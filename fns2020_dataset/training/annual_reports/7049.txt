cover.qxd  23/2/07  22:38  Page 1 A Scheme of Arrangement (the “Scheme”) was
approved by shareholders of Old Hanson on
September 19, 2003, subsequently approved by the
Court on October 13, 2003 and became effective at
the close of business on October 14, 2003 (the
“Scheme Effective Date”). Under the Scheme,
shareholders in Old Hanson received, in substitution
for each of their ordinary shares of £2 in nominal 
value in Old Hanson, one ordinary share of 10p in
nominal value in New Hanson, following a reduction 
in the nominal capital of New Hanson approved by 
the Court on October 20, 2003 and effective from
October 21, 2003.
For the purposes of producing the Annual Report 
and Form 20-F of New Hanson, unless otherwise
expressly specified (a) references to the Company 
and its subsidiaries or Hanson and its subsidiaries, 
or the group, refer to Old Hanson and its subsidiaries
up to the close of business on the Scheme Effective
Date and to New Hanson (including Old Hanson) and
its subsidiaries as from that time and (b) references to
Hanson or the Company are to Old Hanson up to the
close of business on the Scheme Effective Date and 
to New Hanson as from that time. At the Scheme
Effective Date New Hanson had no business assets. 
Solely for the convenience of the reader, the Annual
Report and Form 20-F contains translations of certain
amounts in pounds sterling (“£”) or pence (“p”) into 
US dollars (“US dollars” or “$”) or cents (“c”). The
translations of pounds sterling and pence to US
dollars and cents appearing in the Annual Report and
Form 20-F have been made at the noon buying rate 
in New York City for cable transfers in pounds sterling
as certified for customs purposes by the Bank of 
New York (the “noon buying rate”) on the date of the
information so translated. These translations should 
not be construed as representations that the pound
sterling amounts actually represent such US dollar
amounts or could be converted into US dollars at the
rates indicated. On February 19, 2007 the noon buying
rate was $1.9499 per £1. For additional information on
exchange rates between the pound sterling and the
US dollar, see “Exchange Rates” on page 128 
of the Annual Report and Form 20-F.

Mike Welton
Chairman, Hanson PLC
Hanson’s primary objective is to create
sustainable, long-term value for our
shareholders. In the ten years to December
31, 2006, our total shareholder return
(“TSR”) was 316%, ranking us in the top 25
companies in the FTSE 100. This means an
investment of £100 in Hanson on January
1,1997 was worth £416 at the end of
2006. As we mark our tenth anniversary, 
we are delighted with the value we have
created in the last ten years.
Our strategy 
Our strategy remains straightforward. 
We will continue to focus on heavy building
materials in selected markets. Our product
range and location of operations provides
us with end use and geographic
diversiﬁcation through the construction
cycles. Within each local market, we aim 
to develop a strong network of operations
from which to supply our customers. 
We are driven and incentivised to increase
the economic value of the group through
margin management and capital investment.
We have a good track record of adding
value through acquisitions and remain
committed to a targeted acquisition
programme. Financial discipline is a key
strength which we will seek to maintain.
2006 highlights 
The operating performance in 2006
highlights the fundamental strengths of 
our business. Our business seeks to deliver
value over the long term by leveraging 
our asset positions, including 17 .8 billion
metric tonnes of mineral reserves and
resources, alongside pricing discipline 
and cost control. 
Investments in 2006 were signiﬁcant. 
First, the acquisitions we completed are
intended to provide an excellent strategic 
ﬁt, extending our product range whilst
expanding and strengthening our operations.
Secondly, the increase in our capital
investment programme takes advantage 
of productivity improvement opportunities,
which we believe will deliver signiﬁcant
value in the medium term. 
Returns to shareholders
Total shareholder return in 2006 was 24%,
compared to 13% for the FTSE100. We 
are conﬁdent in our ability to increase the 
long-term value of the business and hence
propose a ﬁnal dividend of 15.35p per
share for 2006. This would result in a total
dividend declared for 2006 of 21.8p, an
increase of 9% compared to 2005. During
2006, we continued our share buyback
programme, repurchasing 9.96 million
shares for £64.1m. 
Board of Directors 
The Board has a strong balance of skills
and experiences. During the year, Jonathan
Nicholls left and we thank him for his
contribution to the development of the
Group during his tenure at Hanson. 
We are pleased that Pavi Binning joined 
as his successor as Finance Director. 
He brings with him a wealth of experience,
having been Chief Financial Ofﬁcer at telent
plc, formerly Marconi Corporation PLC, 
and I am sure that he will make a positive
contribution to Hanson. 
Corporate governance 
We remain committed to exercising high
standards of corporate governance with
open and transparent reporting. Our Annual
Report incorporates a review of the group’s
activities during the year, including ﬁnancial
performance, key performance indicators
and a description of principal risks and
uncertainties facing the group. We also
remain compliant with Section 404 
of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act as 
well as with the Combined Code. 
Corporate responsibility 
Health and safety in the workplace and
respect for our communities is of prime
February 24, 2007
marks our ten year
anniversary since we
completed the last
demerger. Since then,
we have grown to
become a world
leader in heavy
building materials and
we continue to deliver
shareholder value.
Hanson 2006 www.hanson.biz
Chairman’s statement
Firmly focused on value creation
04-05_AW.qxp  23/2/07  22:14  Page 04 05
importance. In 2006, the Board formally
endorsed its approach to health and safety
with a group policy statement. We also take
our environmental responsibilities seriously.
Our key areas of focus are to increase our
resource and energy efﬁciency, reduce 
CO
2
emissions, manage our land holdings
to provide habitats for wildlife and be a
responsible neighbour. Addressing
sustainability also provides opportunities 
for new products and services, which we
develop through innovation, partnerships
and acquisitions. 
Our people
We have 25,900* people worldwide who
have made Hanson a world leader through
hard work and determination to succeed. 
I would like to thank them for their dedication
and commitment. Investment in our people
remains paramount. We will continue to
shape and develop our own talent by
providing career development opportunities. 
Outlook
We believe our strategy is delivering
shareholder value. Our physical assets,
including our mineral reserves, our people
and our track record give us conﬁdence 
for the future.

Chief Executive, Hanson PLC
2006 performance summary 
2006 has been a record year for Hanson,
with operating proﬁt
†#
increasing by 15.1%
to £562.7m, following an increase of
15.4% in 2005. 
We have maintained earnings growth
momentum. Acquisitions made in 2006
added £47 .9m to operating proﬁt
†#
. Property
proﬁts
†
increased by £17 .8m to £32.7m
(£14.9m). Heritage
1
operating proﬁt
†#
from
our six divisions increased by £12.2m.
Strong selling price discipline led the
heritage improvement, recovering signiﬁcant
input cost increases as well as reﬂecting the
underlying economic value of our long-term
mineral reserves. Group operating margin*
†#
increased by 0.7ppts to 12.8% (12.1%).
In 2006, more than half of our operating
proﬁt
†#
was generated in North America. 
Our North American Aggregates division
delivered an excellent result, with operating
proﬁt
†#
30.7% ahead of 2005. This was 
led by strong selling price discipline and a
good performance from acquisitions made
in the year, most notably Material Service
Corporation. We achieved an average
aggregates price increase of 12.1%,
reﬂecting both additional input cost
increases and the increasing scarcity of
mineral reserves in some of the US markets.
2006 was a good year for our North
American Building Products division,
increasing operating proﬁt
†#
by 12.8% over
2005. Acquisition earnings, most notably
from PaverModule in Florida, and operating
proﬁt
†#
increases in Pipe and Precast and
Roof Tile, more than offset a reduction in
operating proﬁt
†#
from our Brick operations
due to weakening of the residential market.
The majority of our products are sold into
the infrastructure, industrial and commercial
construction sectors which remain robust. 
Our businesses in the UK are performing
well in a challenging market. 
In UK Aggregates, the asphalt market was
particularly difﬁcult in 2006. Our asphalt
volumes decreased by nearly 10% and
signiﬁcant cost increases could not be 
fully recovered through selling price rises.
Despite this, the division increased
operating proﬁt
†# 
by 13.2%, beneﬁting 
from the acquisition of Civil and Marine 
in March 2006, and from strong selling
price discipline and cost control. 
Encouragingly, the UK Building Products
division improved its earnings in the second
half of the year compared to the second
half of 2005. Difﬁcult trading conditions
were experienced in 2006, largely due 
to weak brick demand in the repair,
maintenance and improvement (RMI)
sector. Operating proﬁt
†#
increased by
£5.2m, or 13.8%, including additional
property proﬁts of £6.8m.
Another good performance was delivered
by the Australia and Asia Paciﬁc division,
supported by strong selling price increases
and buoyant demand in Western Australia
and Queensland. In addition, results from
Malaysia and Hong Kong improved. 
Good progress was made in Continental
Europe, with a 9.5% increase in operating
proﬁt
†#
in 2006. 
Capital investment
Our plant upgrade programme has
continued this year, driving cash spent on
capital investment up to £288.6m, an
increase of £96.8m compared to last year
and representing 155.8% of depreciation.
Investments include additional mineral
reserves and replacement of plant and
equipment. We have also invested in new
plants and signiﬁcantly upgraded existing
plants, particularly in the USA, to add value
through increased production efﬁciency
and product quality. These improvements
also provide a more comprehensive
product offering and enhanced 
customer service. 
2006 has been 
a record year.
Acquisitions are
performing well 
and our selling 
price discipline has 
been maintained.

Chief Executive’s overview
A year of good progress on all fronts
06-07_AW.qxp  23/2/07  22:15  Page 06 07
Acquisitions 
We paid a total of £558.0m to invest in 
16 acquisitions during 2006. Civil and
Marine, acquired in March for £248.1m,
completes our product integration in the
UK, making us the UK’s leading supplier 
of GGBS (ground granulated blast furnace
slag), a high quality cement substitute with
signiﬁcant environmental beneﬁts. Material
Service Corporation, acquired in June for
£166.3m, is one of the leading aggregates
producers in Illinois. PaverModule, our
Florida-based concrete paver company
acquired in January, forms the basis of a
new product offering for our North America
Building Products division. The other
transactions included operations in North
America, UK, Austria and Spain. 
Customers 
We continue to work with our customers 
to provide high levels of service and product
quality throughout the group. All of our
employees play an important part in this
customer focus. This includes speciﬁcation
advice from our sales teams, product quality
assurance and new solutions from our
operational teams, on-time delivery from 
our distribution teams and administrative
support from our ﬁnance and IT specialists.
Safety 
Safety remains a priority and it should never
be compromised. We are committed to
achieving high standards of health, safety
and welfare for our employees, contractors,
customers and visitors. 
Operating outlook 
Our North America divisions have a broad
geographic spread and end use balance.
This should result in stable overall demand
for our products in 2007, albeit against 
a strong ﬁrst half of 2006. There are some
signs of improvement in brick demand 
in our Building Products UK division.
Elsewhere, demand is expected to 
remain stable.

Hanson 2006 www.hanson.biz
A decade of delivery...
1997
1997 saw the ﬁnal
demerger of a series of
four companies with the
distribution of shares in
the Energy Group PLC to
shareholders on February
24, 1997 . The remaining
companies within
Hanson are now ﬁrmly
focused on our new
sector, building materials.
1998
The transformation of
Hanson into a uniﬁed
company: Cornerstone
has become ‘Hanson
Building Materials
America’ and ARC has
become ‘Hanson Quarry
Products Europe.’ All
operations will share 
the new visual identity.
1999
A strong performance
from our North American
operations, supported by
higher capital expenditure
and bolt-on acquisitions
was the foundation for
another encouraging 
set of results.
2000
2000 has been a year 
of signiﬁcant growth for
Hanson. The acquisition
of Pioneer in May was 
a major deal for Hanson
and accelerated our
strategy of growth
through investment to
establish strong local
market positions.
2001
The group delivered a
strong performance in
proﬁt growth. The USA
will continue to be a
focus for investment.
With our strengthened
balance sheet, we have
the capacity to resume
our value-adding bolt-on
acquisition programme.
2002
Over the past ﬁve years
we have demonstrated
our ability to deliver value
from bolt-on acquisitions.
This remains our
preferred route for
growing the Company.
2003
2003 was a challenging
year for Hanson. A 
more resilient trading
environment in the 
USA, price increases, 
a newly restructured US
management team and
ongoing cost reductions
measures should ensure
a return to growth.
2004
2004 was a good year
for Hanson, thanks to 
the hard work of our
people. Our strategy
remains straightforward.
We will stay focused. 
We intend to generate
cash, invest in the
business and maintain
ﬁnancial discipline.
2005
In 2005, we have
delivered double digit
earnings growth,
completed a signiﬁcant
number of valuable
acquisitions and
increased our returns 
to shareholders.
2006
We rank within the 
top 25 companies 
in the FTSE 100 
for the increase in 
total shareholder 
value achieved over 
the past ten years.
08-09_AW.qxp  23/2/07  22:16  Page 08 09
Chief Executive’s Q&A
You refer to the last ten years as 
a decade of delivery. What would you
consider to be the main areas of delivery?
First, we have delivered sustainable
shareholder value as evidenced by our 
TSR performance since 1997 .
A second area of delivery has been our
investment track record. Since 1997 , we
have invested around £4 billion in over 
100 acquisitions, including £1.7 billion for
Pioneer in May 2000. We are pleased with
the returns we have generated from these
acquisitions. Our commitment to invest in
new plant and equipment in order to
improve productivity and reliability has
remained strong. This has also enabled us 
to raise health, safety and environmental
standards across our operations. 
Thirdly, we have delivered a large amount of
products to our customers, where and when
they need it, supplying around two billion
tonnes of aggregates from our quarries
over the last ten years. 
What is Hanson today?
As one of the world’s leading heavy building
materials companies, our products are vital
to the construction industry. They are used
to build the world around us in the
construction of houses, roads, schools,
hospitals, ofﬁces and airports. 
We operate in 15 countries, with a particular
focus on North America, the UK and
Australia. Our products fall into two
categories: “Aggregates” and “Building
Products”. Within our divisions, we have
some excellent local market positions with 
a unique aggregates mineral reserve and
resource position of 92 years in North
America and 58 years in the UK. 
Where do you expect to see the most
potential for Hanson to grow earnings? 
At Hanson, we believe that we are well-
positioned in each of our core geographies.
A signiﬁcant part of our growth is likely to
come from the USA.
Underlying demand for our products is
driven by demographic growth and the USA
is expected to grow by around three million
people each year. Demand is supported by
a US government infrastructure programme
committed to investing $286 billion over a
six year period to 2009. Around 45% of 
our turnover in the USA is from the
infrastructure sector.
On the supply side, North America provides
an attractive environment for our business
given its high operating standards and high
entry barriers. In addition, the market for
both building products and aggregates 
is still fragmented in many areas which
provides acquisition opportunities. We
are one of the ﬁve largest aggregates
producers in North America, yet only have
around a 5% national market share.
In the UK and Australia, the aggregates
markets are relatively consolidated and
acquisition opportunities are more likely 
to be in Building Products.
We will continue to look for selective
opportunities in our other markets, such 
as Continental Europe.
What are your priorities for the 
next ten years for the group?
We want to add value for our shareholders. 
I see four key aspects to this as we grow
our business: 
• Remain focused on our strategy and
disciplined in our use of cash. We enjoy
strong operating cash ﬂow and intend to
continue to invest in capital expenditure
and acquisitions, to grow dividends and to
make share buybacks when appropriate.
• Invest in our people. Attracting and
retaining talent in our sector is a key
priority. We need to ensure we provide 
the right opportunities for growth and
development, together with high standards
of health, safety and welfare.
• Improve our customer focus. The
requirements of our customers are
changing rapidly and we are working
hard to anticipate and respond to 
these demands. 
• Play our part in protecting and enhancing
the environment. I believe that Hanson
and our industry play an important role 
in enhancing the quality of people’s lives
on a daily basis. We are the environmental
custodians of the sites we operate and we
have a very good track record in the areas
of reclamation and restoration. We aim to
be well-placed to meet the increasing
demand for products and services which
deliver environmental beneﬁts.
We have signiﬁcantly increased the value 
of Hanson over the last ten years and we
believe we have the opportunity and the
capability to deliver the same over the 
next ten years.
...and beyond
Alan Murray, Chief Executive, reviews 
a decade of delivery for Hanson and talks 
about his plans for the next ten years.
We have signiﬁcantly
increased the value of Hanson
over the last ten years and 
we believe we have the
opportunity and the capability
to deliver the same over the
next ten years.

as house prices and planning permissions.
Statistics for housing starts and
completions are published in several of our
major markets, including North America
and the UK. RMI work includes Do-It-
Yourself (DIY) spend and is therefore
often linked to consumer conﬁdence. 
Infrastructure includes transport (such 
as roads, rail and airports) and utilities
(including water transmission, sewerage,
power and communications). Infrastructure
spend on both new projects and RMI is
often government funded, for example
through the SAFETEA (Safe, Accountable,
Flexible, and Efﬁcient Transportation Equity
Act) programme in North America.
Infrastructure demand is driven by
demographics, namely population growth,
along with government ﬁscal policy and
planning constraints. Some infrastructure
work is related to housing.
Industrial & Commercial includes ofﬁces,
factories, schools and hospitals. This
category of construction is funded by both
the public and private sectors and may
include public ﬁnance initiatives (PFI).
Drivers for private spending include
economic growth. Typically, public spending
is driven by political priorities. 
We supply heavy
building materials to
the public and private
construction sectors.
Our key markets are
North America, the
UK and Australia. 
Our customers
Hanson supplies its products and services 
to a broad range of customers, ranging from
large multi-national construction companies
to DIY enthusiasts.
Our aim is to provide premium quality
products and services to all our customers.
Contact with customers is through our
divisions at local, regional and national levels.
Dedicated sales teams are the principal day-
to-day support for our customer base, with
strong management structures in place to
ensure adherence to guidelines.
Service and quality 
The service and quality elements of our
product offering are essential components
of our product positioning. For example, our
Aggregates divisions may advise on the
technical strength speciﬁcation in ready-
mixed concrete, the grip and durability of
asphalt and the on-time delivery to site and
consistency of size and grade of aggregates.
Our Building Products divisions can colour
match bricks and design the strength and
precision of pipes and precast products.
Competitive position
Our aim is to establish Hanson as one 
of the leading suppliers in each of the local
markets in which we operate. We have a

End use markets and demand drivers 
The end use of our products and
services may be categorised into

network of well-located operations to
optimise customer service and transport
costs. These competitive positions may be
strengthened through acquisitions, which
can add value through the realisation of
operating and cost saving synergies in
areas such as increased asset utilisation
and reduced administrative overheads. 
Vertical integration for aggregates 
In some markets, aggregates producers are
integrated into ready-mixed concrete and
asphalt production. In addition, asphalt
producers may undertake road and other
maintenance contracts and surfacing work.
Ready-mixed concrete producers may have
upstream cement operations. Our focus is
on aggregates, but we look to own and
operate ready-mixed concrete, asphalt and
cement operations where this is desirable. 
Economic characteristics 
In general, our products have a low value 
to weight ratio. This means the cost of
transport is a signiﬁcant element of the total
cost of our products to our customers. For
example, in some markets the maximum
economic road delivery distances for
aggregates may be as little as 30
kilometres. Consequently, we aim to
establish a network of plants for our 
customers and thus maintain our overall
competitive position in each market.
Delivery to the ﬁnal destination is principally
by road, but we do use alternative transport
such as rail or marine to move products
where possible. Building products may have
longer economic delivery distances,
depending on market dynamics. 
Barriers to entry 
The main barriers to entry for our
aggregates and brick operations are access
to mineral reserves and the ability to obtain
the necessary legal permissions for
extraction. These barriers to entry are often
increasing in the markets in which we
operate as planning and environmental
controls become more onerous. We aim 
to work with planning authorities and local
communities to ensure we comply with 
all regulatory requirements and maintain 
a strong reserve position. 
Our other, non-brick building products
operations may have barriers to entry due 
to signiﬁcant scale, capital and expertise
requirements. For example, concrete pipe
and precast products are produced for
engineered applications where signiﬁcant
technical expertise is required in design,
manufacturing and sales. Technological 
advances can provide the opportunity 
for reinvestment and upgrading of
manufacturing facilities. 
Low substitution threat and 
low price elasticity 
The threat of substitution for most of 
our products is low. Recycled aggregate
materials are used in certain applications,
particularly in the UK following the
introduction by the UK government of an
aggregates levy. We are looking to increase
the proportion of high value aggregates
produced in our plants in the UK. 
Our products, in general, have low price
elasticity. For example, the volume of
aggregates required in a road project may
not be particularly sensitive to the selling
price of those aggregates.

Ø
: 250.8m metric tonnes
Hanson is one of the world’s largest
producers of aggregates. Aggregates
include sand, gravel and hardstone such
as granite and limestone. Sand and gravel
may be extracted from the sea as marine
dredged aggregates, as well as from 
land-based deposits. Aggregates are an
essential component of a wide variety of
applications. These include uses such as 
a base material for road building, rail lines
and water transmission as well as
drainage pipelines and as landﬁll. 
Asphalt
Ø
: 13.0m metric tonnes
Asphalt is made from a mixture of 90% to
95% of dried aggregates, combined with
5% to 10% of heated liquid bitumen.
Bitumen is a by-product of the petroleum
reﬁning process and the price of bitumen
is, in general, governed by the price of oil.
Asphalt is used as a surfacing material 
for roads, airport runways and car parks.
Different types of asphalt surface can 
be produced depending on the grade 
of aggregates used, which will give the
surface differing qualities such as
improved grip for vehicles or quieter 
tyre noise.

GGBS is manufactured from blast furnace
slag, a by-product from the manufacture of
iron, and is used as a cement replacement,
mostly in ready-mixed concrete, and also in
many other concrete products used in the
construction industry. With higher ultimate
strength and durability, it can replace 50%
or more of the conventional cement in
concrete. Replacing a tonne of conventional
cement with GGBS saves a tonne of CO

The vast majority of our bricks are made
from clay, which is extracted from the
ground, processed, shaped and then ﬁred
in kilns. Bricks can be produced in a wide
variety of colours and textures. They are
used primarily in the housing segment of
the construction sector, both new build
and RMI. Bricks are selected for their
attractive appearance, versatility, low
maintenance and durability. Automation 
in brick plants is increasing, including the
use of robotics to improve brick handling.

10-23_AW.qxp  26/2/07  14:51  Page 13 Reserve years and total years are
calculated by dividing the tonnes of reserve
and total tonnes respectively by the volume
produced in 2006. 
0.2 billion tonnes of the reserves are clay
reserves, held by the Building Products
divisions, which are used to make bricks. 
The mineral reserves and resources which
we own, or have the right to extract, are
fundamental to the long-term growth of
our business. We estimate that our total
mineral reserve and resources position,
including our share of joint-ventures and
associates, as at December 31, 2006 
is 17 .8 billion metric tonnes. 
The following table details our mineral
reserve and resource position as at
December 31, 2006. Reserves and
resources are deﬁned as follows: 
A ‘mineral resource’ is a concentration 
or occurrence of material of economic
interest in or on the earth’s crust in such
form, quality and quantity that there are
reasonable prospects for eventual
economic extraction. The location, 
quantity, grade, continuity and other
geological characteristics of a mineral
resource are known, estimated or
interpreted from speciﬁc geological
evidence and knowledge. 
A ‘mineral reserve’ is the economically
mineable part of a mineral resource. It
includes diluting materials and allowances
for losses, which may occur when the
material is mined. Appropriate
assessments, which may include feasibility
studies, have been carried out, and include
consideration of, and modiﬁcation by,
realistically assumed mining, metallurgical,
economic, marketing, legal, environmental,
social and governmental factors. These
assessments demonstrate at the time 
of reporting that extraction is justiﬁed.
We estimate that 
we have approximately
73 years of production
of mineral reserves
and resources.
66% of the total reserves at December 31,
2006 are owned. The balance is either
leased, or subject to an option to buy or lease.
During the course of 2006, we added a
further 2.2 billion metric tonnes of reserves
and resources. The majority of this was 
in North America.

High performance culture
Our word is our bond
Customer focused
Continuous improvement in all 
our activities including safety and 
the environment
Grow and develop the business 
to increase shareholder value
Proactive corporate citizens
Provide consistent leadership
Our guiding principles:
quarrying, manufacturing, distribution 
and support roles.
Our culture
We are an industry leader making an
important contribution to the world around
us by supplying the raw materials and
products to build key facilities – from roads
to hospitals, schools to airports.
Safety is a priority. We are always conscious
of our responsibility towards the environment
and the communities in which we operate.
We understand the importance of our
customers and adopt a ‘can do’ attitude in
order to remain committed to their needs.
We seek to shape and develop our own
talent by providing career development
opportunities.
Our approach
Equal opportunity
As an equal opportunity employer, our
people are recruited, promoted and
rewarded without regard to gender, age or
beliefs but rather based on merit. Managing
for diversity presents opportunities for
improved business performance. Workforce
planning measures allow us to tap into
opportunities in areas such as ethnicity,
gender and age and tailor our employment
offering accordingly. Full consideration is
given to the employment, the continuing
employment, training and career
development of disabled people.
Attracting the right people into Hanson
We understand the need to attract good-
quality people to work for Hanson. We
remain focused on the retention and
development of employees.
We have ongoing programmes ranging from
educating schoolchildren about the sector,
internships, graduate recruitment and
participation in job fairs which link with
professional bodies in order to broaden
understanding of our industry.
Our people
Hanson employs 25,900 people,
operating from over 1,500 sites 
located close to our customer base 
in 15 countries.
Our worldwide spread gives us strength
and breadth and each site acts with a
‘local business feel’ in the community 
in which it operates.
We have talented people working in a
range of job roles including professionals
in engineering, geology, ﬁnance, sales,
The ongoing development of e-recruitment
via www.hanson.biz/careers is also an
important aspect of the recruitment strategy.
Retaining our people
We have put in place a global system of
reporting on human capital measures to
monitor areas of employee turnover and
reasons for leaving, as well as measures
around workforce planning. The
engagement and development of our
employees are also seen as important
employment offerings.
Developing our people
We have a track record of growing our own
managers by developing people for different
job roles. This is also supplemented by
formal learning such as completion of the
Hanson Diploma in Management,
Foundations of Management, Management
Development Programme or the Global
Advanced Leadership Programme.
The Global Advanced Leadership
Programme involves teams of senior
managers from Hanson joining with teams
from other companies to address an
assigned business challenge. The
programme runs for three one-week
modules and is held in Europe, Asia and
North America. Academics from McGill
University in Canada, Lancaster University
in England and the Indian Institute of
Management work with the teams acting 
as ‘friendly consultants’ to provide next
generation learning for the participants.
Succession
The succession system enables us to
maximise the potential of our people as part
of our leadership competency framework.
Performance and reward management
The approach to performance and reward
management is to ensure our people have a
clear understanding of the job role and their
required outputs which are aligned with key
business objectives. The manner in which
Hanson 2006 www.hanson.biz
Our employees
We understand 
that the success 
of strategic and
operational execution
depends on the
quality and leadership
of our people.
16 Operating and ﬁnancial review
10-23_AW.qxp  23/2/07  22:18  Page 16 the outputs are achieved is also an
important factor.
Feedback and coaching for improved
performance is an important aspect of our
management approach. The reward system
is based on recognising and rewarding
good performance.
Short-term incentive plans target year-on-
year improvement in economic value added.
Training supports a clear understanding of
each person’s role and how it contributes to
overall improved performance. 
Communication
Internal communications play an important
role in keeping employees up to date and
aligning them with our goals. In order to
deliver this, we use the intranet, newsletters,
a global magazine, employee surveys, a
thorough induction programme, brieﬁng
sessions and targeted training courses.
During 2006, a number of employee
surveys were undertaken and the results
fed back to employees as a means of
identifying areas for improvement and the
action to be taken. This process allows us
to tap into the knowledge and experience
of the broader Hanson team.
We promote the sharing of ideas across
divisions in order to leverage the adoption
of best practice across Hanson. Non-
ﬁnancial key performance indicators, such
as customer services measures, are playing
an increasing role in knowledge transfer.
Health and safety
We are committed to achieving high
standards of health, safety and welfare 
for our employees, contractors, customers
and visitors. 
Hanson actively engages with government
agencies, trade associations and other
similar bodies to promote the beneﬁts of a
safe and healthy working environment and
develop best practice around the world.
In 2006, the Board formally endorsed its
approach to health and safety with a group
policy statement. Our divisional Chief
Executives/Managing Directors remain
responsible for establishing formal policies,
for ensuring that arrangements are made to
fulﬁl those policies and for monitoring their
implementation and effectiveness. 
The divisional Chief Executives/Managing
Directors are supported by a network of
safety professionals, who share information
and best practice to apply the lessons 
learnt from accident investigations across
the group. 
We seek to prevent injuries and other
incidents from occurring by: 
• Training our employees to work safely and
eliminating the causes of unsafe behaviour
• Providing safe systems of work and
encouraging a safe production culture
• Striving for improved safety performance 
• Committing to industry improvement
initiatives and targets
In 2006, we continued to focus on
eliminating unsafe behaviour through
programmes of training and performance
monitoring against targets. We are
dedicated to working with our employees 
to change their perception and acceptance
of risk so that safety is not compromised.
The approach towards this interdependent
safety model is supported and led by 
Alan Murray, Chief Executive who is the
director responsible for health and safety, 
as well as the divisional Chief
Executives/Managing Directors.

Our employees
The use of appropriate safety equipment 
is mandatory at all our sites. 
Our logo, shown here on one of our mixer drums, 
is an important part of our identity.
A key part of our internal communications 
is Hanson’s quarterly magazine for our 
employees worldwide. 
10-23_AW.qxp  26/2/07  16:24  Page 17 being a responsible neighbour to the
communities in which we are located.
In 2006, we started an 18 month
programme of improving and rationalising
our environmental management systems.
We are consolidating our processes onto
fewer electronic platforms to achieve
greater consistency. 
Addressing sustainability provides
opportunities for new products and services.
Hanson’s acquisition of Formpave in 2006
is one such example. Formpave is a world
leader in the rapidly expanding sustainable
urban drainage systems (SUDS) market,
providing permeable paving. SUDS are
used to reduce the risk of ﬂooding and 
to prevent pollution. 
Increase our resource and energy efﬁciency 
As a heavy building materials producer,
natural resources such as minerals, energy
and water are at the centre of our business. 
Minerals and recycling
We seek to conserve mineral resources
where practicable. Examples include the
use of recycled glass as an aggregate 
in asphalt and the use of ground 
granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS) 
as a cement substitute.
Environmental
management is
integral to the 
way in which we 
run our business.
We are also able to reuse our own products.
Concrete, either from a returned load or
after use in a structure, can be used to
replace aggregate. When asphalt
pavements reach the end of their life, we
are able to reuse some of the old surface 
in the new pavement.
Energy
Energy use is of concern for its contribution
to greenhouse gas production and to the
extent it is derived from non-renewable
sources. In 2006, we began a corporate
carbon and energy management review
with the Carbon Trust. 
Divisional energy saving initiatives have
been successful in improving control over
energy use. We have already seen
improvements and we are disseminating
what we have learnt throughout 
the businesses. 
Reducing our energy consumption makes
good environmental and ﬁnancial sense. 
Hanson 2006 www.hanson.biz
Our environment
18 Operating and ﬁnancial review
Conserving water: Our Maroochydore plant in
Australia was designed to minimise water use.
Features include the use of rainwater and treated
grey water from the adjacent water treatment plant. 
Habitats for wildlife: One of Britain’s rarest
birds, the bittern, has started to boom at the
Hanson/RSPB wetland being created at
Needingworth quarry in Cambridgeshire, UK.
Responsible neighbour: Our brick operations 
in North America donated 16,000 bricks and
volunteer labour last summer to the Union County
Chapter of Habitat for Humanity. 
A Hay (RSPB)
Our approach
For Hanson, environmental management
is integral to the way in which we run our
business. It affects product and service
design, the way in which we operate our
sites and their after-use when production
has ceased.
We will continue to develop our group
sustainability strategy through 2007 . This
will build on existing policies and practices
which aim for high standards in managing
our people and the environment and the
way in which we relate to our communities.
We focus on the areas in which we can
have the greatest impact as follows: 
• increasing the efﬁciency with which 
we use resources and energy
• reducing CO
2
emissions
• managing our land holdings to provide
habitats for wildlife
10-23_AW.qxp  26/2/07  15:34  Page 18 Water
Water is an essential part of daily life and, in
some places, scarce. Ready-mixed concrete,
brick and block manufacture consume a
signiﬁcant quantity of water. Aggregate
production uses water to clean the product;
after use, we either recycle the water 
or return it to the groundwater system. 
We obtain the water we use from boreholes
and other natural sources and also from
mains water supply.
Our key objectives around water usage are:
• minimising the quantity of water which 
is consumed
• maintaining the quality of water which
leaves our sites
We maintain water quality through good
housekeeping and routine checks to 
ensure that the systems and controls are
working effectively.
Reduce CO
2
emissions
We recognise the importance of reducing
CO
2
emissions and we use a number of
different strategies to achieve this: 
• use of alternative raw materials
• use of renewable energy sources
• managing the way we transport 
our products
• improving our energy efﬁciency
Cement substitutes provide an opportunity
for Hanson to reduce the emissions
associated with the production and use of
concrete. GGBS, for which we are the UK
market leader following our acquisition of
Civil and Marine in 2006, is one such
substitute for Portland Cement. GGBS is
produced from blast furnace slag, a by-
product from the manufacture of steel. As a
by-product, manufacture of GGBS requires
less than one ﬁfth of the energy and
produces one tenth of the CO
2
emissions
of Portland Cement. 
In 2006, Hanson was invited and agreed to
participate in the Carbon Disclosure Project.
This is run on behalf of a group of over 200
investors to address the potential impact of
climate change upon businesses. 
Manage our land holdings to provide 
habitats for wildlife
Hanson is a large landowner and is in a
position to maintain this land to encourage
the creation of diverse habitats for wildlife.
We work in partnership with statutory and
charitable organisations, both whilst sites
are operational and after we have 
ceased operating.
In the UK, we have a biodiversity and
geodiversity action plan with deﬁned targets
which we have met.
Be a responsible neighbour
We seek to manage the environmental
impact of our operations at all stages, 
from planning through operation to
decommissioning. Once we have identiﬁed
a mineral resource which is well positioned
for its market, we consider how the
extraction, processing or manufacture and
transport of this essential building material
will affect the local and wider community. 
Potential issues such as noise and the
visual impact of our operations, particularly
in rural areas, are dramatically reduced or
eliminated by the use of screening earth
banks and tree planting.
We consider that school visits to our sites
are important in demonstrating to children 
the contribution of industry to modern
society. We have prepared high quality
teaching materials and also run events for
teachers to help them to prepare for visits
and integrate them into the curriculum. 
We are involved in fundraising and
sponsorship, as well as making donations
and gifts in kind to the communities in
which we operate. 
Our products play an important role in
enhancing the quality of people’s lives on a
daily basis. Therefore, we are often asked to
support local projects by donating materials.
We have a general policy of supporting
community projects in this way, particularly
those located near to our operations. 
In addition, at a corporate level, we support
a small number of charities which have a
link with our business. In 2006, these were
CRASH, the UK construction industry
charity for the homeless; the Royal Botanic
Gardens at Kew, where we support the
conservation area; the Rotunda Museum 
of geology in Scarborough and the
Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural
History in Washington DC where we have
contributed to an endowment fund to
maintain and upgrade the Rocks Gallery.

Our business objectives
We aim to enhance the value of our
existing assets and market positions by
growing group turnover, earnings and
group margins, through the business
cycle. This will be supported by the
appropriate combination of maintenance,
greenﬁeld and value adding capital
expenditure. 
Additional value is sought through
acquisitions, primarily targeting products 
or locations which can be bolted-on to
complement our existing operations. 
We believe there is an opportunity to add
value in the medium term and to reinforce
our position as one of the world’s leading
suppliers of heavy building materials.

(including value adding capital expenditure)
and with selling price increases. 
In 2006, our group operating margin*
†#
was
12.8% (12.1%), an increase of 0.7ppts. 
Proﬁtability measures
Our primary proﬁtability KPI is operating
proﬁt before impairments. A number of
other proﬁtability KPIs are used, namely
proﬁt before taxation
†
, proﬁt for the year
and basic earnings per share. These are
discussed in more detail in the ﬁnancial
review section of this report.
Net cash inﬂow from operating activities
Net cash inﬂow from operating activities is
deﬁned as the cash ﬂow generated by the
operations, including dividends from joint-
ventures and associates and after payments
for discontinued items such as asbestos. 
It is stated after receipts and payments for
interest and tax but before investing and
ﬁnancing activities. 
Our aim is to increase net cash inﬂow from
operating activities in line with the increase
in proﬁt for the year. This is an indicator of
our ability to convert earnings into cash. For
items such as ﬁnance costs and tax, the
cash impact may be a more meaningful
measure than the complex accounting in
the income statement. 
In 2006, our net cash inﬂow from operating
activities reduced by £25.7m, or 5.5%, to
£445.5m, compared to a 3.6% increase in
the proﬁt for the year. The reduction
included an adverse movement in working
capital of £87 .5m, largely due to an increase
in inventory of £69.1m. Further detail is
provided on page 48.
Financial KPIs
Group turnover*
†
This represents the total amount charged
to customers for our products and
services, including delivery but excluding
joint-ventures and associates, inter-
company sales, property proﬁt and sales
taxes such as VAT. 
Our aim is to increase turnover each 
year through a combination of price and
volume growth, from our existing market
positions and assets, and additional
turnover from acquisitions. 
In 2006, we increased our group
turnover*
†
by 11.2% to £4,132.7m.
Acquisitions made in 2006 contributed
5.8% of this growth. The increase from
the existing operations of 5.4% was due
primarily to increases in selling prices
rather than volume growth. 
Group operating margin*
†#
This represents the group operating
proﬁt

The word “group” designates that it
excludes our share of joint-ventures’ 
and associates’ proﬁt after tax. Group
operating proﬁt

is therefore group

less group operating costs*. 
Our overall aim is to grow or maintain

10-23_AW.qxp  23/2/07  22:18  Page 22 Non-ﬁnancial KPIs
The nature of our business means that
most of our non-ﬁnancial performance
indicators are measured locally. Areas of
particular importance are described below:
Health and safety
‡
The progress of safety performance
throughout our business worldwide is
tracked and reported regularly to the 
Board using standard measures. 
We use the following indicators to provide 
a consistent measure of our performance: 
• Lost time incidence (L TI) rate: this is the
frequency rate of injuries resulting in an
employee being absent for one or 
more shifts. 
• Lost day incidence (LDI) rate: this is the
frequency rate for days lost as a result 
of accidents. 
• Total case incidence (TCI) rate: this is the
frequency rate of accidents.
In 2006, the L TI reduced from 1.2 to 1.1
and the LDI reduced from 21 to 18. TCI
was 3.4 for 2006. This was the ﬁrst year
TCI was measured on a comparable basis
throughout the group. 
Regrettably, there was one employee
work-related fatality and one contractor
fatality during the year. A further employee
work-related fatality has sadly occurred 
in February 2007. In such circumstances,
we co-operate fully with the appropriate
investigating authorities. We also
endeavour to ensure that the deceased’s
family and work colleagues have as much
assistance as possible. We share the
lessons we have learned from these
incidents and review our standards for
application across the group.
Customers
A key part of our focus is to improve our
service at each point of customer contact,
from initial enquiry to receipt of payment.
Key customer satisfaction measures include
quality of advice, product availability, product
quality and on-time delivery. 
We aim to make the administrative support
for our customers as efﬁcient and accurate
as possible and use indicators such as
dispute resolution and debtor days to
measure progress.
Employees
Human capital measures include gender,
tenure, age, occupational group, job grade,
ethnicity, labour turnover and reasons for
leaving. These are supplemented by regular
employee surveys.
Sustainability
Our sustainability strategy is being
developed to include a set of non-ﬁnancial
performance indicators. In the near term, 
we will prioritise the measurement of
energy efﬁciency, CO
2
emissions, the 
use of recycled material and the quality 
of water that leaves our sites. 
Other performance indicators
In addition to the key performance
indicators detailed above, Hanson uses a
number of other ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial
performance indicators. Cost control is
supported by ratios such as tonnes per
manhour and overheads as a percentage 
of turnover. Investment decisions are based
on risk versus return evaluation using cash
ﬂow projections discounted at a weighted
average cost of capital. Assets, including
mineral reserves, are monitored for quality,
age and replacement need. Financing
indicators include interest cover ratios,
gearing and cash ﬂow to net debt. Return
on capital and economic value added
calculations are used to measure and
incentivise value creation.

producers in North America, operating in 
18 states and Mexico. In addition to
aggregates, the division has ready-mixed
concrete and asphalt operations, as well 
as cement operations in Northern California
and a cement substitute operation 
in Florida.
The division consists of ﬁve regions and
Hanson Slag Cement (HSC), each reporting
into the divisional head ofﬁce based in
Dallas, Texas. The ﬁve regions are the West,
Southwest, Mideast, Northeast, and a new
region for the Material Service operations

aggregates volumes declined
slightly by 1.1% compared to last year.
Reductions occurred in certain markets in
our West and Southwest regions. This was
partly offset by increased volume in the
Northeast and Mideast regions where 
the weather at the end of the year was
unusually mild and the operations have 
a more balanced end use exposure.

rises of 37 .4% in asphalt were necessary to
recover the signiﬁcant increase in costs, in
particular bitumen. Cement price rises of
10.9% offset energy cost increases and
compensated for some temporary lost
production following a mechanical failure at
our Californian cement plant. Our share of

aggregates, ready-mixed concrete and
asphalt operations near Phoenix, AZ; and
development of our aggregates operations
at Mission Valley, CA.

T otal market demand across the USA

be signiﬁcant variation in regional demand
patterns. In our markets in 2005, aggregates
volumes in California were below those in
2004. However, Arizona and south T exas
showed strong demand, driven by high levels
of residential construction and a recovery in
industrial and commercial activity. Reduced
activity was experienced in parts of the
Mideast and Northeast regions, most notably

26 Operating and ﬁnancial review
The MSC assets include approximately 
1.7 billion metric tonnes of reserves and
resources in Illinois and northern Indiana,
serving metropolitan Chicago and
surrounding areas. The initial integration 
of these assets into the North American
portfolio has progressed very well and the
management team delivered an excellent
performance in 2006. 
Hanson Slag Cement (HSC) was acquired
in March 2006 as part of Civil and Marine.
HSC is based in Port Canaveral, Florida 
and produces and sells ground granulated
blast furnace slag (GGBS). This is a high
quality cement substitute with signiﬁcant
environmental beneﬁts, relative to
conventional Portland cement.

In certain markets, we selectively declined 
to compete for high volume contracts at low
margins. In addition, a number of operations
were closed as part of our optimisation
strategy which further reduced volumes. 
As a result of this combination of varying
regional demand patterns, selectively
declining low margin work and plant
closures, total heritage

aggregates 
volumes declined by 4.4% for the year. 
Raw material cost pressures were
signiﬁcant in the downstream ready-mixed
concrete and asphalt operations. Average
selling price increases of 12.8% in ready-
mixed concrete recovered cost increases, 
in particular higher cement costs. Average
selling price increases of 11.5% in asphalt
in part offset increases in the cost of
bitumen and raw materials.
In common with aggregates, similar regional
variations in demand were experienced in
those markets where we have downstream
products. The exception was ready-mixed
concrete volumes in Arizona which were
adversely affected by shortages of cement
in the second half of the year. As a
consequence, heritage
1
ready-mixed
concrete volumes for the year declined by
5.3% and heritage
1
asphalt volumes
declined by 5.8%. 
Demand for cement in California remained
strong in 2005 and volumes increased by
6.3%. Operational efﬁciencies at the plant
offset part of the signiﬁcant increases in
the cost of fuel and power. A number of
major one-off repair and maintenance
programmes were undertaken in 2005.
Average price increases of 15.4% were
achieved which, together with the volume
increases, offset the increase in costs. 
Capital expenditure*
†
initiatives progressed
well in 2005, with total spend of £69.4m
(£74.6m). Projects included a processing
upgrade at Sylvania, Ohio, which should
increase productivity and reduce costs. 
In addition, we completed the replant,
including the construction of a new rail
terminal, at our Bridgeport quarry near
Dallas, Texas and acquired land in Arizona
which should allow us to expand operations
in the Phoenix market. 
Good progress was made in 2005 with our
acquisition strategy. The integration of the
Mission Valley Rock acquisition, bought in
June 2005, proceeded according to plan.
This acquisition signiﬁcantly strengthened
Hanson’s position in the strategically
important San Francisco Bay area, with 
an additional 54m metric tonnes of
reserves/resources secured in this market.
In addition, the division acquired a group of
aggregates operations in southern Indiana
in December, providing access to over
115m metric tonnes of reserves/resources
and strengthening our position in the
Louisville, Kentucky, market area. An
additional 80m metric tonnes of mineral
reserves/resources were secured 
in Irwindale, California, in 2005. 
Outlook for 2007
The division beneﬁts from geographic 
and end use diversiﬁcation. This includes
signiﬁcant exposure to the relatively stable
markets in the Midwest and Northeast, 
and end use exposure to infrastructure,
industrial and commercial activities which
should mitigate the impact of the
residential slowdown. 
The extent of progress in 2007 will largely
depend on pricing discipline. Our customers
were notiﬁed of price increases, effective
January 1, 2007 which averaged slightly
less than the increases in 2006 for
aggregates, although this varied signiﬁcantly
by market. Whilst very early in the seasonal
construction cycle, indications to date are
reasonably encouraging. We will continue to
be value rather than volume led, particularly
in those areas where it is difﬁcult to secure
new mineral reserves. 
The full year impact in 2007 from 2006
acquisitions is expected to be slightly
negative due to seasonality. We expect 
to increase the amount of our capital
investment programme during 2007
compared to 2006.

and £7 .8m (£nil) in the newly formed 
Paver group. 
£11.0m, or 8.8%, of the operating proﬁt

increase was due to acquisitions made in
2006, mainly related to the new pavers
product group. Incremental full year
contributions from acquisitions made in
2005 added a further £4.8m. Property
proﬁts reduced by £0.3m, offsetting a
beneﬁt due to foreign exchange translation
of £0.1m. Excluding these items, operating
proﬁt

increased by £0.5m due to an
improvement in Pipe and Precast of 
£7 .4m offset by a decline in Brick and 
Tile of £6.9m. 
Pipe and Precast enjoyed a particularly
good performance in the Southeast region
in 2006, led by infrastructure and
commercial activity in Florida. Results from
our West region were also good, including
strong demand in California. Elsewhere,
overall market demand remained robust,
although there were signs of weakening 
in the Northeast region towards the end 
of the year. Total heritage

selling prices in pipe and 
precast increased by 7 .1% and were
sufﬁcient to recover all input cost 
increases, including cement. 
In Brick and Tile, the reduction in brick
operating proﬁt
†#
more than offset an
improvement in Roof Tile. As expected,
demand for bricks, particularly in the
eastern regions, fell signiﬁcantly due to the
slowdown in residential construction in the
second half of the year. Overall brick
volumes declined by 6.1%. Average selling
prices increased by 7 .3%, recovering the
increased input costs such as natural gas.
The improvement in the Roof Tile
performance was led by average price
increases of 13.7% to recover signiﬁcant
cost rises and strong demand in Florida.
Volume decline of 8.8% was primarily due
to weak demand in California. 
The new Pavers product line, acquired with
Pavermodule in January, enjoyed strong
demand in Florida throughout the year.
Performance was ahead of our
expectations, principally due to an efﬁcient
integration process and very strong
underlying market demand. 
The division completed a further ﬁve
acquisitions in 2006, the largest being the
acquisition of the Hughes Supply concrete
products division which brought four
complementary plants to our operations 
in Georgia and Texas. Four more
complementary plants were acquired in
Connecticut, Utah, Texas and Alabama. All
of these acquisitions are performing well.

volumes for concrete products
increased by 3.1% during 2005. The
strongest markets for concrete products 
in 2005 were in the Southeast (principally
Florida) and the Northeast (principally South
Virginia, Washington DC and Ontario).
Volumes in key Texas markets were
disrupted by the most active hurricane
season on record and by delays on several
major pipe projects in south Texas in the
second half. 
Operating proﬁt
†#
for the Brick and Tile
group decreased by 0.6% to £34.9m
(£35.1m). Heritage
1
brick volumes declined
by 8.2% largely due to a weakening of
demand in Canada where volume declined
by 16.1%. By contrast, volumes in Texas
increased by 10.3% as residential demand
remained strong in this market. Further
operating and commercial synergies were
extracted from the combination of our
heritage
1
brick operations with the Athens
factories that were acquired in 2004.
Average selling prices increased by 6.0%.
Price increases of 12.8% were realised 
in roof tiles. Demand for tiles outstripped
supply in the eastern USA (principally in
Florida), but was offset by lower demand 
in California. 
The division achieved notable success in
2005 with its acquisition growth initiatives,
completing three acquisitions in the year.
The largest of the three acquisitions was
Sherman Pipe which has ten facilities in
Alabama and Georgia. These plants are 
an excellent strategic ﬁt with the existing
heritage
1
facilities in the Southeast region.
Two smaller strategic acquisitions were
completed in Ohio and Rhode Island to
complement the heritage
1
facilities in 
the Northeast region. The integration of
these acquisitions went very well and all
three have been performing ahead of 
pro forma expectations. 
Building Products’ other major growth
initiative in 2005 was a signiﬁcant
programme of greenﬁeld capital
investment and upgrades to existing pipe
and precast and brick and tile facilities.
Capital expenditure*
†
in 2005 was £40.7m
(£38.2m). Three new precast plants were
successfully commissioned in 2005, two 
in Texas and one in California, which have
enhanced our existing product offerings 
in key markets. Approval was given for 
the construction of three new concrete
products facilities in Texas, Arizona and
Florida, and for the construction of a new
greenﬁeld roof tile plant near Jacksonville
in Florida. Commissioning of these
facilities began in the second half of 
2006 and will continue through the 
ﬁrst half of 2007. 
Outlook for 2007
The majority of our business is exposed to
the infrastructure, industrial and commercial
sectors. We expect the markets in these
sectors to be reasonably robust. Our order
backlogs were $560m at December 31,
2006 (compared to $450m at December
31, 2005). Ongoing pricing discipline will
remain a priority.
Brick and Roof Tile have the greatest
exposure to the residential construction
market. The slowdown experienced in the
second half of 2006 is anticipated to
continue into 2007 which could make
progress challenging. 
We will continue to seek capacity and
productivity improvements from capital
investment and expect the level of
investment in 2007 to be similar to 2006.

Aggregates UK
We are one of the leading suppliers of
aggregates, ground granulated blast furnace
slag cement (GGBS), ready-mixed concrete
and asphalt in the UK. The foundation for
this fully integrated business is our land and
marine mineral reserve position, providing
aggregates for our downstream ready-mixed
concrete, asphalt and contracting operations.
GGBS completes the product integration,
supplying cement substitute to our ready-
mixed concrete operations and UK building
products facilities. Geographically, we have
operations in all of the UK’s major markets
where our focus on customer service allows
us to maintain leading market positions. 
The division sold*
†
32.4m metric tonnes of
aggregates in 2006 and has an excellent
long-term mineral position, with
approximately 2.2 billion metric tonnes of
reserves and resources available for future
extraction. This includes a strong reserve
position in sand and gravel, both land and
marine based. 
2006 v 2005
We delivered another year of improved
performance in 2006, beneﬁting from 
the acquisition in March 2006 of Civil

adverse asphalt performance, caused by 
the signiﬁcant decline in asphalt demand
and exacerbated by bitumen and fuel oil
input cost inﬂation.

our ongoing commitment to pricing
discipline, operational efﬁciency and 
cost reduction initiatives.
The 2006 market demand for aggregates
in the UK is estimated to have been similar
to 2005. Our aggregates volumes fell by
2.9% due primarily to planned quarry
closures and lower demand into our
downstream operations. The average selling
price of aggregates increased by 5.7% in
2006. This recovered the signiﬁcant
increases in the operating cost base, most
notably energy and mineral royalty costs.

investment in roads falling for the fourth
consecutive year. Market demand for
asphalt in 2006 is estimated to have been
8% below 2005, compared to a decline of
9.3% in our volumes. We have seen some
recovery in our volumes during the second
half of the year, indicating that our overall
market position is stable. We believe that
the shortfall experienced in 2006 was
probably due to the regional distribution of
demand associated with major works. In
addition to weak volumes, we experienced
considerable cost inﬂation. Signiﬁcant
increases in energy and bitumen costs were
compounded by the prohibited use, by law,
of recycled fuel oil from the beginning of
2006. The impact of these increases could
only be partly mitigated through a
combination of selling price increases 
of 8.6%, cost reduction measures and
efﬁciency initiatives. 
The total demand for ready-mixed concrete
in the UK is estimated to have increased by
approximately 2% in 2006, against a
decline of 1.4% in our volumes. Our
volumes declined due to pricing discipline 
at the expense of lower margin volume.
Selling prices increased by 6.5% during
2006, largely recovering higher input costs,
particularly for cement, fuel and electricity.
The share of joint-ventures’ and associates’

share of net proﬁt after tax

of £9.6m
(£11.9m) was down on last year due to
difﬁcult trading conditions, particularly
asphalt for Midland Quarry Products. 
Signiﬁcant efforts were made to enhance
customer service levels in 2006. Investment
was made in upgrading concrete and
asphalt plants to improve plant availability
and reduce downtime. In addition, a
separate logistics function was established
which has been instrumental in improving
customer service and the efﬁciency of our
haulage ﬂeet across all products. 
Civil and Marine has performed well since
its acquisition in March 2006. It is the UK’s
leading producer of ground granulated blast
furnace slag. This is a high quality cement
substitute with signiﬁcant environmental
beneﬁts relative to conventional Portland
Cement. Civil and Marine has ﬁve
production facilities at Llanwern, Port Talbot,
Purﬂeet, Scunthorpe and Teesside, in
addition to a variety of depot distribution
facilities. This acquisition is an excellent
strategic ﬁt with our existing ready-mixed
concrete and building products facilities and
effectively balances our UK cementitious
demand with supply capabilities.

34 Operating and ﬁnancial review
Signiﬁcant progress was made in 2006 
to develop our strong reserve position for
the future. Our sand and gravel position
has been strengthened through securing 
a number of lease options. Our crushed
rock position was improved through an
extension to our Machen quarry, an
important rail linked facility in South Wales.
Our valuable marine reserve position was
strengthened through the permitting 
of new dredging licences in the 
English Channel. This will allow us to
continue to provide particularly valuable
aggregates to the important South East
and London markets.

†#
improvement,
achieved despite reduced volumes,
illustrates our commitment to pricing
discipline, our initiative to increase 
premium product output and the delivery 
of operational efﬁciency and overhead 
cost reduction beneﬁts. 
Total market demand across the UK for
aggregates is estimated to have declined 
by approximately 3% in 2005. Much of the
reduction was due to a slowdown in major
infrastructure activity, and lower crushed
rock volumes as recycled materials compete
at the low-value end of the sector. As a
result of planned site closures and our
initiative to increase production yields and
reduce low-margin, non-premium products,
our total heritage
1
aggregates volumes have
declined 8.1%, with crushed rock the major
contributor to the decline. Average selling
prices increased by 6.3%, offsetting input
cost increases for fuel and electricity.
Royalty rates and the cost of regulation 
also continued to increase. 
Our asphalt volumes increased by 2.5% 
in 2005 which was broadly in line with
estimated national market growth trends.
We continued to beneﬁt from the capital
investment programme to replace our
asphalt plants with more fuel efﬁcient and
environmentally friendly units which are
capable of utilising recycled materials.
Average selling prices increased by 4.9%
as our strategy of introducing higher value-
added branded products came into effect
and offset the increased cost of fuel oil 
and bitumen. 
The total demand for ready-mixed concrete
in the UK is estimated to have fallen by
approximately 2% in 2005, against a
decline of 6.0% in our volumes. The relative
reduction in our volume was due in part to
the regional location of the work and in part
to our pricing discipline at the expense of 
lower margin volume. Selling prices
increased by 6.2% during 2005 offsetting
higher input costs, particularly for cement,
fuel and electricity. 
Commercially, signiﬁcant progress was
made during 2005 in securing long-term
maintenance contracts. These are used 
as a procurement route by both the UK
Highways Agency and by UK local
authorities. Innovative partnering
arrangements with service level guarantees
were also introduced with a number of
customers. Both these approaches help
underpin the long-term nature of our 
order book and support our capital
investment programmes. 
Capital expenditure*
†
during 2005 was
£23.1m (£35.6m) and included one new
ready-mixed concrete plant, aggregates and
asphalt plant upgrades and modiﬁcations and
additional mineral reserves and resources.
We continued to upgrade our facilities to
make them more efﬁcient. In particular,
initiatives were pursued to increase the
proportion of high-quality aggregates as
opposed to lower-value by-product. 
Managing our reserves, particularly sand 
and gravel, is a high priority for the division.
During 2005 additional sand and gravel
reserves and resources were secured in 
a number of locations, most notably in 
the south east, east of England and 
East Midlands. 
Restructuring cost savings of £10m 
were achieved as planned and have
resulted in a ﬂatter and more customer
responsive organisation.

the prior year. 
Outlook 2007
We do not expect a signiﬁcant recovery in
the market in the short term. Nevertheless,
there are some signs that demand may
improve towards the end of 2007 , helped by
the London Olympic spend leading up to
2012. We expect further raw material cost
increases in 2007 . Therefore, we will look 
to maintain our price discipline in the
marketplace wherever possible. Notiﬁed
price increases for 2007 are, on average,
expected to be similar to 2006. Ongoing
focus on customer service, reliability, logistics
and operational efﬁciency will be supported
by an increase in capital expenditure.

Hanson Building Products UK is one of 
the leading producers of bricks, aggregate
blocks, aircrete blocks, concrete pavers, a
range of precast concrete structures and
packed products. 
Bricks accounted for approximately 40% 
of the division’s group turnover*
†
in 2006
and blocks accounted for around 25%. The
ﬂoors and precast range (which accounts for
15% of group turnover*
†
) includes a variety
of ﬂooring systems, stairs and culverts.
Packed products bag a range of materials 
for general building and landscaping.
36-45_AW.qxp  23/2/07  22:21  Page 36 Brick products. Despite the brick volume
reductions, pricing discipline has been
maintained. Average selling price increases
of 7 .6%, necessary to recover higher energy
costs, were achieved for bricks due to the
combined effects of price increases and
product mix.
Aggregate block heritage
1
volumes 
declined 1.6% whilst average selling prices
increased 6.6%. The operating proﬁt
†# 
from
our aircrete block operations, Thermalite,
improved during 2006. This was driven by
increases in average selling prices of 6.0%,
and reduced costs following production
cutbacks. Demand remained weak in 
2006. These improvements suggest that
Thermalite is now moving back towards 
the level of ﬁnancial performance we were
seeking at the time of acquisition in 2005. 
Packed product average selling prices
increased by 9.2%, despite lower volumes,
as we continued to focus on the higher
margin products within our range. Flooring
demand remained strong during 2006,
whilst precast product volumes declined
due to lower demand and maintenance 
of pricing discipline. 
Input costs, in particular energy, continued
to increase during the year although the
operating proﬁt
†#
impact was partly mitigated
by the forward hedging of gas prices. During
2006, we continued to reduce production
capacity in response to low market demand
and high energy costs. Production was
reduced and several facilities were either
closed or mothballed. A restructuring charge
of £5.0m (£2.5m) was incurred as a result
of these production changes.
Capital expenditure*
†
in 2006 totalled
£18.5m (£16.8m) with an emphasis on
projects which will reduce production costs,
increase efﬁciency and automate manual
handling activities. These projects include
the continuation of our brick robotic setting
and kiln rebuild programme at our brick
factory at Whittlesey. In addition, we
commissioned our ﬁrst drymix packed
products and dry-silo mortar plant at
Nuneaton and commenced construction of
a new aggregate block plant at Whittlesey.
During 2006, three small acquisitions 
were completed. In January, we acquired
Red Bank Manufacturing, a producer of
high quality terracotta clay and concrete
products. In February, we acquired a block
plant from Lafarge. At the end of June, 
we acquired Formpave, a producer of high
speciﬁcation, permeable concrete block
paving. To date, these acquisitions are
performing in line with expectations.

Production was substantially reduced at
four brick factories and temporary lay-offs
were implemented during January 2006

Sand and Gravel, a bagging operation
which complements our packed products
range, and Cradley Special Brick are

Improved customer service and product
offering remain key priorities. Multi-product
deliveries are an example of the customer
service improvements trialled following the
extension of our product range. 
Outlook for 2007
The second half of 2006 saw some signs
of improvement in the RMI markets. We
expect the level of new residential build 
to remain stable and continue to consist of
a high proportion of ﬂats and apartments,
which use less bricks but more of our other
products. The level of property proﬁt in
2006 is unlikely to be repeated in 2007 ,
although this may be offset by lower
restructuring costs and improved 
operating conditions.
We have a number of opportunities to
improve our productivity and capacity 
levels, which, if undertaken, would result 
in a signiﬁcant increase in capital
investment in 2007 .
We will continue to focus on the needs 
of our customers, and are working closely
with them to become one of the UK’s 
leading suppliers of heavy building 
products and solutions which deliver

well ahead of last year. Strong
demand, as a result of both residential and
infrastructure led activity, and good selling
price increases were the main drivers for
this improvement. 
Victoria’s operating proﬁt declined
marginally. Despite ﬂat volumes, selling
price increases were not sufﬁcient to offset
rising input costs. Reduced volume from
lower residential demand and completion 
of major infrastructure projects has led to 
a decrease in the proﬁtability of our New
South Wales operations. 
2006 was difﬁcult for our Building
Products’ operations. Operating proﬁt

highly competitive pricing and a reduction 
in volumes in our precast operations.
The share of joint-ventures’ and associates’

†
of £15.5m (£24.3m) was

replacement delivery vehicles for our ready-

2006. During the year, we acquired 84.5m
metric tonnes of additional reserves and

Three acquisitions were made in 2006. Two
of the acquisitions were in Spain, with the
acquisition of three quarries complementing
our existing operations in Madrid, and two
concrete plants strengthening our position
in Majorca. In November, we acquired
Quarzsande GmbH in Austria which has

†#
reduced
by £4.0m, or 16.7%, to £19.9m (£23.9m). 
The £4.0m reduction in operating proﬁt
†#
was due to difﬁcult market conditions in
Israel and The Netherlands, which persisted
throughout 2005, and to quarry closures,
which impacted results in Spain. Market
conditions in the Czech Republic and

concrete volumes increased by 0.4%. 
In Spain, both group turnover*
†
and
operating proﬁt
†#
decreased in 2005.
Aggregate volumes were below 2004 due
to lower demand in Madrid and Zaragoza
and to the closure of two quarries, although
increases in average selling prices were
achieved. During 2005 we disposed of 19
underperforming ready-mixed concrete
plants. Excluding these disposals, ready-
mixed concrete volumes were ahead of
2004, as were average selling prices. 
Weak trading conditions continued in 
2005 for our Israel operations. Productivity
improvements were not sufﬁcient to counter
a decline in volume and the impact of higher
energy costs. In the Benelux region, the
ready-mixed concrete markets were difﬁcult,
resulting in lower prices and volumes.
Efﬁciency improvements were achieved in
our aggregate operations which helped to
offset a reduced operating proﬁt
†#
. 
Outlook for 2007
In 2007 , we expect activity levels to reduce
from recent highs in certain markets in Spain.
This should be broadly offset by further
progress in the construction market in other
countries. The general pricing environment
is stable with inﬂationary cost increases set
to be recovered. We will continue to seek
further bolt-on acquisitions and to invest 
in our capital expenditure programme.

joint-ventures’ and associates’ proﬁt after
tax
†
in 2006 of £33.7m (£40.5m, £23.2m)
was lower than last year, largely due to a
one-off tax beneﬁt of £6.6m in Australia in
2005. In 2005, excluding this tax credit, the
increase against 2004 reﬂected the strong
performance from our 25% interest in
Cement Australia.

in 2005. This consists of the operating
proﬁt

for each of the six divisions which
totalled £599.2m (£520.3m, £446.1m), 
less central expenses of £36.5m (£31.5m,

of £12.2m.
Further details are provided on page 7 
and in the operating review. The increase 
in central expenses in 2006 related to
incentive accruals, group IT costs and self
insurance charges. The increase in 2005
included higher self insurance charges
relating to a claim in North America.

†#
to a 10% fall in the US dollar is £27 .1m.
Operating impairments
Operating impairments in 2006 were £4.1m
(£4.0m, £29.3m). The net charge for 2006
consists primarily of charges relating to the
Aggregates North America division which
have arisen due to the closure, or intended
closure, of two sites. The net charge in
2005 consisted of £23.6m of impairment
charges, offset by a reversal of £19.6m. 
Finance costs and income
Net ﬁnance costs
†
* in 2006 were £77 .8m
(£55.5m, £46.8m). Interest payable on loans
totalled £131.3m (£119.0m, £92.2m) against
interest receivable of £43.9m (£60.1m,
£40.0m), resulting in a net interest cost of
£87 .4m (£58.9m, £52.2m). The main reason
for the increase in the net interest charge in
each of the last two years was an increased
level of net debt due to acquisitions. 
Interest cost on the pension plan liabilities
and other post-employment beneﬁts was
£103.2m (£103.2m, £99.2m), offset by 
an expected return on pension assets of
£114.5m (£108.7m, £111.2m), to give a
net pension and other post-employment
beneﬁts ﬁnance income of £11.3m 
(£5.5m, £12.0m). The increase in net
pension ﬁnance income in 2006 resulted
primarily from improved investment returns
in 2005 which increased the value of the
assets for 2006. The reduction in 2005
was due to lower interest rates. 
The unwinding of the discount relating 
to long-term provisions was a net charge 
of £2.0m (£2.5m, £6.6m), and included 
the impact of a change in discount rates.

Taxation on continuing operations in 2006
was £79.7m (£34.4m, £27 .1m), equivalent
to an effective tax rate on proﬁt before
taxation
†
of 16.6% (8.0%, 7 .8%). 
The 2006 charge included a beneﬁt of
£2.1m relating to impairments (2005 charge
£5.6m, 2004 beneﬁt of £6.3m). In addition,
the 2005 charge included a net release
from provisions of £29.6m following the
successful resolution of a number of issues
with the relevant tax authorities. The 2004
charge included a one-off deferred tax
beneﬁt of £21.7m. 
Discontinued operations after taxation
The 2006 discontinued operations after
taxation was a gain of £0.4m (loss £7 .3m,
loss £56.0m). This consisted of three
categories of items.
The ﬁrst two relate to current year disposals,
namely the current year proﬁt or loss after
taxation of discontinued operations of £nil
(£2.8m, loss £16.4m) and the proﬁt on
disposal after tax for operations disposed of
during the year of £0.3m (£2.3m, £10.4m).
Further details are provided in note 9 of 
the Notes to the accounts.
A proﬁt after tax of £0.1m (losses of £12.4m,
£50.0m) resulted from operations that were
discontinued prior to 2006. The main item
in this category was a credit relating to
asbestos of £1.1m (losses of £13.7m,
£48.6m) after tax. 
Asbestos
The 2006 net credit of £1.1m after tax
consists of a beneﬁt of £14.0m due to an
asbestos insurance settlement reached in
the year, less a charge of £12.9m, including
discounting, to maintain the provision. 
Various of the Company’s US subsidiaries
are defendants in a number of lawsuits
alleging bodily injury due to exposure to
asbestos-containing products before 1984. 
In 2006, outstanding claimants reduced 
to approximately 107 ,600 from 131,350
(2004: 135,750), representing new
claimants of approximately 6,350 (10,350;
18,700) less 30,100 (14,750; 7 ,150)
resolved during 2006. In the last two years,
over 90% of resolved claimants were
dismissed without payment compared to
approximately 80% in 2004.
The gross US dollar cost of resolutions
(settlement and defence costs) in 2006,
before insurance, was $54.5m ($43.2m,
$59.3m) including legal fees of $25.4m
($26.3m, $27 .4m). Net costs after insurance
were $51.1m ($31.7m, $12.8m), equivalent
to a discounted sterling cost after tax of
£16.9m (£10.6m, £4.3m). The costs incurred
in each year were utilised against the
asbestos provision. 
The Company’s approach to accounting 
for the asbestos claims against these US
subsidiaries is to provide for those costs 
of resolution which are both probable and
reliably estimable based on detailed analysis
and the assumptions referred to in note 21
of the Notes to the accounts. 
Earnings per share 
Basic earnings per share increased by
5.3% (47 .8%) to 56.0p (53.2p, 36.0p),
reﬂecting the increase in proﬁt before
taxation less the impact of the one-off
beneﬁts in the 2005 tax charge.
Dividends
The 2006 interim dividend paid and 
ﬁnal dividend recommended total 21.8p 
(20.0p, 18.15p), an increase of 9.0%
against 2005, following an increase of
10.2% against 2004. The average annual
increase in the dividend since 2002 has
been 9.0%, reﬂecting our progressive
dividend policy.

of
£529.0m (£448.3m, £400.2m). 
In 2006 the adverse movement in working
capital of £87 .5m included £69.1m due to an
increase in inventories. Around half of this
increase was in Building Products North
America, largely due to delays in product
offtake by our customers and increases to
support the order book. The majority of the
balance is due to higher brick inventory in the
UKto maintain future production ﬂexibility.
Other movements in 2006 of £33.8m largely
consist of property proﬁts which are excluded
from operating cashﬂow and shown within
the sale of property, plant and equipment.
T ax and net interest payments increased by
£20.9m in line with the increase in the
income statement expense.
In 2005, taxation paid increased to £54.1m,
against £18.3m in 2004 which was low
due to favourable capital allowances in
the USA.

Capital structure and share 
buyback programme 
The capital structure of the group takes
account of the needs of our equity
shareholders to maximise return on equity,
whilst recognising that to do so requires
access to the debt capital markets. Our
debt ratings are carefully managed and we
maintain an inclusive relationship with the
major rating agencies to ensure consistent
ratings over the medium term. Key credit
ratios are closely monitored and reviewed
as part of our planning process. 
The group continually reviews its level of
debt and equity. Following a four year period
of debt reduction, Hanson commenced an
on-market share buyback programme
during October 2004. 
During the year ended December 31, 
2006, 9,960,000 (8,335,000) shares were
bought back for £64.1m (£46.7m) at an
average cost of £6.43 (£5.60) per share,
and held as treasury shares. £65.7m
(£45.1m) was paid in the year. 
At December 31, 2006 there were 712.3
million ordinary shares in issue excluding
24.6 million held in treasury. The share
buyback programme is a rolling return of
that capital which we believe is in excess 
of our medium-term requirements and
which is reviewed on a continuing basis 
in the context of our cash ﬂow, capital
expenditure and acquisition plans. 
Net debt
Net debt consists of cash, cash equivalents
and borrowings. The maturity proﬁle of the
group’s cash and debt, excluding undrawn
balances on committed bank facilities, is set
out in the adjacent table. The percentage of
net debt held at ﬁxed interest rates at the
end of 2006 was 63%. 
In line with the group’s ﬁnancial risk
policies, the amount of net debt and foreign
exchange contracts denominated in US
dollars was increased during the year
to £1,114.0m (£1,090.1m, £834.7m),
representing 80% (110%, 120%) of net
debt. The change in net debt as a result 
of foreign exchange translation was a
reduction of £159.2m (increase of
£95.7m, reduction of £101.8m).
The effect on net debt of a 10% fall in the
US dollar is £101.3m. For further details,
see note 29 of the Notes to the accounts.

Equity 
Total equity was £2,728.8m (£2,672.3m) 
at December 31, 2006. The increase of
£56.5m consisted of proﬁt for the year of
£401.5m less foreign exchange movements
of £108.3m, dividends paid of £147 .5m,
shares repurchased of £64.1m and other
adverse movements of £25.1m.
Off balance sheet arrangements 
The group’s off balance sheet arrangements
consist of the following, as referred to in 
the Notes to the accounts: operating leases
(notes 3 and 27), commitments to capital
expenditure (note 13), guarantees, surety
bonds (note 26), contingent liabilities 
(note 21). Other than as disclosed, there 
are no off balance sheet arrangements that
have, or are reasonably likely to have, a
current or future material effect on the
group’s ﬁnancial condition, changes in
ﬁnancial condition, revenues or expenses,
results of operations, liquidity, capital
expenditure or capital resources. 
Capital and ﬁnancial obligations 
The table above sets out Hanson’s capital
and ﬁnancial obligations due by period.
Purchase obligations primarily consist of
mineral royalty purchase commitments.
Non-current assets
Non-current assets of £4,582.4m
(£4,221.7m) included £2,901.5m
(£2,735.4m) of property, plant and
equipment. The increase was driven
by acquisitions, which added £313.4m
(£133.8m), and capital investment
of a further £291.4m (£196.1m).
Intangible assets, primarily goodwill,
of £1,196.4m (£97 4.2m) increased
largely due to acquisitions which added
£299.8m (£215.7m). 
Cash, cash equivalents and borrowings 
At the end of 2006, the group’s net debt
of £1,397 .3m (£989.6m) was represented
by borrowings of £2,164.0m (£2,072.6m),
offset by cash of £766.7m (£1,083.0m).
Cash balances include £32.7m (£36.0m),
effectively pledged to third party insurance
companies, and hence not available for
general use.
Other assets 
Other assets include inventories of £450.0m
(£382.4m) and trade and other receivables
of £807 .3m (£774.8m). 
Provisions
Non-current and current provisions at
December 31, 2006 totalled £479.7m
(£552.3m). These included £203.7m
(£232.2m) for the estimated cost of
asbestos settlement and legal costs,
discounted and before insurance and 
tax relief, for the next eight years. 
Other liabilities
Other liabilities include a net liability before
taxation in relation to deﬁned beneﬁt
pension plans of £13.5m (£20.8m) and 
a net liability before taxation relating to
post-employment medical beneﬁts 
of £77 .4m (£103.3m).

The group Risk Committee, which includes 
all of the Executive Directors of the
Company and other senior managers, 
is responsible, under delegated authority 
from the Board, for reviewing the group
risk position and ensuring appropriate risk
mitigation is in place. In carrying out this 
role, the Risk Committee reviews audit
reports, risk assessment returns, including
those for Turnbull, as well as regular
management reports. 
Funding, liquidity and treasury management 
The group’s ﬁnancial risk policy identiﬁes
risks and sets out a control framework for
managing exposures. This policy is approved
by the Board and covers interest rate, foreign
exchange and credit risks. It also sets out
policies for funding and liquidity management.
The Risk Committee has delegated authority
from the Board to monitor and review these
policies, approve the adoption of new
instruments in accordance with group
policies and approve any changes to policy
implementation. Operating within the strict
controls of these policies, the Treasury
department manages these ﬁnancial risks,
ensuring in particular that sufﬁcient funding
and liquidity is available to meet the expected
needs of the group.
In addition to the high level of free cash ﬂow
of the group, Hanson operates a prudent
approach to liquidity management using a
mixture of long-term debt together with
short-term cash and investments. 
Our core funding is provided by three 
bond issues, each of $750m, maturing in
September 2010, March 2013 and August
2016 respectively. The group also has
substantial committed bank facilities which
total £971.2m; the principal components
are a £500m facility, £470m of which
expires in April 2011 and £30m of which
expires in April 2010, and a $475m facility
expiring in July 2009. At the balance sheet
date, £241.8m of committed bank facilities
were utilised by way of letters of credit and
cash drawings. The level of unused facilities,
together with other resources available 
to the group, is such that we believe that 
we have sufﬁcient funding to satisfy our 
working capital requirements in the near 
to medium term. 
Group credit facilities contain a ﬁnancial
covenant consistent with, but less 
restrictive than, the group’s interest cover
target. The group does not, therefore,
anticipate that this covenant will restrict
funding or investment strategies in the
foreseeable future. 
Credit risk 
The Board’s policy is that credit risk for
ﬁnancial transactions should be restricted 
to counterparties with a minimum A-/A3
credit rating for long-term transactions 
and F2/P-2/A2 for short-term transactions.
In addition, there are individual counterparty
and country limits for cash and short-term
investments. Hanson’s credit ratings, which
are a key determinant of the terms on which
the group can issue debt, were unchanged
during the year as shown below.
Interest rate risk 
The group’s policy for interest rate risk is
designed to limit the group’s exposure to
ﬂuctuating interest rates. This is achieved 
by limiting the level of ﬂoating interest rate
exposure to a maximum determined by both
the level of debt and the level of operating
proﬁt of the group at any point in time. 
This approach, which is consistent with 
our target for ongoing leverage, will mean,
other things being equal, that for any given
level of debt, a higher level of operating
proﬁt will result in a higher limit on the level
of ﬂoating rate debt in the group (and vice
versa). Consistent with this policy, the group
held 63% (56%) of net debt at ﬁxed rates
as at December 31, 2006. For further
details, see note 29 of the Notes to 
the accounts. 
Foreign exchange risk 
Due to the nature of our products, which
are generally uneconomical to transport
over long distances, there are few foreign
exchange transaction exposures in the
course of our day-to-day business.
However, the majority (64%) of our 
capital employed is in overseas locations
and is denominated in foreign currencies,
principally US dollars (42%). As a
consequence, changes in exchange rates
affect both reported proﬁt and asset values.
The exposure of asset values to foreign
exchange rates is controlled, to an extent,
by matching a proportion of currency assets
with currency liabilities, using both debt and
foreign exchange contracts. This means
that falling overseas exchange rates will
give rise to both falling asset values and
lower levels of net debt in sterling terms.
The interest cost of currency liabilities also
provides a partial hedge for foreign
currency income.

Hanson 2006 www.hanson.biz
Our business, ﬁnancial condition and results
of operations will be inﬂuenced by a range
of factors, many of which are beyond the
control of Hanson and its Board.
Consequently, these could have an impact on
the price of the Hanson shares and the
amount and timing of any dividends that 
we pay. The risk factors set out below and
the other information in the Annual Report
and Form 20-F should be considered
carefully. There may be other risks which
are not known to the Company or which
may not be material now but could turn out
to be material. 
Risk management 
The Board of Hanson PLC reviews the
effectiveness of the system of internal
control covering, inter alia, ﬁnancial,
operational, compliance and risk
management, at least annually. 
Changes in economic conditions could have
a material adverse effect on the level of
demand for Hanson’s products. 
The demand for many of our products 
is closely linked to economic conditions, both
globally and in the particular countries in
which we operate, especially in North
America, the UK and Australia. As a result,
depressed economic conditions, including 
a downturn in US residential demand, could
have an adverse effect on demand for, and
pricing of, our products, which could result
in reduced sales and reduced proﬁts. 
Changes in government policy or legislation
relating to public works expenditure and
housing could reduce the demand for
Hanson’s products.
National governments’ policies relating to
the development of transport infrastructure
and housing have a signiﬁcant effect on
demand for our products and, as a result,
our proﬁtability. Decreases in governmental
funding, or in the allocation of those funds
for transport infrastructure and housing
projects, could reduce the funds available
for spending on our products, therefore
potentially reducing sales and proﬁts. 
For example, government policy supporting
inner-city residential development in the
UK, and consequently an increase in the
number of apartments being built in place of
houses, has reduced the demand for bricks. 
Inclement weather conditions 
could signiﬁcantly impact levels 
of construction activity and hence 
demand for Hanson’s products.
Extended periods of inclement weather,
especially periods of heavy or sustained
rainfall during peak construction periods
during the year and other acts of nature,
such as hurricanes, can result in a material
reduction in demand for our products. 
It may also impact our ability to produce 
our products, and consequently result 
in reduced revenues and proﬁts. 
Hanson operates in an extremely 
competitive market. 
Most, if not all, of the markets in which we
operate are extremely competitive. Local
factors, such as the number of competitors
and production capacity, the proximity of
natural resources, economic conditions and
product demand exert further competitive
pressure. The pricing policies of competitors
and the entry of new competitors in the
local markets in which we operate can have
an adverse effect on the demand for, and
pricing of, our products. Consequently, the
results of our operations and proﬁtability
may be affected. 
Changes in government policy or legislation
relating to planning, the environment, health
and safety and industry-related taxes could
signiﬁcantly affect Hanson’s regulatory
compliance and other operating costs.
Our performance is affected signiﬁcantly 
by national and/or local government policy
and legislation in the regions and territories
in which we operate. Many of our products
are subject to government regulation in
various jurisdictions regarding their production
and sale. Our operating units are subject to
extensive regulation by national and local
agencies concerning matters such as
planning, environmental and health and
safety compliance. Numerous governmental
permits and approvals are required for our
operations. We believe that our operating
units are currently operating in compliance
with, or under approved variances from,
various national and local regulations in 
all applicable jurisdictions. In the past, our
subsidiaries have made signiﬁcant capital
and maintenance expenditures to comply
with planning, water, air and solid and
hazardous waste regulations. These
subsidiaries may be required to do so 
again in the future in order to ensure
business continuity. 
These national and local regulations in the
jurisdictions in which we operate mean that
it may be difﬁcult to expand existing quarries
or establish new greenﬁeld aggregates
reserves in areas where demand would
justify the capital expenditure required. 
The imposition of industry-related taxes,
such as the Aggregates Levy and the Climate
Change Levy in the UK, increase our costs
and encourage imports of competing
products and product substitution. 
Disruption to, and increased costs associated
with, both the supply of materials, energy and
fuel to Hanson and the supply of ﬁnished
products to Hanson’s customers could
signiﬁcantly reduce Hanson’s proﬁtability. 
We are a signiﬁcant purchaser of energy
and fuel. Gas and other energy supplies are
used in our cement and brick manufacturing
operations and fuel is used for the processing
and transport of our products. We also
purchase signiﬁcant amounts of materials.
These include cement for use in our ready-
mixed concrete and concrete product
operations, steel for use in our concrete
product and steel pipe operations and
bitumen for use in our asphalt activities. 
The cost of these materials and cost of
energy and fuel ﬂuctuates, sometimes by
signiﬁcant amounts. Increases in the costs
of these materials, energy and fuel, or their
lack of availability, can signiﬁcantly impact
Principal risks and uncertainties
46-55_AW.qxp  23/2/07  22:23  Page 52 53
Principal risks and uncertainties
our costs and disrupt our operations. 
The proﬁtability of our operations could 
be adversely affected if we are not able 
to recoup such costs in the prices of 
our products. 
Transport logistics play an important part in
the group’s supply chain, whether by road,
rail, sea or river. Any material disruption
to/or lack of availability of such transport
support could signiﬁcantly impact operating
costs and reduce proﬁtability. 
Increased employment costs could
signiﬁcantly reduce Hanson’s proﬁtability. 
We are a signiﬁcant employer of labour.
Any increased costs of employment,
including pension and post-employment
beneﬁt costs, could signiﬁcantly impact
operating costs and consequently reduce
proﬁtability. The group has several funded
deﬁned beneﬁt pension plans, which cover 
a signiﬁcant number of the group’s
employees who participate in the group’s
pension plans. Hanson also provides
beneﬁts from unfunded non-qualiﬁed plans
in the USA and post-employment beneﬁt
plans in the USA and Canada. Various
assumptions are made in calculating our
assets and/or liabilities under our pension
and healthcare plans which, if incorrect,
could have a material adverse effect on 
our ﬁnancial condition. 
Ineffective implementation of computer
software systems could signiﬁcantly 
reduce Hanson’s proﬁtability. 
The implementation of software to improve
the efﬁciency and effectiveness of various
business processes is an important
contributor to our ongoing operations and
growth strategy. Failure to design, select
appropriate suppliers or implement such
systems effectively could result in unplanned
costs or reduced levels of customer
satisfaction. This could adversely affect the
results of our operations and proﬁtability. 
Hanson’s acquisition strategy or capital
investment programme may be unsuccessful. 
We plan to continue making selective
acquisitions to strengthen, develop and
expand our existing activities. 
The successful implementation of our
acquisition strategy depends on a range of
factors. These include our ability to identify
appropriate opportunities, complete
acquisitions and achieve an acceptable rate
of return from those acquisitions, including
past acquisitions. There may also be
substantial challenges or delays in integrating
and adding value to the businesses which we
acquire. In addition, the costs of integration,
which cannot be reliably estimated, could be
material and the projected synergies resulting
from such acquisitions may not be realised.
Material costs or delays in the integration of
the operations that we acquire, or the inability
to realise synergies from those acquisitions,
could result in increased expenditure.
Consequently, this could lead to reduced
proﬁtability and reduced rates of return
from such acquisitions.
We continue to make signiﬁcant investment
in new plant and other capital equipment.
There may be changes in the cost of, or the
beneﬁts derived from, these projects which
could result in reduced rates of return from
this investment. 
Hanson is subject to risks relating 
to changes in exchange rates. 
In the year ended December 31, 2006,
approximately 76% of our operating proﬁt
†
#
was earned in currencies other than pounds
sterling, and a signiﬁcant portion of our
revenue is denominated in US dollars. 
At December 31, 2006, approximately 64%
of our capital employed was located outside
the UK, and approximately 105% of our net
debt and foreign exchange contracts were
denominated in currencies other than pounds
sterling. Since our results are reported in
pounds sterling, exchange rate movements
affect our reported proﬁts, assets, cash and
debt balances. This effect may be positive 
or negative depending on the nature of the
actual exchange rate movement and the
nature of any currency hedging instruments
that we have put in place. Fluctuations in
exchange rates could have a material
adverse effect on our ﬁnancial condition 
and results of operations to the extent that
we have not effectively hedged against
those exchange movements. 
Adverse changes in tax legislation may 
affect Hanson’s ability to maintain its tax 
rate below the UK statutory rate. 
The effective group tax rate for 2006 was
16.6% compared to a UK statutory rate of
30%. Hanson’s tax charge is subject to
changes in legislation. Such changes in
legislation may be implemented at short
notice and may affect Hanson’s ability to
maintain its underlying tax rate below the
UK statutory rate of 30%. 
We are unable to estimate reliably all costs
associated with asbestos-related claims. 
With respect to asbestos-related claims, the
Company’s approach to accounting for the
asbestos claims against its US subsidiaries
is to provide for those costs of resolution
which are both probable and reliably
estimable. The costs of resolving possible
claims are disclosed as contingent liabilities.
At present, the provision for those costs
(based on detailed analysis and the
assumptions contained in note 21 of the
Notes to the accounts) which are both
probable and estimable equates to
approximately eight years of gross cost,
assuming a cost level of approximately
$60m per annum. Whilst further claims are
likely to be resolved beyond this eight year
period, the associated costs of resolution
cannot be reliably estimated. Hence, no
provision has been made to cover these
possible liabilities. Factors which could
cause actual results to differ from these
estimates and expectations include: (i)
adverse trends in the ultimate number of
asbestos claims ﬁled against the Company’s
46-55_AW.qxp  23/2/07  22:23  Page 53 54 Operating and ﬁnancial review
Hanson 2006 www.hanson.biz
US subsidiaries; (ii) increases in the cost of
resolving current and future asbestos claims
as a result of adverse trends relating to
settlement costs, dismissal rates, legal fees
and/or judgment sizes; (iii) decreases in the
amount of insurance available to cover
asbestos claims as a result of adverse
changes in the interpretation of insurance
policies or the insolvency of insurers; 
(iv) the emergence of new trends or legal
theories that enlarge the scope of potential
claimants; (v) the impact of bankruptcies 
of other companies whose share of liability
may be imposed on the Company’s US
subsidiaries under certain state liability laws;
(vi) the unpredictable aspects of the US
litigation process; (vii) adverse changes in 
the mix of asbestos-related diseases with
respect to which asbestos claims are made
against the Company’s US subsidiaries; and
(viii) potential legislative changes. In light of
such factors, the liability of the Company’s
US subsidiaries for resolving asbestos
claims may be materially different from
current estimates. The impact of such
claims might have a material adverse effect
on the Company’s consolidated ﬁnancial
condition, results of operations and cash
ﬂow. However, assuming that current trends
continue, the Company does not expect
that the liability and costs associated with
these asbestos claims will have such a
material adverse effect. If there were a
material deterioration in current trends, the
Company does not expect that such claims
would impact the ability of the Company to
continue as a going concern based on the
information currently available to it. 
Hanson’s insurance may be insufﬁcient 
to cover its obligations related to Koppers’
environmental liabilities. 
Koppers’ environmental clean-up/
remediation obligations and related 
costs refer primarily to certain former 
US discontinued chemical and related
operations carried on by the Koppers
company. Members of the group remain
contractually and statutorily liable for certain
environmental clean-up/remediation costs
relating to these discontinued operations.
Based on existing known circumstances,
the Company considers the current 
Koppers insurance cover to be sufﬁcient to
meet substantially all of the related future
costs of this liability, recognising that the
estimate of future probable costs could
increase and new sites may arise to which
the insurance cover does not apply. Factors
which could cause actual costs to increase
include: (i) unknown adverse conditions
arising at sites; (ii) third party claims in
excess of estimates; (iii) changes to
regulatory requirements; (iv) changes in
remediation techniques; and (v) any other
signiﬁcant variations to assumptions made
in support of these cost estimates. Should
the current Koppers insurance cover be
insufﬁcient to meet the related future costs,
this could have a material impact on our
ﬁnancial condition, results of operations 
and cash ﬂow and proﬁtability. 
As a consequence of its signiﬁcant present
and former activities in the USA, the group is
subject to litigation claims. These may arise
out of former businesses and activities (in
addition to those relating to asbestos and
Koppers’ environmental liabilities referred to
above) as well as existing operations. 
Former and existing subsidiaries have
engaged in businesses and activities,
unrelated to the business and activities
presently carried on by our group, which
give rise to bodily injury and property
damage claims concerning environmental
and health issues. In particular, claims and
lawsuits have been ﬁled against our US
subsidiaries, either directly or as a result of
indemnity obligations, relating to products
incorporating coal by-products and other
chemicals, in particular for the wood-
treating industry. With respect to those
claims involving coal by-products and other
chemicals, the US subsidiary involved has
not entered into a material settlement or
been subject to a material adverse
judgment since the demergers as described
below. In addition, existing operations suffer
from litigation claims which may be
uninsured or fall within deductible levels. In
many cases, the relevant subsidiary believes
it has good defences against these claims.
Nevertheless, in light of the uncertainties
involved in litigation and in particular in the
USA, where there is the added potential for
punitive damages, our subsidiary may be
required to participate in settlements or be
subject to judgments in future for material
amounts. These may not be covered by
insurance and consequently may have a
material impact on our ﬁnancial condition,
results of operations and cash ﬂow. 
One of the companies into which the former
Hanson businesses demerged may be unable
to satisfy its indemniﬁcation obligations to
Hanson were it required to do so.
Four companies into which former Hanson
businesses were demerged agreed in
connection with their respective demergers
to indemnify us against liabilities of the
businesses transferred to those companies.
We have not incurred any liability in respect
of any claim that related to the above
mentioned businesses nor any such liability
being borne by the relevant demerged
company. The Energy Group plc, one of the
demerged companies, was acquired by TXU
Corp. in 1998. In November 2002, TXU
Corp. announced that several of TXU
Corp.’s UK subsidiaries had been placed
under the administrative process in the UK
(similar to bankruptcy proceedings in the
USA), including The Energy Group plc. 
The Energy Group plc is, therefore, unlikely
to be able to fulﬁl its indemniﬁcation
obligations to Hanson if it were required 
to do so. We are, however, not aware of any
claim against us or our subsidiaries that
would give rise to an indemnity obligation
on the part of The Energy Group plc. 
46-55_AW.qxp  23/2/07  22:24  Page 54 55
Critical accounting policies
requirement for such actions and their 
costs is inherently difﬁcult to estimate and 
is based on current information on costs
and expected plans for remediation. Actual
costs can differ from estimates over time
because of changes in existing laws and
regulations, public expectations, new sites
arising and unknown conditions being
encountered. 
Impairment 
The group applies IAS 36 “Impairment 
of Assets” under IFRS and SFAS 144
“Accounting for the impairment of long-lived
assets and for long-lived assets to be
disposed of” together with SFAS 142
“Goodwill and other intangible assets” 
under US GAAP. 
Under IFRS, the group compares the
carrying value of goodwill and tangible
assets with the higher of their net realisable
value and value in use (explained below), 
to determine whether an impairment exists.
Under US GAAP, the group assesses the
fair value and recoverability of goodwill by
comparing the implied fair value of goodwill
with the actual goodwill attributable to a
reporting unit. 
Value in use is calculated by discounting 
the cash ﬂows expected to be generated by
the asset/group of assets, being tested for
evidence of impairment. The use of different
estimates, assumptions and judgments, in
particular those involved in (a) determining 
a value based on our current expectations 
of future industry conditions and the
associated cash ﬂows from the group’s
operations, but also those involving our
future intentions for assets which are
currently non-operational, (b) our
determination of the level at which groups
of assets can be reasonably tested for
impairment separately from other parts of
the business and (c) our treatment of
centrally held assets, could each result in
materially different carrying values of assets
and assessments of impairment. 
The following section explains where, 
in these ﬁnancial statements, we have
exercised judgement in applying the 
group’s key accounting policies and critical
estimates in areas which are by their nature
inherently uncertain. Although we have
used all of the information currently
available to us in making such critical
estimates, changes to our assumptions 
in these areas could materially affect the
ﬁnancial results and position shown in this
document. Hanson’s signiﬁcant accounting
policies in accordance with IFRS are set out
on pages 74 to 76 of the Annual Report
and Form 20-F. Where estimates have been
used, it is possible that over time the actual
results upon which the judgment was based
could differ from those estimates. 
The group considers the following are the
critical policies where assumptions and
judgments could have a signiﬁcant impact
on the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. 
Legal and other disputes 
Some of the group’s subsidiaries are
subject to a number of legal disputes, 
the most signiﬁcant of which are asbestos
claims against a number of its US
subsidiaries. Provisions for anticipated
settlement costs and associated expenses
arising from legal and other disputes are
made where a reliable estimate can be
made of the probable outcome of the
dispute. Where it is not possible to make
such an estimate, no provision is made. 
Our approach to providing for asbestos is
explained in note 21 of the Notes to the
accounts. 
Environmental obligations 
Some of the group’s subsidiaries are also
subject to environmental obligations for
clean-up and remediation costs, pursuant 
to environmental laws and regulations.
Provisions are made for environmental
obligations and related costs which are
probable and reliably estimable and where 
a legal or contractual obligation to remedy-
known exposures exists. The ultimate
Pensions and other post-employment 
beneﬁt plans 
Under IFRS, the group applies IAS 19
“Employee beneﬁts”. Under US GAAP, the
group has adopted SFAS 158 “Employer’s
Accounting for Deﬁned Beneﬁt Pension
Plans and Other Post-Retirement Plans” 
as at December 31, 2006, amending the
accounting methodology under SFAS 87
“Employer’s Accounting for Pensions” and
SFAS 106 “Employer’s Accounting for 
Post-Retirement Beneﬁts other than
Pensions” on a prospective basis. 
These accounting standards require the
group to make assumptions including, but
not limited to, future asset returns, rates of
inﬂation, discount rates, life expectancies
and health care costs. The use of different
assumptions, in any of the above
calculations, could have a material effect on
the accounting values of the relevant assets
and liabilities which could result in a
material change to the cost of such
liabilities as recognised in the income
statement over time. These assumptions are
subject to periodic review. See note 28 of
the Notes to the accounts for additional
information regarding the group’s pension
and other post-employment beneﬁts. 
Taxation
Signiﬁcant judgement is required in
determining the provision for income taxes.
At any given time, the group is undergoing
tax audits in several tax jurisdictions and
covering multiple years. The group has
provisions for taxes that may become
payable in future periods as a result of 
these tax audits. The group recognises
liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues
based on estimates of whether additional
taxes will be due. Where the ﬁnal outcome 
of these matters is different from the
amounts provided, such differences will
impact the tax provisions in the period in
which such determination is made.

Report of the Directors 58 
The Directors submit their report together with the consolidated financial 
statements of Hanson PLC and its subsidiary undertakings for the year ended  
December 31, 2006. 
Business activities and review 
Hanson is a focused heavy building materials company with operations  
in the UK, North America, Australia, Asia Pacific and Continental Europe. 
A review of the group’s activities during the year, including financial 
performance, key performance indicators and a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties facing the group are included in the Chairman’s 
statement, the Chief Executive’s overview, A decade of delivery and beyond, 
the Operating and Financial Review, the Corporate governance statement 
and the Remuneration report of the Annual Report as detailed  
on page 1. The Annual Report contains some forward looking 
information/statements which by their nature involve some uncertainty  
and should not be construed as a profit forecast. 
Results and dividends 
The profit for the year was £401.5m (£387.6m, £264.2m).  
An interim dividend of 6.45p per ordinary share was paid on September 15, 
2006. The Directors recommend a final dividend of 15.35p per ordinary share 
which will, if approved at the AGM, be paid on May 4, 2007, to ordinary 
shareholders on the register at close of business (London time) on  
April 10, 2007.  
Dividends of £147.5m were paid during the year.  
Property, plant and equipment 
Details of movements in Hanson’s property, plant and equipment are shown  
in note 13 of the Notes to the accounts. 
Subsequent events 
There have been no material post balance sheet events since  
December 31, 2006. 
Research and development 
The development and improvement of new and existing products is an 
essential continuing process in our companies. Expenditure that does not 
meet the capitalisation criteria of an intangible asset is expensed as occurred. 
Research costs are also expensed as incurred. 
Share capital 
Details of changes in share capital during the year and the number of ordinary 
shares reserved for issue at December 31, 2006 are shown in note 23 of the 
Notes to the accounts.  
Details of shares purchased by the Company are shown in note 24 of the 
Notes to the accounts.  
Substantial shareholdings 
Details of substantial interests (3% or more) in Hanson’s share capital,  
as notified to Hanson, are shown in the Investor information section. 
Annual General Meeting 
The AGM will be held at 11.00am on April 24, 2007, at The Institution  
of Engineering and Technology, 2 Savoy Place, London WC2R 0BL. 
Shareholders being sent this document will also be sent a separate notice  
of the AGM incorporating explanatory notes of the resolutions to be proposed 
at the meeting. 
Directors 
The names and biographical details of the Directors are given on page 57.  
J C Nicholls resigned as a Director of the Company during the year under review. 
M W Welton, J W Leng and G Dransfield will retire by rotation and, being 
eligible, offer themselves for re-election at the forthcoming AGM. P S Binning, 
having been appointed since the last AGM, will seek election to the Board. 
Directors’ interests 
Details of the Directors’ service contracts, emoluments and share interests at 
December 31, 2006, appear in the Remuneration report on pages 63 to 67. 
Directors’ Indemnities 
The Company’s Articles of Association were amended following the 2005 
AGM to expand the circumstances in which a Director can be indemnified  
by the Company in accordance with Companies Act 1985. In addition to 
providing this indemnification and any other indemnification provided pursuant 
to the Articles of Association, charter or by-laws of Hanson’s subsidiaries, 
Hanson maintains directors’ and officers’ liability insurance for Directors and 
officers of Hanson and its subsidiaries. 
Except for such indemnification and insurance and except for the respective 
terms of service of such Directors and officers, no Director or officer of 
Hanson or any of their respective relatives or spouses either had an interest  
in any contract or transaction which was material to Hanson or such  
related party or unusual in its nature or conditions or had any outstanding 
indebtedness of a material nature owing to Hanson at any time during the  
last three years.  
Charitable and political donations 
During the year, the group made worldwide charitable donations of £348,000 
(£309,000, £321,000), including £84,000 (£93,000, £183,000) in the UK. 
As in the previous year, no political donations were made to EU political 
parties or organisations. 
Policy on payment of suppliers 
The holding company, Hanson PLC, has no trade creditors. The policy of 
Hanson companies is to agree payment terms with their suppliers and abide 
by those terms, subject to satisfactory performance by the supplier. 
Auditors and disclosure of information to auditors 
The Directors who held office at the date of approval of this Report of the 
Directors each confirm that, so far as they are aware, there is no relevant audit 
information (as defined in the Companies Act 1985) of which the Company’s 
auditors are unaware; and that they have each taken all the steps that ought 
to have been taken as a director of the Company to make himself/herself 
aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s 
auditors are aware of that information. 
This confirmation is given in accordance with the provisions of  
Section 234ZA of the Companies Act 1985. 
Ernst & Young LLP are the independent auditors of Hanson and, having 
expressed their willingness to continue in office, a resolution proposing their 
re-appointment will be submitted at the AGM. The Auditors’ reports on the 
financial statements are on pages 68, 69 and 135.

The Board is accountable to shareholders for good business governance  
and is committed to high standards of corporate governance, recognising  
that Hanson’s good reputation is one of the Company’s most valuable assets. 
To maintain and enhance this reputation Hanson has published its business 
principles which require its officers and employees to act in accordance with 
the laws and customs of each country in which we do business; be honest 
and act ethically; operate with integrity; observe and respect the culture and 
traditions of each country in which we operate; and not to offer, pay or accept 
bribes or favours in any form whatsoever. 
Divisional codes of conduct and supporting policies are also in place. 
A code of ethics for the purposes of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (US) 
(SOX), which applies to Hanson as a company listed on the NYSE, covering 
Hanson’s Chief Executive, Finance Director, Legal Director, Divisional Chief 
Executives and other identifiable persons in the group, including those 
performing senior accounting and controller functions, is in place. No 
amendments to, or waivers in respect of, the code were made during 2006. 
This code is available on request from the Company Secretary or on 
Hanson’s website at www.hanson.biz/corporategovernance. 
The way in which Hanson applies the principles set out in the Combined 
Code on Corporate Governance issued by the Financial Reporting Council in 
July 2003 (the “Code”) is described within this Corporate governance section 
and in the Remuneration report. The Board considers that Hanson has been 
in full compliance with the Code throughout the year under review and also 
with the revised Code published in June 2006, applicable for reporting years 
beginning on or after November 1, 2006. 
As well as being subject to UK legislation and practice Hanson, as a company 
listed on the NYSE, is subject to the listing requirements of the NYSE and the 
rules of the SEC. Compliance with the provisions of SOX, as it applies to 
foreign issuers, is continually monitored. Whilst the Directors believe that the 
group’s corporate governance policies are robust, changes have been and 
will continue to be made to ensure compliance with the rules that are in place 
at any point in time. Hanson follows UK corporate governance practice, which 
does not differ significantly from the NYSE corporate governance standards, 
except that the Nominations Committee is required to be comprised of a 
majority, rather than entirely, of independent directors. 
The Board of Directors  
The Board currently comprises the Chairman, the Chief Executive, two other 
Executive Directors and five Non-executive Directors and their biographies  
are on page 56. 
There is a clear separation of the roles of the Chairman and Chief Executive. 
The division of responsibilities between the Chairman and the Chief Executive 
is set out in writing and has been agreed by the Board. As Chairman, M W 
Welton has responsibility for the running of the Board and for ensuring that all 
Directors are fully informed of matters relevant to their roles. As Chief 
Executive, A J Murray has responsibility for implementing the strategy agreed 
by the Board and for managing the group. 
The commitments of the Chairman did not change during the year. 
All of the Non-executive Directors are considered by the Board to be 
independent of management and free from any business or other relationships 
which affect their ability to exercise independent judgement. J W Leng is the 
Senior Independent Director. 
The Board considers that the current Non-executive Directors bring a wide 
range of business and financial experience required for the successful 
direction of Hanson as an international force in the heavy building materials 
industry and provide a solid foundation for good corporate governance, 
ensuring that no individual or group dominates the Board’s decision making.  
Through the Nominations Committee, the Board ensures that plans are  
in place for the succession of Executive and Non-executive Directors. 
The Chairman and the Company Secretary work closely together in planning 
the annual programme and agendas for meetings. During the year, there were 
seven Board and strategy meetings held, including one offsite in the UK and 
another in the US.

There are clearly occasions when circumstances arise which prevent 
Directors from attending meetings. It is the usual practice in these 
circumstances for the Director concerned to review the Board papers  
with the Chairman and convey any views. 
All Directors then in office attended the AGM in 2006. 
The Board managed overall control of the Company’s affairs with reference  
to the schedule of matters reserved for its authorisation and approval, review 
and responsibility. This schedule was reviewed and updated during the year. 
Of the matters reserved for authorisation and approval, during the year the 
Board considered and approved as appropriate the Company’s long-term 
strategy, the annual operating budget, the financial statements, dividend 
recommendations, treasury activities, major acquisitions and disposals, major 
capital projects and expenditure, and the appointment of a new Finance Director. 
Matters for which the Board has responsibility include compliance with the 
group’s corporate responsibility policies, including environmental and health 
and safety for which group policies were endorsed during the year. 
Matters which the Board reviewed included quarterly results and performance 
against budget, the group’s management resource planning and development, 
charitable donations, the Company’s corporate governance arrangements and 
the effectiveness of the group’s system of internal control, as set out below. 
All Directors are equally accountable for the proper stewardship of the 
Company’s affairs.  
The Non-executive Directors have a particular responsibility for ensuring that 
the business strategies proposed are fully discussed and critically reviewed. 
This enables the Directors to act in the best long-term interest of shareholders, 
whilst taking account of the interests of employees, customers, suppliers and 
the communities in which the businesses operate. 
The Non-executive Directors also oversee the operational performance of  
the whole group. To do this they have full and timely access to all relevant 
information, with updates also provided on governance and regulatory matters 
affecting the Company. In addition, senior executives below Board level are 
invited, as appropriate, to Board and strategy meetings to make presentations 
on their areas of responsibility. 
As part of the initial induction process for those Non-executive Directors 
newly appointed, documents describing the Company and its activities  
are provided. An element of the induction focuses on relevant corporate 
responsibility matters and management resource planning and development. 
The induction programme also includes site visits and, although there were  
no new Non-executive Directors appointed in 2006, site visits were arranged 
at various times during the year, including two arranged in conjunction with 
the holding of the overseas Board meeting. 
All Directors are provided with the opportunity, and encouraged to go, for 
training to ensure they are kept up to date on relevant new legislation and 
best practice and changing commercial and other risks. Typical training 
experience for all Directors included attendance at seminars, forums, 
conferences and working groups, in addition to which W F Blount completed 
an externally certified Director’s College Programme in the USA. 
In order to fulfil their duties, procedures are in place for Directors to seek both 
independent advice and the advice and services of the Company Secretary 
who is responsible for advising the Board, through the Chairman, on all 
governance matters.  Hanson 2006 www.hanson.biz
Corporate governance 60 
During the year, an evaluation of the Board’s effectiveness, including the 
effectiveness of Committees of the Board, was undertaken by external 
consultants by way of a written questionnaire followed by individual meetings 
with all Directors. A report was prepared for the Board for its consideration. 
The results of the evaluation showed that the Board and its Committees were 
operating effectively but did identify some areas which would help the Board 
provide a higher performance. These covered such areas as the process  
for developing strategy; the dynamics of the Board; talent management; 
enhancing the involvement of the Board with the operations; and the  
workings of the Board. Identified improvements will be introduced in 2007. 
The Board plans to conduct evaluations on an annual basis and may use 
alternative approaches in future years. 
As part of the evaluation process, the Chairman considered the performance, 
including time commitments, of each individual Non-executive Director and 
concluded that the performance of each continues to be effective. 
Also during the year and in the absence of the Chairman, the Non-executive 
Directors, led by J W Leng, conducted a review of and discussed the 
performance of the Chairman, taking into account the views of the Executive 
Directors. Feedback was given, including any actions which will be put into 
effect during 2007, to the Chairman, by J W Leng, and the conclusion reached 
was that the Chairman’s performance was effective. Similarly, during the year, 
the Chairman met separately with the Non-executive Directors to consider  
the performance of the Chief Executive in the discharge of his duties. It was 
concluded that the performance of the Chief Executive continues to be effective. 
The Non-executive Directors fulfil a key role in corporate accountability. The 
remits and membership of the Remuneration, the Nominations and the Audit 
Committees of the Board are set out below. The Company Secretary acts as 
secretary to all of these Committees. 
The terms of reference of the Committees are available on Hanson’s website 
at www.hanson.biz/corporategovernance. 
Remuneration Committee 
The Remuneration Committee consists of four independent  
Non-executive Directors; W S H Laidlaw (Chairman), W F Blount,  
The Baroness Noakes and C J Brady and, since January 2007,  
M W Welton. Its role is described in the Remuneration report. 
In 2006, the annual fees for chairing the Committee and for acting as a 
member were £12,500 and £5,500, respectively. There has been no change 
to the fee arrangements for 2007 and no fee will be paid to M W Welton for 
acting as a member of the Committee. 
Nominations Committee 
The Nominations Committee consists of M W Welton as Chairman,  
A J Murray and the independent Non-executive Directors.  
The Committee’s terms of reference, which were reviewed during the year, 
include the review of the structure, size and composition of the Board, with 
recommendations to the Board on any changes, and planning for the orderly 
succession of Executive and Non-executive Directors. 
There were no fees payable for chairing or acting as a member of the 
Committee in 2006. There has been no change to the fee arrangements  
for 2007. 
During the year, on behalf of the Board, the Committee undertook a search 
for the appointment of a new Finance Director, for which search a candidate 
profile was agreed. The Committee then appointed an external search 
consultancy and met with candidates prior to making a recommendation  
to the Board, which resulted in the appointment of P S Binning as Finance 
Director and as a member of the Board on January 2, 2007. For the 
appointment of Non-executive Directors, the Board considers the balance  
of skills and experience on the Board and then agrees a candidate profile  
for the search, for which an external search consultancy is appointed. The 
Committee meets with candidates prior to making a recommendation to the 
Board. No new Non-executive Directors were appointed during the year. 
During the year the Committee met twice formally, and on a number  
of other occasions, principally in the search for a new Finance Director.  
W S H Laidlaw was unable to attend one of the formal meetings. The 
Committee also undertook a review of its own effectiveness, working with  
the same external consultants used for the Board evaluation, and reported 
back to the Board. 
Following appointment by the Board, new Directors must submit themselves 
for election by the shareholders at the AGM following their appointment. 
Thereafter, subject to the Articles of Association in relation to the re-election 
of Directors, all Directors are subject to re-election every three years.  
Recommendations to shareholders on the re-appointment of the Directors  
is not automatic and is subject to consideration by the Committee, prior  
to approval by the Board. 
Audit Committee  
The Audit Committee comprises three independent Non-executive Directors; 
The Baroness Noakes (Chairman), W S H Laidlaw and J W Leng. 
In 2006, the annual fees for chairing the Audit Committee and for acting as  
a member of the Committee were £20,000 and £5,500, respectively. There 
has been no change to the fee arrangements for 2007. 
Regular attendees at Committee meetings, at the invitation of the Committee, 
included the Chairman, the Finance Director, the Head of Internal Audit, the 
Group Financial Controller, the Group Chief Accountant and representatives 
from the external auditors. In 2006, the Chief Executive also attended one 
meeting prior to the appointment of a new Finance Director. 
The Committee’s principal duties include: 
– monitoring the integrity of the Company’s financial statements 
– reviewing the effectiveness of systems for internal financial control, financial 
reporting and risk management 
– reviewing the internal audit programme and monitoring the effectiveness  
of the internal audit function 
–  overseeing the processes for the appointment, re-appointment and removal 
of the auditors 
– approving the terms of engagement and the remuneration for audit services 
– setting the policy for the provision of non-audit services and pre-approval  
of all permitted non-audit services 
– monitoring the whistleblowing procedures 
– ensuring the objectivity and independence of the auditors is maintained. 
During the year the Committee met four times, which all of the Committee 
members attended, other than on one occasion when J W Leng was unable 
to attend. 
The Board considers that each of the members of the Committee has 
experience of corporate financial matters. The Baroness Noakes, who is 
a Chartered Accountant, is considered by the Board to have recent and 
relevant financial experience and is also identified as the Audit Committee 
financial expert for the purposes of SOX. On appointment to the Committee 
all members receive appropriate induction. There were, however, no new 
members appointed during the year. 
The Committee discharged its responsibilities through a series of Committee 
meetings throughout the year at which detailed reports were presented for 
review. The Committee received reports either from the external auditors,  
the Head of Internal Audit or Company management. The Committee  
met privately with the external auditors and the Head of Internal Audit as 
appropriate. It has authority to seek any information it requires from any 
employee, authority to obtain external legal or other independent professional 
advice on any matter within its terms of reference and to secure the 
attendance of external advisors with relevant experience and expertise if it 
considers it necessary. There were no occasions during the year when it 
considered it was necessary to obtain external advice. 
During the year, the Committee’s meetings considered, addressed or 
approved, as appropriate, the following principal matters: 
– the interim and full year financial results prior to consideration by the Board  
– the annual internal audit programme and its resourcing 
– the auditors’ interim and full year reports 
– the auditors’ report to management 
– the overseeing of the group’s SOX compliance work 
– the overseeing of the whistleblowing programme 
– the scope and cost of the external audit 
– any non-audit work carried out by the auditors; and  
– an evaluation of the effectiveness of the auditors, which included feedback 
from management on the quality of the audit and the working relationship 
between management and the auditors, and consideration of their 
reappointment. 
The Committee also undertook a review of its terms of reference and its own 
work and effectiveness, working with the same external consultants used for 
the Board evaluation, and reported back to the Board. 
The Committee received reports during the year on the groupwide 
whistleblowing programme, MySafeWorkplace, through which employees 
may in confidence raise concerns about possible wrongdoing in financial 
reporting or other matters. The Committee ensured proportionate and 
independent investigation of such matters with appropriate follow-up  
action undertaken.  Corporate governance
 
 
61
Additionally, to safeguard the objectivity and independence of the auditors 
and to ensure that the independence of the audit work undertaken by the 
auditors is not compromised, the Committee considered the auditors’ own 
assessment of independence and compliance with relevant professional  
and regulatory requirements. The views of management were also taken  
into consideration. 
The Committee also has a policy for the provision of non-audit services  
by the auditors. The policy defines services which can be provided by the 
auditors and requires all non-audit services to be approved in advance by  
the Committee, which has delegated this task to the Head of Internal Audit. 
The approval process requires full disclosure of the objective and the scope 
of services to be performed in addition to the fee structure. During the year 
the Committee reviewed all approved services and level of expenditure. The 
auditors were permitted to perform non-audit service only where the scope of 
work was within the terms of the policy and there was a business benefit  
to the group in these services being performed by them rather then an 
alternative supplier. A breakdown of the non-audit fees can be found  
in note 32(o) of the Notes to the accounts. 
The Committee considered that Ernst & Young LLP were effective in 
conducting the audit and work on SOX compliance during the year. 
Risk Committee 
A further Committee of the Board is the Risk Committee, which consists  
of the Chief Executive, the Finance Director, the Legal Director and other 
senior executives. It is responsible for monitoring and reviewing the group’s 
significant financial and non-financial risks in relation to treasury activities, tax, 
insurance, asbestos, legacy issues, pensions, internal audit, internal control, 
business risk and other matters as they arise from time to time. As one of its 
main duties, on behalf of the Board, the Committee identifies the principal 
risks and mitigating actions arising out of the internal control reviews, as 
outlined below. 
Internal control  
The Board recognises that it is responsible for the group’s system of internal 
control and for reviewing its effectiveness. The Code requires the Board to 
review the effectiveness of the system of internal control, including financial, 
operational, compliance and risk management, at least annually. In addition, 
Internal Control: Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code was 
published in September 1999 and revised in October 2005, to provide 
guidance to Directors in respect of this requirement.  
The Board confirms that procedures, which accord with the guidance,  
have been in place for the year to December 31, 2006 and up to the date  
of approval of the Annual Report and Form 20-F by the Board. These 
procedures provide an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and 
managing the principal risks faced by the group, thereby ensuring that 
the Board is made aware of these. 
The Board is responsible for the system of internal control. It is regularly 
reviewed by the Risk Committee, acting on behalf of the Board, for 
effectiveness and adequacy and the Board confirms that necessary actions 
have been or are being taken to remedy any significant failings or weaknesses 
identified from those reviews. Such a system can only provide reasonable  
and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss, as it  
is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives. In seeking to achieve these objectives, many of which 
are already features of the existing processes and procedures within the 
Company, the Board has specifically instituted the following processes,  
which have been in effect throughout the reporting period and up to  
the date of approval of the Annual Report and Form 20-F by the Board. 
Policies 
– A planning framework which incorporates a four year plan approved by 
the Board, with objectives for each business unit. 
– A mechanism for reporting weaknesses in internal control systems and  
for monitoring corrective action. 
 
Processes 
– Appointment of experienced and professional staff, both by recruitment and 
promotion, of the necessary calibre to fulfil their allotted responsibilities. 
– A comprehensive system of financial reporting to the Board, based on an 
annual budget with monthly reports against actual results, analysis of 
variances, scrutiny of key performance indicators and regular re-forecasting. 
– Formal business risk reviews performed by management which evaluate 
the potential financial and non-financial impacts of identified risks and 
possible new risk areas, set control, mitigation and monitoring procedures 
and review actual occurrences, identifying lessons to be learnt. 
– Regular treasury reports to the Board which analyse the funding 
requirements of each class of assets, track the generation and use of 
capital and the volume of liquidity, measure the group’s exposure to 
interest and exchange rate movements and record the level of compliance 
with the group’s funding objectives. 
– Well-defined procedures governing the appraisal and approval of 
investments, including detailed investment and divestment approval 
procedures incorporating appropriate levels of authority and regular  
post investment reviews. 
 
Verification 
– An internal audit function, which undertakes periodic examination of 
business units and processes and recommends improvements in controls 
to management. 
– The external auditors, who are engaged to express an opinion on the 
financial statements. 
– An Audit Committee, which considers significant control matters and 
receives reports on internal controls from both the internal and external 
auditors on a regular basis. 
– A Risk Committee, which monitors and reviews significant financial and 
non-financial risk. 
Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures  
The Company has a Disclosure Committee, which includes amongst its 
members, the Chief Executive, the Finance Director and the Legal Director. 
The Committee monitors and reviews the group’s disclosure controls and 
procedures to ensure these are satisfactory for the purpose. The review 
includes the evaluation of the effectiveness as at December 31, 2006  
of these disclosure controls and procedures to permit the signing of the 
certifications required from the Chief Executive and the Finance Director  
in accordance with the requirements of section 302 of SOX. Based on this 
evaluation, the Chief Executive and the Finance Director concluded that the 
disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that information 
required to be disclosed in reports filed under the US Securities Exchange 
Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarised and reported within 
specified time periods and that information required to be disclosed is 
accumulated and communicated to management, including them, to allow 
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
Management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting  
In accordance with the requirements of section 404 of SOX, the following 
report is provided by management in respect of the Company’s internal 
control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) 
under the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934):  
– Hanson’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining 
adequate internal control over financial reporting for the group. 
– Hanson’s management has used the Committee of Sponsoring 
Organisations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) framework to 
evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. 
Management believes that the COSO framework is a suitable framework 
for its evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting because it  
is free from bias, permits reasonably consistent qualitative and quantitative 
measurements of our internal controls, is sufficiently complete so that those 
relevant factors that would alter a conclusion about the effectiveness of our 
internal controls are not omitted and is relevant to an evaluation of internal 
control over financial reporting. 
– Management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over 
financial reporting, as at December 31, 2006, and has concluded that such 
internal control over financial reporting is effective. 
– Ernst & Young LLP, which has audited the consolidated financial 
statements of the group for the year ended December 31, 2006, has also 
audited management’s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control 
over financial reporting under Auditing Standard No. 2 of the Public 
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). See the Auditors’ 
report on page 69. 
Changes in internal control over financial reporting  
During the period management has continued to improve its control 
environment and to enhance its information systems and processes. There 
have been no changes in the group’s internal controls or in other factors 
during the period that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely  
to materially affect, the group’s internal control over financial reporting. 
Internal Audit  
Each major operating division has internal audit capability and these are  
co-ordinated centrally by the Head of Internal Audit under the guidance of  
the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee regularly reviews internal audit 
reports and considers the overall effectiveness of the function. 2006 has seen 
an ongoing focus on financial statement risks identified through existing risk 
management procedures and through the assessment of internal control over 
financial reporting, required by SOX. During 2006, we have further embedded 
the SOX requirements in the organisation and broadened the scope of 
internal audit to carry out more extensive work on operational risks. This 
greater emphasis on operational risks will continue into 2007 and will again 
contribute to the development of the group’s risk management framework and 
its internal controls environment.  Hanson 2006 www.hanson.biz
Corporate governance 62 
Shareholder communications  
Hanson values its dialogue with both institutional and private investors  
and, based on publicly available information, constructive two-way 
communication with fund managers, institutional investors and analysts  
is promoted and encouraged.  
Principally, the investor relations team maintain regular contact with the 
Company’s major shareholders. In addition, regular analyst presentations, 
copies of which are available to download from the investors section of the 
Hanson website at www.hanson.biz, are undertaken and roadshows by the 
Chief Executive and Finance Director follow the announcement of the interim 
and annual results. A quarterly report covering analyst coverage, shareholder 
analysis, feedback from investor meetings and press coverage is provided to 
the Board. 
An independent survey of the Company’s major shareholders was also 
undertaken during 2006 with feedback, in the form of a presentation, given  
to the Board. In addition, a consultation exercise was undertaken with the 
Company’s major shareholders in relation to the introduction of a new Long 
Term Incentive Plan which was subsequently approved by shareholders at  
the 2006 AGM. 
Although the Senior Independent Director and other Non-executive Directors 
are available to meet with major shareholders, no specific shareholder 
requests were made during the year. 
The Hanson website also provides information on the Company and its 
businesses. It is not intended for the website address to be an active link  
or to otherwise incorporate the contents of the website into this document. 
At the AGM (see page 58 for details), the Chief Executive will present a 
review of the results and current business activity. Shareholders are invited to 
ask questions on items of business put before the meeting and will have the 
opportunity to vote separately on each resolution. The Chairman will indicate 
the level of proxy votes lodged in respect of each resolution following each 
vote on a show of hands and details of those abstaining from voting will also 
be disclosed. As for the prior year, this information will also be posted on the 
Hanson website after the meeting. Following the meeting, the Directors will 
be available to meet with shareholders. 
Going concern 
The Directors confirm that, after making appropriate enquiries, they have a 
reasonable expectation that Hanson has adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue  
to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. 
Directors’ responsibilities for the financial statements 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for  
each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the 
Company and of the group and of the profit or loss of the group for that year. 
In preparing these financial statements, the Directors consider that they have: 
selected suitable accounting policies, and applied them consistently; made 
judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and followed 
applicable international accounting standards. 
The Directors are responsible for ensuring that the group keeps proper 
accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time  
the financial position of the group and enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are responsible for 
taking reasonable steps to safeguard the assets of the group and to prevent 
and detect fraud and other irregularities. 
A copy of the Annual Report and Form 20-F of the Company is placed on  
the Company’s website www.hanson.biz. The Directors are responsible for 
the maintenance and integrity of statutory and audited information on the 
Company’s website. Information published on the internet is accessible  
in many countries with different legal requirements. Legislation in the UK 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may  
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

Remuneration Committee membership and terms of reference 
The Remuneration Committee (the “Committee”) consists of four  
Independent Non-executive Directors: W S H Laidlaw (Chairman),  
W F Blount, The Baroness Noakes DBE and C J Brady; and M W Welton, 
who was appointed in January 2007.  
The role of the Committee is to consider and make recommendations on the 
framework of executive remuneration (the “policy”) for approval by the Board. 
In accordance with the policy, the Committee considers, recommends as 
appropriate and approves the conditions of service of the Chairman, the 
Executive Directors and the Company Secretary, including the duration of any 
service agreements, and the emoluments and other benefits payable under 
such agreements, including pension entitlements and participation in incentive 
arrangements. M W Welton is not involved in any decisions as to his own 
arrangements. The Committee also recommends and monitors the level  
and structure of remuneration for senior management and oversees the 
Company’s and Old Hanson’s long-term incentive plans and option schemes.  
During the year under review, other than from its independent advisor, the 
Committee also sought the assistance of the Chairman, the Chief Executive, 
the Company Secretary and the Head of Corporate Human Resources on 
matters relating to remuneration.  
There were four formal meetings held by the Committee during the year and  
all the then members attended each meeting, other than on one occasion when  
C J Brady was unable to attend. The Committee also dealt with other matters 
under its terms of reference by written correspondence. The Chairman, Chief 
Executive and the Company Secretary were present at all the meetings of the 
Committee but each was respectively excluded when his own performance and 
remuneration were being discussed.  
The Committee also undertook a review of its terms of reference and its own 
work and effectiveness, working with the same external consultants used for 
the Board evaluation, and reported back to the Board. 
Committee members receive fees as Non-executive Directors, including a fee 
for acting as a Committee member as outlined in the Corporate governance 
section on page 60, but do not receive any pension entitlements nor any 
short- or long-term performance related incentives. No member of the 
Committee has any personal financial interest, other than as a shareholder in 
the Company, in the matters to be decided or for the day-to-day management 
of the business.  
The fees payable to Non-executive Directors are determined by the Board  
as a whole within the limits set by the articles of association and for the year 
ending December 31, 2006 the basic fee was £40,000. In 2007, it will 
remain the same. The Non-executive Directors do not participate in or vote  
on any discussion relating to their own remuneration. 
The Committee has appointed Mercer Human Resource Consulting  
(“Mercer”) to act on behalf of the Committee in providing independent  
market information and remuneration advice on an ongoing basis.  
Mercer also provides actuarial and consulting services to the Company. 
Remuneration policy 
Hanson operates in competitive and international markets. To secure the 
long-term performance of the business it is essential that the Company 
implements an integrated system of remuneration which rewards sustained 
high performance well enough to attract and retain high-performing executives 
and directors. To ensure that its remuneration rates are competitive, whilst  
not being excessive, the Committee keeps remuneration under regular 
review in light of emerging best practice. 
The remuneration policy is designed to provide packages, which take account 
of individual performance: 
i) in the knowledge of what comparable, in terms of size and complexity,  
UK and international companies are paying; 
ii) in the context of packages offered throughout the Hanson group; and 
iii) to include short- and long-term performance related elements, potentially  
a significant portion of total rewards, to motivate the highest performance 
and to align the interests of the Executive Directors and shareholders. 
 
Share incentives are considered to be an important part of the incentive 
policy for Executive Directors. A shareholding requirement has been 
introduced for the Executive Directors. For the Chief Executive this is to hold 
shares to the value of two times salary and for the other Executive Directors  
to the value of one times salary. For any new Chief Executive or Executive 
Director, the expectation would be that the shareholding requirement would 
be achieved within five years of the individual becoming a Director. The  
Chief Executive, A J Murray, and G Dransfield already satisfy these 
shareholding requirements. 
Basic salary 
In setting the basic salary for each Executive Director, the Committee reviews 
relevant market data and considers the Director’s experience, performance 
and responsibilities. Basic salaries are generally reviewed on an annual basis 
or following a significant change in responsibilities.  
Increases in basic salary of 5.4% and 4.1% have been granted to A J Murray 
and G Dransfield, respectively, for the year commencing January 1, 2007.  
The salary of P S Binning, who was appointed Finance Director on January 2, 
2007, is £420,000. 
The Committee also determines the fee for the Chairman, which was 
£220,000 for 2006. In 2007, this will be £230,000. 
Annual bonus scheme  
The annual bonus scheme for the Executive Directors and other senior 
executives is aligned with changes in shareholder value through the economic 
value added methodology. The main principle of economic value added is to 
recognise that over time a company should generate returns in excess of its 
cost of capital – the return that lenders and shareholders expect of the 
Company each year. 
The annual bonus scheme is calibrated by reference to target levels of  
bonus and, for the Executive Directors and other senior executives, works  
on a bonus banking arrangement whereby each year the improvement in the 
group’s overall economic value added for that year determines whether there 
is a bonus bank addition or deduction. Following the addition or deduction, 
the participant receives one-third of the accumulated bonus bank. There is 
neither a cap (maximum addition into the bonus bank each year) nor a floor 
(maximum deduction from the bonus bank each year). 
The bonus bank has two main functions; firstly it ensures that individuals  
do not make short-term decisions such as deferring essential expenditure 
from one year to the next and receive a bonus for doing so; and secondly, 
the bonus bank can act as a retention tool. 
For 2006, the target level of bonus for A J Murray was 62.5% of basic salary 
and for G Dransfield 37.5% of basic salary. No bonus entitlement arose for  
J C Nicholls who left the Company on October 31, 2006. 
Improvement in the group’s overall economic value added for the year to 
December 31, 2006 determined the bonus bank addition for the Executive 
Directors. The strong operating and profit performance in 2006 led to 
improvement in the group’s economic value added and resulted in additions 
to the bonus bank of 69.4% of basic salary for A J Murray and 41.6% of basic 
salary for G Dransfield. The bonuses paid in respect of the year to December 
31, 2006 to the Executive Directors were £509,262 for A J Murray and 
£161,986 for G Dransfield. 
Performance targets under the annual bonus scheme, based on 
improvements in economic value added, are set by the Committee,  
after taking advice from Mercer. 
Bonuses payable to Executive Directors are not pensionable. 
Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) 
Executive Directors and certain senior executives and managers from the 
Company’s worldwide operations participate in the LTIP. Under this plan, 
participants are conditionally awarded shares in the Company at nil cost with 
the proportion of those shares which may vest subject to the achievement of 
performance targets over a performance period set by the Committee. 
At the 2006 AGM, shareholders approved a new LTIP. The principal change 
from the previous LTIP, which expired in 2006, was to replace that element  
of an award which was the subject of an economic value added measure, 
with earnings per share (“EPS”) and cash flow growth measures. 
Under the new LTIP, 50% of the award is subject to a Total Shareholder 
Return (“TSR”) measure, 25% to an EPS measure and 25% to a cash flow 
growth measure. The Committee chose these performance measures as it 
believes they correlate closely with the Company’s strategy and with the 
creation of shareholder value. 
The extent to which awards under the EPS and cash flow growth measures 
will vest will depend on the extent to which growth in these measures 
exceeds inflation over three year performance periods on the following bases:

performance period

Less than RPI + 3% 0%

RPI + 10% or more 100%
Between RPI + 5% and RPI + 10% 
Between 25% and 100%
on a straight line basis
For the TSR measure in 2006 (and similarly for the awards made in 2003, 
2004 and 2005), the conditional awards made will vest only if Hanson 
achieves a TSR over the three year performance period, from the date of the 
award in May 2006, which is greater than the TSR achieved by at least 50% 
of the members of a comparator group of international building materials 
companies at the date of the award (the “comparator group”) over the same 
period. If so, 30% of the award will vest. All of the award will vest if the 
Company achieves a TSR over the performance period which is greater than 
that achieved by 80% of the comparator group. Between these two points 
the award will vest in the proportion of 2.33% of the award for each 1% 
improvement in the Company’s ranking. 
For the conditional award made in 2006, the EPS and cash flow growth 
performance measures require an increase in the Company’s EPS – continuing 
operations before impairments and the Company’s net cash flow from operating 
activities (excluding additional pension contributions) over a fixed three year 
performance period starting on the first day of the financial year in which the 
awards are granted. For 2006, the EPS and cash flow growth measures  
against which performance will be measured are 50.5p per share and  
£483.3m respectively. 
In 2006, a conditional award of shares was made to A J Murray of 187.5%  
of basic salary and to the other Executive Directors of 130% of basic salary. 
In respect of the outstanding 2004 and 2005 awards, 50% of the award  
is subject to a TSR performance measure and 50% to the attainment of an 
economic value added target. The economic value added targets require 
improvements in economic value added over a period of three years based  
on the results for the financial year immediately preceding the award. For this 
performance measure, a linear vesting schedule applies in order that 25% of  
the award will vest at the minimum performance level with the maximum award 
vesting only on the achievement of substantial performance improvement. On 
attaining the minimum economic value added of £14.0m for the 2004 award 
and £14.5m for the 2005 award, 25% of the respective awards subject to the 
economic value added measure criteria will vest. 100% of the awards subject  
to this measure will vest on attainment of economic value added improvements 
of £37.2m and £38.8m for the 2004 and 2005 awards, respectively. 
For the 2004 award, the TSR comparator group consists of 13 companies, 
including Hanson. These include 3 UK building materials companies in the 
FTSE 350 Index (Hanson, Travis Perkins and Wolseley), 4 European building 
materials companies in the Euro Top 300 Index (CRH, Holcim, Lafarge and 
Wienerberger), 4 North American businesses (Florida Rock, Martin Marietta, 
Texas Industries and Vulcan) and 2 Australian building materials companies 
(Boral and Rinker). The Committee removed Pilkington and Ultraframe 
following takeover of these companies. 
For the 2005 award, the TSR comparator group consists of 15 companies, 
including Hanson. These include 3 UK building materials companies in the 
FTSE 350 Index (Hanson, Travis Perkins and Wolseley), 5 European building 
materials companies in the Euro Top 300 Index (Buzzi Unicem, CRH, Holcim, 
Lafarge and Wienerberger), 4 North American businesses (Florida Rock, 
Martin Marietta, Vulcan and Cemex) and 3 Australian building materials 
companies (Boral, Rinker and James Hardie). The Committee removed 
Pilkington following takeover of this company. 
For the 2006 award, the TSR comparator group consists of 21 companies, 
including Hanson. These include 7 UK building materials companies in the 
FTSE 350 index (Hanson, Marshalls, Persimmon, Taylor Woodrow, Travis 
Perkins, Wimpey and Wolseley), 6 European building materials companies in 
the Euro Top 300 index (Buzzi Unicem, CRH, Holcim, Lafarge, Saint Gobain 
and Wienerberger), 5 North American businesses (Cemex, Centex, Florida 
Rock, Martin Marietta and Vulcan) and 3 Australian building materials 
companies (Boral, James Hardie and Rinker). 
There is no retesting of performance under any of the performance measures. 
The table below shows the conditional interests in shares of Executive 
Directors relating to awards made under the LTIP in 2003, 2004, 2005 and 
2006. For the conditional award made in 2003 to Executive Directors, 47%  
of the award subject to a TSR performance measure criteria and 65% of the 
award subject to an economic value added performance measure criteria 
vested following the end of the three year performance period. This resulted 
in a total vesting of 56% of the maximum number of shares under the 
conditional awards. 
For the conditional award made in 2004, it is anticipated that 30% of the 
award subject to a TSR performance measure, where Hanson’s TSR over  
the three year performance period more than doubled, and 100% of the 
award subject to an economic value added performance measure criteria  
will vest on March 1, 2007. This would result in a total vesting of 65%  
of the maximum number of shares under the conditional awards.

Notes 
1) The Directors elected to satisfy their liabilities to income tax and national insurance contributions, arising on the vesting of shares under the LTIP, out of the 
share award. A J Murray retained 92,156 shares and G Dransfield retained 34,132 shares. 
2) During the period January 1 to October 31, 2006 71,349 of the shares awarded under the 2003 Award vested to J C Nicholls on March 1, 2006. He also 
received a conditional award over 73,500 shares on May 2, 2006. Following his resignation, on October 31, 2006 his outstanding entitlements over 241,160 
shares held under the LTIP lapsed. 
3) S N Vivian, a former Executive Director of the Company, left on June 30, 2003. He retained certain entitlements to the conditional shares awarded to him under the 
LTIP prior to the date of him leaving. Under the 2003 Award, which vested on March 1, 2006 as detailed above, 27,444 shares vested to S N Vivian. 
4) The relevant market prices at the time of the conditional awards in 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006 were 290.4p, 439.6p, 514.3p and 751.7p, respectively. 
5) During the period January 1, 2007 to February 22, 2007 there was no change in the interests of Executive Directors in the LTIP. 
Conditional awards under the LTIP will usually be made annually and the maximum annual level of award is 200% of basic salary. 
Awards vesting under the LTIP are not pensionable. 
Share Option Plan 
Executive Directors and a selected number of senior executives from the Company’s worldwide operations during the period 2001-2005 participated in the 
Share Option Plan. Under this Plan, participants were granted options over a number of shares during the period 2001-2005 but the proportion of those shares 
under option which may be exercised is subject to the achievement of performance targets over a three year performance period set by the Committee. To the 
extent an option or part of an option becomes capable of being exercised at the end of the three year performance period it will ordinarily remain exercisable at 
any time up to 10 years from the date of grant. 
 
The economic value added and TSR performance targets for the conditional options granted to Executive Directors in the years ending December 31, 2002, 
2003, 2004 and 2005 were the same as for the awards made in 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005 to the Executive Directors under the LTIP, as detailed above,  
with no retesting. Consequently, for the grant made in 2004, it is anticipated that 65% of the number of shares under option will become exercisable following 
the end of the three-year performance period. Remuneration report

Notes 
1) Following the end of the three year performance period a total of 56% of the shares under the conditional options granted on March 1, 2003 became 
capable of being exercised. 
2) On September 1, 2006, J C Nicholls exercised options over 24,000, 17,325 and 71,349 shares at exercise prices of 473.3p, 461.75p and 290.4p per  
share, respectively. Following his resignation, on October 31, 2006 the outstanding options over 167,660 shares held by J C Nicholls under the Share 
Option Plan lapsed. 
3) S N Vivian, a former Executive Director of the Company, left Hanson on June 30, 2003. The option grants made to him and outstanding at the date of leaving 
remained subject to the performance criteria as outlined above. Following the end of the three year performance period 56% of the shares under the conditional 
options granted on March 1, 2003 became capable of being exercised. In respect of this grant, S N Vivian became entitled to an option over 27,444 shares at 
an exercise price of 290.4p per share. He exercised his option on September 28, 2006 and has no outstanding option entitlements remaining. 
4) During the period January 1, 2007 to February 22, 2007 there were no changes in the interests of Executive Directors in options under the Share Option Plan. 
No grants of options were made in 2006 and no further grants of options will be made under the Share Option Plan. 
Any gains made under the Share Option Plan are not pensionable. 
Sharesave Scheme 
Many Hanson employees in the UK have built up an equity interest in the Company through the UK HM Revenue & Customs approved savings related 
Sharesave Scheme where options may be granted at a discount of up to 20% to the market price at the date of grant. The term of options granted could  
be from three to seven years and any option is conditional on a commitment by the participant to make regular savings from pay. The savings are held by  
an independent Sharesave provider to buy shares at the end of the option period. The exercise of options under the Sharesave Scheme can be satisfied  
by the issue of new shares or the transfer of existing shares.  
At December 31, 2006, there were approximately 3,250 participants in the Sharesave Scheme and the number of shares under options granted to Executive 
Directors under the Sharesave Scheme are shown in the table below:

Service contracts 
The Executive Directors are all employed on rolling service contracts which are terminable at any time by Hanson on giving 52 weeks’ notice or by the Director 
giving 26 weeks’ notice. Termination payments are limited to the Director’s normal compensation, including basic salary, annual incentives and benefits, for the 
unexpired portion of the notice period. Pension entitlement will also accrue for the unexpired portion of the notice period. In the event that Hanson terminates  
a service contract without notice, the unexpired portion of the notice period will count towards the calculation of entitlements under the Company’s LTIP and 
Share Option Plan; these awards would still remain subject to their respective performance conditions. 
The Chairman and Non-executive Directors do not have service contracts with Hanson. Each is appointed at the will of the Company and the Chairman and 
Non-executive Director concerned under the terms of an appointment letter. The terms and conditions of employment of the Chairman and the Non-executive 
Directors are available on request from the Company Secretary. 
External appointments 
The Company acknowledges that its Executive Directors may be invited to become Non-executive Directors of other leading companies and that such Non-
executive duties can broaden experience and knowledge to the benefit of Hanson. Executive Directors are limited to one such Non-executive position and the 
policy is that fees may be retained. J C Nicholls was a Non-executive Director of Man Group plc during the period January 1 to July 20, 2006, in respect of 
which he received fees of £41,532. No other such positions are held by any of the other Executive Directors. 
Pensions  
The Executive Directors are members of a defined benefit plan (the “pension plan”) which, in accordance with HM Revenue & Customs (“HMRC”) limits, 
provides them with a maximum pension of two-thirds of basic salary on retirement. The pension plan is contributory until such time as the Director has completed 
the maximum pensionable service allowed under the pension plan. For service accruing after July 1, 2004 member contributions are 7.5% of pensionable salary 
(which does not include bonuses). The Executive Directors have a normal retirement age of 60, with the right to receive early retirement pensions to be paid from 
age 55 in certain circumstances. 
In preparation for the HMRC tax simplification changes for pensions, which became effective on April 6, 2006, the Committee reviewed the impact of the 
proposals on all employees, including the Executive Directors. The approach adopted, following recommendations from the independent advisor to the 
Committee, was for solutions which were essentially cost neutral to the Company with no compensation for changes in tax legislation. A contribution was made 
to the provision of independent financial advice for the affected individuals, including the Executive Directors. 
Under the new tax regime, each member now has a Lifetime Allowance (“LTA”) initially set at £1.5m and a new tax, called the recovery charge, is levied at 
retirement if the value of their pension benefit from all sources exceeds this amount. However, for any member whose total benefit on April 6, 2006 exceeded  
the LTA, transitional arrangements allowed them to register the higher value so that they would not be subject to a large retrospective recovery charge. 
To qualify for this enhanced protection the member was required to opt out of pension plan membership as regards future service accrual.  
A J Murray and G Dransfield elected to opt out of pension plan membership as regards future service accrual as a result of registering for enhanced protection 
with HMRC. An unfunded unapproved retirement benefit scheme (“UURBS”) has been arranged in respect of A J Murray to provide an accumulation of benefit 
no greater than a total pension promise of two-thirds of final pensionable salary. An appropriate provision has been made in respect of the UURBS which at 
December 31, 2006 was £237,000. As G Dransfield had already completed the maximum pensionable service allowed under the pension plan, no further 
arrangements were put in place for him. 
The following table gives details for each Executive Director in office during the year of: 
– the increase in the accrued pension attributable to service since December 31, 2005. 
– the increase in the accrued pension net of inflation attributable to service since December 31, 2005. 
– the annual accrued pension payable from normal retirement age, calculated as at December 31, 2006. 
– the transfer value of the increase of the accrued pension net of inflation and the Director’s contributions calculated in accordance with actuarial guidance  
note GN11. 
– the transfer value of the accrued pension at December 31, 2005, calculated in accordance with actuarial guidance note GN11. 
– the transfer value of the accrued pension at December 31, 2006, calculated in accordance with actuarial guidance note GN11. 
– the change in the transfer value over the year net of the Director’s contributions. It includes the effect of fluctuations in the transfer value due to factors 
beyond the control of Hanson and the Directors, such as market movements and improvements in longevity. 
These amounts exclude any benefits attributable to additional voluntary contributions.

Notes 
1) Prior to the HMRC tax simplification changes for pensions referred to above becoming effective on April 6, 2006, those Executive Directors and employees 
who joined the pension plan after May 1989 were subject to an earnings cap (£105,600 in 2005/2006) on HMRC approved pension plans. It was Hanson’s 
policy to provide executives with appropriate benefits outside of the pension plan in relation to that part of their salary which exceeded the cap. The contributions 
made during the year were subject to income tax as a benefit in kind and the Executive Director concerned (J C Nicholls, for whom a contribution of £77,785 
was made on April 1, 2006) was liable to settle the tax liability himself.  Remuneration report

Independent auditors’ report to the shareholders of Hanson PLC 
We have audited the group financial statements of Hanson PLC and 
subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2006 which comprise  
the consolidated income statement, the consolidated balance sheet, the 
consolidated cash flow statement, the consolidated statement of recognised 
income and expense and the related notes 1 to 31. These group financial 
statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. 
We have reported separately on the parent company financial statements  
of Hanson PLC for the year ended December 31, 2006 and on the 
information in the Directors’ Remuneration report that is described as  
having been audited.  
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work 
has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members 
those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for 
no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s 
members as a body for our audit work, for this report or for the opinions we 
have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors 
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the group financial statements in 
accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union are set out 
in the statement of Directors’ responsibilities.  
Our responsibility is to audit the group financial statements in accordance 
with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards  
on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the group financial statements 
give a true and fair view and whether the group financial statements have 
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also report to you whether in our opinion 
the information given in the Report of the Directors report is consistent with 
the financial statements. 
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, we have received all the 
information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information 
specified by law regarding Director’s remuneration and other transactions  
is not disclosed. 
We review whether the Corporate governance statement reflects the 
Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2003 Combined  
Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services 
Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required to consider 
whether the Board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, 
or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the group’s corporate governance 
procedures or its risk and control procedures. 
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and Form 20-F and 
consider whether it is consistent with the audited group financial statements. 
The other information comprises only the Report of the Directors, the 
Chairman’s statement, the Chief Executive’s Overview, A decade of delivery 
and beyond, the Operating and Financial Review and the Corporate 
governance statement. We consider the implications for our report if we 
become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies 
with the group financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any 
other information. 
Basis of audit opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit 
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and 
disclosures in the group financial statements. It also includes an assessment 
of the significant estimates and judgments made by the Directors in the 
preparation of the group financial statements, and of whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the group’s circumstances, consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed. 
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and 
explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with 
sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the group financial 
statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or 
other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall 
adequacy of the presentation of information in the group financial statements. 
Opinion 
In our opinion: 
– the group financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with 
IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, of the state of the group’s affairs 
at December 31, 2006 and of its profit for the year then ended; 
– the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance 
with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation; and 
– the information given in the Directors’ report is consistent with the group 
financial statements.

Report of independent registered public accounting firm  
To the Board of Directors and shareholders of Hanson PLC 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Hanson 
PLC and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related 
consolidated income statements, consolidated cash flow statements and 
consolidated statements of recognised income and expense for each of  
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006. These financial 
statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our 
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based  
on our audits. 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public 
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards 
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  
An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the 
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes 
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by 
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. 
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present 
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Hanson 
PLC and subsidiaries at December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the consolidated 
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the 
period ended December 31, 2006, in conformity with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union which differ in 
certain respects from accounting principles generally accepted in the United 
States of America (see note 32 of the Notes to the accounts). 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public 
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness  
of Hanson PLC’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 
2006, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework 
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway 
Commission, and our report dated February 22, 2007 expressed an 
unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of independent registered public accounting firm  
To the Board of Directors and shareholders of Hanson PLC 
We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying 
Management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting  
on page 61, that Hanson PLC maintained effective internal control over 
financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established  
in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of 
Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). 
Hanson PLC’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal 
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness  
of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express  
an opinion on management’s assessment and on the effectiveness of the 
Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public 
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards 
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was 
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an 
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating 
management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating 
effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as  
we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit 
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed  
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting 
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s 
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and 
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable 
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the 
assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions 
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts 
and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with 
authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3)  
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection  
of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets  
that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting  
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation 
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may 
become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree  
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
In our opinion, management’s assessment that Hanson PLC maintained 
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006,  
is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in 
our opinion, Hanson PLC maintained, in all material respects, effective internal 
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on the 
COSO criteria. 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public 
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated 
balance sheets of Hanson PLC as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the 
related consolidated income statements, consolidated cash flow statements 
and consolidated statements of recognised income and expense for each of 
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006, and our report dated 
February 22, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

1 Accounting policies 
Basis of preparation 
From January 1, 2005, as required by the European Union’s IAS Regulation, 
the group has prepared its Annual Report and Form 20-F in accordance  
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by 
the European Union (EU) and in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 1985. IFRS as adopted by the EU differ in certain respects 
from IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). 
However, the consolidated financial statements for the periods presented 
would be no different had the Company applied IFRS as issued by the IASB. 
References to IFRS hereafter should be construed as references to IFRS as 
adopted by the EU. 
IFRS differs in certain respects from US generally accepted accounting 
principles, a reconciliation to which is included in note 32 of the Notes to the 
accounts. A summary of the group’s key accounting policies is set out below. 
The financial statements have been prepared using the historical cost 
convention except where the measurements of balances at fair value  
is required as explained below. 
Basis of consolidation 
The accounting reference date of the Company is December 31. The 
consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the 
Company and its subsidiaries together with the group’s share of the results  
of joint-ventures and associates using the equity method of accounting. 
Within the income statement, the group’s share of results of joint-ventures 
and associates is stated after interest and taxation. 
Use of estimates 
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make 
estimates and assumptions. These affect the reported amounts of assets and 
liabilities; the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the 
financial statements; and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
during the reporting period.  
Turnover 
Turnover is recognised by the group when the risks and rewards associated 
with the transaction have been transferred to the purchaser, which is 
demonstrated when all the following conditions are met: evidence of a  
binding arrangement exists (generally, purchase orders), products have been 
delivered or services have been rendered, there is no future performance 
required and amounts are collectable under normal payment terms. Turnover 
represents the net amounts charged or chargeable in respect of services 
rendered and products delivered, excluding inter company sales, value added 
tax and other sales taxes. Turnover is recognised net of any discounts given 
to the customer.  
Freight and distribution costs 
Freight and distribution costs incurred are included in the income statement 
as part of costs and overheads. Freight and distribution costs that are  
re-charged to customers are included in the income statement as part  
of turnover. 
Research, development and exploration expenditure 
Expenditure on development and improvement of new and existing products 
that do not meet the recognition criteria of an asset are expensed as incurred. 
Research costs are expensed as incurred. Where costs associated with the 
exploration for and evaluation of mineral reserves do not meet the recognition 
criteria of an asset, the expenditure is expensed as incurred. 
Advertising costs 
Expenditure on advertising is expensed in full in the period in which it  
is incurred. 
Share-based payments 
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees, for awards granted  
after November 7, 2002, is measured at fair value on the date of grant and  
is recognised as an expense over the vesting period. Fair value is determined  
by an external valuer using an appropriate pricing model. In valuing equity- 
settled transactions, no account is taken of any vesting conditions, other than 
conditions linked to the price of the shares of the Company (market conditions). 
For awards evaluated on non-market conditions or with no performance 
criteria, an expense is ultimately only recognised for awards which vest. 
Where an award is dependent upon a market condition, the cost of the award 
is recognised irrespective of whether the award vests unless the employee 
leaves during the vesting period. At each balance sheet date, the cumulative 
expense is calculated representing the extent to which the vesting period has 
expired and management’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments 
that will ultimately vest. The movement in cumulative expense since the 
previous balance sheet date is recognised in the income statement, with  
a corresponding entry in equity.  
The cost of cash-settled transactions is measured at fair value using a 
binomial model. During the vesting period, a liability is recognised based on 
the portion of the vesting period expired at the balance sheet date. From the 
end of the vesting period until settlement, the liability represents the full fair 
value of the award as at the balance sheet date.  
Intangible assets 
Goodwill arising on acquisitions completed prior to January 1, 1998 was 
written off directly to reserves. From January 1, 1998 to December 31, 2003, 
all acquired goodwill was capitalised and amortised over a period not 
exceeding 20 years. On transition to IFRS, on January 1, 2004, the carrying 
value of goodwill relating to acquisitions was taken as its deemed cost at that 
date. Since that date under IFRS, goodwill is capitalised and is not amortised 
but is reviewed annually for impairment. 
Intangible assets other than goodwill, which are capable of being recognised 
separately and measured reliably on acquisition of a business, are capitalised 
at fair value on acquisition. Expenditure on computer software which is 
deemed not to be integral to the computer hardware is capitalised at cost. 
The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as either finite or indefinite. 
Intangible assets with a finite life are amortised on a straight line basis over 
their useful lives. Intangible assets with an indefinite life are not amortised but 
reviewed annually for impairment. 
Business combinations 
The results of businesses acquired are dealt with in the consolidated 
accounts from the date of acquisition. Upon the acquisition of a business, the 
fair values that reflect their condition at the date of acquisition are attributed 
to the identifiable assets (including separately identifiable intangible assets) 
acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed. Adjustments are 
also made to bring the accounting policies of businesses acquired into 
alignment with those of the group. Where the consideration paid for a 
business exceeds the fair value of net assets acquired and liabilities and 
contingent liabilities assumed, the difference is treated as goodwill.  
Property, plant and equipment (including mineral reserves) 
Property, plant and equipment is shown at cost less depreciation, depletion 
and any impairments. The cost of property, plant and equipment comprises its 
purchase price and any costs directly attributable to bringing it into working 
condition for its intended use. Costs to develop new commercial aggregates 
deposits and for major development programmes at existing sites are 
capitalised and amortised over the life of the quarry. Repair and maintenance 
costs are charged to costs and overheads as incurred. Finance costs relating 
to the purchase of property, plant and equipment are not capitalised but are 
expensed as incurred. Exchanges of assets are measured at fair value of the 
asset given up unless the exchange transaction lacks commercial substance. 
No depreciation is provided on freehold land except for mineral reserves 
which are depleted on the basis of tonnage extracted. Depreciation of other 
property, plant and equipment is calculated to write off their cost over their 
expected useful lives allowing for estimated residual value. The majority of 
property, plant and equipment is written off on a straight line basis over the 
following periods: 
Plant and equipment 2-30 years 
Land, buildings and natural resources up to 50 years  Notes to the accounts

1 Accounting policies continued 
Assets held under leases 
Assets held under finance leases are included within property, plant and 
equipment at the capitalised value of the future minimum lease payments and 
are depreciated over the shorter of their lease period and their useful life. The 
capital element of the future payments is treated as a liability and the interest 
element is charged to the income statement so as to reflect a constant annual 
rate of interest on the remaining balance of the outstanding obligation. 
Rentals paid on operating leases are charged to the income statement on  
a straight line basis over the shorter of the lease period and the useful life  
of the leased asset. 
The group determines whether an arrangement contains a lease by assessing 
whether the fulfilment of a transaction is dependent on the use of a specific 
asset and whether the transaction conveys the right to use that asset to Hanson 
in return for payment. Where this occurs, the arrangement is deemed to include 
a lease and is accounted for as such. 
Asset impairment 
Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are reviewed, at least 
annually, to ensure that assets are not carried above their recoverable 
amounts. Where some indication of impairment exists, detailed calculations 
are made of the discounted cash flows resulting from continued use of the 
assets (value in use) or from their disposal (fair value less costs to sell). 
Where these values are less than the carrying amount of the assets, an 
impairment loss is charged to the income statement. 
Investments in joint-ventures and associates 
The group’s investments in its joint-ventures and associates are accounted  
for under the equity method of accounting. 
Under the equity method, the investment in the joint-venture or associate  
is carried in the balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the 
group’s share of net assets of the joint-venture or associate. Goodwill relating 
to a joint-venture or associate is included in the carrying amount of the 
investment and is not amortised. After application of the equity method,  
the group determines whether it is necessary to recognise any additional 
impairment loss with respect to the group’s net investment in the joint-venture 
or associate. The income statement amount reflects the share of the results, 
after interest and tax, of operations of the joint-ventures and associates. 
Where there has been a change recognised directly in the equity of the  
joint-venture or associate, the group recognises its share of any change  
and discloses this in the reconciliation of changes in total equity, and where 
appropriate, in the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense. 
Inventories and receivables 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value, on a first 
in first out basis. Cost includes raw materials, direct labour and expenses, and 
an appropriate proportion of production and other overheads. Full provision  
is made against slow moving inventories based on historical experience and 
current market conditions. Receivables are stated after deducting a provision 
for doubtful debts. 
Government grants 
Grants received from governments for the acquisition of assets are 
recognised only when there is reasonable assurance that they will be received 
and any conditions attached to them have been fulfilled. The grant is held  
on the balance sheet within accrued income and released to the income 
statement over the periods necessary to match the related depreciation 
charges or other expenses of the asset as they are incurred.  
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and current balances with 
banks and other similar institutions, which are readily convertible into known 
cash amounts and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value 
and have a maturity of three months or less at the date of inception. For the 
purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consists  
of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of bank overdrafts. 
Derivatives, financial instruments, interest bearing loans and borrowings  
Derivative financial instruments are used to manage the financial risks arising 
from the business activities of the group and the financing of those activities. 
Derivative financial instruments are not held for trading purposes. Derivative 
financial instruments are used for managing financial risks as follows: 
– Forward exchange contracts are used as balance sheet hedging 
instruments to hedge foreign currency net assets held overseas and 
to hedge highly probable future foreign currency cash flows. 
– Interest rate swaps are used to hedge the group’s exposure to movements 
in interest rates. 
– Commodity swaps are used to hedge against the group’s exposure  
to changes in energy prices. 
Under IAS 39, derivative financial instruments are always measured at fair 
value, with hedge accounting employed in respect of those derivatives 
fulfilling the stringent requirements for hedge accounting as prescribed  
under the standard. In summary, these criteria relate to initial designation  
and documentation of the hedge relationship, prospective testing of the 
relationship to demonstrate the expectation that the hedge will be highly 
effective throughout its life, and subsequent retrospective testing of the 
hedge to verify effectiveness. The accounting treatment for the group’s hedge 
relationships are described by class below. Hedge effectiveness is reviewed 
regularly. If a hedge becomes ineffective, hedge accounting ceases to apply 
and subsequent changes in fair values of the derivative are recognised in the 
income statement.  
Fair value hedges 
The group uses interest rate swaps to hedge the group’s exposure to 
changes in the fair value of fixed rate debt as a result of interest rate 
movements. The carrying amount of the hedged item is adjusted for gains and 
losses attributable to the risk being hedged. For effective hedges, changes in 
the fair values of both the hedge and the portion of the hedged item covered 
by the hedge are recognised in the income statement. If a hedge becomes 
ineffective, the hedged item ceases to be remeasured with subsequent 
changes in fair value. Instead, the portion of its carrying value relating to 
previous changes in fair value is amortised over its remaining life. 
Cash flow hedges 
The group uses interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to floating rate  
debt, foreign exchange contracts as cash flow hedges to manage its 
exposure to currency fluctuations on its future cash flows and commodity 
swaps to manage its exposure to fluctuations in energy prices. For effective 
cash flow hedges changes in the fair value of the hedge are recognised in 
equity, they are recycled through the income statement in the same period 
during which the hedged item impacts the income statement. For hedges  
that become ineffective the amount previously recognised in equity is recycled  
to the income statement. Where the underlying hedged item is no longer 
expected to occur, this recycling is effected immediately. If the underlying 
hedged item is still expected to occur then the recycling from equity happens 
when the forecast transaction occurs.  
Net investment hedges 
Currency borrowings and forward exchange contracts are used as balance 
sheet hedging instruments to hedge foreign currency net assets held 
overseas. Forward exchange contracts are initially valued at the forward 
element of the contract and any subsequent movement in its valuation is 
recognised directly in the income statement. The spot element forms the net 
investment hedge relationship, and any movement in its valuation, so long as 
the relationship is effective, is recognised in equity. If the hedge becomes 
ineffective, movements in the valuation of the spot element are recognised 
directly in the income statement. On disposal of a foreign currency investment, 
the cumulative gains and losses are recycled from equity to the extent that 
they related to hedges of the investment being disposed.  
Provisions 
General 
Provisions for non-current obligations are discounted using a pre-tax rate  
that reflects current market assessments. The unwinding of the discount  
on provisions is included within finance costs along with the effect on the 
provision of changes in the discount rate. 
Asset retirement obligations 
A provision is recognised for the present value of estimated asset retirement 
costs in the period in which the obligation arises. The estimated future cost  
is reassessed over the life of the underlying tangible asset. An asset 
representing the future cost of dismantling facilities, where the group has a 
legal or constructive obligation, is recorded and depreciated over its useful 
life. Changes in the timing or amount of the estimated cost of the obligation 
are added or deducted to the cost of the related tangible asset. Other 
reclamation costs associated with the restoration of sites, following the 
extraction of aggregates and clay, are expensed as incurred. 
Provisions are classified as current when they are expected to be settled 
within 12 months of the balance sheet date. 
Pensions and other post-employment benefits 
The group’s current and past service cost for defined benefit schemes 
is charged to operating profit. Interest on the defined benefit schemes’ 
obligations and the expected return on the schemes’ assets are recognised in 
net finance costs. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised directly in equity 
through the statement of recognised income and expense so that the group’s 
balance sheet reflects the fair value of the schemes’ surpluses or deficits as 
at the balance sheet date.  Hanson 2006 www.hanson.biz
Notes to the accounts for the 12 months ended December 31, 2006

1 Accounting policies continued 
Contributions to defined contribution schemes are charged to operating  
profit as they become payable. Multi-employer schemes are accounted for as 
defined contribution schemes, where the group is unable to obtain adequate 
information regarding its share of the schemes’ assets and liabilities to 
account for these as defined benefit schemes. 
Taxation 
The tax charge represents the sum of the current tax charge and the 
movement in deferred tax recognised in the income statement. The current tax 
charge is based on taxable profit for the period, and prior period adjustments. 
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the consolidated income 
statement because items of income or expense can be taxable or deductible 
in other years and it further excludes items that are not taxable or deductible. 
Except as noted below, deferred tax is provided, using the liability method,  
on all temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the carrying 
value of assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and their tax 
bases. The amount of deferred tax reflects the expected recoverable or 
payable amount and is based on the expected manner of realisation or 
settlement of the asset or liability.  
Deferred tax is not provided to the extent that the temporary differences 
arise from: 
– the initial recognition of goodwill; 
–  the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a 
business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither 
accounting nor taxable profit or loss; 
–  temporary differences in respect of the unremitted earnings of subsidiaries, 
joint-ventures and associates where the parent is able to control the timing 
of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the 
temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
A deferred tax asset is recognised for all deductible temporary differences, 
carry-forward of unused tax losses and unused tax credits to the extent 
it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the 
deductible temporary differences, unused tax losses and unused tax credits 
can be utilised. 
Deferred tax asset and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes 
levied by the same taxation authority and the group intends to settle its 
current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured, on an undiscounted basis,  
at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is 
realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. The carrying 
amount of deferred tax assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date. 
Income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised 
in equity and not in the income statement.  
Own shares 
Own equity instruments which are reacquired (treasury shares and ESOP 
shares) are deducted from equity at the acquisition cost including transaction 
costs. ESOP shares are used to satisfy the Company’s share based payment 
awards. No gain or loss is recognised in the income statement on the purchase, 
sale, issue or cancellation of the Company’s own equity instruments. 
Foreign currencies 
Cumulative average rates of exchange ruling during the year have been used 
to translate the income statements of overseas subsidiaries, joint-ventures 
and associates from their functional currency. Transactions which do not  
take place in an entity’s functional currency are converted at the spot rate. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are 
retranslated from their functional currency at balance sheet exchange rates. 
The balance sheets of overseas subsidiaries, joint-ventures and associates 
are translated at rates ruling at the balance sheet date from their functional 
currency. Differences on translation arising from changes in the sterling value 
of overseas net assets, related foreign currency loans, foreign exchange 
contracts and currency swaps at the beginning of the financial accounting 
year, or at the date of any later capital currency conversions, together with  
the differences between income statements translated at average rates  
and at balance sheet rates, are shown as a movement on reserves and  
in the statement of recognised income and expense. Other exchange  
rate differences are dealt with in the income statement for the year. 
Dividends 
Dividends attributable to the equity holders of the Company declared during 
the year are recognised directly in equity. Interim dividends are recognised 
when paid. 
New IFRS standards and interpretations adopted during 2006 
In 2006, the following standards became effective and were adopted by  
the group: 
– IFRS 6 Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Assets  
– IFRS 6 Amendment relating to IFRS 6 
– IAS 21 Amendments to IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign 
Exchange Rates – Net Investment in a Foreign Operation 
– IAS 39 Amendment to IAS 39 – Fair Value Option 
– IAS 39 Amendment to IAS 39 – Cash Flow Hedge Accounting 
– IAS 39 Amendment to IAS 39 and IFRS 4 – Financial Guarantee Contracts 
– IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease 
– IFRIC 5 Rights to Interests Arising from Decommissioning, Restoration and 
Environmental Rehabilitation Funds 
– IFRIC 6 Liabilities arising from participating in a Specific Market – Waste 
Electrical and Electronic Equipment 
The adoption of these standards has not had a significant impact on the 
results of the group in 2006. 
New IFRS standards and interpretations not adopted 
The IASB and IFRIC have issued additional standards and interpretations 
which are effective for periods starting after the date of these financial 
statements. The following standards and interpretations have yet to be 
adopted by the group, all of which are effective January 1, 2007 with the 
exception of IFRIC 12 Service Concession Agreements which is effective 
January 1, 2008 and IFRS 8 Operating Segments which is effective  
January 1, 2009: 
– IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosure 
– IFRS 8 Operating Segments 
– IAS 1 Amendment to IAS 1 – Presentation of Financial Statements:  
Capital Disclosures 
– IFRIC 7 Applying IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary 
Economies for the First Time 
– IFRIC 8 Scope of IFRS 2 
– IFRIC 9 Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives 
– IFRIC 10 Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment 
– IFRIC 11 IFRS 2 – Group and Treasury Share Transactions 
– IFRIC 12 Service Concession Agreements 
The group does not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and 
interpretations will have a material effect on its financial statements on initial 
adoption. Upon adoption of IFRS 7, the group will be required to disclose 
additional information about its financial instruments, their significance and the 
nature and extent of the risks to which they give rise, together with greater 
detail as to the fair value of its financial instruments and its risk exposure. 
There will be no effect on reported income or net assets. Apart from IFRS 7 
and the IAS 1 Amendment, all the new standards and interpretations 
identified have yet to be adopted by the EU and the group assumes they  
will be adopted in their current form, in line with the published timetable.

2 Segmental analysis 
The group’s primary segments are the trading operations of North America, UK, Australia, Asia Pacific and Continental Europe. These operations are organised 
and managed separately according to the geographic location of their assets and economic environment. There are no significant transactions occurring 
between the primary segments. 
There are two secondary business segments, Aggregates and Building Products. The major products for each secondary segment, which differ slightly between 
countries, are as follows: 
Aggregates – crushed rock and sand and gravel, asphalt, cement and ready-mixed concrete. 
Building products – bricks, concrete pipe and products, concrete flooring, precast concrete and roofing tiles. 
Hanson’s business operations, as shown below, are managed using a combination of primary and secondary structures in eight distinct segments, including the 
corporate office and related costs that are described as Central.  
The group’s primary segmental performance measure is ‘Operating profit before impairments’.

5 Share-based payments 
Included within wages and salaries in note 4 is an expense arising from share-based payment transactions of £11.7m (£7.6m, £4.9m) all of which relates to 
equity-settled share-based payments. Details of each of the employee share plans in place are given below and where applicable in the Remuneration report. 
Long Term Incentive Plan 
The group operates a Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) under which awards of shares are made, on a conditional basis, subject to performance measurements 
over a three year period. The vesting of 50% of each award is dependent on total shareholder return (TSR) achieved by Hanson, measured by reference to a 
comparator group of companies. As relative TSR is defined as a market condition, a Monte Carlo simulation model has been applied. Further details in relation  
to the TSR measurement are provided in the Remuneration report. The remaining 50% of each award is dependent on non-market conditions and has therefore 
been valued using a Black-Scholes model. For the 2006 award, 25% is dependent on cash flow growth performance and 25% is dependent on earnings per 
share growth performance, whereas previous awards are dependent on an economic value added measure as the non-market condition. Awards are equity 
settled and where the performance measurement targets are attained in part or in full, vested shares are distributed to LTIP participants as soon as practicable 
after the end of the performance period. 
The expense recognised in the income statement in the year from the LTIP is £9.9m (£6.1m, £4.1m). Conditional awards were made over 2,387,057 ordinary 
shares on May 2, 2006 which will vest, subject to the performance measurement targets being attained, on May 2, 2009. The weighted average fair value of 
each share award granted is £5.01 (£3.45, £3.01). The fair value of total awards granted during the year is £12.0m (£10.8m, £10.9m). 
The following table illustrates the number of, and movements in, share awards during the year under the LTIP:

Share Option Plan 
The group also operates a discretionary Share Option Plan. No options were granted during 2006 and no further grants of options will be made under this plan, 
the last grant having been made in 2005. Under the plan participants were granted options over a number of shares subject to the achievement of performance 
targets over a three year performance period. 50% of the option grant is dependent on TSR performance measure and therefore valued using a Monte Carlo 
simulation model. The remaining 50% of the option grant is dependent on an economic value added measure which has been valued using a Black-Scholes 
model. Options which have vested will ordinarily remain exercisable at any time up to 10 years from the date of grant and are settled by the issuance of equity 
once exercised. 
The expense recognised in the income statement in the year from the Share Option Plan is £0.6m (£0.6m, £0.4m).  
The following table illustrates the number and weighted average exercise prices of, and movements in, shares under option during the year under the plan.

Sharesave Scheme 
The group also operates a UK HM Revenue & Customs approved savings related Sharesave Scheme available to all UK employees. Options are granted at  
a discount of up to 20% of the market price at the date of invitation to participate over three, five or seven year savings contracts and options are exercisable 
during the six month period following completion of the savings contract. Options are valued using a Black-Scholes model. 
During 2006, options were granted over 837,502 shares which will ordinarily be exercisable at an exercise price of 611.0p per share during the period; June 1 
to November 30, 2009 for the three year savings contract; June 1 to November 30, 2011 for the five year savings contract; and June 1 to November 30, 2013 
for the seven year savings contract. The weighted average fair value of each share under option granted is £1.81 (£1.34, £1.43). The expense recognised in  
the income statement in the year from the Sharesave Scheme is £1.2m (£0.9m, £0.4m). 
The following table illustrates the number and weighted average exercise prices of, and movements in, shares under option during the year in the Sharesave Scheme:

The weighted average share price during the year is 697.4p (544.0p, 412.0p).  
The expected volatility for Hanson has been calculated using historical data over a term commensurate with the expected life of each award/option.  
The expected volatility figures used in the valuations were calculated based on the following principles: 
– Historic weekly volatility over periods of increasing length ending on the date of each grant/award were determined. 
– The volatility figures above were used to calculate a weighted average volatility for the term commensurate with the expected term of the award/option  
being valued. 
Other Schemes 
Hanson also has an HM Revenue & Customs approved Executive Share Option Scheme. No further grants of options will be made under this scheme. Hanson 
also had Executive Share Option Schemes A and B which are now closed. The options granted under the Share Option Schemes A and B were deemed to  
be cash-settled and consequently grants that had not been settled by January 1, 2005 have been accounted for under IFRS 2. Options were granted with an 
exercise price equal to market value and remained exercisable at any time up to 10 years from the date of grant. No performance conditions applied to the right 
to exercise the options granted under either scheme. At December 31, 2006 there are no options outstanding under the Executive Share Option Schemes A 
and B and as a result the carrying amount of the liability relating to the cash-settled options at December 31, 2006 is £nil (£nil, £0.4m).  Hanson 2006 www.hanson.biz

Impairments during the year: 
An impairment charge of £4.1m resulting from two individual operating site closures has been recognised in Aggregates North America. An impairment charge 
of £0.2m resulted from the closure of three individual operating sites within Aggregates UK. The impairments have arisen due to the closure, or intended closure, 
of the sites and are based on the recoverable amount of the assets. Impairment charges totalling £0.2m against individual operating sites within Aggregates UK 
have been reversed, as proceeds from the sale of the sites exceeded their carrying values, net of the provision. The main class of assets affected by each of the 
impairment charges and reversals is property, plant and equipment. 
Impairments during 2005: 
A net impairment charge of £4.0m was recognised in 2005.   
An impairment charge of £16.5m was recognised against goodwill held in Aggregates North America Southwest region. The impairment, which reduced the 
goodwill’s carrying value to its value in use at discount rates provided below, resulted from a change in the economic circumstances of that operation. 
An impairment provision of £14.9m recorded against property, plant and equipment in years prior to 2005, in Aggregates North America West region, was 
reversed in 2005. The original charge resulted from significant uncertainty over the assets’ ability to generate future profitability, due to the lack of an economic 
supply of raw materials. The supply was secured in 2005, removing this uncertainty and improving the projected cash flows generated by these assets. 
An impairment charge of £5.3m was recognised in 2005 against goodwill and property, plant and equipment at various individual operating sites within 
Aggregates UK. These tangible assets are cash generating units for the purpose of measuring impairment, as they generate largely independent cash flows.  
The impairments arose due to the closure, or intended closure of the sites, on commercial grounds and were based on the recoverable amount of the assets. 
Impairment charges totalling £4.7m against individual operating sites within Aggregates UK were reversed, as anticipated proceeds from the sale of the site and 
business exceeded their carrying values, net of the provision. 
Property, plant and equipment of £1.2m located in Spain and goodwill amounting to £0.6m in the Czech Republic were impaired in 2005, as these assets were 
not expected to generate a value in use equal to their carrying value. Both of these cash generating units comprise a part of Continental Europe.  Notes to the accounts

Impairments during 2004: 
A net impairment charge of £29.3m was recognised in 2004. 
An impairment charge of £21.2m was recognised in 2004 against property, plant and equipment and other assets at various individual operating sites within 
Aggregates UK. These tangible assets are cash generating units for the purpose of measuring impairment, as they generate largely independent cash flows.  
The impairments have arisen due to the closure, or intended closure of the sites, on commercial grounds and are based on the recoverable amount of the assets. 
Impairment charges totalling £0.5m against individual operating sites within Aggregates UK have been reversed, as anticipated proceeds from the sale of the 
site and business exceeded their carrying values, net of the provision. 
Assets in Asia Pacific and Continental Europe of £4.9m and £3.7m were impaired in 2004, as these assets were not expected to generate a value in use  
equal to their carrying value.  The main classes of assets affected by the impairment charges were property plant and equipment and goodwill. 
Assumptions used for impairment testing: 
The recoverable amount for each cash generating unit is based on a value in use calculation using cash flow projections based on four year forecasts approved 
by the Board of Directors excluding the impact of anticipated acquisitions, business improvement capital expenditure and restructuring. Forecast replacement 
capital expenditure requirements are included within the first four years, after which capital expenditure is assumed to represent 100% of depreciation. 
Subsequent cash flows beyond the initial four year forecast for all cash generating units are inflated by rates of 1.5% to 4.0% (0.7% to 4.9%, nil% to 4.0%) 
including the US 4.0% (4.0%, 4.0%), UK 3.0% (3.0%, 2.5%) and Australia 2.75% (2.5%, 2.5%). Cash flows have been discounted at rates between 7.0% and 
9.5% (7.5% and 9.5%, 8.0% and 10.0%) including the US 7.8% (8%, 8.5%), UK 7.8% (8.5%, 8.5%) and Australia 9.0% (9.5%, 9.5%). Post-tax discount rates 
have been applied to post-tax cash flows. The use of these rates results in recoverable values that are identical to the ones that would be obtained by using  
pre-tax rates and pre-tax cash flows, as required by IAS 36 “Impairment of assets”. 
The calculation of value in use is most sensitive to the following key assumptions: 
– Sales volumes 
– Average selling prices 
– Operating costs 
The sales volume assumptions are influenced by several factors including, end use market and demand drivers, our competitive position, quality of product and 
service, distribution and product selling price. Historical sales volumes are used as the base. These are either increased or decreased over the forecast period 
using assumptions derived from past experience or consistent with external sources of information. Average selling price assumptions are influenced by several 
factors including end use market and demand drivers, our competitive position, site tenure, quality of product and service, distribution and product selling price. 
Historical average selling prices are used as the base. These are either increased or decreased over the forecast period using assumptions derived from past 
experience. Operating cost assumptions are influenced by several factors including availability of product and service, supply and demand, scarcity of availability, 
and age and quality of plant and equipment. Historical operating costs are used as the base. These are either increased or decreased over the forecast period 
using assumptions derived from past experience. 
Given the excess of value in use over the carrying amount for each cash generating unit, and the absence of any reasonably possible change in the key 
assumptions applied, the additional disclosures in IAS 36 “Impairment of assets” regarding the sensitivity of the value in use calculations are not warranted. 
The principal risks and uncertainties of the business are disclosed in more detail on pages 52 to 54 of this document. Where business segments include closed 
sites or sites that are to be closed, the anticipated proceeds less costs to sell have been used. Goodwill is analysed by segment in note 2(e).

9 Discontinued operations 
During 2006, the operations of Seagoe, a drainage business based in Northern Ireland, were sold for £3.8m (net of disposal costs) on January 31. At December 
31, 2005, this operation was classified as held for sale. 
During 2005, Aggregates North America sold its 50% interest in the joint-venture Campbell Concrete and Materials, a ready-mixed concrete and aggregates 
business operating in Houston, Texas, on June 17 for £31.0m; and Continental Europe disposed of 19 ready-mixed concrete sites on May 13 for £14.0m, 
following restructuring of its Spanish operations.  
During 2004, Building Products UK sold its drainage business on May 14; Aggregates UK sold the Portland Stone operations on December 22 and the Pinden 
operations on December 24; and Asia Pacific sold its Thailand operations on July 19.  
Note 9(a) below analyses the profit after tax of £nil earned during the year by the operations discontinued in 2006. The profit of £2.8m in 2005 represents the 
net profit after tax incurred during 2005 by operations discontinued in 2006 and 2005. The loss of £16.4m in 2004 represents the net loss after tax incurred 
during 2004 by the operations discontinued in 2006, 2005 and 2004.

The final dividend of 15.35p recommended by the Board is payable on May 4, 2007, subject to shareholder approval, to those ordinary shareholders on the 
register at the close of business on April 10, 2007. The Investor information section of the Annual Report contains details of Hanson’s dividend policy and 
reinvestment programme. 
11 Earnings per ordinary share 
The basic earnings per ordinary share of 56.0p (53.2p, 36.0p) is calculated by taking the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company of £400.4m 
(£387.3m, £264.3m) and dividing by the weighted average of ordinary shares in issue during the year, after deducting shares held in employee trusts or  
as treasury shares, of 715,285,833 (728,300,283; 734,257,732). The basic earnings per ordinary share of continuing operations of 55.9p (54.2p, 43.6p)  
is calculated on earnings of £400.0m (£394.6m, £320.3m) and using the same number of shares referred to above. Earnings per ordinary share is also 
calculated below, before impairments, as the Directors consider this as a useful indication of underlying performance. 
The diluted earnings per ordinary share of 55.3p (52.6p, 35.6p) is calculated by taking the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company as set out above 
and dividing by the basic number of shares adjusted for the notional vesting/exercise of outstanding long-term incentive awards and options, where these would 
be deemed to have a dilutive impact. The diluted number of shares at December 31, 2006 is 723,578,366 (735,664,121; 741,105,680). At December 31, 
2006 there are 787,281 (nil, nil) shares under option which are deemed to be anti-dilutive. 
The reconciliation from basic earnings per ordinary share to diluted earnings per ordinary share is given as follows:

Other intangible assets with a finite useful life are amortised on a straight line basis over a period of 1-28 years, and those that were acquired during the year 
have a weighted average amortisation period of 21 years (11 years). 
Other intangible assets with an indefinite useful life include brand names with a carrying value of £10.7m (£10.7m) within Building Products UK. Market 
research, using qualitative and quantitative methods, provides evidence that the brands will generate net cash inflows for the group for an indefinite period.

Asbestos 
Various of the Company’s US subsidiaries are defendants, typically with many other companies, in lawsuits filed in state and federal courts by claimants who 
allege that they have suffered bodily injury as a result of exposure to asbestos-containing products, the manufacture of which by such subsidiaries ceased, 
depending on the subsidiary involved, between 1973 and 1984, which was prior to the time that these subsidiaries became members of the group.  Hanson 2006 www.hanson.biz

The discounted pre-tax provision for the gross cost of asbestos is shown above. The related insurance asset is included within “Receivables” in note 17 and the 
deferred tax asset relating to asbestos payments is included within “Deferred tax” in note 22. 
Claimant numbers and costs during the year  
Information regarding the movement in asbestos claimants in the year and the cost of resolution in the year is provided below: 
 2006 2005 2004 
New claimants 6,350 10,350 18,700
Resolutions (30,100) (14,750) (7,150)
Outstanding claimants 107,600 131,350 135,750
Average gross cost of resolution ($) 1,811 2,929 8,294
Gross cost of resolution ($m) 54.5 43.2 59.3
Less insurance recoveries ($m) (3.4) (11.5) (46.5)
Net cost before tax ($m) 51.1 31.7 12.8
New claimants in 2006 were approximately 6,350 (10,350,18,700). At the end of 2006, outstanding claimants totalled approximately 107,600 (131,350, 
135,750). Of the 30,100(14,750, 7,150) claimants whose cases were resolved during 2006, over 90% were dismissed without payment. In the USA, claimants 
can file without illness or product identification. In the absence to date of federal reform, a number of states have introduced or are looking to introduce an 
unimpaired docket which will suspend claims until there is proven evidence of illness.  
The gross cost of resolving asbestos claims in 2006 was $54.5m ($43.2m, $59.3m) including legal fees of $25.4m ($26.3m, $27.4m). The net pre-tax cost of 
asbestos for the year after insurance was $51.1m ($31.7m, $12.8m), equivalent to a sterling cost of £16.9m after tax. 
The aggregate amounts paid in settlement and average settlement payments in any given period, together with related defence costs, have fluctuated widely and 
are expected to continue to fluctuate widely depending on the nature of the claims resolved (including the proportion of which that are mass claims), disease mix, 
number of other defendants and jurisdiction of claim. 
Each of the Company’s relevant US subsidiaries, together with its insurance carriers and outside counsel, review each asbestos claim that is pursued by 
claimants. In many cases claimants are unable to demonstrate that any injury they have suffered resulted from exposure to the subsidiary’s products, in which 
case their claim is generally dismissed without payment. In those cases where a compensatable disease, exposure to the subsidiary’s products and causation 
can be established by claimants, the subsidiary generally settles for amounts that reflect the type of disease, the seriousness of the injury, the age of the claimant, 
the particular jurisdiction of the claim and the number and solvency of the other defendants. 
The Company’s approach to accounting for the asbestos claims against its US subsidiaries is to provide for those costs of resolution which are both probable 
and reliably estimable. The costs of resolving possible claims are disclosed as contingent liabilities (refer note 26). At present, based on detailed analysis and 
the assumptions noted below, the provision for those costs which are both probable and reliably estimable equates to approximately eight years of gross cost, 
assuming an annual level of approximately $60m. Whilst further claims are likely to be resolved beyond this eight year period, the associated costs of resolution 
are not able to be reliably estimated and hence no provision has been made to cover these possible liabilities. 
Assumptions made in establishing the provision relate to the number, disease mix and location of future claimants, trends in dismissal rates, settlement and 
defence costs, resolution of all existing claimants, time scale of resolution of new claimants, the continued solvency of co-defendants and expected insurance 
recoveries. In light of the significant uncertainty associated with asbestos claims, there can be no guarantee that the assumptions used to estimate the provision 
for the cost of resolving asbestos claims will be an accurate prediction of the actual costs that may be incurred and as a result the provision will be subject to 
potential revision from time to time as additional information becomes available and to reflect any changes in trends. 
Gross cost provision 
The provision of $496.8m at January 1, 2006 was increased by $60.0m (the estimated gross cost for an additional year) and reduced by the gross cost incurred 
in 2006 of $54.5m, to give a closing provision at December 31, 2006 of $502.3m. This represents the estimated gross cost of asbestos for the next eight years, 
and is equivalent to $398.7m on a discounted basis, or £203.7m.

Insurance asset 
The insurance asset of $14.6m at January 1, 2006 was reduced by insurance utilisation during the year of $3.4m, on an undiscounted basis. 
Most of the US subsidiaries involved with asbestos claims have had agreements with their respective insurance carriers regarding the defence and settlement  
of asbestos claims, the terms of which varied for each such subsidiary. These insurance arrangements have resulted in the insurance companies having met 
substantially all of the amounts such subsidiaries have paid prior to 2006 in settlements and defence costs. In 2006, most of these costs were borne by  
the relevant subsidiaries. The amounts to be paid by the relevant subsidiaries in future years may vary, depending on litigation and negotiation with the 
relevant insurers.  
On February 13, 2006, Hanson announced that one of its US subsidiaries, responsible for approximately 20% of the group’s present asbestos costs, had 
reached a settlement with its insurers. The settlement is effective from January 1, 2006 and resolves a number of issues relating to historic insurance policies 
which provided insurance cover for a range of claims, including those relating to asbestos. Under the settlement, the subsidiary will pay the first $35.0m of its 
future asbestos costs, which the subsidiary estimates will be paid over approximately four years from January 1, 2006. Thereafter the subsidiary’s asbestos costs 
will be paid in full by the insurance carriers up to agreed limits. These limits have not been disclosed as they are subject to a confidentiality agreement between 
the subsidiary and the insurance carriers. These limits, assuming they are not utilised for non-asbestos claims, are expected to provide asbestos insurance  
cover for this subsidiary well beyond 2020. The receivable recognised as a result of this settlement increased the insurance asset by $58.5m, or £23.0m  
on a discounted basis. The closing insurance asset at December 31, 2006 is $89.7m, equivalent to £34.2m on a discounted basis as shown in note 17. 
Certain other US subsidiaries, not party to the recent settlement, continue to pursue litigation and negotiation to maximise the insurance cover available. 
Litigation proceedings are progressing in the state of California. 
Deferred tax asset 
The net cost of asbestos is deductible for US taxation at an estimated rate of 39%. At December 31, 2006, the deferred tax asset relating to the discounted 
asbestos provision, net of insurance, was £66.1m as shown in note 22. 
Income statement 
The net impact on the income statement, shown under discontinued items in note 9, was a profit of £1.1m after tax. This consists of a discounted charge after 
tax of £8.5m, as shown in the ‘Provided’ column of the above table, plus the net impact of the discount unwind and change in discount rate which was a charge 
of £4.4m after tax as shown in the ‘Discount’ column of the above table, less the new insurance of £14.0m. 
Cash flow 
The net cash flow impact, shown within net cash inflow from operating activities, was a net cash outflow of £16.9m shown in the ‘Utilised’ column of the  
above table. 
Risk factors 
Factors which could cause actual results to differ from these estimates include: (i) adverse trends in the ultimate number of claimants filing asbestos claims 
against the Company’s US subsidiaries; (ii) increases in the cost of resolving current and future asbestos claims as a result of adverse trends relating to 
settlement and/or defence costs, dismissal rates, and/or judgment amounts; (iii) increases or decreases in the amount of insurance available to cover asbestos 
claims; (iv) the emergence of new trends or legal theories that enlarge the number of potential claimants; (v) the impact of bankruptcies of other defendant 
companies whose share of liability may be imposed on the Company’s US subsidiaries under certain state liability laws; (vi) the unpredictable aspects of the  
US litigation process; (vii) adverse changes in the mix of asbestos-related diseases with respect to which asbestos claims are made against the Company’s  
US subsidiaries; and (viii) potential legislative changes. 
In light of such factors, the costs of the Company’s US subsidiaries involved in resolving asbestos claims may be materially different from current estimates and 
consequently might have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. However, assuming 
that current trends continue, the Company does not expect that such costs will have such a material adverse effect and, even assuming a material deterioration 
in current trends, on the evidence available to it, the Company does not expect that such claims would impact the ability of the Company to continue as a  
going concern. 
Koppers’ liabilities 
Koppers’ environmental obligations and related costs arise primarily from the US chemical and related operations formerly operated by Koppers Company Inc,  
a company acquired by Beazer PLC, which itself was acquired by the Company in 1991. Members of the Beazer group remain contractually and statutorily  
liable for certain environmental costs relating to these discontinued operations. During 1998 an agreement was signed under which, for a one-off premium and 
related transaction costs totalling $275.0m, insurance cover of $800.0m in perpetuity (after payment by members of the Beazer group of the first $100.0m  
of remediation costs arising since January 1, 1998) was provided by subsidiaries of two reinsurance companies, Centre Solutions and Swiss Re.  
At the end of 2006, $467.9m of the $800.0m insurance cover had been utilised. The estimate of future probable cost, discounted at 5.9% (5.3%, 5.1%),  
is shown as a provision of £104.9m at December 31, 2006. These costs are the responsibility of the insurers and hence a receivable of £104.9m is recorded  
at December 31, 2006 as shown in note 17. 
Based upon existing known circumstances, the Company considers that the remaining $332.1m of insurance cover is expected to meet the related future costs, 
recognising that the estimate of future probable costs could increase and new sites may arise to which the insurance cover does not apply. Factors which could 
cause such remediation costs to increase include (i) unknown adverse conditions arising at sites; (ii) third party claims in excess of estimates; (iii) changes to 
regulatory requirements; (iv) changes in remediation techniques; and (v) any other significant variations to assumptions made in support of these estimates. 
Other provisions 
Long-term provisions have been discounted at rates of up to 7.1% (6.25%). 
Reclamation obligations have been established to cover those situations where members of the group have either a legal or constructive obligation to carry out 
remedial works. Reclamation provisions are expected to be utilised over the life of the relevant site. Legal, insurance, environmental and other provisions relate  
to acquisitions, disposals and rationalisations both arising on acquisitions and provided for in current and prior years. Legal, insurance, environmental and other 
provisions are expected to be utilised on a reducing basis over the next five years, depending in each case on the nature of the underlying obligation. 
Where appropriate, reclamation and environmental provisions have been established after taking into account the opinions of suitably qualified and experienced 
consultants and after estimating the costs in line with current practice and standards.  Hanson 2006 www.hanson.biz

22 Tax payable/receivable and deferred tax 
a) Tax payable/receivable  
Current and non-current tax payable/receivable represents expected taxes payable/receivable for tax filings in respect of current and prior years that exceed 
payments made and received. It also includes provisions for potential adjustments by tax authorities with respect to tax filings. Examination of tax filings by tax 
authorities may last several years beyond the year of filing. 
 
At any given time, the group is undergoing tax audits in several tax jurisdictions and covering multiple years. The group has provisions for taxes that may become 
payable in future periods as a result of these tax audits. The group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether additional 
taxes will be due. Where the final outcome of these matters is different from the amounts provided, such differences will impact the tax provisions in the period  
in which such determination is made. Interest on tax liabilities is accrued for in the tax charge and is included in the provisions. The tax provisions are analysed  
at each balance sheet date and adjustments are made as events occur to warrant adjustments to the provisions. The provisions at December 31, 2006 were 
£99.3m (£112.8m, £126.9m). The decrease is due to revisions to the best reasonable estimate of the tax exposures, cash paid on certain audits and foreign 
exchange movements on non UK provisions.

Deferred tax 
i) Losses 
The group only recognises a deferred tax asset on losses where it expects to realise the benefit from those losses in the foreseeable future. The group has a 
significant amount of capital and non-trading losses. These can only be offset against certain types of income in particular legal entities, and no such income  
is currently envisaged.

Gross losses  999.8 656.7
Deferred tax at applicable tax rates  300.0 202.0
Less deferred tax recognised  (8.1) (15.2)
Unrecognised deferred tax  291.9 186.8
The increase in losses relates to losses generated from restructurings in the current year, as well as agreement of prior year losses with tax authorities. 
The losses have no expiry date. 
ii) Other temporary differences 
At December 31, 2006 the group has other deductible temporary differences of £16.8m (£20.8m) for which deferred tax assets of £5.1m (£6.4m) have not 
been recognised because it is not probable that future taxable income will be available against which the group can utilise the benefits. The deductible 
temporary differences do not expire under current tax legislation. 
iii)  Unrecognised tax base 
The group has deductible temporary differences for which no tax benefit has been recognised related to certain additional tax attributes of property, plant and 
equipment located in the UK and Australia. The amount of these deductible temporary differences at December 31, 2006 was £275.3m (£288.9m). These 
additional tax attributes have not been recognised because it is not probable that suitable profits will be available. There is no expiry date for these differences. 
iv) Overseas subsidiaries 
At December 31, 2006, the group has not provided deferred tax in relation to temporary differences on its overseas subsidiaries, joint-ventures or associates. 
Quantifying the temporary differences is not practical, however, based on current enacted law, and on the basis that the group can control the timing and 
realisation of these temporary differences, no material tax consequences are expected to arise.

Own shares 
On May 31, 1995 the group established an Employee Share Trust (the “Trust”) approved by shareholders on May 15, 1995. The Trust as at December 31, 
2006 held 0.2m (0.1m, 1.0m) shares in the Company at a book value of £1.5m (£0.5m, £4.0m). The Trust waived its rights to dividends payable during the year 
and to future dividends on its holding of shares. The cost of the Hanson Sharesave Scheme, where awards are granted at a discount to the market price of the 
Company’s shares, Share Option Plan and the Long Term Incentive Plan is charged to the income statement. During the year, the group contributed £14.2m 
(£6.0m, £nil) to the Trust. 
At December 31, 2006, 24,645,000 shares were held in treasury, none of which has the right to receive dividends. No shares were purchased by the Company 
to be held in treasury during the period January 1 to February 19, 2007. Pursuant to approval given by shareholders at the AGM held on April 26, 2006, as at 
December 31, 2006 the Company retains the authority to purchase a further 48,955,000 of its own shares up to the end of the AGM to be held on April 24, 
2007. Details of shares purchased during the year are shown below:

Cash flow hedge reserve 
Movements in the cash flow hedge reserve represent: 
– changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges;  
– the recycling of the above changes through the income statement (totalling £(0.2)m since January 1, 2006), offsetting therein the impact of the underlying 
hedged item; and  
– related deferred tax.  
 
The change in the fair value of derivatives in the cash flow hedge reserve in the period relates mainly to interest rate swaps with a maximum maturity date of 
2013 hedging floating rate debt and commodity swaps with a maximum maturity date of 2007 hedging fluctuations in energy prices. Underlying cash flows are 
therefore expected to occur until these dates.  Notes to the accounts

Cumulative translation reserve 
Included within the foreign exchange adjustments of £(107.9)m (£56.8m, £(12.1)m) is foreign exchange of £nil (£0.1m, £(0.3m)) recycled through the income 
statement on disposal of overseas operations. The reserve was set to £nil on transition to IFRS on January 1, 2004. 
Retained earnings 
Included within the retained earnings balance of £1,879.3m (£1,655.5m, £1,402.8m) is £45.3m (£37.6m, £(2.5)m) in respect of joint-ventures and associates 
of which profit after tax for the current year is £33.7m (£43.2m, £2.0m) and dividends are £27.3m (£32.9m, £19.9m). The undistributed earnings of joint-
ventures and associates are £45.3m (£38.9m, £18.0m). 
Other reserves 
Other reserves represent merger reserves on acquisition of Pioneer International Limited of £216.3m, and £756.1m created on the reduction of share capital 
through the Scheme of Arrangement under Section 425 of the Companies Act. 
25  Business combinations 
Total cash consideration on acquisitions including acquisition costs for 2006 was £558.0m (£342.9m). 
During 2006, Building Products UK acquired the share capital of Red Bank Manufacturing, a producer of terracotta and clay products, on January 10 and 
Building Products North America acquired the share capital of PaverModule Inc., a concrete paving manufacturer, on January 20 for a total consideration for 
these acquisitions of £60.6m. On March 2, Aggregates UK purchased the share capital of Civil and Marine (Holdings) Ltd, a leading producer of ground 
granulated blast furnace slag in the UK, with additional operations in the US and in the Czech Republic, for £248.1m. Aggregates North America completed  
its acquisition of the share capital of Material Service Corporation, a leading aggregate materials producer in the USA, on June 16 for £166.3m. The group 
completed a further five acquisitions of entities based in the UK, USA and Spain, along with seven assets acquisitions, primarily concrete plants and quarries,  
for a total consideration of £83.0m. All acquisitions of share capital included the transfer of the entire voting rights to the group. 
On January 4, 2005, Building Products UK acquired the share capital of UK brick manufacturer, Marshalls Clay Products, for £64.7m and of Thermalite, a 
market leader in aircrete blocks, on March 7 for £124.2m. On June 17, Aggregates North America acquired the share capital of Mission Valley Rock, Berkeley 
Ready Mix and Berkeley Asphalt, and Building Products North America acquired the assets of Sherman Pipe, a concrete pipe and precast concrete products 
business, for a total consideration of £108.0m. Other acquisitions made in the year consisted of three quarries in Southern Indiana by Aggregates North 
America in December, and a further six acquisitions totalling £46.0m.

Included in the goodwill arising on acquisitions are items that cannot be individually separated and reliably measured due to their nature. This includes market 
share, as well as new market and product entry, and synergy benefits. Of the total goodwill on current year acquisitions of £286.7m (£190.1m), £12.5m 
(£36.9m) is deductible for tax purposes. 
For the period since acquisition, turnover of £215.0m and operating profit before impairments of £47.9m in respect of the current year acquisitions is included 
within the income statement as continuing operations. If the acquisitions had taken place at the beginning of the financial year, the continuing operating profit 
before impairments of the group would have been £557.3m (£527.6m) and turnover from continuing operations would have been £4,215.1m (£4,048.9m). 
The preliminary allocation of the purchase consideration to net assets and liabilities will be reviewed based on additional information up to a year from the date  
of acquisition. The Directors do not anticipate that any net adjustments resulting from such reviews will have a material effect on the financial position or results 
of Hanson’s operations. In respect of acquisitions in 2005, there were no material subsequent amendments to the preliminary allocations made.

26 Contingent liabilities 
Litigation relating to certain discontinued operations 
Certain of the Company’s US subsidiaries, either directly or as a result of indemnity obligations, are the subject of claims or lawsuits both on an individual and 
class action basis for bodily injury or property damage, relating to products incorporating asbestos, coal by-products and chemicals, in particular for the wood 
treating industry. 
Asbestos 
The Company’s approach to accounting for the asbestos claims against its US subsidiaries is to provide for those costs of resolution which are both probable 
and reliably estimable (refer note 21). The costs of resolving possible claims are disclosed as contingent liabilities. At present, based on detailed analysis and 
the assumptions noted below, the provision for those costs which are both probable and reliably estimable equates to approximately eight years of gross cost, 
assuming an annual level of approximately $60m. Whilst further claims are likely to be resolved beyond this eight year period, the associated costs of resolution 
are not able to be reliably estimated and hence no provision has been made to cover these possible liabilities. 
Assumptions made in establishing the provision relate to the number, disease mix and location of future claimants, trends in dismissal rates, settlement and 
defence costs, resolution of all existing claimants, time scale of resolution of new claimants, the continued solvency of co-defendants and expected insurance 
recoveries. In light of the significant uncertainty associated with asbestos claims, there can be no guarantee that the assumptions used to estimate the provision 
for the cost of resolving asbestos claims will be an accurate prediction of the actual costs that may be incurred and as a result the provision will be subject to 
potential revision from time to time as additional information becomes available and to reflect any changes in trends. Factors which could cause actual results  
to differ from these estimates include: (i) adverse trends in the ultimate number of claimants filing asbestos claims against the Company’s US subsidiaries; (ii) 
increases in the cost of resolving current and future asbestos claims as a result of adverse trends relating to settlement and/or defence costs, dismissal rates, 
and/or judgement amounts; (iii) increases or decreases in the amount of insurance available to cover asbestos claims; (iv) the emergence of new trends or legal 
theories that enlarge the number of potential claimants; (v) the impact of bankruptcies of other defendant companies whose share of liability may be imposed on 
the Company’s US subsidiaries under certain state liability laws; (vi) the unpredictable aspects of the US litigation process; (vii) adverse changes in the mix of 
asbestos-related diseases with respect to which asbestos claims are made against the Company’s US subsidiaries; and (viii) potential legislative changes. 
In light of such factors, the costs of the Company’s US subsidiaries involved in resolving asbestos claims may be materially different from current estimates and 
consequently might have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. However, assuming that 
current trends continue, the Company does not expect that such costs will have such a material adverse effect and, even assuming a material deterioration in current 
trends, on the evidence available to it, the Company does not expect that such claims would impact the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. 
Details of asbestos claims against the Company’s US subsidiaries and the Company’s approach to provisioning (and the associated contingent liabilities) are 
detailed in note 21. At December 31, 2006, approximately 107,600 claimants were outstanding. The amounts of compensation formally claimed in the cases 
initially filed by these claimants vary but typically follow standard formulations that are used in various jurisdictions by various plaintiffs’ law firms. Of the claimants 
outstanding as of December 31, 2006, Hanson estimates that approximately 36% do not specify a dollar claim for damages, approximately 57% claim an 
amount “greater than $10,000” and approximately 7% specify various amounts, typically “greater than” specified amounts between $50,000 and $1m. Hanson 
is not aware of any claim specifying an amount greater than $40m. Hanson does not believe that the specific dollar amount mentioned in any claim is an 
accurate gauge of what relief, if any, the claimant may eventually recover from one of Hanson’s US subsidiaries, and most claimants fail to allocate their alleged 
claims of liability amongst the various named defendants. 
Coal by-products and chemicals 
These claims and lawsuits relate primarily to former US chemical products and operations, in particular those relating to the wood treating and coal tar derivative 
industries; products and operations which are unrelated to the group’s present business and activities. In such cases where one of the Company’s subsidiaries 
is involved, there are often several potential defendants named in the claim or lawsuit. Since the final demerger in 1997 no settlements have been paid by, or 
judgments rendered against, any of the Company’s subsidiaries which have had or could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial 
condition, results of operations or cash flow in connection with any such claims or lawsuits. In a number of instances, the claim or lawsuit against the subsidiary 
has not been pursued and has been dismissed. With respect to those claims or lawsuits that have been or are being pursued, the subsidiary concerned 
generally believes itself to have had or to have meritorious defences and such claims and lawsuits have been and are being vigorously defended.  
The costs of defence and the amounts that are claimed by the plaintiffs, particularly in those lawsuits which involve numerous claimants, can be significant  
with claims amounting to tens of millions of dollars. The unpredictable aspects of the US litigation process and the potential for juries to award punitive damages 
mean that there is a possibility that the Company’s subsidiary may suffer at some stage a significant adverse verdict. Insurance issues do arise on these claims 
and lawsuits, both in terms of settlement and defence coverage, the outcome of which can be uncertain. In certain instances no insurance coverage may be 
available to the relevant subsidiary. The insurance cover referred to in note 21 relating to the Koppers’ environmental obligations does not apply to the bodily 
injury claims and lawsuits described in this note, although it will address certain of the property damage claims. The cost relating to these claims is shown in 
note 21. 
Other litigation 
Several of the Company’s US subsidiaries are subject to litigation in California courts arising out of sand dredging operations on submerged lands leased from 
the state of California. The litigation involves allegations that these subsidiaries underpaid royalties due under the leases and that sand was dredged from state 
owned lands without authorisation. The litigation includes claims by the state of California under California statutes providing for the recovery of treble damages 
and certain fines, penalties and attorney fees where the wrongful conduct involves false statements or conversion of state owned property. A press release by 
the California Attorney General states that he is seeking damages of $200m, although the complaint actually filed in court does not specify the amount of 
damages sought. The court’s decision on a declaratory motion regarding the interpretation of the royalty provisions of the relevant leases has not served to 
clarify the situation. The parties are now engaged in litigation on all matters arising out of the case. In light of the uncertainties involved in any litigation, no 
assurances or predictions can be made on the outcome of this litigation.  
Various subsidiaries of the Company are also the subject of a number of other pending legal proceedings. The Company does not anticipate that the outcome  
of these proceedings, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s consolidated financial condition, results of 
operations or cash flow. However, in light of the uncertainties involved in any litigation and in particular in the USA, where there is the added potential for punitive 
damage awards, there can be no guarantee that a settlement might have to be made by, or an unfavourable judgement may be rendered against, the Company 
or one of its subsidiaries, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flow in 
connection with the above mentioned non-asbestos claims and lawsuits.  Notes to the accounts

26 Contingent liabilities continued 
Demergers 
In connection with the demergers, each of the four companies into which the Company demerged its respective businesses agreed to indemnify  
the Company against, among other things, the past, present and future obligations and liabilities of the businesses transferred to it on its respective demerger 
while the Company agreed to indemnify each of these companies against, among other things, the past, present and future obligations and liabilities of all other 
businesses owned or previously owned by the Company (including the businesses transferred to the other demerged companies). Neither the Company nor any 
of its existing subsidiaries has incurred any liability in respect of a claim that related to the above-mentioned businesses demerged by the Company, any such 
liability being borne by the relevant demerged company without liability to the Company or any of its existing subsidiaries. The Energy Group PLC, one of the 
demerged companies, was acquired by TXU Corp. in 1998. In November 2002, TXU Corp. announced that several of TXU Corp’s UK subsidiaries had been 
placed under the administration process in the UK, including The Energy Group PLC. The Energy Group PLC itself is therefore unlikely to be able to fulfil its 
indemnification obligations to the Company and its existing subsidiaries if and when required. The Company is, however, not aware of any claims against it  
or its subsidiaries that would give rise to an indemnity obligation owed to the Company or its subsidiaries, on the part of The Energy Group PLC. 
Bonds and guarantees 
As at December 31, 2006 the group had contingent liabilities of: 
– £127.1m (£111.7m, £97.8m) in respect of bank guarantees and performance bonds given to third parties primarily relating to environmental and restoration 
obligations and the deductible element of insurance programmes, of which £0.2m (£0.2m, £0.2m) relates to former trading activities of the group; and 
– £121.1m (£99.7m, £81.6m) in respect of surety bonds issued by US insurance companies in respect of reclamation liabilities of £50.2m (£51.6m, £42.1m), 
performance bonds of £49.9m (£38.0m, £31.2m) and other surety obligations of £21.0m (£10.1m, £8.3m). 
Whilst the group holds provisions (see note 21) for certain liabilities to which the bonds and guarantees relate, the liabilities under the bonds and guarantees are 
not directly recorded on the consolidated balance sheet.

28 Pensions and other post-employment medical plans 
i) Description of plans 
Hanson provides pension and post-employment medical plans in a number of countries in which it operates in accordance with local employment practices. 
These arrangements have been subject to change in recent years and, with the exception of some arrangements covered under collective bargaining 
agreements in the US, new employees are no longer eligible for inclusion in either defined benefit pension plans (“DB plans”) or post-employment medical plans. 
The liabilities of the group’s DB plans primarily relate to pensioners currently in receipt of benefits, ex-employees with accrued rights to receive pensions in 
future and current employees who were members of DB plans before the relevant cut-off date, being July 2002 in the UK and July 2005 in the USA. The group 
follows a policy of funding DB plans to a target of the accrued benefit obligation, a level which is higher than the statutory minimum funding level in each country. 
Together with plan trustees, the group has a long term goal of matching the liabilities of the plans with appropriate assets. 
The liabilities of the group’s post-employment medical plans are primarily in the USA and Canada. These comprise a number of separate arrangements which 
have been closed to new entrants over time such that the substantial part of the liabilities relates to retirees. Post-employment medical liabilities are unfunded 
and are held as a balance sheet provision. 
Where pension benefits are provided to new employees of the group, they are eligible to join defined contribution pension plans (“DC plans”). The group 
contribution to such plans is generally related to the employee contribution and ranges from 5-10% in the UK and 3-6% in the USA, in each case as a 
proportion of pensionable salary. 
The group also participates in multi-employer pension plans, primarily in the USA. These provide defined benefits to certain of the group’s union employees. 
Multi-employer pension plans are accounted for as DC plans as it is not possible to isolate the components of such plans which would collectively comprise  
the group’s liability.   Hanson 2006 www.hanson.biz

28 Pensions and other post-employment medical plans continued 
ii) Details of cash contributions  
Contributions by the group to its pension plans totalled £73.9m (£59.1m, £57.8m) in the year, principally in the UK, USA and Canada. This is represented by 
regular contributions of £30.3m (£31.1m, £38.0m) and additional contributions of £22.4m (£12.1m, £8.4m) to DB pension plans; contributions to DC plans  
of £15.5m (£12.1m, £7.6m); and contributions to multi-employer plans of £5.7m (£3.8m, £3.8m). In addition to the ongoing regular contributions, group 
companies are scheduled to make additional payments to the principal UK DB plan of £8.4m in each of the next two years. No conclusion has currently been 
reached on the level of contributions to other plans although, overall, the group expects to maintain its regular contributions at broadly the same level in 2007. 
Contributions relating to multi-employer plans are based on negotiated collective bargaining agreements. The surpluses and deficits in the multi-employer plans 
are not considered to have a material impact on the Company. Benefits paid by the group in respect of its post-employment medical plans, totalled £10.4m 
(£9.0m, £8.5m).

The trustees of the principal DB plans, together with the group, have sought to reduce the risk of a deficit arising in each plan that might result from a reduction 
in the discount rate applied to the liabilities by investing a proportion of plan funds in assets of a similar duration to the liabilities. In the UK, the liabilities of the 
principal plan have a duration of 18.2 years. The bond and similar assets of this plan, which are equivalent to 46.8% of that plan’s liabilities, have a duration  
of 16.5 years. The asset category ‘bond and similar assets’ includes bonds, investments in pooled funds of money market investments and interest rate swaps 
which, taken together, have the characteristics of a high quality bond portfolio and annuities. In the USA, the liabilities of the principal plan have a duration  
of 10.6 years. The bond assets of this plan, which are equivalent to 60.5% of that plan’s liabilities have a duration of 13.5 years. Taken together, the liabilities  
of the principal plans in the UK and USA referred to above represent 82.7% of group pension liabilities. 
The major categories of plan assets are as follows: 
 2006 2005 2004 
 % % % 
Equity 33.7 41.7 46.3
Bonds and similar assets 58.0 51.7 44.2

Total 100.0 100.0 100.0
 
iv) Assumptions 
In setting the discount rates for pension liabilities, Hanson has, together with its advisers, assessed the AA corporate bond yields for bonds of a similar duration 
to that of the liabilities of the principal plans. To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumptions, the group considered the current level of 
expected returns on risk-free investments (primarily government bonds), the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which 
the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class. The expected long-term rate of return for each asset class was weighted 
based on the asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio, resulting in weighted average assumptions 
of 5.55% for the UK and 6.30% for the USA at December 31, 2006.  
The major assumptions used to determine the liabilities for the principal US and UK defined benefit plans are set out below:

Over the past year, we have reviewed the mortality experience of the principal plans in the UK and the USA. For the UK, these investigations concluded that the 
current mortality assumptions needed to be updated and the short cohort has been applied to the mortality tables used in retirement (i.e. PA(90) rated down 5 
years for current pensioners and PXA92 (C=2014) for future pensioners). In the USA, the mortality table “RP-2000 projected to 2010” has been adopted in 
retirement for both current and future pensioners. Further reviews will be undertaken in 2007 as part of the tri-annual actuarial valuation of the principal UK plan 
and the annual actuarial valuation of the US plan.  
Life expectancies arising from the mortality tables the group has used are:

29 Financial risk management 
Exposure to liquidity, credit, and market price risk arises as a result of the day-to-day business activities of the group and the financing of those activities. 
Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge exposures to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and energy prices. 
a) Funding and Liquidity Risk  
In addition to the high level of free cash flow of the group, Hanson operates a prudent approach to liquidity management using a mixture of long-term debt 
together with short-term debt, cash and investments to meet its liabilities when due. This approach allows the group to respond quickly to strategic market 
opportunities as they arise. 
The group’s core funding is provided by three $750m bonds maturing in September 2010, March 2013 and August 2016 respectively. In addition the group 
holds the following facilities:  
– A £500m revolving credit facility, £470m of which expires in April 2011 and £30m of which expires in April 2010. The facility contains a $947m swingline 
advance facility and a sub-limit of up to £300m for Australian dollar loan note advances.  
– A $475m syndicated credit facility expiring in July 2009. This facility is available to be drawn as either cash advances or standby letters of credit. 
– Two A$200m bilateral revolving credit facilities maturing in September 2007. 
– A €100m bilateral revolving credit facility maturing in August 2007.

2009 242.7 500.0
2010 30.0 470.0
2011 470.0 –
 
b) Credit Risk 
Credit risk represents the loss which Hanson would suffer if a counterparty failed to meet its contractual obligations. This is an inherent risk in the day to day 
operations of the group. 
The Board’s policy for mitigating credit risk is to enter into financial transactions with counterparties with a A-/A3 credit rating for long-term transactions and 
F2/P-2/A2 for short-term transactions. In addition, each counterparty and country are allocated limits for cash and short-term investments. Cash deposits and 
investments have a maximum term of three months. 
At December 31, 2006 there were no significant risk weighted concentrations of credit risk. The maximum exposure under cash and short-term investments to  
a single counterparty at December 31, 2006 represented no more than 11% of group cash and short-term investments. 
c) Market Risk 
Market risk is the risk of loss arising from movements in market variables such as interest rates, exchange rates, and energy prices. Market risk is incurred by 
Hanson as a result of borrowing to meet its financing obligations, by holding investments which earn interest, by operating in currencies other than sterling and 
by purchasing commodities as inputs into its operations. 
Each of these risks is monitored by the relevant business unit and reviewed by senior management and/or the group Risk Committee.  Notes to the accounts

29 Financial risk management continued 
(i) Interest rate risk 
The group’s policy on interest rate risk is designed to limit the group’s exposure to fluctuating interest rates. This is achieved by limiting the level of floating interest 
rate exposure to a maximum determined by both the level of debt and the level of operating profit of the group at any point in time. This approach, which is consistent 
with the group’s target for leverage, will mean, other things being equal, that for any given level of debt, a higher level of operating profit will result in a higher limit on 
the level of floating rate debt in the group (and vice versa). Consistent with this policy, at December 31, 2006 the group held 63% of net debt at fixed rates. Hanson 
uses interest rate swaps as part of fair value hedges, to swap fixed rate debt into floating rates and as part of cash flow hedges to swap floating rate debt into fixed 
rates, in line with the policy described above. Derivatives are classified separately in the balance sheet as an asset or liability as appropriate. 
In respect of interest-earning financial assets and interest bearing financial liabilities, the following table indicates their weighted average effective interest rates 
at the balance sheet date and the periods in which they reprice or mature. Interest on financial instruments classified as floating rate is repriced at intervals of 
less than one year. The other financial assets and liabilities of the group that are not included in the table below are non-interest bearing and are therefore not 
subject to interest rate risk.

During 2006, $125m of the interest rate swaps relating to the 2010 $750m 7.875% fixed rate bond were cancelled, leaving $375m swapped to floating rates 
and $125m of the interest rate swaps relating to the 2013 $750m 5.25% fixed rate bond were cancelled, leaving $375m swapped to floating rates. In addition, 
$250m of the 2016 $750m 6.125% fixed rate bond was swapped to floating rates. During 2005, $250m of the interest rate swaps relating to the 2013 $750m 
5.25% fixed rate bond were cancelled, leaving $500m swapped to floating rates at December 31, 2005. 
(ii) Foreign exchange risk 
Due to the nature of the group’s products, which are generally uneconomic to transport long distances, there are few foreign exchange transaction exposures  
in the course of the group’s day-to-day business. The group does, however, have the majority (63.5%) of its net assets in overseas locations denominated in 
foreign currencies, principally US dollars (42.1% of net assets). As a consequence, changes in exchange rates affect both reported profit and asset values.  
The exposure of asset values to changes in foreign exchange rates is controlled to an extent by matching a proportion of currency assets with currency liabilities 
using both debt and foreign exchange contracts. This means that falling overseas exchange rates will result in both lower asset values and lower levels of net 
debt in sterling terms. The interest cost of currency liabilities also provides a partial hedge for foreign currency income. 
The following table summarises the group’s net balance sheet currency exposure as at December 31, 2006:

(iii) Energy price risk 
Hanson is exposed to price risk on fuel and other energy purchases in its operations. Energy price risk is managed by a combination of physical supply 
agreements and derivative instruments which together limit the effect of changing prices on the group’s operating profit. Derivative transactions are accounted 
for as cash flow hedges where the hedge relationship meets the criteria for hedge accounting, and as non-designated hedges where the criteria are not met. 
The notional and carrying values of energy hedges outstanding at December 31, 2006 are as follows: 
 2006 2005 
 £m £m 
Carrying Value (1.2) (0.2)
Notional Value 8.6 4.1
The maximum length of time over which energy price risk is hedged using derivatives is one year. 
(iv) Hedging 
Hanson uses derivatives to mitigate or hedge market price risk. Hedges are classified into the following types: 
Fair value hedges 
For effective fair value hedges, the hedging instrument is recorded at fair value on the balance sheet, with changes in fair value being taken through the income 
statement. The carrying amount of the hedged item is adjusted for gains and losses attributable to the risk being hedged. Hanson uses fixed to floating interest 
rate swaps to hedge the change in fair value of some of its fixed rate debt caused by interest rate movements: 
– $375m of the $750m fixed rate bond maturing in 2010 
– $375m of the $750m fixed rate bond maturing in 2013 
– $250m of the $750m fixed rate bond maturing in 2016 
– £199.8m of fixed rate bank debt 
 
Cash flow hedges 
For cash flow hedges, the fair value of the hedge is carried on the balance sheet. The hedged item is either held off-balance sheet or recorded at historic or 
amortised cost, depending upon the type of transaction. For effective hedges, changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument are taken to equity. They are 
then recycled through the income statement in the period during which the hedged item impacts the income statement. 
Included in the group’s cash flow hedges are US$250m and A$250m of floating to fixed interest rate swaps hedging floating rate borrowings. Other than 
floating rate borrowings the maximum length of time over which the variability in future cash flows of forecast transactions, is hedged is under one year. 
Net investment hedges 
The group holds foreign currency denominated debt and forward exchange contracts as hedges of its foreign currency investments. The value of such contracts 
is set out in the currency exposure table in section c) (ii) of this note. 
Non-designated hedges 
As IFRS has stringent rules under which hedge accounting may be applied, it is not considered practicable to apply hedge accounting for a small number of 
hedges (including some hedges of energy). These items are of generally low value. Such hedges are deemed non-designated under IAS 39 and are recognised 
at fair value on the balance sheet with changes in their fair value being recognised immediately through the income statement. 
The amount of hedge ineffectiveness during the year was not significant.  Notes to the accounts

29 Financial risk management continued 
d) Fair value of financial instruments 
Fair value is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between knowledgeable, willing parties on an arm’s length basis. For 
financial instruments carried at fair value, market prices or rates are used to determine fair value where an active market exists. Hanson uses forward prices for 
valuing forward foreign exchange and commodity contracts and uses swap models with present value calculations based on market yield curves to value interest 
rate swaps. For short-term assets and liabilities, the carrying amount is approximate to their fair value.  
All derivative financial assets and liabilities are shown at fair value on the balance sheet. Under IAS 39 hedge accounting rules, only the portions of the three 
$750m bonds which form part of an effective fair value hedge are shown at fair value in the balance sheet. The fair value of bonds at December 31, 2006 was 
£1,178.3m (£940.4m), compared to their carrying value of £1,161.0m as at December 31, 2006.

For those financial assets and liabilities which bear either a floating rate of interest or no interest, fair value is estimated to be equivalent to book value.  
For non-current receivables (note 17), payables (note 19) and provisions (note 21) fair value is estimated to be equivalent to book value, and is not included in 
the table above.

32 US accounting information
a) Comparison of International and US accounting principles 
From January 1, 2005, as required by the European Union’s IAS Regulation, 
the group has prepared its Annual Report and Form 20-F in accordance  
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the 
European Union (EU), which differ in certain respects from US generally 
accepted accounting principles (US GAAP). These differences relate 
principally to the following items, and the effect of each of the adjustments to 
profit for the financial year and net equity that would be required to reconcile 
to US GAAP is set out below.  
IFRS as adopted by the EU differ in certain respects from IFRS as issued  
by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). However, the 
consolidated financial statements for the periods presented would be no 
different had the Company applied IFRS as issued by the IASB. References 
to IFRS hereafter should be construed as references to IFRS as adopted by 
the EU. 
As a result of the group’s transition to IFRS on January 1, 2004, the 
reconciliations of net income and net equity for 2004 published in previous 
periods have been restated to reflect the restated profit and net equity 
reported within the Consolidated income statement and Consolidated 
balance sheet.  
Basis of consolidation 
Under IFRS, an entity is consolidated where a parent has control over another 
entity. Control is defined in IAS 27 “Consolidated and Separate Financial 
Statements” as “the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an 
entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities”. Under US GAAP, whilst an 
entity is also consolidated where control exists, FIN 46(R) also requires the 
consolidation of a Variable Interest Entity (VIE) where the entity is the primary 
beneficiary by means other than voting rights.  
Under IFRS, equity method accounting records the group’s share of profit 
and its investment in joint-ventures and associates in a single line item. When 
a joint-venture or associate is fully consolidated under US GAAP, the joint-
venture’s or associate’s balance sheet and income statement are recorded  
on a line by line basis with a corresponding adjustment to minority interest. 
Under FIN 46(R), the group is considered to have a variable interest entity in 
which Hanson is the primary beneficiary. This entity is Piedras y Arenas Baja, 
S de R L de CV (“Piedras”), a 50% joint-venture which is accounted for as a 
joint venture operation and therefore equity accounted in the group’s results 
under IFRS. Under FIN 46(R) Piedras is considered to be a variable interest 
entity as the total equity investment at risk is not currently sufficient to enable 
Piedras to finance its activities without additional financial support from other 
sources. The Hanson group is considered the primary beneficiary of Piedras 
as it currently provides more than half of the total debt and financial support 
to the entity and absorbs the majority of the expected losses. 
Piedras is an aggregates producer located in Mexico which in 2006 had 
turnover of £14.4m (£11.9m) and a pre-tax loss of £0.3m (£0.5m). In 
addition it had net assets at December 31, 2006 of £2.7m (£3.5m). 
Approximately 71% (80%) of the annual turnover of Piedras is to the group. 
There is no recourse to the general credit of the Company for creditors (or 
beneficial interest holders) of the consolidated VIE. 
Intangible assets 
(i) Goodwill 
Under IFRS, goodwill arising on acquisitions completed prior to January 1, 
1998 was written off directly to reserves. From December 31, 1997 to 
January 1, 2004, all acquired goodwill was capitalised and amortised over a 
period not exceeding 20 years. Since January 1, 2004, goodwill continues  
to be capitalised, however, amortisation of goodwill ceased at that date. On 
disposal of a business, the profit or loss on disposal is determined including 
goodwill reported as part of intangible assets. Under US GAAP prior to 
January 1, 2002, goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to July 1, 2001, was 
capitalised and amortised over its estimated useful life, not exceeding 40 
years. Under the transition provisions of SFAS 142 “Goodwill and other 
intangible assets”, goodwill, which arose during the period subsequent to July 
1, 2001, was capitalised, but has not been amortised. From January 1, 2002, 
goodwill is no longer amortised, but is reviewed annually for impairment.  
(ii) Other intangible assets 
Since January 1, 2002, separately identified intangible assets arising on 
acquisitions have been capitalised and amortised over their useful lives of 
between 1 and 28 years under US GAAP. Separately identified intangible 
assets recognised since transition to IFRS have been amortised on the same 
basis as under US GAAP. 
(iii) Capitalised software 
Under IFRS, computer software which is deemed not to be integral to the 
computer hardware is capitalised as part of intangible assets. Under US 
GAAP, the balances are classified as property, plant and equipment. 
Impairment of goodwill 
Under IFRS, goodwill is reviewed for potential impairment on an annual basis 
and where there is an indication that an impairment may have occurred. The 
impairment is measured by comparing the carrying value of goodwill for each 
cash generating unit (CGU) with the higher of the fair value less cost to sell 
and the value in use. Under US GAAP, goodwill impairment reviews are also 
conducted when an indicator of impairment exists, in addition to an annual 
impairment review as required by SFAS 142. The potential impairment is 
identified by comparing the carrying value of each reporting unit with its fair 
value. Where the carrying value including any separately identifiable intangible 
assets is greater than the fair value, an impairment loss is calculated based on 
the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over the implied fair value of 
goodwill. Where reporting units identified under US GAAP differ from the 
CGUs identified under IFRS, a reconciling item may arise. 
The group’s reporting units are based on its geographical region and product 
groups. Goodwill is allocated to these reporting units based on the location 
and product base of acquisitions and disposals at the date of the transaction. 
Joint-ventures and associates 
The main adjustments that would have been necessary to reconcile the joint-
ventures and associates not domiciled within the United States to US GAAP 
would have been in respect of deferred tax, pensions and goodwill. The group 
has not included a reconciling item for these adjustments, as the effect on net 
income and the balance sheet is not material. 
Impairment of long-lived assets to be held and used 
Under IFRS, property, plant and equipment and intangible assets subject to 
depreciation and amortisation are assessed for impairment on an annual basis. 
Where an indicator suggests that there is potential for impairment, a review is 
completed comparing the recoverable amount with the carrying value of the 
asset. The recoverable amount is the higher of the value in use based on the 
expected future cash flows discounted to present value, or the asset’s fair 
value less costs to sell. Where the carrying value exceeds the recoverable 
amount, the asset is impaired to the recoverable amount. If in the subsequent 
period, the indicator which caused the impairment no longer exists and the 
recoverable amount has improved, the impairment loss should be reversed.  
Under US GAAP, such assets are assessed for impairment using a three-step 
approach. Where an indicator suggests there is potential for impairment, the 
group determines whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows 
attributable to the long-lived assets in question is less than their carrying 
amount. It is only if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the 
carrying value of the asset that an impairment should be recognised. The 
impairment loss is calculated based on the amount by which the carrying 
value of the asset exceeds its fair value. When an impairment is recorded 
against the cost of the asset, it may not be reversed. 
Capitalisation of interest costs 
Under IFRS, the capitalisation of interest costs is optional. It is the group’s 
policy under IFRS not to capitalise interest costs. Under US GAAP, interest 
costs associated with the construction of major assets over a period of time, 
such as facilities for use by the group, are capitalised as part of the cost of 
the tangible fixed asset where the impact of the interest cost is material to the 
financial statements. The interest cost capitalised represents an allocation of 
the interest cost incurred during the period required to complete construction 
of the asset. In 2006, interest costs of £131.3m have been incurred. Of that 
amount £2.3m has been capitalised during the period as part of property, 
plant and equipment under US GAAP. 
Inventory valuation 
Under IFRS, valuing inventory on a last-in-first-out (LIFO) basis is not 
permitted. However, under US GAAP, where the inventory is valued on a 
LIFO basis for tax purposes in the local state, the same methodology must  
be used for accounting purposes. 
Deferred stripping costs 
On January 1, 2006, the group adopted EITF 04-6 “Accounting for stripping 
costs incurred during production in the mining industry” (EITF 04-6). Under 
IFRS, stripping costs in the post-production phase are capitalised in certain 
situations where the benefit exceeds one year and are amortised during the 
period over which the benefit is realised. Under US GAAP, where stripping 
costs are incurred during this phase, the costs are included as part of the 
costs of inventory produced.  Notes to the accounts

32 US accounting information continued 
Derivative instruments and hedging activities 
The group enters into derivative instruments to limit its exposure to interest 
rate, foreign exchange and commodity price risks. 
Under UK GAAP until December 31, 2004, certain derivative instruments 
were not required to be recognised on the balance sheet at fair value.  
On January 1, 2005, the group adopted IAS 32 and 39 on a prospective 
basis, requiring designation of hedging instruments and recognition of all 
derivative instruments at fair value on the balance sheet. The group’s  
hedging policy remains unchanged but the instruments are accounted  
for as described in the Accounting policies on page 75.  
Under US GAAP, derivative instruments, whether designated as a hedge  
or not, are required to be recognised on the balance sheet at fair value.  
From January 1, 2005, the group has applied hedge accounting for the 
purposes of SFAS 133 “Accounting for derivative instruments and hedging 
activities” where the requirements of SFAS 133 are met. Prior to that date, 
hedge accounting was not applied for the purposes of US GAAP and 
therefore, in 2004, the reconciliation to net income in that period fully  
reflects the changes in fair value of the derivatives, other than hedges  
of net investment. Hedges of net investment are the same under US GAAP  
as under IFRS, being taken to equity. 
Transition adjustment 
In addition, under US GAAP, transition adjustments were required to include 
the fair value of derivatives on the balance sheet on the adoption of SFAS 
133 at January 1, 2001. For those derivatives considered to be fair value 
hedges, the January 1, 2001 opening fair value of £17.1m was shown as 
current assets and liabilities – derivatives and as an adjustment to debt. The 
adjustment to debt is being subsequently amortised through the income 
statement over the residual life of the debt. For those derivatives considered 
to be cash flow hedges, the January 1, 2001 opening value of £0.5m was 
shown as current assets and liabilities – derivatives, and as an adjustment to 
other comprehensive income. The amounts in other comprehensive income 
are recognised in the income statement as the related cash flows are realised.  
Pensions 
Under both IFRS and US GAAP, the pension cost or credit is determined by 
reference to the pension liability and the market value of the underlying plan 
assets. Under IFRS, the group has elected not to apply the corridor approach 
and all actuarial gains or losses are recognised directly in equity, along with 
the related tax impact. The corridor approach is applied under US GAAP. 
Under IFRS, the interest on defined benefit scheme obligations and the 
expected return on those schemes’ assets are treated as part of finance costs 
in the Income Statement. Under US GAAP, these items are treated as part of 
the net periodic pension cost in operating profit.  
In 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 158 “Employers’ accounting for 
defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans” (SFAS 158) which 
the group has adopted from December 31, 2006 for US GAAP reporting 
purposes. As a result, the full defined benefit scheme surplus or deficit as of 
December 31, 2006 has been recognised in the US GAAP balance sheet. 
Share-based payments 
Under IFRS, the group applies the fair value method of accounting for its 
share-based payment schemes. As permitted under the transition rules for 
IFRS, the group has applied the accounting methodology to awards granted 
after November 7, 2002. From January 1, 2006 for US GAAP reporting 
purposes, the group has adopted FASB Statement No. 123 (Revised) 
“Share-based payments” (SFAS 123R), using the “modified prospective” 
method. This method requires the group not to restate prior periods but to 
record the current year charge of awards not vested at the transition date 
and to continue to report pro forma disclosures as previously required under 
FASB Statement No. 123 “Accounting for stock based compensation”  
(SFAS 123).  
In 2006, the basis of calculation of income statement charges and balance 
sheet positions for share based payments is consistent under IFRS and US 
GAAP. Under US GAAP, for awards granted prior to 2005, the group used a 
Black Scholes model to calculate the fair value of awards. For awards granted 
since January 1, 2005, the group has changed its method used to estimate 
the fair value of certain awards. The Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) and 
Share Option Plan (SOP) are valued using a Monte Carlo simulation model 
for the portion of awards dependent on market conditions and a Black 
Scholes model for the portion of awards dependent on non-market conditions. 
Sharesave awards continue to be valued using a Black Scholes model. The 
changes in method used to estimate the fair value were made in 2005 in 
order to be consistent with the estimates used for fair values determined 
under IFRS. 
In periods prior to 2006, the group has applied the intrinsic value method 
under APB 25 “Accounting for stock issued to employees” as permitted by 
SFAS 123. In line with the requirements of SFAS 123 and as amended by 
SFAS 148 “Accounting for stock-based compensation – transaction and 
disclosure” (SFAS 148), the group provides pro forma disclosure of the 
impact of applying these standards which are based on a fair value method.  
Provisions 
Under IFRS, provisions are discounted to reflect the time-value of money 
based on the estimated timing of cash flows. US GAAP applies a stricter 
definition, permitting discounting only where the timing of cash flows is  
fixed or reliably determinable. IFRS requires a current market discount rate  
to be applied to provisions, whereas in the instances that discounting is 
permitted US GAAP requires the current rate to be used for new provisions, 
or changes in estimates for existing obligations, without amendment in 
subsequent periods. 
Accounting for restructuring costs 
Under IFRS, restructuring costs are recognised where implementation of  
a formal plan has begun and communicated with those affected. Costs of 
leased property, plant and equipment, which will no longer provide economic 
benefit, are provided for as part of the restructuring plan. Under US GAAP, 
one-time termination benefits are recognised where a detailed formal plan  
has been communicated to employees. Where employees are required to 
continue working until they are terminated to be eligible for the termination 
benefit and that period exceeds the minimum retention period, the cost is 
recognised rateably over the retention period. Costs of property, plant and 
equipment that will continue to be incurred under a leasing contract without 
economic benefit are recognised once the assets cease to be used.  
Non-monetary transactions 
Under IFRS, exchanges of assets in return for an equity interest in a joint-
venture entity are transferred at the fair value of assets surrendered. The fair 
value of the equity interest received is measured by its fair value, which is 
equivalent to the fair value of the assets given up adjusted by the amount  
of cash transferred. In this instance a proportion of the gain or loss on the 
transaction is recognised in the equity shareholders’ income statement.  
When the fair values cannot be reliably measured or the transaction lacks 
commercial substance, no gain or loss on disposal is recognised. 
Under US GAAP, from January 2005, the group has adopted SFAS 153 
“Exchanges of non-monetary assets”. The issuance of this standard removes 
future differences as it is to be applied on a prospective basis. However,  
there are a number of residual differences on acquisitions prior to this date. 
Previously, APB Opinion No. 29 “Accounting for non-monetary transactions” 
provided an exemption to its general principles of measuring such 
transactions at fair value where the exchange related to similar productive 
assets. SFAS 153 has removed this exemption for transactions taking place 
after January 2005. 
Foreign exchange gains and losses on disposals of businesses 
Prior to the transition date of January 1, 2004, under IFRS, cumulative  
foreign exchange gains and losses relating to disposals were adjusted  
within reserves. At the date of transition the group opted to set the reserve  
to nil and subsequent movements have been recycled on disposal of the 
related business. Under US GAAP, such gains and losses are also included 
in determining the profit or loss on disposal but they are tracked from the date  
of acquisition of the entity.  
Deferred tax 
Under both IFRS and US GAAP, deferred taxation assets and liabilities  
are provided on differences between the book and tax bases of assets and 
liabilities except in certain limited circumstances. Certain assets may have 
more than one tax base and IFRS requires use of the tax base most relevant 
to the manner of realisation; for those assets which are not depreciable, 
depletable or amortisable for tax purposes, the tax base may be nil. US GAAP, 
however, requires the use of the tax base assuming a disposal of the asset. 
Accordingly, the tax base and the corresponding temporary difference for 
certain assets will be different under IFRS and US GAAP.  
Under IFRS, deferred tax assets are recognised for future deductions and 
utilisations of tax carry forwards to the extent that it is more likely than not that 
suitable taxable profit is expected to be available. Under US GAAP, deferred 
tax assets are recognised at their full amounts and reduced by a valuation 
allowance to the extent it is more likely than not that suitable taxable profits 
will not be available.  
Differences in deferred taxation may occur as a result of accounting 
adjustments between IFRS and US GAAP.  Hanson 2006 www.hanson.biz
Notes to the accounts for the 12 months ended December 31, 2006 114 
32 US accounting information continued 
Discontinued operations 
Discontinued operations are those clearly distinguishable operations and 
activities which either ceased or left the group in the accounting period or 
soon thereafter, including assets held for sale, where it is probable that the 
sale will complete within one year. Prior to January 1, 2004, assets held for 
sale were not treated as discontinued operations. IFRS includes equity 
method investments as part of discontinued operations whereas US GAAP 
specifically excludes equity method investee from scope. 
Acquisition accounting 
US GAAP requires that a deferred tax asset or liability be raised to reflect the 
difference between the tax basis of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, 
and their fair values at the time of acquisition. The same is true under IFRS. 
However, where there are differences between the fair values of these assets 
and liabilities under IFRS and US GAAP, there will be a resulting difference in 
the deferred tax calculated. The recognition of deferred tax assets or liabilities 
affects the amount of goodwill recognised on acquisition. IFRS requires that 
contingent consideration is included within the cost of the consideration  
at the date of acquisition where it is probable that the resolution of the 
contingency will result in the transfer of economic benefit and that the amount 
can be measured reliably. US GAAP, however, only permits recognition of 
such consideration once the contingency is resolved and the amount to be 
paid is determinable. Under IFRS, when shares are issued as consideration 
for an acquisition, the fair value of that consideration is based upon the share 
price at the date the acquisition is unconditional. Under US GAAP, the 
acquisition price is based upon the share price over a reasonable period of 
time before and after the date that the acquisitions are agreed to and 
announced. Where an acquisition results in negative goodwill, IFRS requires 
that the excess amount is immediately taken to the income statement. US 
GAAP requires the excess to initially be proportionally allocated to the fair 
values assigned to non-current assets.  
Asset recognition 
Under IFRS, assets which include a degree of uncertainty become 
recognisable in accordance with the criteria set out in IAS 37 “Provisions, 
contingent liabilities and contingent assets”. Where such an asset is 
recognised under IFRS, it is discounted to its present value based on the 
timing of expected cash flows. Although broadly similar, there are certain 
circumstances under US GAAP where a contingent asset can only be 
recognised if additional criteria are met. 
New US accounting standards and pronouncements not yet adopted 
In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 157 “Fair Value 
Measurements” (SFAS 157), seeking to clarify the methodology used to 
measure fair value by emphasizing that market-based measurement should be 
used as the method to value assets and liabilities. This establishes a fair value 
hierarchy and incorporates an adjustment for risk in the valuation model. The 
statement will be applied prospectively from the effective date of January 1, 
2008, with limited retrospective effect on financial instruments previously 
measured at fair value under the initial recognition of FASB Statement 133 
“Accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities”. While it is not 
possible to determine the financial impact of the prospective element of the 
statement, the effect of reversing the transition adjustment on adoption of 
SFAS 133 would be £10.0m credit to US GAAP net equity.  
In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48 “Accounting for 
Uncertainty in Income Taxes – An Interpretation of FASB Statement No.  
109” (FIN 48). FIN 48 requires tax benefits from uncertain positions to be 
recognised only if it is “more likely than not” that the position is sustainable 
based on its technical merits. The interpretation also requires qualitative and 
quantitative disclosures, including discussion of reasonably possible changes 
that might occur in unrecognised tax benefits over the next 12 months, a 
description of open tax years by major jurisdiction, and a roll-forward of all 
unrecognised tax benefits. FIN 48 applies for the group’s financial year 
beginning 1 January 2007. The group is currently in the process of quantifying  
the net adjustment to retained earnings as of January 1, 2007, which will  
arise on adoption of FIN 48. 
The Emerging Issues Task Force issued Abstract 06-2 “Accounting for 
Sabbatical Leave and Other Similar Benefits Pursuant to FASB Statement  
No. 48” (EITF 06-2) in March 2006. The abstract explains that compensated 
absence during which an employee is not required to carry out any duties in 
which the compensated absence is required to be earned, must be accrued 
over the preceding service period. The methodology is applied under IAS 19 
“Employee benefits” and has not resulted in a reconciling difference to US 
GAAP. It is therefore not believed that the adoption of the abstract will have  
a material impact on transition.  Notes to the accounts

f) Cash flow statement 
The consolidated statements of cash flows prepared under IFRS present substantially the same information as those required under US GAAP. These 
statements differ, however, with regard to classification of items within them. 
Under US GAAP, cash and cash equivalents for cash flow purposes include short-term liquid resources but not overdrafts. Under IFRS, overdrafts are included 
within the definition of cash equivalents. Under US GAAP, capitalised interest is treated as part of the cost of the asset to which it relates and thus included as 
part of investing cash flows; under IFRS all interest is treated as operating activities. Following the adoption of SFAS 123(R) in 2006, the cash flow statement 
reflects excess tax benefits arising on the vesting of share-based payments as financing cash flows. Under IFRS, the excess tax benefits are recorded as 
operating cash flows.

The group has provisions for taxes that may become payable in future periods as a result of tax audits. It is the group’s policy to establish provisions for taxes 
that may become payable in future years as a result of an examination by tax authorities. The tax provisions are analysed at each balance sheet date and 
adjustments are made as events occur to warrant adjustment to the provisions. At any given time, the group is undergoing tax audits in several tax jurisdictions 
and covering multiple years. The provisions for taxes at December 31, 2006 were £93.5m (£103.0m, £108.5m). The decrease is due to revisions to the best 
reasonable estimate of the tax exposures, cash paid on certain audits and foreign exchange movement on non UK provisions. 
The group has not provided deferred tax liabilities related to differences of its overseas subsidiaries and joint-ventures under Accounting Principles Board 
Opinion (APB) 23, “Accounting for Income Taxes – Special Areas” as it is the group’s policy to permanently reinvest such earnings. Quantifying the amount  
of undistributed earnings and deferred tax liabilities is not practical. 
“FASB Staff Position No 109-2” Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act  
of 2004”, provides guidance under FASB Statement No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,” with respect to recording any potential impact of the repatriation 
provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Hanson has determined that the benefits are immaterial to the financial statements at December 31, 2005.

reversal of such impairments is not permitted. 
In 2005, previously recognised impairment charges against property, plant and equipment in North America of £19.6m have been reversed. The reversal of such 
impairments is not permitted under US GAAP. In addition, an impairment of goodwill of £17.6m has been recognised under IFRS. Under US GAAP, £15.5m of 
this impairment has been recognised previously and therefore the IFRS impairment has been reversed. 
Of the amounts charged as impairments in 2004 under IFRS, £nil had been charged in prior years as amortisation under US GAAP or previously impaired under 
IFRS, and is therefore shown as a reduction in the difference between the charge under IFRS and US GAAP. The operating impairment charge of £29.3m in 
2004 under IFRS relates to various operations within North America, the UK and Asia Pacific, where it has been necessary to make an impairment provision for 
the difference in these operations’ carrying values compared with the higher of their value in use or net realisable value.  
j)  Additional information required by US GAAP in respect of accounting for intangible assets subject to amortisation 
Other intangible assets subject to amortisation primarily consisting of purchase options, order backlogs and non-compete agreements capitalised since 2003, 
that have a cost of £33.5m (£35.0m, £12.9m) and an accumulated amortisation charge of £5.6m (£5.5m, £3.4m). The estimated aggregate amortisation 
expense for each of the next five years is £3.1m, £2.7m, £2.7m, £2.5m and £2.0m.

In 2004 and 2003, the group applied historical volatility as its basis to estimate expected volatility for the proforma disclosure required by SFAS 123. In light of 
guidance provided by IFRS and in conjunction with external advisors, the group has re-evaluated its process for estimating volatility in 2005 resulting in volatility 
assumptions which are more reflective of market conditions. This process has been applied prospectively for SFAS 123 reporting purposes in 2005. The 
changes did not have a material impact on the group’s proforma net income or related per share amounts. 
In 2006, the group adopted SFAS 123 (Revised) “Share-based payments” (SFAS 123R) using the modified prospective method. The impact of changing from 
the intrinsic value method under APB 25 “Accounting for stock issued to employees” to the fair value method under SFAS 123(R) in 2006 is to increase income 
before taxes and net income by £14.7m and £9.7m respectively. The impact on both basic and diluted earnings per share in 2006 is 1.4p per share.  Hanson 2006 www.hanson.biz

The intrinsic value method of APB 25, as permitted under SFAS 123, continues to be applied to periods prior to January 1, 2006 and as a result the group

‡ ‡
* If approved by shareholders at the AGM to be held on April 24, 2007, the recommended final dividend of 15.35p per ordinary share for the year ended December 31, 2006 will be payable on May 4, 2007 to ordinary 
shareholders on the register at close of business (London time) on April 10, 2007. 
‡ For holders of ADSs and CDIs, the dividend base rate is declared in pence and is converted to US dollars (for ADS holders) and Australian dollars (for CDI holders) on the UK dividend payment date using the 
prevailing exchange rates on that day. Payment of the final dividend for the year ended December 31, 2006 to holders of ADSs and CDIs will be on May 11, 2007. 
Ordinary shareholders who wish to have future dividends paid direct into their bank or building society account should contact Lloyds TSB Registrars at the 
address shown on the inside back cover. Payment to banks outside the UK is available to private shareholders subject to a small charge. 
Dividend policy 
The Board remains committed to a progressive dividend policy, although this will be subject to maintaining a reasonable level of dividend cover over the medium-
term. The increase of 10.0% in the dividend for 2002, of 10.1% for 2003, of 7.1% for 2004, of 10.2% for 2005, followed by an increase of 9% for 2006 
reflects our progressive approach to dividend payments. Future dividends will be dependent upon Hanson’s earnings, financial condition and other factors. 
Major shareholders 
To its knowledge, Hanson is not owned or controlled directly or indirectly by any government or by any other corporation. As of February 19, 2007, Hanson has 
been notified of the following persons who, directly or indirectly, are interested in 3% or more of the issued share capital, excluding shares held in treasury. The 
voting rights of the major shareholders listed below are the same as for the other holders of ordinary shares or ADSs.

Other than as identified above and interests held as bare nominee, Hanson has not been notified of any other interests in 5% or more of the ordinary shares 
(including ADSs) in the three years prior to the date of the Annual Report and Form 20-F. 
As at February 19, 2007, 14.2m ADSs were held of record in the USA. The 70.8m ordinary shares (9.9% of the issued share capital, excluding shares held in 
treasury), representing those ADSs were registered in the name of National City Nominees Limited. 
As of February 19, 2007, approximately 0.3m ordinary shares were held of record in the USA by approximately 250 record holders. Hanson believes that as  
of February 19, 2007, approximately 7.6% of its outstanding ordinary shares were also beneficially owned by US holders. Since certain of these securities  
are held by brokers or other nominees, the number of holders of record in the USA may not be representative of the number of beneficial owners or of where the 
beneficial owners are resident.  
Ordinary shareholders 
As at February 19, 2007 there were 736,968,849 ordinary shares in issue, of which 24,645,000 were held in treasury. There were 45,703 registered holders.   Hanson 2006 www.hanson.biz

Description of business  
General development of business 
Hanson became a business focused purely on building materials in 1997 
following the demerger of the old Hanson conglomerate. The major building 
materials companies remaining within Hanson at the time were ARC, Hanson 
Brick and Cornerstone. 
Hanson management transformed the business into a world leading building 
materials company through a series of disposals and acquisitions, the largest 
of which was the acquisition of the Australian construction materials business, 
Pioneer International, in May 2000. 
Following a series of restructurings, Hanson now operates as four identifiable 
trading regions: North America (48.4% of 2006 continuing turnover), UK (30.3% 
of 2006 continuing turnover), Australia and Asia Pacific (14.7% of 2006 
continuing turnover), and Continental Europe (6.6% of 2006 continuing turnover).  
This structure reinforces a continued focus on our core values of cost and 
margin control, together with disciplined and proactive growth via capital 
expenditure and bolt-on acquisitions. 
North America 
Hanson’s North American operations are organised into two operating groups, 
Aggregates North America and Building Products North America, with a 
corporate office in Dallas, Texas. 
(a) Aggregates North America 
Aggregates North America, headquartered in Dallas, Texas produces 
aggregates, ready-mixed concrete, asphalt and cement.  
(b) Building Products North America 
Building Products North America, headquartered in Dallas, Texas, is divided 
into three sub-groups, Pipe & Precast, Brick & Tile and Concrete Paving.  
Pipe & Precast, also headquartered in Dallas, produces concrete pipes, and 
products and precast concrete for the US and Canadian markets. Brick & Tile, 
with its headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina, produces bricks for the US 
and Canadian markets from its principal manufacturing factories in Canada, 
Texas, and the Carolinas, and roof tiles from its plants in Florida, California, 
Texas and Arizona. Concrete Paving has operations in Florida. 
UK 
Hanson reports as two groups in the UK, Aggregates UK and Buildings 
Products UK.  
(a) Aggregates UK 
Aggregates UK produces aggregates, slag cement, ready-mixed concrete and 
asphalt in the UK through its own operations and is a partner in a number of joint-
venture companies, the most significant of which is Midland Quarry Products 
Limited, owned jointly with a member of the Tarmac group of companies.  
Included within Aggregates UK are Hanson’s marine dredging operations 
which, through a wholly owned subsidiary and United Marine Holdings Limited, 
a joint-venture with a member of the Tarmac group of companies, supply sea-
dredged aggregates to the UK, Belgium and Holland. 
(b) Building Products UK 
Building Products UK supplies bricks, blocks, concrete products, concrete 
flooring, precast concrete and packed aggregates products throughout the UK. 
Australia and Asia Pacific 
In Australia, we are a major supplier of construction materials to the Australian 
market. Its operations are divided into two operating groups: Construction 
Materials, which produces ready-mixed concrete and aggregates; and Building 
Products, which produces blocks, pavers, retaining walls and precast products. 
Its other major interests include (i) its 25% share in Cement Australia Holdings 
Pty Ltd, jointly owned with Rinker Group Ltd and Holcim Ltd, which operates 
cement plants in New South Wales, Tasmania and Queensland, and (ii) 
Pioneer Road Services Pty Ltd, jointly owned with Shell Australia Ltd, which 
operates as an asphalt and contracting business. 
In Asia Pacific, we operate principally in Malaysia, Hong Kong and Singapore. 
Continental Europe 
In Continental Europe, we operate various aggregates, ready-mixed concrete 
and asphalt operations in Spain, the Czech Republic, The Netherlands, 
Belgium, Germany, Austria and Israel.

Business overview 
Seasonality 
Seasonality is a significant factor affecting all of our operations. In our major 
markets in the USA, the UK and northern Continental Europe, activity is very 
much concentrated during the period between March and November, while the 
winter in Australia and the rainy season and Chinese New Year in Asia Pacific 
cause a material slow-down in operations during these periods. Unusual 
weather patterns, in particular heavy and sustained rainfall during peak 
construction periods, can cause significant delays and have an adverse  
impact on our businesses. 
Sources and availability of raw materials 
We generally own or lease the real estate on which the raw materials, namely 
aggregates and clay reserves/resources, essential to our main businesses are 
found, although in the case of the marine businesses of Aggregates UK and 
Aggregates North America, we operate under licences from the relevant 
national and local authorities. 
We are also a significant purchaser of certain important materials such as 
cement, bitumen, steel, gas, fuel and other energy supplies, the cost of which 
can fluctuate by material amounts and consequently have an adverse impact 
on our businesses. We are not generally dependent on any one source for  
the supply of these products, other than in certain jurisdictions with regard  
to the supply of gas and electricity. Competitive markets generally exist in  
the jurisdictions in which we operate for the supply of cement, bitumen, steel 
and fuel.  
Sales and marketing 
Although sales and marketing activities are more important in connection with  
our brick business in both the USA and the UK, where branding of the product  
is a factor, in general the nature of the majority of our products, ie rock, sand, 
gravel, ready-mixed concrete, concrete products and slag cement, and the 
cost of transportation, means that marketing and selling is conducted on a 
more localised basis, with an emphasis on service and delivery. Sales and 
marketing costs tend to be relatively low in relation to the overall delivered 
price of our products. 
Competitive position 
Statements relating to Hanson’s position as one of the leading heavy building 
materials companies, one of the largest producers of aggregates and one of the 
largest producers of heavy building products are based on management estimates. 
Governmental regulation (including environmental) 
Many products produced by our operating units are subject to government 
regulation in various jurisdictions regarding production and sale. We believe 
that our operating units have taken, and continue to take, measures to comply 
with applicable laws and government regulations in the jurisdictions in which 
we operate so that the risk of sanctions does not represent a material threat  
to any of the operating units individually or to Hanson as a whole. We also 
believe that compliance with these regulations does not substantially affect  
the ability of our subsidiaries to compete with similarly situated companies. 
In addition to the regulatory framework described above, our operating units 
are subject to extensive regulation by national, state and local agencies 
concerning such matters as planning, environmental and health and safety 
compliance. In addition, numerous governmental permits and approvals are 
required for our operations. We believe that our operating units are currently 
operating in substantial compliance with, or under approved variances from, 
various national, state and local regulations. We do not believe that such 
compliance will materially adversely affect our business or results of operations.   Ancillary information
 
 
129
In the past, our subsidiaries have made significant capital and maintenance 
expenditures to comply with planning, water, air and solid and hazardous 
waste regulations and these subsidiaries may be required to do so in the  
future. From time to time, various agencies may serve cease and desist orders 
or notices of violation on an operating unit or deny its applications for certain 
licences or permits, in each case alleging that the practices of the operating 
unit are not consistent with the regulations or ordinances. In some cases, the 
relevant operating unit may seek to meet with the agency to determine mutually 
acceptable methods of modifying or eliminating the practice in question. We 
believe that our operating units should be able to achieve compliance with  
the applicable regulations and ordinances in a manner which should not have  
a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results  
of operations. 
Approximately, 100 present and former US operating sites, or portions thereof, 
currently or previously owned and/or leased by current or former companies 
acquired by Hanson (responsibility for which remains with a member of the 
Hanson group) are the subject of claims, investigations, monitoring or 
remediation under the US federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, 
Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), the US federal Resource 
Conservation and Recovery Act or comparable US state statutes or 
agreements with third parties. These proceedings are in various stages ranging 
from initial enquiries to active settlement negotiations to implementation of 
response actions. In addition, a number of present and former Hanson 
operating units (responsibility for which remains with a member of the Hanson 
group) have been named as Potentially Responsible Parties (“PRPs“) at 
approximately 40 off-site landfills under CERCLA or comparable state statutes. 
In each of these matters the Hanson operating unit is working with the 
governmental agencies involved and other PRPs to address environmental 
claims in a responsible and appropriate manner. A substantial majority of these 
operating and landfill sites are covered by the environmental insurance policy 
referred to under the heading “Material Contracts” referred to below. 
We do not believe that any of the above proceedings relating to operating 
sites and off-site landfills not covered by the environmental insurance policy 
should materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results  
of operations. At December 31, 2006, we had accrued £171.1m for 
environmental obligations, including legal and other costs, at such sites as  
are not covered by the above-mentioned environmental insurance policy.  
Costs associated with environmental assessments and remediation efforts  
are accrued when determined to represent a probable loss and to be capable  
of being reasonably estimated. There can be no assurance that the ultimate 
resolution of these matters will not differ materially from our estimates. 
We cannot predict whether future developments in laws and regulations 
concerning environmental and health and safety protection will affect our 
earnings or cash flow in a materially adverse manner or whether our operating 
units will be successful in meeting future demands of regulatory agencies in a 
manner which will not materially adversely affect our business, financial 
condition or results of operations. 
For other legal proceedings against Hanson, see note 26 of the Notes to the 
accounts. 
Patents and trademarks 
Our operating units have various patents, registered trademarks, trade names 
and trade secrets and applications for, or licences in respect of, the same that 
relate to various businesses. We believe that certain of these intellectual property 
rights are of material importance to the businesses to which they relate. We 
believe that the material patents, trademarks, trade names and trade secrets of 
our operating subsidiaries and divisions are adequately protected and that the 
expiration of patents and patent licences should not have a material adverse 
effect upon our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
Employees 
As at December 31, 2006, the group employed 25,900 employees, excluding 
joint-venture and associates. An analysis of employee numbers by business 
and geographical area is found in note 4 of the Notes to the accounts. We 
believe that in general our relationship with our employees and trade unions  
or other bodies representing our employees is good. 
Property, plant and equipment 
As of December 31, 2006, the net book value of property, plant and 
equipment is £2,901.5m, predominantly held by the operating divisions.  
None of the individual properties is considered to have a value that is of major 
significance in relation to our assets as a whole. For a description of certain 
environmental issues that may affect our utilisation of our assets, see under the 
heading “Governmental regulation (including environmental)” referred to above. 
Material contracts 
For details relating to the Deposit Agreement under which the Hanson ADSs 
were issued, the indentures under which the group’s public bonds were issued 
and various agreements and indemnities relating to the demergers, see under 
the heading “Exhibits” included in Hanson PLC’s 2006 Annual Report and 
Form 20-F filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
In August 1998, an agreement was reached under which, for a one-off premium 
and related transaction costs totalling $275m, insurance cover of $800m  
(after payment by the group of the first $100m of remediation costs arising  
since January 1, 1998) was available to meet the costs of remediating the 
environmental liabilities relating to the former Koppers’ company operations  
of Beazer plc (“Beazer”) (acquired by Hanson in 1991). The insurance cover  
is provided by the subsidiaries of two leading reinsurance companies, Centre 
Solutions (a member of the Zurich Group) and Swiss Re. Administration of the 
environmental remediation programme will continue to be carried out by Beazer. 
In April 2005, we entered into a £500m multi-currency revolving credit facility 
arranged by Barclays Capital and J.P. Morgan plc with a syndicate of banks, 
£470m of which expires in April 2011 and £30m of which expires in April 
2010. This facility contains a $947m swingline advance facility and a sub-limit 
of up to £300m for Australian dollar loan note advances. In addition, in July 
2004, we entered into a five year $475m facility arranged by Banc of America 
Securities Limited and Citigroup Global Markets Limited with a syndicate of 
banks. This facility is available to be drawn as either cash advances or standby 
letters of credit. 
In August 2006, we entered into an indenture with The Bank of New York  
as trustee. Under the indenture, we can issue an unlimited amount of debt 
securities. In August 2006, we issued $750m in aggregate principal amount  
of notes. The notes bear interest at the rate of 6.125% per year and will 
mature on August 15, 2016.  
Exchange controls 
There are no UK restrictions on the import or export of capital including foreign 
exchange controls that affect the remittances of dividends or other payments 
to non-resident holders of ordinary shares except as otherwise set forth in 
“Taxation information for US shareholders” below and except for certain 
restrictions imposed from time to time by HM Treasury pursuant to legislation 
such as The United Nations Act 1946 and the Emergency Laws Act 1964 
against the government or residents of certain countries. 
Except for the general limitations contained in the Company’s Memorandum 
and Articles of Association and in the Deposit Agreement governing the 
Company’s ADSs, and certain restrictions that may be imposed from time to 
time by HM Treasury under legislation as described above, under English law 
and Hanson’s Memorandum and Articles of Association, persons who are 
neither residents nor nationals of the UK may freely hold, vote and transfer 
ordinary shares in the same manner as UK residents or nationals. 
Taxation information for US shareholders  
The following paragraphs are intended as a general guide only and do not 
purport to be a complete technical analysis or listing of all potential tax effects 
relevant to the ADSs or the ordinary shares. The statements of US federal tax 
laws set forth below are based on provisions of the US Internal Revenue  
Code of 1986, as amended, current and proposed US Treasury regulations 
promulgated there under, and administrative and judicial decisions, all of which 
are subject to change, possibly on a retrospective basis. 
This discussion addresses only US shareholders that beneficially own and  
hold ADSs or ordinary shares as capital assets and use the US dollar as their 
functional currency, and that are either a citizen or resident of the USA for US 
federal income tax purposes, or a corporation, or other entity treated as a 
corporation for US federal income tax purposes, created or organised under 
the laws of the USA or any political subdivision thereof, or an estate the 
income of which is subject to US federal income taxation regardless of its 
sources, or a trust, if a court within the USA is able to exercise primary 
supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more US persons 
have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust (each a “US 
shareholder” for the purposes of this discussion). 
The discussion does not consider the tax treatment of beneficiaries of trusts  
or estates, partnerships or other pass-through entities or persons who hold 
ordinary shares or ADSs through a partnership or other pass-through entity. 
This discussion does not address all aspects of US federal income taxation, 
such as US federal gift or estate tax, nor state or local taxation. It does not 
address the tax consequences for financial institutions, financial services 
entities, insurance companies, dealers in securities or foreign currencies, 
persons subject to the alternative minimum tax, persons owning directly, 
indirectly or by attribution 5% or more of the total combined voting power  
of the stock of Hanson, persons carrying on a trade or business in the UK 
through a permanent establishment, persons who acquired ordinary shares  
or ADSs as compensation, persons who elect mark-to-market accounting, tax-
exempt entities or private foundations, persons that hold the ordinary shares or 
ADSs as part of a straddle, hedge, constructive sale or conversion transaction  Hanson 2006 www.hanson.biz

or other integrated transaction, persons whose functional currency is other 
than the US dollar, certain expatriates or former long-term residents of the 
USA or holders who elected to apply the provisions of the former income  
tax convention between the USA and the UK. 
US shareholders and holders of Hanson ADSs should consult their tax 
advisors with regard to the application of the US federal income tax laws to 
their particular situation, as well as any tax consequences arising under the 
laws of any state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction. 
Considerations relevant to the ADSs and ordinary shares  
US shareholders of ADSs are not members of the Company but may instruct 
Citibank N.A., the Depositary, as to the exercise of voting rights pertaining to 
the number of ordinary shares represented by their ADSs. However, US 
shareholders of ADSs are generally treated as the owners of the underlying 
ordinary shares for purposes of the US-UK double taxation conventions 
relating to income and gains (the “UK-US income tax treaty“) and to estate and 
gift taxes (the “Estate and Gift Tax Convention“), and generally for purposes of 
the US federal tax laws. 
Taxation of dividends 
A US shareholder will be required to include in gross income as ordinary 
income the amount of any dividend paid on the ordinary shares or ADSs on  
the date the dividend is received to the extent the dividend is paid out of our 
current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for US federal 
income tax purposes. Dividends in excess of these earnings and profits will  
be applied against, and will reduce, the US shareholder’s basis in the ADSs  
or ordinary shares and, to the extent in excess of such basis, will be treated as 
gain from the sale or exchange of such ADSs or ordinary shares. In addition, 
dividends of current or accumulated earnings and profits will be foreign source 
passive income for US foreign tax credit purposes and will not qualify for the 
dividends-received deduction otherwise available to corporations.  
Dividends paid out of current or accumulated earnings in foreign currency to  
a US shareholder will be includable in the income of a US shareholder in a US 
dollar amount calculated by reference to the exchange rate on the date the 
dividend is received, regardless of whether the dividend is in fact converted 
into US dollars on such date. A US shareholder that receives a foreign 
currency dividend and converts the foreign currency into US dollars 
subsequent to receipt will have foreign exchange gain or loss based on any 
appreciation or depreciation in the value of the foreign currency against the  
US dollar, which will generally be US source ordinary income or loss. 
An individual US shareholder’s “qualified dividend income” is subject to tax at 
a reduced rate of tax of 15%. For this purpose, qualified dividend income 
includes dividends from foreign corporations if (a) the stock of such 
corporation with respect to which such dividend is paid is readily tradable on 
an established securities market in the USA, including NASDAQ, or (b) such 
corporation is eligible for the benefits of a comprehensive tax treaty with the 
USA that includes an information exchange programme and is determined to 
be satisfactory to the US Secretary of the Treasury. The US Secretary of the 
Treasury has indicated that the UK-US income tax treaty which came into 
effect on March 31, 2003 (the “Treaty”) is satisfactory for this purpose. 
Dividends will not, however, qualify for the reduced rate if such corporation is 
treated for the tax year in which dividends are paid (or in the prior year) as a 
“passive foreign investment company” for US federal income tax purposes. 
Based on the nature of Hanson’s operations, Hanson does not believe that it 
would be treated as a passive foreign investment company. Accordingly, if 
Hanson’s beliefs are correct, dividend distributions with respect to its ordinary 
shares or ADSs should be treated as qualified dividend income and subject to 
the US shareholder’s satisfaction of the holding period requirements described 
below, should be eligible for the reduced 15% US federal income tax rate.  
A US shareholder will not be entitled to the reduced rate: (a) if the US 
shareholder has not held the ordinary shares or ADSs for at least 61 days of 
the 121 day period beginning on the date which is 60 days before the ex-
dividend date; or (b) to the extent the US shareholder is under an obligation  
to make related payments on substantially similar or related property. Any days 
during which a US shareholder has diminished its risk of loss on the ordinary 
shares or ADSs are not counted towards meeting the 61 day holding period 
required by the statute. The UK does not currently apply a withholding tax on 
dividends under its internal laws. However, if such a withholding tax were 
introduced, the UK would be entitled, under the Treaty, in certain 
circumstances to impose a withholding tax at a rate of up to 15% on dividends 
paid to a US shareholder. Subject to applicable limitations, a US shareholder 
who was subject to any such withholding should be entitled to claim a 
deduction for withheld tax or, subject to the holding period requirements 
mentioned below, a credit for such withholding tax against such holder’s US 
federal income tax liability. The US foreign tax credit limitation may be reduced 
to the extent that dividends are eligible for the reduced rate described above. 
Taxation of capital gains 
Upon a sale or other disposition of ordinary shares or ADSs, a US shareholder 
will recognise gain or loss for US federal income tax purposes in an amount 
equal to the difference between the US dollar value of the amount realised and 
the US shareholder’s tax basis (determined in US dollars) in such ordinary 
shares or ADSs. Generally, such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss and 
will be long-term capital gain or loss if the US shareholder’s holding period  
for such ordinary shares or ADSs exceeds one year. Any such gain or loss 
generally will be income or loss from sources within the US for foreign tax 
credit limitation purposes. Long-term capital gain of a non-corporate US 
shareholder is generally subject to a maximum tax rate of 15%. The 
deductibility of a capital loss recognised on the sale or exchange of ordinary 
shares or ADSs is subject to limitations.  
If the ordinary shares or ADSs are publicly traded, a disposition of such 
ordinary shares or ADSs will be considered to occur on the “trade date”, 
regardless of the US shareholder’s method of accounting. A US shareholder 
that uses the cash method of accounting calculates the US dollar value of the 
proceeds received on the sale as of the date that the sale settles. However, a 
US shareholder that uses the accrual method of accounting is required to 
calculate the value of the proceeds of the sale as of the “trade date” and, 
therefore, may realise foreign currency gain or loss, unless such US 
shareholder has elected to use the settlement date to determine its proceeds 
of sale for purposes of calculating such foreign currency gain or loss. In 
addition, a US shareholder that receives foreign currency upon the sale or 
exchange of the ordinary shares or ADSs and converts the foreign currency 
into US dollars subsequent to receipt will have foreign exchange gain or loss 
based on an appreciation or depreciation in the value of the foreign currency 
against the US dollar. Foreign exchange gain or loss will generally be US 
source ordinary income or loss. 
A US citizen who is resident (or in certain circumstance has been resident 
within the previous five UK years of assessment for tax) or ordinarily resident  
in the UK or a US corporation which is resident in the UK by reason of being 
managed and controlled in the UK or a US citizen who, or US corporation 
which, is trading in the UK through a branch or agency and has used, held or 
acquired ADSs or ordinary shares for the purposes of such trade, branch or 
agency, may be liable for both UK and US tax on any gain on the disposal of 
ADSs or ordinary shares. Subject to certain limitations, such a person will 
generally be entitled to a tax credit against any US federal tax liability for the 
amount of any UK tax (namely, capital gains tax in the case of an individual and 
corporation tax on chargeable gains in the case of a corporation) which is paid 
in respect of such gain. 
US information reporting and backup withholding  
A US shareholder is generally subject to information reporting requirements 
with respect to dividends paid in the USA on ADSs or ordinary shares. In 
addition, a US shareholder is subject to backup withholding (currently at a  
rate of 28%) on dividends paid in the USA on ADSs or ordinary shares unless 
the US shareholder provides an IRS Form W-9 or otherwise establishes an 
exemption. A US shareholder is subject to information reporting and backup 
withholding (currently at a rate of 28%) on proceeds paid from a sale, 
exchange, redemption or other disposition of ADSs or ordinary shares  
unless the US shareholder provides an IRS Form W-9 or otherwise establishes 
an exemption. 
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. The amount of any backup 
withholding will be allowed as a credit against a US shareholder’s US federal 
income tax liability and may entitle such holder to a refund, provided that 
certain information is furnished on a timely basis to the IRS. 
Inheritance tax 
The United Kingdom imposes inheritance tax, broadly, on transfers of capital 
which occur on death and in the preceding seven years. HM Revenue & 
Customs is known to consider that the Estate and Gift Tax Convention applies 
to inheritance tax and it is understood that, in practice, both the HM Revenue & 
Customs and the US Internal Revenue Service apply the provisions of the 
Estate and Gift Tax Convention to inheritance tax. On this assumption, an ADS 
or ordinary share held by an individual who is domiciled in, or a citizen of, the 
United States and is not a national of or domiciled in the United Kingdom will 
not be subject to UK inheritance tax on the individual’s death or on a transfer 
of the ADS or ordinary share during the individual’s lifetime except in the 
exceptional case where the ADS or ordinary share is part of the business 
property of a UK permanent establishment or an enterprise or pertains to a UK 
fixed base of an individual used for the performance of independent personal 
services. Special rules apply where an ADS or ordinary share is held in trust. 
The Estate and Gift Tax Convention generally provides a credit for the amount 
of any tax paid in the United Kingdom against the US federal tax liability or for 
tax paid in the USA to be credited against the United Kingdom liability 
(according to rules set out in the Convention) in a case where the ADS or 
ordinary share is subject both to UK inheritance tax and to US federal gift or 
estate tax. 
Stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax 
Stamp duty will, subject to certain exceptions, be payable at the rate of 1.5%, 
rounded up to the nearest £5, on any instrument transferring ordinary shares 
to the Custodian of the Depositary on the value of such ordinary shares. In 
accordance with the terms of the Deposit Agreement, any tax or duty payable 
by the Depositary or the Custodian of the Depositary on future deposits of 
ordinary shares may be charged by the Depositary to the party to whom ADRs 
are delivered against such deposits.  Ancillary information
 
 
131
No UK stamp duty will be payable on any transfer of an ADR evidencing an 
ADS, provided that the ADR (and any separate instrument of transfer) is 
executed and retained at all times outside the UK and is not required to be 
admitted in evidence in any proceedings in the United Kingdom. A transfer of 
an ADR evidencing an ADS in the United Kingdom could attract stamp duty at 
a rate of 0.5%, rounded up to the nearest £5. Any transfer (which will include 
a transfer from the Depositary to an ADS holder) of the underlying ordinary 
shares could result in a stamp duty liability at the rate of 0.5%, rounded up  
to the nearest £5. On a transfer from a nominee to the beneficial owner (the 
nominee having at all times held the ordinary shares on behalf of the beneficial 
owner) under which no beneficial interest passes and which is neither a sale 
nor arises under a contract of sale nor is in contemplation of sale, a fixed £5 
stamp duty will be payable. The amount of stamp duty or stamp duty reserve 
tax payable is generally calculated at the applicable rate on the purchase price 
of the ordinary shares. 
Stamp duty reserve tax at a rate of 0.5% will be payable on any agreement  
to transfer ordinary shares or any interest therein unless an instrument 
transferring the ordinary shares is executed and stamp duty at a rate of 0.5%, 
rounded up to the nearest £5 has been paid. Stamp duty reserve tax will not 
be payable on any agreement to transfer ADRs representing ADSs.

Independent auditor’s report to the shareholders of Hanson PLC 
We have audited the parent Company financial statements of Hanson PLC for 
the year ended December 31, 2006 which comprise the Balance Sheet and 
the related notes I to VIII. These parent Company financial statements have 
been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. We have also 
audited the information in the Directors’ Remuneration report that is 
described as having been audited.  
We have reported separately on the group financial statements of Hanson 
PLC for the year ended December 31, 2006. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work 
has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members 
those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for 
no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s 
members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we 
have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and Form 20-F, 
the Directors’ Remuneration report and the parent Company financial 
statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and 
Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice) as set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities. 
Our responsibility is to audit the parent Company financial statements and the 
part of the Directors’ Remuneration report to be audited in accordance with 
relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the parent Company financial 
statements give a true and fair view and whether the parent Company 
financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration report to be 
audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
1985. We also report to you whether in our opinion the information given in 
the parent Company Report of the Directors is consistent with the financial 
statements. 
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept 
proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for the audit, or if information specified by law 
regarding Directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed. 
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and Form 20 F and 
consider whether it is consistent with the audited parent Company financial 
statements. The other information comprises only the Report of the Directors’, 
the Chairman’s statement, the Chief Executive’s overview, A decade of 
delivery and beyond, the Operating and Financial Review, the Corporate 
governance statement, and the unaudited part of the Directors’ remuneration 
report. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any 
apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the parent Company 
financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other 
information. 
Basis of audit opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit 
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and 
disclosures in the parent Company financial statements and the part of the 
Directors’ Remuneration report to be audited. It also includes an assessment 
of the significant estimates and judgments made by the Directors in the 
preparation of the parent Company financial statements, and of whether  
the accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s circumstances, 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed. 
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and 
explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with 
sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the parent Company 
financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration report to be 
audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or  
other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall 
adequacy of the presentation of information in the parent Company financial 
statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration report to be audited. 
Opinion 
In our opinion: 
– the parent Company financial statements give a true and fair view, in 
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, 
of the state of the Company’s affairs as at December 31, 2006; and 
– the parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration report to be audited have been properly prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and 
– the information given in the Directors’ report is consistent with the parent 
Company financial statements.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in respect of the financial statements 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial period which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the 
Company and of the profit or loss for that period. In preparing those financial statements, the Directors are required to: 
– select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
– make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
– state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; 
and 
– prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business. 
The Directors confirm that the financial statements comply with the above requirements. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company 
and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

I) Accounting Policies 
a) Basis of preparation 
The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention, except where noted below, in accordance with the 
Companies Act 1985 and UK accounting standards (UK GAAP). 
By virtue of section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 the Company is exempt from presenting a profit and loss account. The Company has taken advantage of 
the exemption from preparing a cash flow statement under the provisions of FRS 1 (Revised 1996) and the exemption covered in FRS 8 and has not separately 
disclosed transactions with subsidiary undertakings. 
The following paragraphs describe the significant accounting policies under UK GAAP, which have been consistently applied unless otherwise stated.  
b) Profit and loss 
As permitted by the exemption in Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 the Company has not presented its own profit and loss account or the related notes. 
The loss for the year was £16.4m (loss of £11.2m). After dividends of £147.5m (£136.2m) the retained loss for the year was £163.9m (loss of £147.4m). 
There are no recognised gains or losses other than the loss of £163.9m for the year ended December 31, 2006 and employee share awards of £3.3m, which 
have been debited to reserves. 
Fees for audit and non-audit services provided by Ernst and Young LLP to the Company have been borne by a group undertaking.   Hanson PLC – Company
  
 
 
137
I) Accounting Policies continued 
c) Share-based payments 
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees, for awards granted after November 7, 2002, is measured at fair value on the date of grant and is 
recognised as an expense over the vesting period. Fair value is determined by an external valuer using an appropriate pricing model. In valuing equity-settled 
transactions, no account is taken of any vesting conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of the Company (market conditions). 
For awards evaluated on non-market conditions or no performance criteria, an expense is ultimately only recognised for awards which vest. Where an award is 
dependent upon a market condition, the cost of the award is recognised irrespective of whether the award vests unless the employee leaves during the vesting 
period. At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated representing the extent to which the vesting period has expired and 
management’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The movement in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet 
date is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding entry in equity.  
d) Dividends 
Dividends attributable to the shareholders are taken directly to equity when declared. Interim dividends are recognised when paid. Details of the final dividend 
recommended by the Board are disclosed in note 10 of the group Annual Report and Form 20-F. 
Dividends receivable are accounted for on a cash received basis. 
e) Foreign currencies 
Assets, liabilities, revenues and costs denominated in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transactions. Monetary 
assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date are re-translated at year end rates of exchange. Exchange differences arising are taken to the profit and loss 
account. 
f) Fixed asset investments 
Fixed asset investments are stated at cost, except where it is required to reflect a provision for a permanent diminution in value.  
The Company holds two investments, both at cost with no provisions for impairment: 
 Principal activity % owned Country Year ended 
Houserate Ltd Investment holding company 100 UK December
Hanson Holdings Limited Investment holding company 100 UK December
g) Interest bearing loans and borrowings 
Loans are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. 
h) Own shares 
Own equity instruments which are reacquired (treasury shares) are deducted from shareholders’ funds. No gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss on the 
purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Company’s own equity instruments. The Company has purchased all its own shares using funding provided by its 
subsidiary undertakings. 
i) Pensions and other post-retirement benefits 
The Company accounts for pensions under FRS 17 “Retirement benefits”. Contributions to defined contribution schemes are charged to the operating profit as 
they become payable. 
The employees of the Company participate in two defined benefit pension schemes and one defined contribution scheme. The Company is unable to identify 
separately the relevant portion of the defined benefit schemes’ assets and liabilities. Further details are given in note VIII to these accounts. Pension costs are 
accounted for under FRS 17 “Retirement benefits”. 
 
II) Investments in subsidiaries  
The companies listed below are those whose results, in the opinion of the Directors, principally affected the profit or assets of the group. A full list of subsidiary

VIII)  Pensions and other post-employment medical plans 
The employees of the Company participate in three group pension plans: the Hanson No 2 Pension Scheme, a funded defined benefit plan which provides 
benefits to certain current and former employees of the Company; the Hanson Industrial Pension Scheme, another defined benefit pension plan and the Hanson 
Industrial Pension Scheme, a defined contribution plan. 
As it is not possible to separately identify the Company’s share of the Hanson Industrial Pension Scheme defined benefit plan, the Company accounts for this 
scheme on a defined contribution basis. Details of the entire net FRS 17 deficit position are disclosed below. The Company also contributes to the Hanson No 2 
Pension Scheme, the details of which are disclosed in the accounts of Hanson Building Materials Limited. 
Total contributions to all schemes in respect of the employees of the Company are £1.1m (£1.4m). 
From March 31, 2006, the Company has guaranteed the obligations of the Hanson Industrial Pension scheme. The net pension deficit under FRS17 was as 
follows: 
 2006 2005 
 £m £m 
Market value of scheme assets 1,179.3 1,093.9
Present value of scheme liabilities (1,190.5) (1,107.4)
Pension deficit (11.2) (13.5)
Deferred tax 4.7 4.1
Net FRS 17 pension deficit (6.5) (9.4)

Group Total 254 152 143 18 641 124 9 17 9 4 38 15 71 17 28 A Scheme of Arrangement (the “Scheme”) was
approved by shareholders of Old Hanson on
September 19, 2003, subsequently approved by the
Court on October 13, 2003 and became effective at
the close of business on October 14, 2003 (the
“Scheme Effective Date”). Under the Scheme,
shareholders in Old Hanson received, in substitution
for each of their ordinary shares of £2 in nominal 
value in Old Hanson, one ordinary share of 10p in
nominal value in New Hanson, following a reduction 
in the nominal capital of New Hanson approved by 
the Court on October 20, 2003 and effective from
October 21, 2003.
For the purposes of producing the Annual Report 
and Form 20-F of New Hanson, unless otherwise
expressly specified (a) references to the Company 
and its subsidiaries or Hanson and its subsidiaries, 
or the group, refer to Old Hanson and its subsidiaries
up to the close of business on the Scheme Effective
Date and to New Hanson (including Old Hanson) and
its subsidiaries as from that time and (b) references to
Hanson or the Company are to Old Hanson up to the
close of business on the Scheme Effective Date and 
to New Hanson as from that time. At the Scheme
Effective Date New Hanson had no business assets. 
Solely for the convenience of the reader, the Annual
Report and Form 20-F contains translations of certain
amounts in pounds sterling (“£”) or pence (“p”) into 
US dollars (“US dollars” or “$”) or cents (“c”). The
translations of pounds sterling and pence to US
dollars and cents appearing in the Annual Report and
Form 20-F have been made at the noon buying rate 
in New York City for cable transfers in pounds sterling
as certified for customs purposes by the Bank of 
New York (the “noon buying rate”) on the date of the
information so translated. These translations should 
not be construed as representations that the pound
sterling amounts actually represent such US dollar
amounts or could be converted into US dollars at the
rates indicated. On February 19, 2007 the noon buying
rate was $1.9499 per £1. For additional information on
exchange rates between the pound sterling and the
US dollar, see “Exchange Rates” on page 128 
of the Annual Report and Form 20-F.

Continental Europe (as such expressions are referred
to in the Annual Report and Form 20-F) is either a
holding company or divisional entity, and does not
itself carry out any of the business activities described
on page 58 of the Annual Report and Form 20-F. 
References to ‘we’, ‘our’ or ‘us’, unless the content
otherwise requires, is, in the context of a description 
of the group’s businesses, operational activities or
liabilities, a reference to those of the relevant
subsidiary company. References to Hanson or the
Company should, where appropriate, be construed as 
a reference to the group or one or more of the
Company’s subsidiaries. 
The market, industry and product segment data
contained in the Annual Report and Form 20-F have
been taken from industry and other sources available
to Hanson in the relevant jurisdictions and, in some
cases, adjusted based on relevant management’s
knowledge of the industry. Hanson has not
independently verified any third-party market
information. Similarly, while Hanson believes its 
internal estimates are reliable, they have not been
verified by independent sources. 
Some of the information included in the Annual 
Report and Form 20-F, including documents
incorporated by reference, are, or may be deemed to
be, “forward-looking statements” within the meaning
of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995
(United States). Such forward-looking statements are
subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors which
could cause actual results and developments to differ
materially from future results and developments
expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.
An investor can identify these statements by the fact
that they do not relate strictly to historical or current
facts. They use words such as ‘anticipate’, ‘estimate’,
‘expect’, ‘intend’, ‘will’, ‘project’, ‘plan’, ‘believe’ and other
words and terms of similar meanings in discussion of
future operating or financial performance. 
Such factors include, but are not limited to, changes 
in economic conditions, especially in the USA, the 
UK and Australia; changes in governmental policy 
or legislation relating to public works expenditure 
and housing; inclement weather conditions; the
competitive market in which we operate; changes in
governmental policy or legislation that could effect
regulatory compliance and other operating costs;
disruption to, or increased costs of, the supply of
materials, energy and fuel to our business; pension
and post-retirement healthcare costs; ineffective
implementation of computer software systems; our
inability to achieve success in our acquisition strategy;
exchange rate fluctuations; potential liabilities,
including asbestos, arising out of former businesses
and activities; adequacy of Koppers’ environmental
insurance and US litigation exposure. Hanson does
not undertake any obligation to update or revise
publicly such forward-looking statements. All written,
oral or other tangible and electronic forward-looking
statements attributable to Hanson or persons acting
on behalf of Hanson are expressly qualified in their
entirety by this cautionary statement.

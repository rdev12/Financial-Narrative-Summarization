This has been a challenging year for the T opps business in a difficult trading environment.
However, we are facing these challenges and managing the business in a robust and
prudent manner. We have delivered a credible financial performance in a tough operating
environment. I remain confident that our business will show resilience through this period
and we will be well positioned to capitalise on the strong foundations of the Company as
the economic situation improves.
Financial results
T otal Group revenue has been almost flat year-on-year at £208.1 million (2007: 
£207.9 million) with like-for-like revenue for the period showing a decline of 5.4% on 
last year. Operating profit for the period was £34.6 million (2007: £44.3 million) giving a
profit before tax of £27.7 million (2007: £37.8 million). Basic earnings per share is 9.56p
(2007: 15.09p). During the period our banking facilities were renegotiated with a relaxation
of both covenants associated with the debt and the facility has been extended to 2012.
There was a one-off arrangement fee of £0.5 million which will be amortised over the
remaining period of the facility. 
Dividend
In order to reduce net debt and improve the Company’ s financial flexibility, the Board has
decided not to pay a final dividend for this financial year. We believe this is in the best
interests of the business in the prevailing economic environment and we will continue 
to review the dividend policy on a bi-annual basis. 
Board changes
In March this year we announced the appointment of Alan White, currently CEO of 
N Brown Group plc, to the Board as a Non-Executive Director. His appointment 
was effective from 1 April 2008. In addition we also announced the resignation from 
the Board of Alan McIntosh with effect from 31 March 2008. I would like to thank 
Alan McIntosh for his support and contribution to the Company during his 10 years 
as Non-Executive Director.
We are also announcing that Victor Watson will not seek re-election at the next AGM, 
after 10 very successful years on the Board, Victor has decided to step down. I would 
like to thank Victor for all of his support and contribution to the Company.
Chairman’ s statement
I am confident that we can capitalise on our position 
as market leader as we trade through the current
economic cycle and expect to benefit significantly
when consumer confidence returns.

People 
The Company’ s staff are fundamental to the continuing success of the business. 
Their ability to deliver exceptional customer service is a key factor in differentiating 
T opps from its competitors and will contribute to the future success of the business. 
I would like to extend the Board’ s thanks and gratitude to everyone in the Company 
for their continuing efforts and hard work.
Outlook
We have a very resilient business model and an extremely capable team who are
managing the business prudently. The team have made significant progress during 
the year to ensure that the business is in the best possible condition for the year ahead. 
We have again tightened our cost base for the coming year, reviewed our plans for
growth, focused our attention on cash management, and extended our banking facilities.
The Board is confident that as a result of these actions the business can withstand a
sustained period of weak consumer activity.
I am confident that we can capitalise on our position as market leader as we trade
through the current economic cycle and expect to benefit significantly when consumer
confidence returns.

We have maintained our market leading position and expect to capitalise on this during
the coming year. We will achieve this by continuing to focus on excellent customer
service, outstanding value ranges and an anticipated contraction in the competition. 
We have delivered a credible performance and anticipate that our resilient business 
model will help us to create an even stronger business.
UK store development and expansion
We are pleased to have achieved our store opening target with a net 19 new stores
opened in the period. This now gives us an overall total of 320 trading outlets throughout
the UK. For the coming year we will focus the majority of our attention on improvements
to our existing estate. In the current economic climate we believe that a more cautious
approach to expansion is appropriate. We anticipate that an easing of pressures in the
property market should create opportunities for us to open a small number of new stores
in strong trading locations.
T opps Tiles
We have opened a net 17 new stores and now have a total of 263 T opps outlets. 
This includes 24 new openings offset by two closures, three relocations and two 
rebrands to Tile Clearing House (TCH).  
Alongside our traditional retail channel we have, this year, launched our first online business.
This offers a wide selection of our most popular ranges as well as some additional
complementary products not found in our stores. These include bathrooms accessories
and heated towel radiators. We have developed the online offer during the year and whilst
this element of the business is still in its infancy we look forward to it increasing sales as it
grows in popularity. Our online offer can be found at www.toppstiles.co.uk.
Tile Clearing House
Tile Clearing House remains focused on trade customers and jobbing builders, operating
a “cash and carry” type format. We have opened a net two new stores under the 
Tile Clearing House brand and now have a total of 57 outlets.
Holland
In Holland we have opened a further net two stores during the year taking the total to 22.
This consisted of three new openings and one closure due to a relocation. The business 
has had to contend with a difficult trading environment and a number of other issues.
Against this backdrop we have seen a decline in like-for-like revenues and the business
has generated a loss for the year. 
We have also conducted a review of the goodwill that arose on acquisition of the Dutch
business and decided that against the context of the current year’ s results and a more
cautious outlook for the future it is appropriate to impair the goodwill and write it down 
by £1.2 million to £nil in the current year. 
Chief Executive’ s statement
We will continue to maintain our focus on tight cost
control and prudent management of the business at
the same time as delivering the service element that
our customers expect. We intend to capitalise on 
our market leading position and believe that we will
emerge from the current economic situation a stronger
business and benefit significantly when consumer
confidence returns.

Whilst we operate a tight cost base which is appropriate for a small business, the key
issues which we are tackling are store sales density and gross profit margins. We have 
a new management team in place with a very clear agenda. They will be focused on
driving sales and improving margins by upweighting the mix of tile sales. The year ahead
is likely to be one of continued, measured progress with less focus on expansion than 
we have seen previously.
Marketing, advertising and sponsorship
Over the last year we ran both national and regional marketing and advertising
campaigns. These included the launch of a new TV advertising campaign on ITV . 
The campaign featured works of art created entirely from our tiles and wooden flooring,
with the adverts appearing on ITV three times a day straight after the national news. 
This campaign served us well through the year and we have achieved our goal of
continuing to build consumer awareness of the brand. During the year ahead we 
expect to focus on targeted regional and local marketing where the business requires it.
T opps Tiles is Britain's biggest supporter of community youth football and we currently
sponsor over 200 local teams nationwide. 
Staff development and customer service
A core part of our strategy is to deliver outstanding customer service. In order to provide
this we place the highest importance on the development of our staff to deliver an
excellent standard of service. We are rigorous in our recruitment and retention of capable,
ambitious people and are committed to the development and career progression of our
employees. We have a sophisticated in-store e-learning training system and additionally
we incentivise our staff with competitive employee benefit packages. 
We continue to differentiate our business from the competition in a number of ways. 
All of our stores carry a wide range and supply of stock, we offer a loan-a-tile service, a
free “How to” DVD, a tile cutting service and a buy-back service allowing customers to
“sell back” undamaged tiles within 45 days of purchase. In addition, we have teamed 
up with traders local to each of our stores to provide customers with a T opps approved
tile installation service. These services coupled with friendly and knowledgeable staff
offering expert technical advice led to 98.2% of customers surveyed expressing levels 
of satisfaction as “good to excellent” (2007: 97.6%).
Corporate responsibility
The management team at T opps Tiles is committed to conducting the Company’ s
business in a socially responsible manner, taking into consideration social, environmental
and ethical matters, whilst at the same time ensuring the Company achieves its
objectives. Our policy is published on our website at www.toppstiles.co.uk and 
more detail on our achievements can be found in this report.

 The market
T opps continues to be the leading tile retailer in the UK with a market share in excess 
of 22%. 
As consumers preferences continue to converge with European tastes the relatively 
low consumption of tiles per head in the UK compared with the rest of Europe 
(roughly one-third of Northern Europe, source: MBD) provides significant opportunities.
Consumers are continuing to refurbish the traditional tiling areas such as kitchens,
bathrooms and conservatories and are also increasingly extending into general 
living areas, helped by the broad range of under flooring heating products now 
commonly available.
During the year we have also seen a reduction in customer choice as some consolidation
in the retail market has taken place, particularly with smaller regional tile businesses.
Worldwide consumption for tiles, in particular in the more developed tile markets is 
likely to continue to weaken in the short term. This has begun to present some buying
opportunities, with regard to both price and terms. With a dedicated tile distribution
warehouse, T opps is well positioned to take advantage of these opportunities.
Current trading and outlook
In the seven weeks of the new financial period Group overall revenue decreased by
13.5% and like-for-like sales decreased by 18.3%.
At the half year we highlighted that the key driver of risk to the business was the general
economic climate and since then the economy has continued to weaken. The business 
is well equipped to deal with the current economic cycle and we have made good
progress in tightening our cost base for the coming year, focusing our attention on cash
management and improving our financial flexibility by renegotiating our banking facilities.
We will continue to maintain our focus on tight cost control and prudent management 
of the business at the same time as delivering the service element that our customers
expect. We intend to capitalise on our market leading position and believe that we will
emerge from the current economic situation a stronger business and benefit significantly
when consumer confidence returns.

Risks and uncertainties
The key risks to the business continue to be its relationship with key suppliers, the
potential threat of competitors, the risk that key information technology or EPOS 
systems could fail, the loss of key personnel, the risk of a prolonged economic downturn,
the impact of foreign exchange rates and the development of substitute products.
Following a modest weakening of results in the first half we highlighted at that time that
the key risk for the second half was the general economic climate. The deterioration in 
the economy has been more pronounced during the second half of the year and when
reviewing risks and uncertainties this is currently accounting for the majority of the 
Board’ s focus.
The business has responded to these risks by taking the appropriate action as described
in this report. Specifically, we have tightened our cost base, reviewed our plans for growth,
focused our attention on cash management, and renegotiated and extended our banking
facilities. We are also seeking to enhance and improve our retail operations where possible
by reviewing our product offer, customer service and marketing strategies.
We also highlighted at the half year point that an appreciation in the Euro had put 
pressure on gross margins as a result of our overseas sourcing. The US dollar has 
also strengthened over the course of the second half of the year. The current general
weakness of the Pound will put further pressure on margins for the coming year but we
are addressing this risk by constantly reviewing our sourcing opportunities. During the year
approximately 20% of purchases were sourced from overseas.
Post the end of the financial reporting period there have been significant reductions in
interest rates. The Group will see a small amount of direct benefit from this via our cash
interest charge, however, a more significant benefit would be the potential improvement 
in consumer confidence.
There are currently a number of risks and uncertainties that the Group is managing. 
If sales performance continues at the current levels we will need to manage costs and
cash even more tightly, however, the Board remains confident the business will continue 
in its ability to generate positive returns and meet all of its financial commitments in full.
The Directors will continue to routinely monitor of all of these risks and uncertainties and the
Board will take appropriate actions to mitigate the risks and/or their potential outcomes.
We have conducted a review of existing contractual relationships and have concluded
that there are none which are essential to the business.

Financial review
Profit and loss account
Revenue
Revenue for the period ended 27 September 2008 increased by 0.1% to £208.1 million
(2007: £207.9 million). Like-for-like store sales declined by 5.4% across the year, falling 
by 0.9% in the first half and 9.8% in the second half of the year. The deterioration in
performance reflects the tightening in the economy and the impact that this has had on
both the financial and consumer sector.
Gross margin
Overall gross margin was 61.8% compared with 62.8% last year. At the interim stage of
this period gross margin was 62.7%. In the second half of the period we have generated
a gross margin of 60.8%. Erosion of gross margin reflects exchange rate impacts and
also the pressure of the current trading environment. However, the relatively small
deterioration in gross margin reflects the Company’ s strong brand and business model 
as we are able to invest margin in a controlled way to drive transactions.
Operating expenses
T otal operating costs have increased from £86.2 million to £93.9 million, an increase 
of 8.9%. Costs as a percentage of sales were 45.1% compared to 41.4% last year.
The increase in costs has been mainly driven by our enlarged store estate. The average
number of stores trading during the financial period was 329 (2007: 303). This has
generated an increase in our total operating expenses of 7.3%.
Further to this there have been several non-recurring items as follows:
We have spent an additional £1.5 million on Group marketing activities, in particular 
a nationwide ITV1 television campaign.
We have incurred a £1.2 million (non-cash) charge for goodwill impairment in relation to
the acquisition of the Dutch joint venture. This reflects the Board’ s more cautious outlook
for the Dutch business as described in the Business Review section of this report.
Offsetting these additional charges, in part, is a saving of £1.1 million on management
bonuses compared to the previous financial period. This saving was due to management
bonus targets not being met during the period.
When taking these items into account, the underlying cost base has reduced by 0.2% 
for the year as a whole.
Operating profit
Operating profit for the period was £34.6 million (2007: £44.3 million). Operating profit 
as a percentage of sales was 16.6% (2007: 21.3%).
Underlying operating profit, excluding the non-cash goodwill impairment highlighted
above was £35.8 million (2007: £44.3 million).

Other gains and losses
Other gains and losses include the impact of property disposals. During the period we
completed the sale and leaseback of four freehold properties for £4.0 million, which
generated a £0.9 million profit on disposal (2007: £0.3 million).
Financing
The cash interest charge for the year was £6.3 million (2007: £6.3 million), excluding 
the impact of IAS 39 revaluations. Despite higher interest rates we have maintained the
interest charge at the same level of the prior year through a combination of reducing net
debt and also the economic benefit we have received from the interest rate derivatives 
we have in place.
The interest rate derivatives give rise to a “marked to market” revaluation per the
requirements of IAS 39 “Financial Instruments; Recognition and Measurement”. 
This revaluation has generated a fair value (non-cash) charge of £1.5 million (2007: 
£0.5 million). Due to the nature of the underlying financial instrument IAS 39 does not 
allow hedge accounting to be applied to these losses and hence this charge is being
applied direct to the income statement rather than offset against balance sheet reserves.
Net interest cover was 6.4 times based on earnings before interest, tax and depreciation,
excluding the impact of IAS 39 in finance charges.
Profit before tax
Reported profit before tax is £27.7 million (2007: £37.8 million).
Group profit before tax margin was 13.3% (2007: 18.2%).
Tax
The effective rate of Corporation T ax was 41.0% (2007: 32.0%).
There are a series of key items affecting the tax rate during the year, as follows:
The withdrawal of Industrial Buildings Allowances has resulted in a one-off deferred tax
charge of £1.1 million, accounting for 4.1% of the effective tax rate.
Changes to the capital allowances regime and prior year adjustments have impacted the
tax charge by £1.2 million, accounting for 4.4% of the effective tax rate.
The impairment of goodwill described under “Operating Expenses” does not qualify for
corporation tax relief, thereby increasing the effective tax rate by a further 1.2%.
The underlying tax rate, excluding the above items, was 31.3% (2007: 30.8%).
Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share were 9.56p (2007: 15.09p).
Diluted earnings per share were 9.55p (2007: 15.02p).

Dividend and dividend policy
In order to reduce net debt and improve the Company’ s financial flexibility, the Board has
decided not to pay a final dividend for this financial year. We believe this is in the best
interests of the business in the prevailing economic environment and we will continue 
to review the dividend policy on a bi-annual basis.
Balance sheet
Capital expenditure
Capital expenditure in the period amounted to £6.6 million (2007: £9.7 million). 
This includes the cost of developing two freehold sites for £1.2 million. In addition we 
have opened 33 new outlets at a cost of £3.8 million, refitted 11 existing sites at a cost 
of £0.6 million, plus a further £1.0 million on other associated activities.
At the period end the Group owned eight freehold or long leasehold sites including 
two warehouse and distribution facilities with a total net book value of £15.6 million 
(2007: £17.7 million).
Stock
Stock at the period end represents 140 days turnover compared with 146 days for the
same period last year.
Capital structure and treasury
Cash and cash equivalents at the period end were £14.0 million (2007: £15.8 million) with
repayable borrowings at £106.0 million (2007: £111.0 million).
This gives the Group a net debt position of £92.0 million compared to £95.2 million as 
at 1 October 2007.
During the period we renegotiated our current loan facility, securing a favourable relaxation
of the covenants associated with our debt and an extension of the facility to January
2012. There is an associated one-off fee of £0.5 million which will be amortised over 
the remaining period of the facility.
Cash flow
Cash generated by operations was £38.7 million, compared to £49.8 million last year.
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting for the period to 27 September 2008 will be held on

Corporate Social Responsibility (“CSR”) continues to gain increasing importance in all
modern businesses and T opps Tiles is no exception. We have been working on our 
CSR agenda since 2004 when we established a working party chaired by a main Board
Director. We are proud of   our achievements in this area and focus our attentions across
four primary areas:
� Community Relations
� Environment
� Workplace and Employees
� Supply Chain
The Group is a constituent member of the FTSE4Good Index of socially responsible UK
quoted companies. The FTSE4Good Index is designed to measure the performance 
of companies that meet globally recognised corporate responsibility standards and to
facilitate investment in those companies where CSR issues are an influencing factor in 
the investors’ decision making process. We aim to comply with the criteria set by the
operators of this index and are actively engaged in the continued developments of our
CSR policies to ensure ongoing compliance.
Community relations
T opps Tiles has been actively involved in supporting community relations over a long
period of time, through our association with youth football. T opps provides new kits and
equipment to junior teams local to our stores, a simple and effective way of reaching out
to all our local communities and which makes us one of the biggest supporters of youth
football in the UK. We currently support over 200 teams with plans to extend this to every
store over the coming year. 
In addition to our football sponsorship, T opps has also been a long term supporter of a
nominated corporate charity. For the past six years we have supported Asthma UK and
have successfully raised in excess of £600,000 for their worthy causes over that period.
We are very proud of our association with Asthma UK and we wish them the very best 
of luck in all of their future fundraising efforts.
In July we hosted our seventh annual charity Golf Day where UK and overseas suppliers 
meet with T opps friends and colleagues to raise money. The day was dedicated to 
The Prince’ s Trust and we successfully raised £18,985 to support the Trust’ s work with
disadvantaged young people.
“Every penny raised goes to the cause rather than
overheads. With the help of Royalty , celebrities, the
media and thousands of decent, ordinary people 
we have already raised over £12 million. There is a
great deal more to be done and we are indebted to
T opps Tiles for their decision to support our work”.

Kate Burt, The Prince’ s Trust Deputy Director of Fundraising, confirmed: “we need
visionary companies who believe that through investing in young people you can change
lives forever. We are delighted that T opps Tiles was inspired to join us and help more
young people realise their potential.”
We have recently begun work with our new corporate charity, Help for Heroes. 
Founded in 2007, Help for Heroes funds specialist rehabilitation and adaptive training for
servicemen and women maimed in the service of our country in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Many wounded servicemen and women come from communities served by our stores
and we want to give Help for Heroes the biggest “thank you” we can. We aim to make
this our biggest ever fundraising drive and during the coming year our stores will be
staging their own Heroes Days with sponsored exploits by “homegrown heroes” who 
will compete for the coveted title of T opps No.1 Help for Heroes fundraiser 
Help for Heroes founder, Bryn Parry, confirmed: “Every penny raised goes to the cause
rather than overheads. With the help of Royalty, celebrities, the media and thousands 
of decent, ordinary people we have already raised over £12 million. There is a great 
deal more to be done and we are indebted to T opps Tiles for their decision to support 
our work”.
Environment
There are three primary areas where our business potentially impacts the environment.
These are property, waste and transport. We regularly review our progress in these areas
and endeavour to use the most environmentally responsible practices possible.
Property – energy is a major driver of cost for the business and also forms a significant
part of our environmental impact. Energy efficient technology, including low energy
lighting, helps to reduce the impact and we are continuing trials to reduce further our
environmental impact by adopting new technology wherever possible. 
Waste – waste management is an important area for our business and we recycle as
much as possible. Stores return paper, plastic and cardboard to the central warehouse 
for recycling.

Environment (continued)
Our offices recycle all used paper, the majority of which is shredded and used as
packaging. We continue to move our reporting away from being paper based and issue
increasing numbers of reports in electronic format. 
Transport – during the year we have started a move towards consolidation of deliveries 
to stores. This means that we will reduce our reliance on third party transport further and
be able to achieve more of the deliveries required from our existing capacity. This has 
the benefit of reducing the overall mileage and also reduces emissions as a result of us
operating our own modern and efficient fleet of vehicles. All new lorries comply with the
Euro 4 emissions regulations and come ready equipped with driver efficiency monitoring
systems. This technology enables us to plan the most efficient routes and also monitor
our drivers’ performance. All new vehicles this year now have new generation engines
giving in the region of a 16% saving on fuel. Our new trailers are now specially designed
for better weight distribution allowing more weight to be carried and less tyre wear.
Workplace and employees
We have a duty to our employees to provide them with a safe and comfortable working
environment. We maintain regular dialogues with staff and our in-house Health and Safety
team carries out regular assessment to ensure that this is happening. We also operate a
Health and Safety Committee which meets on a regular basis and is chaired by a main
Board Director.
Communication with our employees is vital and we have initiatives in place to ensure
regular and effective dialogue with staff. We produce a bi-monthly in-house magazine
which updates all employees on what is happening across the business.
In addition we operate an employee suggestion scheme which is overseen by our 
Chief Executive, Matthew Williams. This helps to improve the business across a number
of areas.
We have a policy of internal promotion, where possible, and actively encourage our 
staff to apply for internal vacancies and promotions. T o support this we conduct 
regular dialogues with employees on job and career development. We are committed 
to being an equal opportunities employer and have policies in place which are clearly
communicated to all of our staff. In April 2008 the Company retained its Investors in
People award for a further three years. This award recognises our continued efforts to
ensure that all staff understand the goals of the Company and are fully trained to ensure
they can contribute fully to achieving these goals.

Supply chain
We source our goods for resale from around the world including tiles, natural stone,
wooden flooring and adhesives. Labour standards, factory conditions and human rights
are issues we take seriously. T o address any possible concerns our buyers conduct regular
supplier visits and factory tours and also insert a clause into all contracts with suppliers
which stipulates our requirements. We have also developed a policy on timber products
and have adopted the principles and criteria of the Forest Stewardship Council as 
our benchmark.

T opps Tiles Plc
Annual Report & Financial Statements 2008 Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial statements in
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial period. The Directors are required by the IAS
Regulation to prepare the Group financial statements under IFRSs as adopted by the European Union. The Group’ s financial statements
are also required by law to be properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that IFRS financial statements present fairly for each financial period the Group’ s financial
position, financial performance and cash flows. This requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events 
and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and expenses set out in the
International Accounting Standards Board’ s “Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements”. In virtually 
all circumstances, a fair presentation will be achieved by compliance with all applicable IFRSs. Directors are also required to:
� properly select and apply accounting policies;
� present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable
information; and 
� provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to understand
the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’ s financial position and financial performance.
The Directors have elected to prepare the parent Company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). The parent Company financial statements are 
required by law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company. In preparing these financial statements, the Directors 
are required to:
� select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
� make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and
� state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained 
in the financial statements.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial
position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the parent Company financial statements comply with the Companies Act
1985. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Company’ s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ responsibility statement
We confirm to the best of our knowledge:
1) the Group’ s financial statements, prepared in accordance with IFRS, and the Company’ s financial statements, prepared in
accordance with UK Accounting Standards, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and
2) the Business Review, which is incorporated into the Directors’ Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of
the business and the position of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with 
a description of the principal risks and uncertainties they face.
After making enquiries, the Directors have formed a judgement, at the time of approving the financial statements, that there is a
reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
For this reason the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.

Directors’ Report (continued) Corporate governance statement
Corporate governance statement
The Company is committed to the principles of corporate governance contained in the Combined Code of Corporate Governance 
that was issued in 2006 by the Financial Reporting Council (“the Code”) for which the Board is accountable to shareholders. 
Statement of compliance with the Code of Best Practice
The Company has complied throughout the period with the Provisions of the Code of Best Practice set out in section 1 of the Code
except for provision A.6.1, as the Board does not currently undertake formal appraisal of its own performance and that of its
committees. The Company complies with all other provisions of the code.
The Board of Directors comprises seven members, of whom three are independent Non-Executive Directors and three are Executive
Directors, led by the Company’ s Non-Executive Chairman, Mr. Barry Bester. The Senior Independent Non-Executive Director is the 
Rt. Hon. Michael Jack, who also chairs the Audit Committee. Brief biographical details of all Directors are given on pages 20 and 21.
The Board meets at least 12 times a year. Certain defined issues are reserved for the Board including approval of financial statements
and circulars, annual budgets, strategy, Directors’ appointments, service agreements and remuneration, internal control and risk
management, corporate governance, key external and internal appointments and pensions and employee incentives.
In advance of Board Meetings Directors are supplied with up-to-date information about trading performance the Group’ s overall financial
position and its achievement against prior year, budgets and forecasts. 
Where required, a Director may seek independent professional advice at the expense of the Company. All Directors have access to the
Company Secretary and they may also address specific issues to the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director. 
In accordance with the Articles of Association, all Directors are subject to re-election every third year. Directors are elected at the first
AGM after appointment, therefore, Alan White will be subject to election at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. The Board regards
Mr. White to be independent and considers his broad retail experience and position as a CEO of a Plc business to be of great benefit 
to the Group. 
All Non-Executive Directors have written letters of appointment. These letters of appointment stipulate three-year renewable terms 
of office. In line with the Code all Non-Executive Directors who have served for nine years or more will be subject to annual re-election. 
As such, the Rt. Hon. Michael Jack will be subject to re-election at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. Although his length of
service exceeds nine years the Board regards him to be independent and considers his broad based commercial experience and
extensive business specific knowledge to be extremely beneficial. 
Mr. Victor Watson will not seek re-election at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting and will retire from the Board effective from the
date of the Annual General Meeting.
The Board considers that Messrs. Alan White and the Rt. Hon. Michael Jack are independent for the purposes of the Code. The terms
and conditions for the appointment of Non-Executive Directors are available for inspection on request.
The Board will review the independence of Non-Executive Directors on an ongoing basis.
The Board also operates three committees. These are the Nomination Committee, the Remuneration Committee and the Audit
Committee. All of these committees meet regularly and have formal written terms of reference which are available for inspection 
on request.

Code of Best Practice as reported above. Further explanation of how the Principles have been applied in connection with Directors’

Audit Committee
The Audit Committee consists of Non-Executive Directors. The Chairman is the Rt. Hon. Michael Jack, the other members are

Interim financial statements before submission to the Board. The Committee reviews the arrangements by which staff may, in confidence,

system of internal control and reports its findings twice yearly to the Board. The Committee meets with the external auditors, the rest of
the Board attend at the invitation of Audit Committee Chairman.
As stated above, part of the role of the Audit Committee is to review the independence of the Company’ s auditors. The Company’ s
external auditors, Deloitte & T ouche LLP have provided non-audit services to the Company in the form of tax advice. The Audit
Committee is aware that providing audit and non-audit advice could give rise to a potential conflict of interest. The Audit Committee 
has concluded that the auditors, Deloitte & T ouche LLP , are independent.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee is chaired by Victor Watson. The other members are Alan White and the Rt. Hon. Michael Jack. The formal
terms of reference for this Committee require it to make recommendations to the Board for appointments of Directors and other senior
executive staff. 
Appointments to the Board are made on merit, against objective criteria, taking into account the skills and experience required. 
Where appropriate, external search consultants are enlisted.
Dialogue with institutional shareholders
The Directors seek to build on a mutual understanding of objectives between the Company and its institutional shareholders by making
annual presentations and communicating regularly throughout the year. The Company also posts financial information on its website
www.toppstiles.co.uk.
Maintenance of a sound system of internal control
The Board has applied Principle C.2 of the Combined Code by establishing a continuous process for identifying, evaluating and
managing the significant risks the Group faces. The Board regularly reviews the process, which has been put in place from the start of
the period to the date of the approval of this report and which is in accordance with the revised guidance on internal control published 
in October 2005 (The Turnbull Guidance). The Board is responsible for the Group’ s system of internal control and for reviewing its
effectiveness. Such a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can 
only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
In compliance with Provision C.2.1 of the Combined Code, the Board continuously reviews the effectiveness of the Group’ s system 
of internal control. The Board’ s monitoring covers all controls, including financial, operational and compliance controls and risk
management. It is based principally on reviewing reports from management to consider whether significant risks are identified, 
evaluated, managed and controlled and whether any significant weaknesses are promptly remedied and indicate a need for more
extensive monitoring. The Board has also performed a specific assessment for the purposes of this Annual Report. This assessment
considers all significant aspects of internal control arising during the period covered by the report including the work of internal audit. 
The Audit Committee assists the Board in discharging its review responsibilities.
During the course of its review of the system of internal control, the Board has not identified nor been advised of any failings or
weaknesses which it has determined to be significant. Therefore a confirmation in respect of necessary actions has not been 
considered appropriate.  T opps Tiles Plc

Remuneration Report
Introduction
This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985. The report also meets the relevant
requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the principles relating to
the Directors’ remuneration in the Combined Code. As required by the Act, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the
Annual General Meeting of the Company at which the financial statements will be approved.
The Act requires the auditors to the Company’ s members on certain parts of the Directors’ Remuneration Report and to state whether
their opinion on those parts of the report have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. The report has
therefore been divided into separate sections for the audited and unaudited information.
Unaudited information
Remuneration Committee
The Company has established a Remuneration Committee, which is constituted in accordance with the recommendations of the
Combined Code. The members of the committee are the Rt. Hon. Michael Jack, Victor Watson and Alan White who are all independent
Non-Executive Directors. The Committee is chaired by the Rt. Hon. Michael Jack.
None of the Committee has any personal financial interest (other than as shareholders), conflicts of interests arising from cross-
directorships or day-to-day involvement in running the business. The Committee makes recommendations to the Board. No Director
plays a part in any discussion about his own remuneration.
Remuneration policy
Executive remuneration packages are prudently designed to attract, motivate and retain Directors of the high calibre needed to maintain
the Group’ s position as a market leader and to reward them for enhancing value to shareholders. The performance measurement 
of the Executive Directors and key members of senior management and the determination of their annual remuneration package are
undertaken by the Committee. The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is determined by the Board within limits set out in the
Articles of Association.
There are three main elements of the remuneration package for Executive Directors:
� basic annual salary (including Directors’ fees) and benefits;
� annual bonus payments; and
� pension arrangements.
Basic salary
An Executive Director’ s basic salary is reviewed and determined by the Committee prior to the beginning of each year and when an
individual changes position or responsibility. In deciding appropriate levels, the Committee considers the Group as a whole and relies on
objective research which gives up-to-date information on a comparator group of companies. Basic salaries were reviewed in September
2008 with no increases taking effect this year. Executive Director’ s contracts of service, which include details of remuneration, will be
available for inspection at the Annual General Meeting.
In addition to basic salary, the Executive Directors receive certain benefits-in-kind, principally a car and private medical insurance.
Annual bonus payments
A discretionary annual cash bonus scheme represents the short term incentive element of the overall remuneration package for 
Mr. Williams, Mr. Parker and Mr. Ounstead. The Remuneration Committee establishes the objectives that must be met in the financial
period if a cash bonus is to be paid. The maximum bonus achievable in the period was 100% of basic salary based on Group
performance against budgeted operating profit. For the period ending 27 September 2008 there will be no bonus paid. The annual
bonus scheme for the period to September 2009 is also up to a max of 100% of basic salary based upon the achievement of budgeted
Group operating profit.
Pension arrangements
Mr. Bester, Mr. Ounstead and Mr. Parker received contributions into their own personal pension schemes as disclosed in the table 
on page 31. T opps Tiles Plc

Directors’ contracts
Executive Directors
It is the Company’ s policy that Executive Directors are offered permanent contracts of employment providing for a maximum of 
six months’ notice.
Non-Executive Directors
All Non-Executive Directors have specific terms of engagement and their remuneration is determined by the Board within the limits 
set by the Articles of Association and based on independent surveys of fees paid to Non-Executive Directors of similar companies. 
The basic fee paid to each Non-Executive Director in the period was £33,000. It is the Company’ s policy that Non-Executive Directors
should have contracts with an indefinite term providing for a maximum of six months notice. Non-Executive Directors cannot participate
in any of the Company’ s share option schemes and are not eligible to join the Company’ s pension scheme.
The details of the Non-Executive Directors’ contracts are summarised in the table below:
Date of contract or letter Unexpired Notice
Name of Director of appointment term period
B.F.J Bester 27 May 1997 n/a 6 months
J.M. Jack 26 January 1999 n/a 6 months
V.H. Watson (*retires 13 January 2009) 27 May 1997 n/a 6 months
A. White 1 April 2008 n/a 6 months
Performance graph
The following graph shows the Company’ s performance, measured by total shareholder return (“TSR”), compared with the performance
of the FTSE 250 Index also measured by TSR. The index chosen for the comparison demonstrates the Group’ s TSR in comparison to
the average for FTSE 250 companies.
This index has changed from prior year (was previously FTSE MID 250) but the comparative remains consistent and presents a similar
picture. The FTSE 250 index is considered a relevant comparator as the business has formed a part of this index for the majority of the
time period presented.

Annual Report & Financial Statements 2008

We have audited the group financial statements of T opps Tiles Plc for the 52 weeks ended 27 September 2008 which comprise the
consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense, the consolidated balance sheet, 
the consolidated cash flow statement, and the related notes 1 to 30. These group financial statements have been prepared under the
accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as
having been audited.
We have reported separately on the parent company financial statements of T opps Tiles Plc for the 52 weeks ended 27 September 2008. 
This report is made solely to the company’ s members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’ s members those matters we are required to state to 
them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. T o the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility 
to anyone other than the company and the company’ s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we
have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, the Remuneration Report and the group financial statements in accordance
with applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union are set out in the Statement
of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the group financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited in
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the group financial statements give a true and fair view, whether the group financial
statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and whether
the part of the Remuneration Report described as having been audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies
Act 1985. We also report to you whether, in our opinion, the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the group
financial statements. The information given in the Directors’ Report includes that specific information presented in the Business Review
that is cross referred from the Business Review section of the Directors’ Report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if
information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate governance statement reflects the company’ s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2006
Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are 
not required to consider whether the board’ s statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the
effectiveness of the group’ s corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited group financial
statements. The other information comprises only the Directors’ Report, the Chairman’ s statement, the Chief Executive’ s statement, 
the unaudited part of the Remuneration Report, the Business Review and the Corporate governance statement. We consider the
implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the group financial
statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any further information outside the Annual Report.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board.
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the group financial statements
and the part of the Remuneration Report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements
made by the directors in the preparation of the group financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate 
to the group’ s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to
provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the group financial statements and the part of the Remuneration
Report to be audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion
we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the group financial statements and the part of the
Remuneration Report to be audited.

1 General information
T opps Tiles Plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985. The address of the registered
office is given on page 22. The nature of the Group’ s operations and its principal activity is set out in the Directors’ Report on page 24.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in
which the Group operates. Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 2j.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following standards and interpretations which have not been applied 
in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective:
Standards and interpretations in issue but not yet effective 
IFRS 8 Operating Segments 
IAS 23 Amendment “Borrowing Costs” 
IFRS 3 Revised “Business Combinations” 
IAS 27 Amendment “Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements” 
IFRS 2 Amendment to “Share-Based Payment” 
IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements 
IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes 
IFRIC 14 IAS 19 – The Limit on a Deferred Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction 
IFRIC 15 Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate 
IFRIC 16 Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on 
the financial statements of the Group.
Adoption of new and revised standards
In the current year, the Group has adopted IFRS 7 Financial instruments: Disclosures which is effective for annual reporting periods
beginning on or after 1 January 2007 and the related amendment to IAS 1: Presentation of Financial Statements. The impact of the
adoption of IFRS 7 and changes to IAS 1 has been to expand the disclosures provided in these financial statements regarding the
Group’ s financial instruments and management of capital. (See notes 2o, 15, 17 and 19).
2 Accounting policies
a) Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs). The financial
statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRS’ s adopted by the European Union and therefore the Group financial
statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS regulation. The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis,
except for the revaluation of financial instruments. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
b) Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company
(its subsidiaries) made up to the Saturday nearest to the 30 September each year. Control is achieved where the Company has 
the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or sold are consolidated for the periods from or to the date on which control passed. 
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
c) Financial period
The accounting period ends on the Saturday which falls closest to 30 September, resulting in financial periods of either 
52 or 53 weeks.
Throughout the financial statements, Directors’ Report and financial review, references to 2008 mean at 27 September 2008 
or the 52 weeks then ended; references to 2007 mean at 29 September 2007 or the 52 weeks then ended.
d) Business combinations
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the
aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued
by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination. The acquiree’ s
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised at their fair
value at the acquisition date, except for non-current assets (or disposal Groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance
with IFRS 5: Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, which are recognised and measured at fair value less
costs to sell.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business
combination over the Group’ s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
Notes to the financial statements
For the 52 week period ending 27 September 2008 T opps Tiles Plc

2 Accounting policies (continued)
e) Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’ s interest in the fair value of the
identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is
subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill which is recognised as an asset is reviewed for
impairment at least annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’ s cash-generating units expected to benefit from
the synergies of the combination. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, 
or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating 
unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill
allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. 
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRSs has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject
to being tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill of £15,080,000 written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not
been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
f) Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods 
and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes. Sales of goods are
recognised when title has passed. Sales returns are provided for based on past experience and deducted from income.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable,
which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’ s
net carrying amount.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders’ rights to receive payment have been established.
g) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, less estimated residual value, over their estimated useful lives, 
on the following bases:
Freehold buildings 2% per annum on cost on a straight-line basis
Short leasehold land and buildings over the period of the lease, up to 25 years on a straight-line basis
Fixtures and fittings over 10 years or at 25% per annum on reducing balance basis as appropriate
Motor vehicles 25% per annum on reducing balance
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Residual value is calculated on prices prevailing at the date of acquisition.
h) Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value and relate solely to finished goods for resale. Cost comprises
purchase price of materials and an attributable proportion of distribution overheads based on normal levels of activity and is valued
at standard cost. Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price, less further costs expected to be incurred to completion
and costs to be incurred – marketing, selling and distribution. Provision is made for those items of inventory where the net realisable
value is estimated to be lower than cost. 
i) Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. T axable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income
statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items
that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’ s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using 
the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred
tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary
differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition
of goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that
affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.

2 Accounting policies (continued)
i) Taxation (continued)
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, and interests in jointly
controlled entities, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the
temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, 
in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax
liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax
assets and liabilities on a net basis.
j) Foreign currency
Transactions in currencies other than the entity’ s functional currency (foreign currencies) are recorded at the rates of exchange
prevailing on the dates of transactions. At each period end, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies
are retranslated at the rates prevailing on that date. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign
currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are
measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included in the
income statement for the period. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are
included in profit or loss for the period except for differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which
gains and losses are recognised directly in equity. For such non-monetary items, any exchange component of that gain or loss is
also recognised directly in equity.
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’ s foreign operation are
translated at exchange rates prevailing at period end dates. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange 
rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during the period, in which case the exchange rates at the dates 
of transactions are used. Exchange differences arising are classified as equity and transferred to the Group’ s translation reserve.
Such differences are recognised as income or expense in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
k) Leases
Rentals under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term, even if the payments are not made on such
a basis. Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to sign an operating lease are similarly spread on a straight-line basis over
the lease term.
l) Investments
Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
m) Retirement benefit costs
For defined contribution schemes, the amount charged to the income statement in respect of pension costs is the contributions
payable in the year. Differences between contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid are shown as either
accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.
n) Finance costs
Finance costs which are directly attributable to the construction of tangible fixed assets are capitalised as part of the cost of those
assets. The commencement of capitalisation begins when both finance costs and expenditures for the asset are being incurred 
and activities that are necessary to get the asset ready for use are in progress. Capitalisation ceases when substantially all the
activities that are necessary to get the asset ready for use are complete.
All other finance costs of debt are recognised in the income statement over the term of the debt at a constant rate on the 
carrying amount
o) Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group’ s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the
contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets are classified into the following specified categories: financial assets “at fair value through profit or loss” (FVTPL,
“held-to-maturity” investments, “available-for-sale” (AFS) financial assets and “loans and receivables”. The classification depends 
on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition.
Financial assets at FVTPL
Financial assets are classified as at FVTPL where the financial asset is either held for trading or it is designated as at FVTPL. 
The Group has no designated FVTPL financial assets. T opps Tiles Plc
Annual Report & Financial Statements 2008
40
2 Accounting policies (continued)
o) Financial instruments (continued)
A financial asset is classified as held for trading if:
• it has been acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the near future or
• it is a part of an identified portfolio of financial instruments that the Group manages together and has a recent actual pattern of
short-term profit-taking; or
• it is a derivative that is not designated and effective as a hedging instrument.
Financial assets at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss recognised in profit or loss. The net gain or loss
recognised in profit or loss incorporates any dividend or interest earned on the financial asset. Fair value is determined in the manner
described in note 2t.
Loans and receivables
Trade receivables, loans, and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market 
are classified as loans and receivables. Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method,
less any impairment. Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables when 
the recognition of interest would be immaterial.
Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets, other than those at FVTPL, are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date. Financial assets
are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the
financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been impacted.
For certain categories of financial asset, such as trade receivables, assets that are assessed not to be impaired individually are
subsequently assessed for impairment on a collective basis. Objective evidence of impairment for a portfolio of receivables could
include the Group’ s past experience of collecting payments, an increase in the number of delayed payments in the portfolio past the
average credit period of 94 days, as well as observable changes in national or local economic conditions that correlate with default
on receivables.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception of
trade receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account. When a trade receivable is
considered uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are
credited against the allowance account. Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in profit or loss.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event
occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss to the
extent that the carrying amount of the investment at the date the impairment is reversed does not exceed what the amortised cost
would have been had the impairment not been recognised.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are
readily convertible to a known amount of cash within three months and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Derecognition of financial assets
The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire; or it transfers the
financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. If the Group neither transfers nor
retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Group recognises its
retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Group retains substantially all the risks
and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises 
a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. 
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities,
Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Financial liabilities are classified as at FVTPL where the financial liability is either held for trading or it is designated as at FVTPL. 
The Group does not have any designated FVTPL liabilities.
A financial liability is classified as held for trading if:
• it has been incurred principally for the purpose of disposal in the near future; or
• it is a part of an identified portfolio of financial instruments that the Group manages together and has a recent actual pattern 
of short-term profit taking; or
• it is a derivative that is not designated and effective as a hedging instrument.

2 Accounting policies (continued)
o) Financial instruments (continued)
Financial liabilities at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss recognised in profit or loss. The net gain or loss
recognised in profit or loss incorporates any interest paid on the financial liability. Fair value is determined in the manner described 
in note 2t.
Other financial liabilities
Other financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs. Other financial liabilities 
are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective
yield basis. The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest
expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments
through the expected life of the financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period.
Derecognition of financial liabilities
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’ s obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire.
Derivative financial instruments
The Group’ s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
The Group uses foreign exchange forward contracts and interest rate swap contracts to manage these exposures. The Group does
not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’ s policies approved by the Board of Directors, on the use of 
financial derivatives.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to
their fair value at each balance sheet date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss immediately.
A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is more than 
12 months and it is not expected to be realised or settled within 12 months. Other derivatives are presented as current assets or
current liabilities.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks 
and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts and the host contracts are not measured at fair value 
with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss.
p) Share-based payments
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-Based Payments. In accordance with the transitional provisions, 
IFRS 2 will be applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 October 2005.
The Group issues equity settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity settled share-based payments are 
measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the share-based payment is expensed 
on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’ s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. Fair value is
measured by use of the Black Scholes model. 
The Group provides employees with the ability to purchase the Group’ s ordinary shares at 80% of the current market value through
the operation of its share save scheme. The Group records an expense, based on its estimate of the 20% discount related to shares
expected to vest on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
q) Trade payables
Trade payables are initially measured at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest 
rate method.
r) Profit from operations
Profit from operations is stated after charging restructuring costs but before property disposals, investment income and finance costs.
s) Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Group will
be required to settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the
obligation at the balance sheet date, and are discounted to present value where the effect is material. T opps Tiles Plc
Annual Report & Financial Statements 2008

2 Accounting policies (continued)
t) Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the application of the Group’ s accounting policies, which are described above, the Directors are required to make judgements,
estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. 
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised 
in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods 
if the revision affects both current and future periods.
The following are the critical judgements, apart from those involving estimations (which are dealt with separately below), that the
Directors have made in the process of applying the Group’ s accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the
amounts recognised in financial statements.
Management consider the detailed criteria for the recognition of revenue from the sale of goods set out in IAS 18 Revenue and, 
in particular, whether the Group has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods and only
recognise revenue where this is the case.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have 
a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are
discussed below.
Impairment of goodwill
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which goodwill
has been allocated. The value in use calculation requires the entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the 
cash-generating unit and to discount by a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value. The carrying amount of
goodwill at the balance sheet date is £0.2 million. During the period the Group has incurred an impairment charge of £1.2 million.
(Details of the impairment charge calculation are provided in note 12.)
Fair value of derivatives and other financial instruments
As described above the Directors use their judgement in selecting an appropriate valuation technique for financial instruments 
not quoted in an active market. Valuation techniques commonly used by market practitioners are applied, such as discounted 
cash flows and assumptions regarding market volatility.
Tax
The Directors are aware of the material impact that corporation tax has on the Group accounts and therefore they ensure that the
Group continues to provide at a sufficient level for both current and deferred tax liabilities.

12 Goodwill (continued)
The recoverable amounts are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for the value in use calculations 
are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates discount rates based on the Group’ s weighted average cost of capital. The growth rates are based on
industry growth forecasts. Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future
changes in the market. Discounted cash flows are calculated using a post tax rate of 5.8% (2007: 7.5%).
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the next 
five years and extrapolates cash flows for the following five years based on an estimated growth rate of 2%. This rate does not
exceed the average long term growth rate for the relevant markets.
As a result of the annual test of impairment of goodwill, the Directors have decided that an impairment of the goodwill relating to 
the Dutch operation is prudent at this stage. The review of the business valuation has taken into account the operating loss in 
the period of £758,000 and local managements internal budgets and expectations for the next five years. As a result of this, it is
considered that a business valuation can support the carrying value of the current tangible fixed assets, but not the goodwill that
arose on acquisition. Therefore the Group has impaired the full carrying value of goodwill relating to the acquisition of T opps 
Holding BV .

The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables at 27 September 2008 and 29 September 2007
approximates to their fair value on the basis of discounted cash flow analysis.
Credit risk
The Group’ s principal financial assets are bank balances and cash and trade receivables.
The Group considers that it has no significant concentration of credit risk. The majority of sales in the business are cash based sales
in the stores.
T otal trade receivables (net of allowances) held by the Group at 27 September 2008 amounted to £0.5 million (2007: £0.4 million).
These amounts mainly relate to insurance generated sales and sundry trade accounts. In relation to these sales, the average 
credit period taken is 94 days and no interest is charged on the receivables. Trade receivables between 60 days and 120 days are
provided for based on estimated irrecoverable amounts from the sale of goods, determined by reference to past default experience.
Before accepting any new customer, the Group uses an external credit scoring system to assess the potential customer’ s credit
quality and defines credit limits by customer. Limits and scoring attributed to customers are reviewed periodically. Of the trade
receivables balance at the end of the year, £137,000 (2007: £46,000) is due from Independent Inspections, the Group’ s largest
customer. There are no other customers who represent more than 5% of the total balance of trade receivables.
Included in the Group’ s trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of £228,000 (2007: £92,000) which are past 
due at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the
amounts are still considered recoverable. The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances. The average age of these
receivables is 200 days (2007: 340 days), however this ageing is distorted by one account of £6,000 (2007: two accounts totalling
£6,300) which is overdue by 1,092 days (2007: 834 days).

The allowance for doubtful debts was £5,000 at the beginning and end of the period (2007: £5,000). Given the minimal receivable
balance, the Directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.
The allowance for doubtful debts includes no individually impaired trade receivables (2007: £nil) which have been placed 
under liquidation.
16 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash held by the Group and short-term bank deposits (with associated right of set off) with 
an original maturity of three months or less. The carrying amount of these assets approximates their fair value. A breakdown of
significant bank and cash balances by currency is as follows:

Trade payables and accruals principally comprise amounts outstanding for trade purchases and ongoing costs. The average credit
period taken for trade purchases is 48 days (2007: 65 days). No interest is charged on these payables.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade payables at 27 September 2008 and 29 September 2007 approximates 
to their fair value on the basis of discounted cash flow analysis.

The Group borrowings are arranged at floating rates, thus exposing the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
The Group has one principal bank loan of £116 million taken out on 1 August 2006. During the period the banking facilities were
renegotiated with a relaxation of both covenants associated with the debt. Repayments commenced on 28 July 2007 and will
continue for an extended period until 28 January 2012. There was a one-off arrangement fee of £0.5 million which is being
amortised over the remaining period of the facility. The loan is secured by upstream guarantees provided by certain subsidiaries. 
The LIBOR margin shall be adjusted between 1.5% and 2.75% dependent on the Group’ s level of compliance with a net debt 
to EBITDA covenant.
At 27 September 2008, the Group had available £5 million (2007: £5 million) of undrawn committed banking facilities. T opps Tiles Plc

The Group considers itself to be exposed to risks on financial instruments, including market risk (including currency risk), credit risk,
liquidity risk and cash flow interest rate risk. 
The Group seeks to minimise the effects of these risks by using derivative financial instruments to hedge these risk exposures
economically. The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’ s policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide
written principles on foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, the use of financial derivatives and non-derivative financial
instruments and the investment of excess liquidity. The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative
financial instruments, for speculative purposes. 
Market risks
The Group’ s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. 
The Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency 
risk, including: 
• forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on the import of goods from South America 
and China; and
• interest rate swaps and collars to mitigate the risk of movements in interest rates.

Foreign currency risk management
The Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Hence, exposures to exchange rate fluctuations
arise. Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising forward foreign exchange contracts. 
The carrying amounts of the Group’ s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date
are as follows:
Assets Liabilities
2008 2007 2008 2007
£’000 £’000 £’000 £’000
Euro 1,471 552 5,278 4,889
US dollar 317 – 323 1,091
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
The Group is mainly exposed to the currency of the Netherlands (Euro currency) and the currency of China and Brazil (US dollar
currency) and stock purchases from various European countries (Euro). The following table details the Group’ s sensitivity to a 
10% increase and decrease in the Sterling against the relevant foreign currencies. 10% represents management’ s assessment 
of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates. The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency
denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 10% change in foreign currency rates. 
The sensitivity analysis includes external loans as well as loans to foreign operations within the Group where the denomination 
of the loan is in a currency other than the currency of the lender or the borrower. A positive number below indicates an increase 
in profit and other equity where Sterling strengthens 10% against the relevant currency. For a 10% weakening of Sterling against 
the relevant currency, there would be an equal and opposite impact on the profit and other equity and the balances below would 
be negative.

Profit or loss movement on a 10% strengthening in Sterling against the Euro 479 642
Profit or loss movement on a 10% strengthening in Sterling against the US dollar 1 213
Currency derivatives
The Group utilises currency derivatives to hedge significant future transactions and cash flows. The Group uses foreign currency
forward contracts in the management of its exchange rate exposures. The contracts are denominated in US dollars and Euros.
At the balance sheet date, the total notional amount of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts that the Group has
committed to are as below:
2008 2007
£’000 £’000
Forward foreign exchange contracts 400 7,800
These arrangements are designed to address significant exchange exposures for the first half of 2008 and are renewed on a
revolving basis as required.
At 27 September 2008 the fair value of the Group’ s currency derivatives is a £62,000 liability (2007: a liability of £251,000). 
These amounts are based on market value of equivalent instruments at the balance sheet date.
Gains of £189,000 are included in operating profit in the year (2007: losses of £251,000).
Interest rate risk management
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as entities in the Group borrow funds at floating interest rates. The risk is managed by the
Group by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings, by the use of interest rate swap contracts and
collars. The Group’ s exposures to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk management
section of this note. T opps Tiles Plc

Interest rate sensitivity analysis
The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivatives and non-derivative
instruments at the balance sheet date. For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of liability outstanding
at balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year. A 50 basis points increase or decrease is used when reporting interest
rate risk internally to key management personnel and represents management’ s assessment of the possible change in interest rates.
If interest rates had been 50 basis points higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’ s profit would be
impacted as follows:
50 basis points 50 basis points 
increase in interest rates decrease in interest rates
2008 2007 2008 2007
£’000 £’000 £’000 £’000
Profit or (loss) (558) 689 (3,208) (1,808)
The Group’ s sensitivity to interest rates has decreased during the current period mainly due to the reduction in variable rate debt
instruments and the increase in interest rate swaps.
Interest rate swaps
The Group uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its bank borrowings. 
The Group’ s interest rate swaps comprise:
• five year interest rate cap with a notional value of £20 million with interest capped at 6%;
• five year interest rate swap with a notional value of £20 million paying interest at a fixed rate of 5.63%;
• ten year cancellable collar with a notional value of £60 million with a cap of 5.6% and a floor of 4.49%, the interest rate within this
range is LIBOR less 0.4%. Where LIBOR falls below the floor the interest rate resets to a fixed level of 5.55%. 
The fair value liability of the swaps entered into at 27 September 2008 is estimated at £1,945,000 (2007: £481,000). Amounts of
£1,464,000 have been charged to finance costs in the year (2007: £481,000).
Credit risk management
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
Management have considered the counterparty risk associated with the cash and derivative balances and do not consider 
there to be a material risk. The Group has a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties. The Group’ s exposure to its
counterparties is reviewed periodically. Trade receivables are minimal consisting of a number of insurance companies and sundry
trade accounts, further information is provided in note 15. 
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, which is net of impairment losses, represents the
Group’ s maximum exposure to credit risk without taking account of the value of any collateral obtained.
Liquidity risk management
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining
adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and
matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities. Included in note 18 is a description of additional undrawn facilities that
the Group has at its disposal to reduce liquidity risk further.

The Group expects to continue to reduce its debt to equity ratio, which is currently 1.92.
The following table details the Group’ s liquidity analysis for its derivative financial instruments. The table has been drawn up based 
on the undiscounted net cash inflows/(outflows) on the derivative instrument that settle on a net basis and the undiscounted gross
inflows and (outflows) on those derivatives that require gross settlement. When the amount payable or receivable is not fixed, the
amount disclosed has been determined by reference to the projected interest and foreign currency rates as illustrated by the yield
curves existing at the reporting date.

Fair value of financial instruments
The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows:
• Foreign currency forward contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted
interest rates matching maturities of the contracts.
• Interest rate swaps are measured at the present value of future cash flows estimated and discounted based on the applicable 
yield curves derived from quoted interest rates.
• Interest rate collars are measured using applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates and market volatilities.

The inputs to the Black-Scholes Model are as follows:

Expected volatility – % 88.2 27.8
Expected life – years 3 or 5 3 or 5
Risk – free rate of interest – % 4.5 4.3
Dividend yield – % 4.6 4.4
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’ s share price over the previous three years. 
The expected risk used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’ s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability,
exercise restrictions and behavioural forces.

This report is made solely to the company’ s members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’ s members those matters we are required to state to 
them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. T o the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility 
to anyone other than the company and the company’ s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we

Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the parent company financial statements in accordance with

in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the parent company financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and

Notes to the Company financial statements
For the 52 week period ending 27 September 2008
1 Basis of accounting
The separate financial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 1985. They have been
prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with United Kingdom Accounting Standards and law.
The principal accounting policies are summarised below. They have all been applied consistently throughout the year and the
preceding year.
The Company issues equity settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity settled share-based payments are
measured at fair value at the date of grant. In previous periods, the fair value determined at the grant date of the share-based
payment has been expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Company’ s estimate of shares that will
eventually vest. In the current period, the Company has adopted the guidance principles of IFRIC 11 (A parent grants rights to its
equity instruments to employees of its subsidiaries) with the charge being added to the cost of investment in those subsidiaries
whose employees receive the benefit of the share options.
Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in FRS 8 from disclosing transactions with other members of the Group 
and the exemption in FRS 29 for making disclosures relating to financial instruments.
2 Profit for the year
As permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 the Company has elected not to present its own profit and loss 
account for the year. T opps Tiles Plc reported a retained loss for the financial year ended 27 September 2008 of £8,972,000 
(2007: profit of £1,358,000).
The auditor’ s remuneration for services to the Company was £32,000 for audit related work (2007: £15,000 for audit related work).
No fees were payable in either year in relation to non-audit work.
The Company had no other employees other than the Directors (2007: same), their remuneration is detailed on page 31.

[Notes]
1 This notice has been sent to all Ordinary Shareholders who are entitled to attend or be represented at the meeting. As at the close 
of business on the date of this notice, the Company’ s issued share capital comprised 171,092,506 ordinary shares of 3.33 pence
each. Each Ordinary Share carries the right to one vote at a general meeting of the Company.
2 Members are entitled to appoint a proxy to exercise all or any of their rights to attend and to speak and vote on their behalf at the
meeting. Members may appoint more than one proxy in relation to the Annual General Meeting provided that each proxy is
appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share or shares held by that shareholder.
3 A proxy need not be a shareholder of the Company but must attend the meeting to represent you. A Form of Proxy is enclosed and
instructions for use are shown on the form. You can only appoint a proxy using the procedures set out in these notes and the notes
to the proxy form. The fact that shareholders may have completed forms of proxy will not prevent them from attending and voting in
person should they afterwards decide to do so. Details of how to appoint the Chairman of the meeting or another person as your
proxy using the proxy form are set out in the notes to the proxy form. If you wish your proxy to speak on your behalf at the meeting
you will need to appoint your own choice of proxy (not the Chairman) and give your instructions directly to them.
4 T o be valid, a Form of Proxy and any power or authority under which it is signed, must be lodged with the Company’ s Registrars,
Capita Registrars, Proxy Department, PO Box 25, Beckenham, Kent BR3 4BR, no later than 48 hours before the time appointed 
for the holding of the Annual General Meeting.
5 You may appoint more than one proxy provided each proxy is appointed to exercise rights attached to different shares. You may not
appoint more than one proxy to exercise rights attached to any one share.
6 A vote withheld is not a vote in law, which means that the vote will not be counted in the calculation of votes for or against the
resolution. If no voting indication is given, your proxy will vote or abstain from voting at his or her discretion. Your proxy will vote 
(or abstain from voting) as he or she thinks fit in relation to any other matter which is put before the meeting. The notes to the proxy
form explain how to direct your proxy how to vote on each resolution or withhold their vote.
7 In the case of joint holders, where more than one of the joint holders purports to appoint a proxy, only the appointment submitted by
the most senior holder will be accepted. Seniority is determined by the order in which the names of the joint holders appear in the
Company's register of members in respect of the joint holding (the first named being the most senior).
8 CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies by utilising the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do 
so for the Annual General Meeting and any adjournment(s) thereof by utilising the procedures described in the CREST Manual.
CREST Personal Members or other CREST sponsored members, and those CREST members who have appointed a voting service
provider(s), should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s), who will be able to take the appropriate action on their
behalf. In order for a proxy appointment made by means of CREST to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a “CREST Proxy
Instruction”) must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear’ s specifications and must contain the information required
for such instructions, as described in the CREST Manual. The message must be transmitted so as to be received by the issuer’ s
agent (ID:RA10) by the latest time(s) for receipt of proxy appointments specified in the notice of meeting. For this purpose, the time of
receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Applications Host) from
which the issuer’ s agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST . After this time,
any change of instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should be communicated to the appointee through other means. 
Notice of Annual General Meeting (continued) T opps Tiles Plc
Annual Report & Financial Statements 2008

CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers should note that Euroclear does not
make available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations will therefore 
apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or, if the
CREST member is a CREST personal member or sponsored member or has appointed a voting service provider(s), to procure that
his CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted
by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection, CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST
sponsors or voting service providers are referred, in particular, to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical
limitations of the CREST system and timings.
The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertificated
Securities Regulations 2001.
9 In order to facilitate voting by corporate representatives at the meeting, arrangements will be put in place at the meeting so that 
(i) if a corporate shareholder has appointed the Chairman of the meeting as its corporate representative to vote on a poll in
accordance with the directions of all of the other corporate representatives for that shareholder at the meeting, then on a poll those
corporate representatives will give voting directions to the Chairman and the Chairman will vote (or withhold a vote) as corporate
representative in accordance with those directions; and (ii) if more than one corporate representative for the same corporate
shareholder attends the meeting but the corporate shareholder has not appointed the Chairman of the meeting as its corporate
representative, a designated corporate representative will be nominated, from those corporate representatives who attend, who 
will vote on a poll and the other corporate representatives will give voting directions to that designated corporate representative.
Corporate shareholders are referred to the guidance issued by the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators on proxies
and corporate representatives (www.icsa.org.uk) for further details of this procedure. The guidance includes a sample form of
appointment letter if the chairman is being appointed as described in (i) above.
10 The following documents are available for inspection by members at the registered office of the Company (except Bank Holidays)

THE ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING of the Company will be held at the Company’ s premises at Thorpe Way, Grove Park, Enderby,
Leicestershire LE19 1SU on Tuesday 13 January 2009 at 10.30am.
Five of the resolutions are to be taken at this year’ s Annual General Meeting as special business. By way of explanation of these and
certain other resolutions:
Ordinary business
Resolutions 2, 3, 4 and 5
Re-election of Directors
M. Williams and N. Ounstead are the Directors retiring by rotation this year and they offer themselves for re-election and A. White offers
himself for re-election as a new appointment to the Board. All members of the Board of Directors submit themselves for re-election at
least every three years with the exception of The Rt. Hon. J.M. Jack who has served for at least nine years and therefore retires and
offers himself for re-election annually. Brief biographical details about the Directors standing for re-election appear on pages 20 and 21 
of the Annual Report and Financial Statements.
Special business
Resolutions 8 and 9
Appointment of authority to issue shares and the disapplication of statutory rights of pre-emption
Resolution 8: The right of the Directors to allot further shares in the capital of the Company requires in most cases the prior authorisation
of the shareholders in general meeting under section 80 of the Companies Act 1985 (“the Act”), Resolution 9 will be put to members as
special business to authorise the Directors to allot Ordinary Shares with a nominal value of £1,889,510 out of the Company’ s unissued
share capital representing approximately 33.3% of the Company’ s current issued share capital (excluding shares held in treasury). 
The Company currently holds nil Ordinary Shares in treasury.
The Directors have no current intention of exercising the authority to allot further shares. The authority shall expire immediately following
the Annual General Meeting next following the resolution or, if earlier, 15 months following the resolution being passed.
Resolution 9: This proposed resolution seeks to obtain power under section 95 of the Act to enable the Directors to allot, for cash,
shares with an aggregate nominal value of £283,429 equal to approximately 5% of the Company’ s current issued share capital 
without being required first to offer such securities to existing shareholders. The Company will thereby be given greater flexibility when
considering future opportunities but the interests of existing shareholders will be protected as, except in the case of a rights issue or 
the allotment of shares under the Company’ s share option schemes, the Directors have no present intention to allot any part of the
unissued share capital of the Company or, without the prior approval of the Company in general meeting, to make any issue which
would effectively alter the control of the Company or the nature of its business. This authority will expire immediately following the 
Annual General Meeting next following the resolution or, if earlier, 15 months following the resolution being passed.
Resolution 10
Authority to purchase Ordinary Shares
At the Annual General Meeting, Ordinary Shareholders are being invited under Resolution 10 to grant authority to the Company to make
market purchases of its Ordinary Shares. It is proposed such authority shall expire on the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting to
be held in 2009 or 12 months from the date of this resolution, if earlier.
This authority will be limited to the purchase of not more than 14.9% of the Ordinary Shares currently in issue. This represents the
maximum amount of Ordinary Share capital in issue which is permitted before tender or partial offer to all shareholders is require to 
be made to perform any share buy-back. The maximum price payable under this authority will be 105% of the average of the middle
market quotations of an Ordinary Share for the five business days before the relevant purchase and the minimum price will be [3
1
⁄ 3p] 
per Ordinary Share.
In considering whether or not to purchase Ordinary Shares under the market purchase authority, the Directors will take into account
cash resources, the effect on gearing and other investment opportunities before exercising the authority. In addition, the Company 
will only exercise the authority to make such a purchase in the market when the Directors consider it is in the best interests of the
shareholders generally to do so and it should result in an increase in Earnings per Ordinary Share.
As at 24 November 2008, there were options to subscribe for 878,584 equity shares outstanding under various schemes representing
approximately 0.51% of the current issued share capital of the Company. If the authority sought by Resolution 10 was exercised in full, 
the number of outstanding options would represent approximately 0.87% of the issued share capital following the repurchase of shares.

Resolution 11
Amendment to Articles of Association
It is proposed that the Company adopts amended articles of association which take account of further changes brought about as 
at the date of this meeting as a result of the continued implementation of the Companies Act 2006 (the “2006 Act”). The proposed 
new Articles of Association reflect further provisions of the 2006 Act which have been implemented since the date of the last AGM. 
It is expected that further amendments may be required at the next AGM to deal with the final changes brought about later in 2009 by
the implementation of the remainder of the 2006 Act. The new set of articles of association contains certain key differences from the
current Articles of Association of the Company. The key changes are set out below:
Articles 124A and 124B - Conflicts of Interest
The 2006 Act sets out directors’ general duties, which largely codify the existing law, but with some changes. Under the 2006 Act a
director must now avoid a situation where he has, or can have, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or possibly may conflict with the
Company’ s interests. The requirement is very broad and could apply, for example, if a Director becomes a Director of another company
or a trustee of another organisation. The 2006 Act allows Directors of public companies to authorise conflicts and potential conflicts,
where appropriate, where the articles of association contain a provision to this effect. The 2006 Act also allows the articles of association
to contain other provisions for dealing with Directors’ conflicts of interest to avoid a breach of duty. These New Articles give the Directors
authority to approve such situations and to include other provisions to allow conflicts of interest to be dealt with in a similar way to the
current position.
There are safeguards that will apply when Directors decide whether to authorise a conflict or potential conflict. First, only Directors 
who have no interest in the matter being considered will be able to take the relevant decision, and secondly, in taking the decision the
Directors must act in a way they consider, in good faith, will be most likely to promote the Company’ s success. The Directors will be 
able to impose limits or conditions when giving authorisation if they think this is appropriate.
It is also proposed that the New Articles should contain provisions relating to confidential information, attendance at board meetings 
and availability of board papers to protect a Director being in breach of duty if a conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest arises.
These provisions will only apply where the position giving rise to the potential conflict has previously been authorised by the Directors. 
It is the Board's intention to report annually on the Company’ s procedures for ensuring that the Board’ s powers of authorisation of
conflicts are operated effectively and that the procedures have been followed.
The proposed new Articles of Association are available to view at the Company’ s website – www.toppstiles.co.uk. 
Resolution 12
Adoption of Sharesave Scheme
It is proposed that the Company adopts the T opps Tiles Plc 2008 Sharesave Scheme (“Sharesave Scheme”). The proposed scheme is
in substantially the same form as the last scheme previously adopted by the Company (and which lapsed earlier this year) except that it
has been updated to accommodate changes in legislation.
The principal features of the Sharesave Scheme are outlined below:
General
The Sharesave Scheme is intended to be a Save-As-You-Earn share option scheme approved by the HM Revenue & Customs in
accordance with Schedule 3 to ITEPA 2003.
The UK Sharesave Scheme shall be administered by the Board or a duly authorised committee thereof.
Eligibility
All UK tax resident Executive Directors and employees of the Company and participating companies within the Group with at least five
years service must be entitled to participate. 
The Board may also permit Executive Directors and employees with a shorter period of service to participate in the Sharesave Scheme.
Invitations to apply for options under the Sharesave Scheme will be made to all eligible Executive Directors and employees who have
completed three months service with the Company (or one or more of its subsidiaries) at the date invitations under the Sharesave
Scheme are made. Thereafter, the Board will determine the basis upon which any future invitations to apply for options will be made. T opps Tiles Plc
Annual Report & Financial Statements 2008
68
The Savings Contract
T o participate in the UK Sharesave Scheme, an eligible employee must enter into a Save-As-You-Earn contract (the “Savings Contract”)
with an appropriate savings carrier approved by the Company, thereby agreeing to make monthly contributions of between £5 and £250
for a specified period of three, five or seven years. The Board has discretion to determine which of the Savings Contracts will be available
in respect of any invitation to apply for options. 
Scaling Down
Applications to participate in the Sharesave Scheme may be scaled down by the Board in accordance with procedures laid down in the
rules of the Sharesave Scheme, if applications exceed such number that represents 3% of the ordinary share capital of the Company in
issue immediately prior to that date or 5% thereof when that date falls within the period of 48 months commencing on the first day on
which options are granted under the Sharesave Scheme.
Option price 
Options granted to acquire shares under the Sharesave Scheme will have an option price determined by the Board, which will be not
less than the higher of:
(a) 80% of the middle market quotation for such shares as derived from the Official List for the period of three dealing days immediately
preceding the date on which invitations to apply for options are issued to employees; and
(b) where shares are to be subscribed, their nominal value. 
Grant of options
The number of shares which may be allocated under the Sharesave Scheme on any day shall not, when added to the aggregate
number of shares which have been allocated in the previous three years under the Sharesave Scheme and under any other employees’
share scheme adopted by the Company or any subsidiary, exceed such number that represents 3% of the ordinary share capital of the
Company in issue immediately prior to that date or 5% thereof when that date falls within the period of 48 months commencing on the
first day on which options are granted under the Sharesave Scheme.
Options may be granted within the six weeks following the date on which the Sharesave Scheme is adopted by the Company or
approved by HMRC. Thereafter, options may normally only be granted in the six weeks following the announcement by the Company 
of its results for any period, or following a change in the legislation relating to Sharesave Schemes or where there are circumstances
considered by the Committee to be exceptional. 
No options may be granted later than ten years after the approval of the Sharesave Scheme by shareholders.
No payment will be required for the grant of an option. Options will not be taken into account in determining a participant’ s pension rights
under a final salary pension scheme, or the employer’ s contributions to a defined contributions scheme. Options are not transferable
(other than on death in which case they may be exercised by a participant’ s personal representatives).
Limits on the issue of shares
In any ten-year period not more than 10% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company from time to time may be issued or
issuable pursuant to rights acquired under the Sharesave Scheme and any other employees’ share scheme adopted by the Company.
For the purposes of this limit, options or other rights to acquire shares which lapse or have been released do not count. However, new
shares subscribed by the trustees of an employee benefit trust to satisfy rights granted under any employees’ share scheme adopted 
by the Company do count towards this limit. 
Exercise of options
Options will only normally be exercisable for a period of six months commencing on the date on which a bonus is payable under the
Savings Contract and, if not exercised by the end of that period, the option will lapse. 
Earlier exercise may, however, be permitted in specified circumstances, including termination of employment as a result of injury,
disability, redundancy, retirement or the sale of the subsidiary or business for which the participant works. In such cases, options may 
be exercised within six months of cessation of employment but only to the extent of his total savings plus any interest accrued to the
date of exercise. In the event of death of an option holder, the personal representative of the deceased may normally exercise within 
one year of the date of death.
Early exercise may also be permitted where a participant reaches pensionable age but remains in employment. In such a case, options
may be exercised within six months of reaching that age if he continues after that date to hold the office or employment by virtue of
which he is eligible to participate in the Sharesave Scheme.
Options may be satisfied by the issue of new shares or by the transfer of existing shares, from an employee benefit trust established by
the Company, from treasury or otherwise.

Rights attaching to shares
All shares allotted or transferred under the Sharesave Scheme will rank pari passu with all other common stock of the Company for the
time being in issue (save as regards any rights attaching to such shares by reference to a record date prior to the date of allotment or
transfer) and the Company will apply for any new shares issued under the Sharesave Scheme to be admitted to the Official List and to
trading on the London Stock Exchange.
Takeover of the Company
In the event of a takeover, reconstruction or winding up of the Company, options may be exercised within six months of the change of
control. Alternatively, options may be exchanged for new equivalent options over shares in the acquiring company where appropriate. 
Variation of capital 
In the event of any rights or capitalisation issue, subdivision, consolidation, reduction or other variation of share capital, the Board may
make (subject to receiving prior approval of the HMRC) such adjustments as they consider appropriate to the number of shares subject
to options and/or the price payable on the exercise of options. 
Alterations to the Sharesave Scheme
The Directors may make certain alterations and additions to the Sharesave Scheme but any such changes made after HM Revenue &
Customs has approved the scheme shall not take effect until such changes have been approved by HM Revenue & Customs. 
Permitted alterations or additions include minor ones that benefit the administration of the Sharesave Scheme or ones that are
necessary to obtain HM Revenue & Customs approval under any relevant legislation or are necessary to obtain favourable taxation
exchange control or regulatory treatment for the Company or associated companies.
All other changes must be sanctioned by the Company by ordinary resolution of the members in general meeting.
Additionally, no amendment can be made which would adversely affect the rights of participants without their consent (as if they were 
a separate class of shareholder).
Termination
The Sharesave Scheme may be terminated at any time by resolution of the Board or of the Company in general meeting and shall in any
event terminate on the tenth anniversary of the date on which the Sharesave Scheme is adopted by the Company in general meeting.
T ermination will not affect the outstanding rights of participants. Aadam Nozeer

evolutions in the way people work. 
We understand these complexities and are uniquely positioned across our

Introduct Ion 
ExpErts I n a compl Ex world
hays I n 2012
Welcome to our 2012 Annual Report & Financial Statements.  
2012 was fast-changing and increasingly complex both in terms  
of the macroeconomic backdrop in which we operated and 
also the challenges faced by our clients and candidates around 
the world. Over the last 10 years, Hays has strategically built a 
business that is unmatched in terms of its sectoral diversification 
and geographic footprint, meaning we are able to understand and solve these 
challenges wherever they occur. 
This year we have delivered a good set of results in this context, whilst continuing 
to develop the Group to ensure we are well placed to meet the challenges and 
capitalise on the opportunities of the future.
I am proud to be Chairman of a Group with 7,800 experts in 33 countries across  
20 specialisms around the world. It is this diversity that means Hays really are the 
experts in today’s complex world.

 driven by a strong performance by our International 
business, in the context of increasingly challenging conditions in many of our markets. 
The year saw fast-changing, volatile market conditions around the world, with sentiment amongst 
our clients and candidates varying from quarter to quarter. As such, our approach to managing 
the business has been nimble and responsive to reflect this volatility, most notably in terms of 
prioritising appropriate areas of investment.
We have continued to grow our business to maximise fees in more buoyant markets, such as the 
resource-based regions of Australia and our global IT, Engineering, Life Sciences and Oil & Gas 
specialisms. Equally, we have continued to invest in order to capitalise on structural growth markets 
such as Germany, Japan and Brazil. At the same time, we have taken appropriate action to defend 
the profit of the Group by focusing on strong cost control in more challenging markets, and 
leveraging our best-in-class IT systems to drive consultant productivity. 03 directors’ report business review 253.8

to d El IvEr our long -t Erm goals
This year the Group has 
delivered good organic fee and 
profit growth in the context of 
an increasingly uncertain 
economic environment. 
Group net fees increased by 8%
(1)
 in 2012  
as we benefited from the diversity of the 
Group’s operations both by geography and 
specialism. Management focus throughout 
the year has been on defending the Group’s 
financial performance in more challenging 
markets, whilst selectively investing for 
growth in more buoyant areas. As a result, 
the Group delivered good growth in 
underlying operating profits of 9%
(1)(2)
, whilst 
earnings per share increased by 5%
(3)
 and 
our cash flow performance was excellent.
dIv IdEnd
Increased global economic uncertainty 
slowed the pace of the Group’s profit growth 
as the first half progressed and as a result 
first half operating profit was only 2% 
sequentially higher than the previous half. 
Considering this, and the Board’s view at  
that time regarding likely growth in Group 
profitability in the second half of the year, we 
decided that, whilst the dividend remained 
affordable, it was no longer appropriate to 
maintain it at its previous level, which had 
been uncovered by earnings for two years. 
We therefore took the very difficult decision  
in February to reduce the interim dividend 
and we propose to pay a final dividend of  
1.67 pence, which is in line with our one-
third/two-thirds split, and results in a full 
year dividend of 2.5 pence, down 57% on  
the previous level. 
The Board fully understands the importance 
to shareholders of paying a sustainable and 
progressive dividend. We believe that future 
dividends should be covered by earnings in 
the range 2.0x – 3.0x
(3)
 and we are committed 
to growing the dividend when cover sustainably 
reaches 2.5x
(3)
.
govE rnanc E and board
As Chairman, one of my primary 
responsibilities is to ensure that the Group 
operates to the highest standards in all 
aspects of governance and risk management. 
We are making good progress in broadening 
our corporate responsibility programme. 
When I joined Hays in late 2010, it was clear 
to me that the Group takes all of these 
aspects very seriously and this remains the 
case. Transparency is central to this, and  
you will find more detail about our approach 
and progress over the last year in the 
governance section starting on page 34, 
and in our separately published Corporate 
Responsibility Report. 
I was delighted to welcome Pippa Wicks  
to the Board as a non-executive director on  
1 January 2012. Pippa is a member of the 
Audit, Nomination and Remuneration 
Committees and is currently Managing 
Director at AlixPartners. She brings with her a 
wealth of experience and, along with Victoria 
Jarman who joined our Board in October 2011 
and who I introduced in last year’s Annual 
Report, has had an immediate positive impact. 
At this year’s Annual General Meeting, Paul 
Stoneham will be retiring as a non-executive 
director having served on the Board for 
eight years. I would like to thank Paul for his 
commitment and contribution in that time.
It is critical that the make-up of the Board 
reflects not only the shape of our business 
today, but also evolves to reflect what is  
a fast-paced, structural growth industry. 
Whether that is in terms of responding  
to the development of new media and 
technology, understanding the changing 
needs of our clients or reflecting the rapid 
internationalisation of the business, my focus 
is on ensuring that the make-up of the Board 
appropriately reflects the way the Group is 
developing, and is fully aligned to the focus 
and goals of our executive management team.
pEopl E
Over the last year I have continued to  
travel and meet our people around the 
Group. What strikes me above all is their 
professionalism and their focus on solving 
the challenges of our clients and candidates 
around the world. Our people are undoubtedly 
our key asset and over the past year we have 
continued to welcome new experts into the 
Group, as well as opening new Hays businesses 
in Chile, Colombia and Malaysia – our 33rd 
country. I am convinced that the long-term 
opportunities for growth we offer, as well  
as the unrivalled support and development 
opportunities available, mean that our 
people will continue to find Hays a place 
where they can forge exciting and rewarding 
careers. I would like to personally thank them 
all for their hard work and commitment 
throughout the year.
summary
We have continued to make significant 
progress in 2012. The fast-changing 
economic backdrop we have faced has 
meant that we have had to become more 
selective about areas of investment to 
ensure that we maximise opportunities  
for growth whilst defending the financial 
performance of the Group. For as long as the 
economic outlook remains uncertain, we will 
continue with this approach. Longer term, 
the structural growth opportunities for our 
industry remain undiminished and the Board 
will continue to focus on ensuring that the 
Group takes full advantage of them.

Conditions remained challenging overall  
and in several markets became tougher 
as the year progressed as heightened 
macroeconomic concerns negatively 
impacted candidate and client confidence.
The private sector became more difficult 
over the year particularly in our Banking  
and City-related specialisms. Elsewhere, 
those specialisms characterised by skills  
and candidate shortages remained relatively 
resilient, and we saw good growth in  
areas such as IT, Energy, Oil & Gas and 
Life Sciences. 
In the public sector, which makes up 24% 
of our net fees in the UK, activity remained 
subdued but broadly sequentially stable, 
although areas such as Office Support 
and Construction & Property were 
especially difficult.
2. austral Ia
The market became increasingly dual-track, 
as the resources and mining focused 
economies of Western Australia and 
Queensland (around 35% of our net fees in 
Australia) saw very strong growth, driven 
primarily by a shortage of skilled people. 
Market conditions in the rest of Australia 
became more difficult as the year progressed.
The market for permanent placements 
became more difficult in the second half  
as candidate confidence was impacted  
by the more uncertain global 
macroeconomic climate.
Temporary markets were more robust,  
driven largely by Resources & Mining, where 
many roles are filled by people on longer-
term contracts. Elsewhere, we saw clients 
turn to temporary employees to fill roles 
when they were unable to find a suitable 
permanent candidate, or were more  
cautious about their hiring decisions.
3. gErmany
We saw broad-based growth throughout  
the year across all of the sectors in which  
we operate.
Specialist recruitment in Germany is still 
relatively immature; the vast majority of 
recruitment is still undertaken in-house.
This is changing, however, and the 
outsourcing of recruitment was again a trend. 
This is particularly the case in the IT & 
Engineering sectors, which make up 77%  
of our net fees in Germany. The market 
continued to be driven by this structural move 
towards outsourcing, but was also, in our 
experience, buoyed by a shortage of skilled 
candidates (notably in the Engineering sector) 
and the continued adoption of more flexible 
working arrangements both by companies 
and employees.

what wE do
We are focused on the specialist recruitment market. In the vast majority of our businesses,  
we operate a contingent fee model, with fees paid to us by our clients derived as a proportion  
of the salary of the candidate placed. In the permanent business, we recognise fees when the 
candidate starts work. For temporary placements, we earn fees when a candidate is active  
in an assignment.
wh Er E w E do I t
Our organisational structure is simple and is built around three regions globally. Within this 
structure, our 5,013 consultants operate from 245 offices in 33 countries – an unrivalled footprint 
in specialist recruitment. Critically, we have market-leading positions in many of the most important 
markets in the world, including Australia, Germany and the UK. All of this means we understand 
our clients’ challenges locally, with the ability to solve them globally.

What makes Hays unique in the world of specialist recruitment is the diversity of our business 
model. The breadth of our expertise by contract type, geography and specialism positions  
us well to withstand various stages of the macroeconomic cycle and best serve our clients  
around the world, regardless of the challenges they face.
what dr IvEs growth
The global specialist recruitment market is driven primarily by confidence amongst both 
businesses, to replace people who leave, and candidates to move jobs. We call this ‘job churn’.  
In addition, we identify four further factors currently driving fee growth: the emergence of 
structural growth markets; the macroeconomic cycle; skills shortages; and the globalisation 
of the flow of labour.

We have a proven track record of 
organically entering new markets that 
allows us to establish a business quickly 
and with minimal risk. 
Following the launch of Hays Brazil in 2007, we have 
successfully leveraged our scale across Latin America  
by organically growing our footprint to seven offices 
across four countries with the launch of Mexico and 
Colombia in FY 2011 and Chile in FY 2012.
We launched these countries using our replicable 
business model and our market-leading international 
database of clients and candidates to forge relationships 
and build a local market presence.
Central to the success of our new country entries is 
ensuring that we build the business based on the culture 
of Hays under our single global brand and we use this  
as a key competitive advantage in the marketplace. 
Duarte Ramos, Country Manager of Colombia, has  
been with Hays for eight years and was instrumental  
in the launch of our Mexican business in September  
2010. He started his career with Hays as a consultant  
in Lisbon and was responsible for setting up our Oporto 
operation (our second office in Portugal) in 2005.  
He then moved back to Lisbon as a Regional Director  
of the Portuguese business. 
Hays Chile is managed by Giordano Righi. He is equally 
experienced, having held key managerial positions within 
Hays Germany’s Permanent, Temporary and Contracting 
business divisions. Before moving to Chile, Giordano  
most recently set up our Permanent Engineering division 
across Germany.

The mining industry in Western Australia 
has seen tremendous recent growth.
th E contE xt
The forecast demand for Australian resources will mean that 
up to half of all new jobs created in the next few years will be 
in the mining sector and related industries.
(2)
Whilst in the long term this is good news for job creation  
in Australia, the immediate issue is one of skills shortages  
in the mining regions. Many of the roles that are vital to the 
sector require experts with niche skills and experience and 
sourcing this talent is proving to be a challenge for many of 
our clients.
th E cl IEnt’s challE ng E 
Newmont is one of the world’s top five global gold 
producers, with multiple underground and open pit mining 
operations in Western Australia. The mining talent they  
need to source is highly skilled and in short supply, as the 
level of knowledge and qualifications needed for roles is 
exceptionally high. As part of the ongoing relationship we 
have with them, they came to Hays for help in finding a drill  
& blast engineer, a position that they have struggled to fill in 
the past due to the technical nature of the role and the lack 
of available candidates.
hays E xp Ert Is E In act Ion 
Due to our in-depth knowledge of Newmont’s requirements 
and our extensive global database of candidates we were 
quickly able to present a qualified experienced mining 
engineer. Newmont was so impressed with the candidate, 
Fredrik Gransell, that within an hour of receiving his CV they 
arranged an interview on-site. They flew Fredrik from his 
native Stockholm to Perth and then to their Jundee site for 
an interview and induction. 
Hays was able to work with both Fredrik and Newmont 
throughout the process to ensure that the fit was right, and 
two months after the visit, Fredrik relocated to Perth to start 
his new life and career.

our strat EgIc and op Erat Ional  
focus
Specialist recruitment is an industry that offers significant 
long-term structural growth opportunities as client organisations 
across the world increasingly turn to experts such as Hays to 
help them source the very best talent. In the short term however, 
recruitment is geared to the economic cycle and we must ensure 
that our day-to-day operational focus is responsive and quick to 
adapt to changes in each market as and when they occur.
Capitalising on this long-term opportunity and building Hays to 
be the global leader in specialist recruitment is the cornerstone 
of our strategy. Managing our short-term actions to maximise 
Group profitability whilst ensuring we invest appropriately to 
build the long-term global platform are the key management 
challenges in our business.

op Erat Ional focus
The world we operate in today is increasingly complex, so this year we have changed the 
way we present our Group strategy in order to better illustrate the way we think about and 
manage our business against this backdrop. On the page opposite, we have outlined our 
aims as a Group, as well as the two levels on which we manage the business. Our four 
Strategic Pillars underpin everything we do in order to deliver on these long-term aims. 
Additionally, our areas of Operational Focus describe how we manage the business on  
a day-to-day basis in response to the prevailing and fast-changing environment. 
In an industry, which has clear structural growth opportunities but is also characterised  
by cyclicality, this twin-track approach is critical to achieving our long-term aims, whilst 
maximising the short-term performance of the Group.
our four strat EgIc p Illars
Our four Strategic Pillars underpin the way we manage and grow the Group over the long 
term. They remain unchanged regardless of the stage of the economic cycle, and they are 
designed to ensure we are never distracted from our core strategic aim of building the 
world’s pre-eminent specialist recruitment business.
We assess our progress against these Strategic Pillars in our Key Performance Indicators, 
which you will find on pages 20 and 21. Additionally, I give my own view on our progress  
over the last 12 months and discuss our focus in 2013 on pages 16 to 19.
our op Erat Ional focus
Overlaying these Strategic Pillars are our areas of short-term Operational Focus. We need  
to be nimble and responsive to the market context in which we find ourselves, so our actions 
reflect today’s complex, multi-speed and overall more challenging market conditions. 
These areas of Operational Focus represent the immediate ‘to-do’ list for the Group’s 
executive team as we manage the business. In a cyclical industry such as specialist 
recruitment, notwithstanding the longer-term structural growth opportunities which exist, 
it is critical that we can quickly shift our emphasis between investment and cost control as 
market conditions change, in order to maximise fees and profits in the short term.
Throughout the next few pages, my strategic review includes brief case studies and updates 
on how we are approaching each of these areas of Operational Focus. Additionally, you can 
find operating reviews of each of our divisions starting on page 24.

Selective investment to capitalise on growth areas combined 
with strong cost control and a focus on productivity has 
delivered a strong performance.
Introduct Ion to our p Erformanc E In 2012
Throughout 2012 we focused on ensuring that the Group was quick to respond to changes in 
market conditions as and when they occurred around the world. Our priorities were to drive 
fee growth where opportunities existed and defend our profit performance in those parts of 
the business which faced more challenging conditions. 
This approach manifested itself in four main ways:
•	 Ensuring we are positioned to take full advantage of structural growth opportunities  
by continuing to build our presence in regions such as Latin America, Japan and Germany; 
•	 Continuing our strategy of international diversification by launching in new countries (we 
opened in Chile, Colombia and Malaysia in 2012), and launching core Hays specialisms in 
existing countries;
•	 Investing selectively to capitalise on opportunities for growth in more buoyant markets, 
such as Western Australia, Germany and Canada; and
•	 Reducing costs, maximising fee opportunities and optimising consultant productivity in 
more challenging markets.
As a result, I am pleased that we have delivered good turnover, net fee and operating profit 
growth. In the second half of the year, we improved profitability sequentially and versus prior 
year, despite the fact that net fees were lower than in the first half. This result is testament to 
our focus on cost control and our multifaceted approach to managing the business in what 
became overall more challenging and increasingly complex markets.
Our International business grew net fees by 16%
(1)
, and 17 countries delivered growth of 10%
(1)
 
or more. Given the more uncertain macroeconomic environment, particularly in the second 
half of our year, this is clear evidence of the structural growth characteristics of markets such 
as Germany, Brazil and Japan. In addition, it illustrates the expertise of our teams around the 
world, their ability to respond to challenges and fully capitalise on opportunities in their 
specific markets.
Over the last few years, we have very deliberately expanded our global footprint and the 
diversity of our sectoral offering and this has delivered clear benefits in 2012. As the most 
sectorally diversified business in our industry, combined with our global scale and balanced 
exposure to both mature markets and areas of structural growth, we have built a clear 
competitive advantage in an industry which is undeniably impacted by the macroeconomic 
cycle. Whilst some markets that are core to our Group have been challenging throughout  
the year, the fact that we have long-established, market-leading businesses in more buoyant 
areas such as Resources & Mining, Engineering, Life Sciences and IT has been central to 
delivering a good set of results in 2012.

Our long-term aim is to be the world’s pre-eminent specialist recruitment business. On 
pages 14 and 15 I outline the Strategic Pillars which underpin the work we do to achieve that 
aim, as well as the areas of Operational Focus we have as we manage the business to deliver 
sustainable, profitable growth. Last year I similarly outlined our priorities for 2012 and it is 
important to revisit them and assess our progress over the last year.

(1)  LFL (like-for-like) growth represents organic growth of continuing activities at constant currency, before  
exceptional items. 17 directors’ report business review driving uk performance
The UK market became increasingly challenging as the year progressed. The private sector 
(which represents around 75% of our UK net fees) saw conditions become progressively 
more difficult, notably in the Banking and City-related specialisms. Confidence amongst our 
clients and candidates has been reduced by heightened concern about the global economy, 
particularly in the second half of the year, as the UK entered a double-dip recession. After 
falling 60% from peak levels, the UK public sector has remained broadly stable through 2012 
and, in the fourth quarter, we delivered net fee growth of 6%
(1)
. Public-sector activity remains 
at low levels, however, and is mainly driven by more senior permanent roles. We do not 
expect material growth in this business in the short term, but longer term we do expect the 
UK public sector to again become a significant addressable market for the Group. 
In this difficult context, we have taken the actions necessary to best defend the bottom line 
of the UK business. We have implemented initiatives to generate cost savings in our UK 
back-office of around £15 million and, given our view on the outlook for the UK, we will 
continue to take action on costs where required. Importantly, we will continue to capitalise 
on all fee opportunities available. With this in mind, I appointed Nigel Heap as the Managing 
Director of our UK & Ireland business in May. Nigel has been with Hays for over 24 years, 
spending the last 15 years in Australia building that business into the success it is today and 
running our Asia Pacific region. In his new role, Nigel will focus on driving fee and profit 
growth through the UK business. 
c ontinued international growth and diversification
The performance of our International business in 2012 has again been excellent. The 
well-balanced, diversified business model we have built across our Asia Pacific and 
Continental Europe & Rest of World divisions over the last few years is critical to this  
and the Group now generates around 70% of net fees from the International business,  
up from 15% just 10 years ago. 
Our strategy for growing the International business is multifaceted. We are primarily focused 
on developing the businesses we have in existing markets whether that is by new office 
openings – we opened new offices in Belgium, Germany and China – or launching new 
specialisms into existing countries. This not only increases the diversification of our revenues 
but, more critically, it fundamentally underpins the service we offer our clients and candidates. 
A good example of this is the roll-out of our market-leading Oil & Gas specialism into the 
USA and Denmark.
In addition to this focus on diversification, we continued to expand our footprint throughout 
2012 and now operate in 33 countries, having opened Hays businesses in Chile, Colombia 
and Malaysia.
delivering exceptional customer service
Delivering world-class service ultimately boils down to our ability to understand and solve the 
challenges faced by our clients and candidates around the world every day. As a leading specialist 
recruitment business, we advise people through one of the most important and often most 
difficult decisions they ever make: changing jobs, or hiring the right person for their business. 
In doing this, our key differentiator is the quality of our consultants and their ability to act as 
trusted advisers. It is also about the quality of the systems and processes we have in place to 
allow them to most effectively meet the demands of our clients, and ensure an excellent and 
professional experience for our candidates. 
Not only are our new IT systems driving our consultants’ ability to service the needs of the 
market, they are also highly adaptable to the advances we see every day in how people use 
technology in their daily lives. As the world moves more towards mobile platforms for example, 
our IT systems allow contractors to submit their timesheets or search for their next assignment 
via their smartphones. Similarly, as communities of professionals develop on various social media 
networks, our IT systems enable us to effectively utilise sites such as LinkedIn, Facebook and

Last year at Hays we sourced candidates for 
the global Oil & Gas industry across a broad 
range of skilled and technical disciplines. 
To meet this growing global demand,  
we have opened our second US office  
in Houston, Texas. This office will initially 
focus on our global Oil & Gas offering,  
and will be headed by our North American 
President, John Faraguna. Houston is the 
base for many clients with whom we 
already have established relationships in 
Europe, the Middle East, Asia and South 
America and represents the logical next 
strategic step as we continue to roll-out 
and develop this key specialism.
Hays Oil & Gas operates from 13 of our

launched this year in Denmark which will 
act as our base for Northern Europe. We 
will continue the strategic roll-out of this 
key global specialism.

Twitter as new channels to find the experts that our clients need. Having completed a major 
investment programme in our technology platforms, we are now uniquely positioned in our 
industry to take advantage of these changes in how people communicate and build relationships.
We must recognise that the world of recruitment continues to evolve as clients’ demands 
change and candidates’ channels to find their next role develop. To remain a leader in the 
industry it is vital that we remain at the forefront of product and service innovation, to ensure 
that we can deliver effectively both now and in the future to each of our chosen market 
segments. There is no one-size-fits-all for recruitment in today’s world. The needs of our 
large corporate clients differ significantly from those of our smaller clients for example,  
so we need solutions tailored to each. Over the year, we have continued to invest in these 
tailored services. Our acquisition of 3 Story Software, a contingent workforce management 
system, and its subsequent integration into our own Managed Service business, is just one 
such example of investing to address specific client needs. This integrated solution allows us 
to manage our clients’ temporary worker labour forces and illustrates how we are developing 
our spectrum of services to truly power the world of work, whoever are our clients. 
Investment in people
We are the ultimate people business. To fulfil our long-term aims we need to hire the very 
best people, provide them with the industry’s best training, give them excellent career 
development opportunities and reward and motivate them effectively and appropriately. 
Each of these aspects is fundamental to our success in creating experts throughout Hays 
who are the very best in the world at servicing our clients’ and candidates’ needs.
I am pleased that we have made further demonstrable progress in each area. For example,  
we have launched our own interactive recruitment tool, the Hays Challenge, to better source 
potential new consultants. Within a year, over 40,000 potential recruits from 190 countries 
have taken the Hays Challenge online, many of them going on to apply for a role in our

is critical to our success. 
Computacenter face the complex 
challenge of efficiently managing their 
workforce of skilled technicians, generally 
contracted on assignments across 
approximately one hundred clients.
Not only did they have to manage the 
complicated workflows, but they needed 
to implement a system which could 
provide accurate operational and financial 
tracking for each assignment.
Hays worked with Computacenter to 
implement our cloud based vendor 
management system, 3 Story Software, 
which enables organisations to effectively 
manage their contingent workforce and 
supply chain, allowing hiring managers, 
suppliers and employees to collaborate 
online through a single portal.
This integrated system provided an 
enhanced level of control over the entire 
process, including real-time management 
information. Efficiency benefits were 
recognised immediately: job fill rates were 
improved to over 99% and time-to-hire 
was significantly reduced.

Employers are looking for more consistency,

The structure of these arrangements ranges 
from the implementation of simple Preferred 
Supplier Lists (PSL), to formal contracts 
with the management of the recruitment 
process outsourced to a single supplier  
(or ‘Master Vendor’). These contractual

In our view the key to delivering this

processes, dedicated teams and a robust 
Vendor Management System software 
platform, which gives the client control 
along with access to high-quality, real-time

pr Ior It IEs and focus for 2013
Regardless of the stage of the economic cycle, our long-term aims and the structural growth 
opportunities in our industry remain unchanged and we will continue to work within the 
framework of our four Strategic Pillars as we build towards achieving them. The long-term 
opportunities in this industry are very significant indeed.
At the same time, we recognise the need for short-term financial performance. Looking 
ahead to 2013, we expect the overall economic backdrop to remain difficult and our markets 
to continue to be multi-speed. That means we need to be both adaptable to the world as it 
changes and selective about areas for investment. Achieving the right balance of building 
scale for the long term, exploiting stronger market segments and reducing costs and driving 
productivity to maximise the bottom line in more difficult areas will be key to our success.
Within this, my primary focus will be on the following specific areas for 2013:
delivering improved financial performance in the uk
Our number-one priority is improving the financial performance of the UK business.  
The recessionary UK market, however, remains very difficult, and in many of our core 
specialisms such as Banking & Finance, or Construction & Property, the market continues  
to be increasingly challenging. We have already made significant progress in reducing  
the cost base of the UK business and thereby defended the financial performance of  
the business over the year. However, we will continue to look for further areas to reduce 
costs but will be careful this will not damage the underlying fabric of the business. 
Simultaneously, we will continue to focus on improving the productivity of our consultant 
base and redirecting resources to fully capitalise on all opportunities for growth.
s elective investment in growth markets or buoyant areas
Over the years we have deliberately built a business with exposure to a diversified range  
of industry specialisms and a market leadership position in most. Several opportunities  
for growth exist across the business today, even in the current uncertain macroeconomic 
environment, particularly in those industries characterised by highly skilled technical experts. 
Examples include life sciences, natural resources and mining, oil and gas and IT engineering. 
Having already built the global market-leading brand in each of these technical areas, our 
clients and candidates recognise the depth of our expertise to help them and  
we will continue to invest selectively in these areas, for example by increasing headcount  
in our existing businesses in large markets such as Germany, Australia and Canada as well  
as building critical mass in our newer markets such as the USA and Brazil.
Ensuring we capitalise on structural growth opportunities 
The structural growth potential of our industry represents a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. 
We have built businesses with market-leading exposure to the most significant opportunities 
and a key focus remains on ensuring we are ideally positioned to fully capitalise on this, 
whether that is in more developed economies such as Germany or Japan, or emerging 
economies such as Brazil. We will continue to invest appropriately to build our business in 
these areas so that we maintain market-leading positions, and seize the long-term potential 
for growth that exists.

The performance of the Group is 
significantly impacted by changes to  
the underlying economic situation, 
particularly in the United Kingdom, 
Australia and Germany.
The Group has diversified its operations to include a balance of both 
temporary and permanent placement recruitment services to public and 
private-sector markets, and operates across 33 countries and 20 sector 
specialisms. That said, as at 30 June 2012 Group profits are heavily 
concentrated in two countries, namely Australia and Germany.
The Group’s cost base is highly variable and is carefully managed to align 
with business activity.
The Group has ensured that net debt has been kept at an appropriate level.
The Group is highly cash generative, requiring low levels of asset 
investment. Cash collection is a key priority and the Group has made 
appropriate investment in its credit control and working capital 
management processes.

The Group faces a number of industry  
risk factors in the competitive environment 
notably the gradual shift towards 
outsourced recruitment models with 
associated margin pressures and  
the increasing use of social media.
We have leveraged our broad geographical and sectoral footprint to  
win a significant number of multispecialism contracts with large corporate 
organisations. This has strengthened significantly our relationship with 
these clients, increasing our share of their recruitment spend and 
increasing our share of the markets in which we operate.
We monitor changes in the market in terms of industry trends including 
social media and insourcing, and continue to invest in our online presence 
to provide a high-quality customer experience.

The Group is reliant on its ability to recruit, 
train, develop and retain staff to deliver its 
growth plans.
We continue to ensure that overall remuneration packages are 
competitive. This includes performance-related commissions to 
incentivise staff.
Increased focus has been given to internal recruitment activities and 
training opportunities (for example through e-learning).
Our leadership development programmes are in place and developing 
the potential of future leaders.
Annual succession plans are undertaken across all regions to identify key 
roles and successor options.
We maintain medium to long-term management incentive schemes for 
our top 360 employees to foster commitment to the continued growth

Certain checks are required before we 
place candidates into their roles. For 
certain roles and industries those checks 
are more specific as set out by legislation. 
Failure to complete, maintain or refresh 
those checks could lead to legal, financial 
and reputational consequences. 
All new employees receive training in respect of the relevant operating 
standards that are applicable to their particular recruitment role. The 
Compliance function is also available to provide support and guidance 
to recruitment consultants.
Our higher-risk specialisms such as Education and Healthcare have 
supplementary processes and controls in place to ensure that 
operational standards are complied with.
In territories where legislation sets out additional requirements 
compliance specialists are employed, for example in occupational health 
and safety in Australia. 
Dedicated compliance auditors conduct spot checks on candidate 
records, to ensure that the appropriate vetting checks and due diligence 
are carried out in line with legal and contractual requirements.

The Group continues to develop and 
integrate new systems to improve 
performance. Business activities are 
increasingly reliant on system performance 
and integrity (Hays’ and its clients’ 
systems) to deliver service to clients and 
workers. A large amount of confidential 
data is held in these systems.
Technology systems are housed in various data centres and the Group 
has capacity to cope with a data centres loss through the establishment 
of disaster recovery sites that are physically based in separate locations 
to the ongoing operations.
Data protection remains a key priority. Specific contractual provisions 
exist with regard to our data centres to ensure we have sufficient 
handling and storage procedures around confidential data. 
The Company has in place data protection and security policies and, 
where data protection legislation allows, email monitoring programmes 
are undertaken to highlight potential areas of concern, which are then 
investigated.
c ontract r Isk 
Group companies enter into contractual 
arrangements with clients, some of which 
can be onerous in terms of required 
activities.
During contract negotiations management seeks to minimise risk and 
ensure that the nature of risks and their potential impact is understood.
Our legal team has the depth of knowledge and experience to enable 
them to advise management on the level of risk presented in contracts.
Reviews are performed on a risk basis across key contracts, to identify 
and agree improvements to the way in which we deliver services  
to clients.
The Group Finance Director reviews and approves all contracts with 
non-standard terms.
f or EIgn E xchang E
The Group has significant operations 
outside the UK and is therefore exposed 
to foreign exchange translation risk.
Profits from Australia and Euro-based markets are a material proportion 
of the Group’s profitability. There is no active management of translation 
foreign exchange risk, however, we continue to monitor our policies in 
this area.
Eurozon E
The Group has a number of operations  
in the Eurozone and would be exposed 
should one or more countries exit the Euro.
As part of its discussions, the Board has considered the impact on 
global trading and business prospects, country risk (collapse, debt 
default and funding pressure), bank counterparty risk, trade debtor 
recoverability, the impact on Group funding, the carrying values of 
financial and non-financial assets, foreign exchange exposure and 
interest rate risk, and ways to mitigate against each of these risks  
as far as practicable. 
Overall, save for the material impact that a disorderly fragmentation  
of the Eurozone would likely have on business and candidate 
confidence, the Eurozone risks identified by the Board relating 
to the exit of one or more countries from the Euro are considered 
to be manageable. Hays PLC Annu Al Repo Rt & Fin Anci Al St Atement S 2012 24

In Asia Pacific, net fees increased by 15% (10% on a like-for-like 
basis
(1)
) to £242.2 million and operating profit increased by 16%  
(11% on a like-for-like basis
(1)
) to £90.9 million. The difference 
between actual growth and like-for-like growth was predominantly 
due to the appreciation in the Australian Dollar. The business 
continued to achieve an excellent conversion rate of 37.5%, up  
from 37.2% in the prior year, as we carefully balanced the need  
to drive profitability with selective investment to capitalise on  
the long-term growth potential across the region.
In our market-leading Australia & New Zealand business, net fees 
were up 10%
(1)
 versus prior year. Temporary placement net fees 
increased by 18%
(1)
 and we achieved record temporary levels in 
several months. Permanent placement net fees declined by 1%
(1)
  
with an excellent performance in the resource-based regions of 
Western Australia and Queensland offset by increasingly tough 
market conditions in New South Wales and Victoria. New Zealand 
also delivered excellent net fee growth of 34%
(1)
. Our public-sector 
business, which accounts for 24% of net fees in Australia & New 
Zealand, delivered good growth of 13%

. 
Our Asian business, which accounted for 13% of the division’s net 
fees in the year, delivered net fee growth of 11%
(1)
. Japan delivered 
strong net fee growth of 16%
(1)
, although comparators include the 
impact of the March 2011 earthquake and subsequent disruption. 
Elsewhere in Asia, market conditions were mixed and became more 
challenging as the year progressed, notably in those businesses with 
a significant weighting towards banking and financial services such 
as Hong Kong and Singapore.
Consultant headcount
(2)
 in the division increased by 4% over the 
year, with 3% more consultants in Australia & New Zealand and 5%  
in Asia, but we took action to reduce headcount by 2% in the second 
half as we became more selective about areas of investment. We will 
continue with this approach going forward, as although we continue 
to selectively increase consultant headcount in the resources-based 
regions of Australia and to capitalise on structural growth in Japan, 
we remain cautious elsewhere in order to protect the profitability of 
the division while market conditions remain challenging. Hays PLC Annu Al Repo Rt & Fin Anci Al St Atement S 2012 26

T aking advantage of our international network 
and globally integrated systems is vital to our 
success. Hays Netherlands has demonstrated 
the benefits of cross-border collaboration 
working with NXP Semiconductors.
Our team in the Netherlands has a 
well-established relationship with NXP , having 
successfully implemented a managed service 
for the sourcing and management of highly skilled 
specialists in R&D, IT and Finance. This paved 
the way for our teams in Austria and Germany 
to begin working with the market-leading 
semiconductor company in December 2011.
“Within NXP, managed service is a new initiative that includes the 
sourcing of specialised engineers, IT and finance professionals. 
Hays has been successful in solving our sourcing challenges in the 
Netherlands and is now rolling out this principle further in Germany, 
Austria and Belgium. We have just extended our contract for another 
two years as we believe that this partnership will become very 
successful in the other countries.”

In Continental Europe & Rest of World, we delivered net fee growth 
of 21% (23% on a like-for-like basis
(1)
) to £266.5 million, driving 
excellent operating profit growth of 35% (37% on a like-for-like 
basis
(1)
) to £43.7 million. Both net fees and operating profit in the 
year represented records for the division. The difference between 
actual growth and like-for-like growth was primarily due to the 
depreciation in the Euro. The conversion rate increased to 16.4%  
in 2012 from 14.7% in 2011 driven by broad-based net fee growth  
in the more buoyant markets, strong cost control across the division 
and more selective headcount investment in the more challenging 
areas, particularly in the second half of the year.
Our German business, which represented 51% of the division’s net 
fees and the majority of the division’s profit, delivered excellent net 
fee growth of 30%
(1)
 and posted several record monthly performances 
as momentum remained strong through the year. Growth was 
broadly based across our contracting, temporary and permanent 
placement businesses, particularly in our core specialisms of IT and 
Engineering. We also achieved strong growth in Accountancy & 
Finance, Construction & Property, Sales & Marketing, Legal and Life 
Sciences and these specialisms now account for 23% of total net 
fees. Our market-leading position and the increasing diversification 
of the business means we are ideally positioned to benefit from  
the continuing rapid development of the specialist recruitment 
market in Germany and the clear structural growth opportunities  
this presents.
Elsewhere in Europe, activity was significantly impacted by the 
Eurozone crisis and more general macroeconomic uncertainty.  
In France, our second largest country in the division, we recorded 
17%
(1)
 net fee growth, although permanent momentum slowed 
markedly in the second half. Our other businesses in Continental 
Europe, covering 14 countries and focused principally on the 
permanent placement markets, delivered net fee growth of 9%.
We continue to invest in our business in Latin America, recognising 
the structural growth opportunities in this market. Having opened 
Hays Colombia and Chile in the year, we now operate in four countries 
across seven offices in Latin America. In Brazil, which is now the sixth 
largest country in the Group, we delivered excellent net fee growth 
of 30%
(1)
. In North America, Canada delivered strong net fee growth 
of 25% and we started to diversify our offering in the US by opening 
our second office in Houston, which will focus on Oil & Gas.
Consultant headcount
(2)
 in the division increased by 15% during  
the year, led by increases of 16% in Germany, 29% in Brazil and 56% 
in Canada. We are continuing to invest in consultant headcount in 
those regions which demonstrate clear growth, while being more 
cautious across the rest of the division to maximise our financial 
performance. As a result, consultant headcount was broadly flat 
in the second half.

thrive despite the more difficult economic 
conditions. We have many clients in highly 
technical industries, where the demand for 
skills and experience is high, but the number  
of available candidates is limited. 
Having built a deep relationship with Bentley, 
our team is able to fully understand their 
specific challenges in sourcing high-quality, 
skilled people, and solve them using  
Hays’ network
“Bentley work closely with Hays to source high-quality candidates 
across our niche business areas including Finance, Procurement 
and IT. For example, when setting up a new company-wide 
Programme Management Office it was important to find the 
right candidates for such a specialist area. Hays supported us 
by working hard to source candidates with exactly the right skills 
and requirements.”

publ Ic s Ector
In the United Kingdom & Ireland, net fees decreased by 7% to  
£225.3 million, with an operating loss of £6.5 million. Net fees  
fell by 8% in the permanent placement business and by 6%  
in the temporary placement business, and are now down 50%  
versus peak levels. 
Trading conditions in the UK have been tough and became 
increasingly difficult as the year progressed. In our UK private-sector 
business, net fees declined by 6%. Markets were particularly difficult 
in our Banking and City-related specialisms, but as the year progressed 
conditions became tougher across much of the market as confidence 
amongst candidates and clients was negatively impacted by the 
worsening economic conditions.
Our public-sector business, which represented 24% of UK net fees, 
faced tough but stable market conditions throughout the year, with 
net fees decreasing by 8%. We continue to expect this business to 
remain broadly stable at these subdued levels in the short term.
In Ireland, our business performed well delivering excellent net fee 
growth of 30%
(1)
.
UK financial performance was negatively affected as a result of these 
more challenging market conditions. However, despite the fact that 
net fees in the second half were 6% lower than those in the first half, 
the successful implementation of a series of cost-saving initiatives 
meant that the sequential financial performance of the business in 
the second half broadly reflected that of the first half. The various 
cost-reduction programmes incurred one-off costs of £5.8 million, 
which were offset by a £6.0 million curtailment gain on the closure  
of the UK defined benefit pension scheme to future accrual at the 
end of the year.
Consultant headcount
(3)
 in the division declined 10% during the  
year primarily through natural attrition, as we reacted to changes  
in market conditions to defend the financial performance of the 
business. We continue to review all aspects of our UK cost base, 
which we have already reduced by circa 30% from peak levels, with 
particular emphasis on overhead and back-office support costs.  
At the same time, our focus is on growing market share and taking 
full advantage of those segments of the UK recruitment market 
which continue to present revenue growth opportunities.

Group turnover increased by 12% (or 11% on a like-for-like basis
(1)
) and net fees increased by 
9% (8%
 
on a like-for-like basis
(1)
), driving operating profit growth of 12%
(2)
 (9%
 
on a like-for-
like basis
(1)
). The difference in growth rates between Group turnover and net fees was 
primarily driven by a change in mix between the temporary and permanent businesses. 
Exchange rate movements had a positive impact on the results overall increasing net fees 
and operating profit by £7.1 million and £3.4 million respectively, as depreciation in the rate 
of exchange of the Euro was more than offset by favourable movements in other Group 
currencies, particularly the Australian Dollar. Fluctuations in exchange rates remain a 
significant sensitivity for the Group.
The Group’s operating cost base increased by 8%
(1)
 versus prior year. This was principally due 
to the fact that, whilst the Group’s consultant headcount increased 1% year-on-year at the end 
of June, it was 9% higher, on average, throughout the year. The other primary driver of the 
increase was a rise in commission payments in line with net fees. The Group’s conversion rate, 
which is the proportion of net fees converted into operating profit
(2)
, increased to 17.5% from 
17.0% in the prior year. This was driven by net fee growth and strong control of the Group’s 
operating cost base.
Group consultant headcount increased by 1% during the year, but was down 4% in the second 
half. The full year increase was driven by an 11% rise in the number of consultants in the 
International business, where we continue to invest in order to ensure the Group capitalises 
on the more buoyant markets and on the clear structural growth opportunities that exist 
across many of our International markets. This was principally offset by a 10% reduction in 
consultant headcount in the UK, which was largely as a result of natural attrition, as we 
reacted to changes in market conditions to defend the financial performance of the business.

Net fees from temporary placements, which represent 56% of Group fees, increased by 
12%
(1)
. This comprised a volume increase of 4% and a favourable increase in mix/hours 
worked of 9%, partially offset by underlying margins
(4)
, which were slightly lower at 14.6% 
(2011: 14.7%). Margins have remained broadly stable through the year.
Net fees in the permanent placement business, representing 44% of Group net fees, 
increased by 3%
(1)
. The average fee per placement increased by 6%
(1)
, driven primarily by  
the mix of business, as more of our permanent fees were generated by the International 
business where the average salary of candidates placed is higher. This was partially  
offset by a 3% decline in placement volumes.
The higher level of growth in temporary relative to permanent placements reflects the 
greater resilience of the temporary placement business in more challenging, uncertain 
markets. We saw lower levels of activity in permanent placements, particularly in the second 
half of the year, as client and candidate confidence in many markets was negatively 
impacted by heightened global economic uncertainty.

selective, targeted investment to capitalise on stronger markets and deliver  
profitable fee growth
We have continued to selectively invest to grow our international platform, opening new 
offices and developing new specialisms in existing countries. In Asia Pacific ,we opened an 
office in Guangzhou (our fourth in China) and, in May 2012, we launched Hays Malaysia, our 
seventh Asia Pacific country of operation and the 33rd country for the Group. In Continental 
Europe & Rest of World we opened offices in Cologne and Leipzig (Germany), Houston 
(USA) and Gosselies (Belgium) and we are continuing to develop our business in Latin 
America, where we launched new businesses in Colombia and Chile. 
In the UK we continued the consolidation of our office network ending the financial year  
with 110 offices, a reduction of 15 in the year and down from a peak level of 235 in 2009.
Our consultant headcount ended June at 5,013, up 1% year-on-year but down 4% in the 
second half, reflecting our more selective, targeted investment approach. In our International 
business, we increased consultant headcount by 11% in the year to 3,079. Consultant 
headcount in UK & Ireland reduced 10%, primarily through natural attrition. 
We continue to build a stronger, broader-based and more efficient business. Our best-in-
class IT systems enable us to interact with new media and social networks effectively, 
provide data capture on candidates and opportunities globally, and allow us to manage 
administration more efficiently. Each of these elements are critical to ensure we continue  
to provide market-leading service to our clients and candidates, and anticipate and respond 
to their evolving needs. 
c urr Ent trad Ing
c ontinued mixed conditions, with pockets of strong growth but overall more 
challenging, notably in permanent markets
Overall trading conditions became more challenging through the second half, particularly  
in the fourth quarter. The difficult global economic environment continues to have a negative 
impact on candidate and client confidence in many markets, particularly in permanent 
recruitment markets.
Conditions in Australia are sequentially stable overall, with comparatives becoming tougher. 
We continue to see growth in Western Australia, although this is offset by tougher conditions 
elsewhere. In Asia, markets with significant weighting towards banking remain particularly 
tough. In Continental Europe & Rest of World, we see continued strong growth in Germany 
and Canada, and good growth in markets such as Brazil and Russia, but growth is slowing 
across much of the rest of the division, and net fees are declining in certain countries. In the 
UK, the market continues to be very difficult.
Looking ahead, whilst we continue to see pockets of growth and opportunity in certain 
markets, overall the environment remains challenging and in some countries very  
difficult. We will continue to react quickly to changing conditions in each market, investing 
selectively to capitalise on growth and defending the financial performance where markets 
are more difficult. Hays PLC Annu Al Repo Rt & Fin Anci Al St Atement S 2012 32

The net finance charge for the year was £5.7 million (2011: £7.5 million). The average interest  
rate on gross debt during the year was 2.8% (2011: 2.5%), generating net bank interest 
payable, including amortisation of arrangement fees, of £7.1 million (2011: £6.0 million). 
The net interest credit on the defined benefit pension scheme obligations was £2.3 million 
(2011: charge of £1.2 million), with the change being primarily due to higher scheme asset 
values increasing expected asset returns. The charge for the Pension Protection Fund levy 
was £0.9 million (2011: £0.3 million). It is expected that the net finance charge for the year 
ending 30 June 2013 will be around £10 million due to the IAS 19 pension charge and an 
expected increase due to early refinancing of the revolving credit facility.

Taxation for the year was £46.9 million, representing an effective tax rate of 38.3% (2011: 
33.0% pre-exceptional items). The effective tax rate reflects the Group’s geographical mix  
of profits and the impact of unrelieved overseas tax losses and costs incurred in the UK, for 
which no tax deduction is currently available. We expect the Group’s effective tax rate to be 
around 40% in 2013.
dIscont Inu Ed op Erat Ions
A profit from discontinued operations of £11 million arose in the year, primarily from  
the write-back of provisions that were established when the Group completed the disposal 
of its non-core activities between March 2003 and November 2004 which, in the light of 
subsequent events, are no longer required.
EarnI ngs p Er sharE
Basic earnings per share increased 5% to 5.47 pence (2011: 5.19 pence
(2)
). The increase  
in earnings per share reflects the Group’s higher operating profit and the lower net finance 
charge, partially offset by an increase in the effective tax rate. 
c ash flow and balanc E sh EEt
Cash flow in the year was excellent with 127% conversion of operating profit
(2)
 into  
operating cash flow
(3)
. This was higher than the cash flow conversion in the prior year  
(2011: 85%) primarily as a result of stronger working capital management, with trade debtor 
days decreased to 35 days (2011: 38 days). Overall, cash inflow from working capital was  
£3.2 million and net cash generated by operations
(3)
 was £162.2 million (2011: £97.3 million).
Net capital expenditure was higher at £18.8 million (2011: £18.6 million). Capital expenditure  
is expected to reduce to around £10 million in 2013.
Dividends paid in the year totalled £65.8 million, pension deficit contributions were  
£12.4 million and £6.2 million was paid out in net interest. Net debt therefore reduced  
slightly from £134.8 million at the start of the year to £132.9 million at the end of the year.  
The Group expects a modest reduction in net debt in 2013. The Group has a £300 million 
unsecured revolving credit facility available, which expires in January 2014.
The most significant item in the Group balance sheet is trade receivables, which were 
£351.4 million at year end (2011: £345.6 million). The increase in trade receivables reflects 
the increase in revenue offset by the improvement in debtor days.

The Group’s pension liability under IAS 19 at 30 June 2012 of £15.4 million (£10.4 million 
net of deferred tax) increased by £3.5 million compared to 30 June 2011, primarily due to the 
net effect of a decrease in the net yield (discount rate versus RPI inflation rate) being partially 
offset by higher than expected asset returns and employer contributions.
During the year, the Company contributed £15.5 million of cash to the defined benefit scheme 
(2011: £16.5 million), which included £12.4 million funding towards the pension deficit in line 
with previous guidance. 
c ap Ital structur E and d Iv IdEnd
The Board’s priorities for our free cash flow are to fund the Group’s investment and 
development, maintain a strong balance sheet and deliver a sustainable dividend at a level 
that is affordable and appropriate. 
As we set out in our Half Year Results statement, the increased global economic uncertainty, 
which impacted our business in the year, slowed the pace of the Group’s profit growth.  
At the end of the first half, considering this slowing of profit growth and our view on the 
likely growth in Group profitability in the second half, the Board decided that, whilst the 
previous level of dividend remained affordable, it was no longer appropriate to maintain the 
dividend at that level, which had been uncovered for the last two years. The Board therefore 
decided to rebase the dividend and paid an interim dividend of 0.83 pence per share  
(2011: 1.85 pence).
In line with this policy, the Board proposes to pay a final dividend of 1.67 pence per share 
(2011: 3.95 pence), resulting in a total dividend for the full year of 2.50 pence per share  
(2011: 5.80 pence).
We believe that dividends should be covered by earnings in the range 2.0x to 3.0x
(2)
  
and consider this payout policy to be appropriately covered by earnings and cash flow. 
The Board remains committed to paying a sustainable and progressive dividend. It is our 
intention to grow the dividend when dividend cover sustainably reaches circa 2.5x
(2)
. 
The recommended dividend payment date will be 16 November 2012 and, if approved, will 
be paid to shareholders who are on the register at the close of business on 12 October 2012.
t r Easury manag EmEnt
The Group’s operations are financed by retained earnings and bank borrowings. The Group 
has an unsecured £300 million revolving credit facility, in place until January 2014, and uses 
this facility to manage its day-to-day working capital requirements as appropriate. We have 
begun refinancing discussions with our banking group, which are progressing well.
All borrowings are raised by the Group’s UK-based Treasury department, which manages  
the Group’s treasury risk in accordance with policies set by the Board. The Group’s treasury 
department does not engage in speculative transactions and does not operate as a profit centre. 
The Board considers it appropriate to use certain derivative financial instruments to reduce 
its exposure to interest rate movements under its floating rate revolving credit facility. The 
Group holds six interest rate swaps which exchange a fixed payment for floating rate receipt 
on a total debt value of £40 million with an equal mix of two-year and three-year maturities, 
which commenced in October 2011. The Group does not hold or use derivative financial 
instruments for speculative purposes.
Counterparty risk primarily arises from investment of any surplus funds. The Group restricts 
transactions to banks and money market funds that have an acceptable credit rating and 
limits exposure to each institution. Hays PLC Annu Al Repo Rt & Fin Anci Al St Atement S 2012 34
Corporate governan Ce report
Dear Sharehol Der
In 2012, your Board has delivered the robust, 
focused and responsive governance needed  
to lead the Group through the most complex 
trading conditions we have experienced.
In this Report, I will explain and illustrate how your Board has dealt 
with the most important business opportunities and challenges 
faced by the Group during the year. World economic affairs  
have been dominated by ongoing problems in certain Eurozone 
economies. These have acted as a very unwelcome drag on the 
economies of a number of our major European markets. However, 
your Board has not lost sight of the growth opportunities that exist 
in many parts of the world. In this increasingly complex world, 
balanced and effective governance is needed as never before.
Boar D governan Ce
Two director changes in the year have broadened the skills and 
perspective of the Board, as well as its diversity. We have welcomed 
Victoria Jarman and Pippa Wicks as independent non-executive 
directors. Victoria’s expert knowledge of international finance and 
operations is extremely valuable as business complexity increases. 
With a proven track record as a strategic business adviser and a 
leader of world-class businesses, Pippa adds considerable weight 
and insight to the Board’s discussions. Biographical information on 
Victoria, Pippa and the other directors can be found on pages 38 
and 39. Having served the Company for over nine years, Lesley Knox 
stepped down as a director following the Annual General Meeting on 
9 November 2011. As a result, Paul Harrison took over as Chairman of 
the Remuneration Committee and Senior Independent Director and 
Victoria Jarman became Chairman of the Audit Committee in place 
of Paul Harrison. Two of our nine directors are female, representing 
22% of your Board, which is a positive development and is in line 
with the recommendations made in February 2011 by Lord Davies  
in his report entitled ‘Women on Boards’. 
Details on Board effectiveness can be found on pages 45 and 46. 
However, I would like to highlight some of the steps we have taken  
in the year to ensure that your Board is, and continues to be, fit for 
purpose. My aims are to maintain a strong and diverse Board and to 
get the best out of the Board’s expertise. A hands-on understanding 
of our businesses and their profit drivers remain top priorities for 
each Board member. I have met with the Management Board in  
the year and have continued to build relationships with other senior 
executives in the Group. As Chairman, it is also my responsibility to 
promote regular interaction between the non-executive directors 
and key business managers. This approach ensures that the 
non-executive directors can contribute to Board discussions through 
constructive input and effective challenge. During the year, the 
Board visited operations in Germany, France and the UK, held an 
off-site strategy day with the Management Board members and  
two other senior international business managers and received 
detailed presentations from divisional senior managers on significant 
developments within their businesses. During site visits, the directors 
are given an opportunity to meet with a large number of employees 
to learn more about our people, markets and services. I chose the 
visits to Germany and France because we want to leverage greater 
growth in those countries in the medium term. In the year, the Board 
has also visited our new flagship London office in Cheapside to learn 
more about the UK operations.
Ongoing director training is essential for any top-performing board. 
All new directors receive initial induction training on a diverse range 
of business, trading, investor, organisational and legal matters.  
The Board receives external periodic training on important topics 
through the Deloitte Academy programme and ad hoc presentations 
and papers from advisers and Group functions including Company 
Secretarial, Legal, Tax and Treasury. During the year, the directors 
received training on trends in financial reporting, corporate 
governance and risk, corporate responsibility, and potential impacts 
arising from a disorderly breakup of the Eurozone. 
alan thoMS on CHAIRMAN 35 directors’ report Governance r iSk an D aCC ounta Bility You will find a summary of our principal risks on pages 22 and  
23 and an explanation of our risk control framework in the Audit 
Committee Report on page 49. The Board’s role in risk management 
is crucial, as it sets the Group’s risk appetite and controls framework. 
The Audit Committee ensures that the businesses are operating 
within the limits set by the Board. No organisation is perfect. 
However, I am pleased to say that a culture of risk awareness is 
fostered through all levels within Hays, supported by targeted 
training on key topics and diligent management. Business standards 
and control measures are clearly articulated throughout the Group 
and there is responsiveness and accountability as required. 
Risk is an inevitable consequence of doing business, whether  
the risks are internal or external to an organisation. Your Board  
and senior management work hard to set a culture that is zero-
tolerant toward ethical risks and measured and appropriate toward 
business risks. 
Of course, the Eurozone crisis has rarely been out of the headlines. 
The Board has considered the potential impact should one or more 
countries exit the Euro. More information is contained in the Principal 
Risks on page 23.
Bribery and corruption exposures have been a particular area  
of focus for most UK companies operating overseas, due to the 
introduction of the UK Bribery Act in 2011. We took the opportunity 
to carry out thorough bribery risk assessments of all our businesses 
in December 2010 and launched a new anti-bribery and corruption 
policy based on those findings in June 2011. This was supported  
by general training for every employee worldwide and specialist 
training for senior operations and finance managers. Our risk 
assessments found that Hays has a reasonably low risk profile. 
Nonetheless, we have implemented measures that aim to prevent 
any acts of bribery and corruption by, or on behalf of, Hays anywhere 
in the world and have kept those measures under review to ensure 
that they are operating effectively. The 2012 Corporate Responsibility 
Report, which is published online at hays.com/corporate-responsibility, 
includes a fuller description of our actions on anti-bribery and corruption.
engaging with Sharehol Der S
As Chairman, I remain available at all times to discuss with shareholders 
any matters they wish to raise. During the year, we held over 300 
separate meetings with institutional investors and made six set-piece 
results presentations. In the 2012 Thomson Extel investor relations 
survey, Paul Venables was ranked no. 1 finance director and Alistair 
Cox was ranked no. 2 chief executive in the European business 
services sector, as voted by the investor and analyst community.  
Our Head of Investor Relations was ranked no. 2 amongst investor 
relations professionals. In the Institutional Investor 2012 study of  
the top ranked European investor relations programmes, Hays was 
ranked no. 1 in the European business and employment services 
sector based on the views of sell-side analysts and investors. These 
accolades are important and demonstrate how seriously Hays takes 
communication with investors.

com/investors. I would encourage all private investors to look out for 
updates after results announcements and to attend the Hays annual 
general meeting held each November, where we seek to give brief 
reports on key developments in the business.
As I have already mentioned, Paul Harrison took over from Lesley 
Knox as Senior Independent Director last November. Paul is a very 
experienced finance director and is an alternative point of contact 
for investors. We have written to our top 10 shareholders introducing 
Paul as Senior Independent Director and providing his direct contact 
details. Paul will also have contact with our largest shareholders  
from time to time in his capacity as Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee. The Remuneration Committee Chairman, in conjunction 
with the Committee’s remuneration advisers, leads consultation with 
major shareholders whenever a change in remuneration policy is 
proposed. We keep the policy under regular review in the light of 
trends and developing shareholder sentiment. The Remuneration 
Committee reviewed the remuneration policy during the year and 
believes the policy remains appropriate. More information on the 
policy can be found in the Remuneration Report on pages 56 and 57.
During the year we carried out the first stakeholder engagement 
survey of our corporate responsibility programme between January 
and March 2012. Shareholders will be able to express their views on

You will find a summary of the work done by the Board and its 
committees in the last financial year on page 44. I want to highlight 
two areas in particular. The first is the financial performance of the 
UK business which has been adversely affected by the prolonged  
UK economic downturn. Whilst the progress of all Hays’ businesses 
is closely monitored, improving the financial performance of the  
UK business remains an important area for the Board’s focus and  
a top priority. More information on the steps taken within the UK 
business can be found in the Chief Executive’s Strategic Review on 
page 17. The second area I wish to highlight is our German business 
which has enjoyed significant growth since acquisition in 2003.  
Our German business is a leader in IT and Engineering and is well 
positioned in its markets to capitalise on further growth opportunities 
including diversification into other segments such as Construction & 
Property and Finance. During its visit to Germany, the Board received 
presentations from the German management team on its plans for 
the business and also met a large number of employees in one of our 
largest offices in Mannheim.
Boar D prioritie S in 2013
This year, in addition to Board succession, my priorities for Board 
governance will be further director training and understanding  
the impact of technology on the changing business model. I will also 
ensure that the Board maintains the flexibility it needs to address all 
the demands placed upon it. At this year’s Annual General Meeting 
Paul Stoneham will be retiring as a non-executive director having 
served on the Board for eight years. As Chairman of the Nomination 
Committee, I will be leading the process for the appointment of a 
new non-executive director giving particular attention to the diverse 
skills and experience required in the future for a Group with an 
expanding international footprint.

The Board is organised to apply breadth and depth, in both 
experience and skills, to ensure the successful development of the 
business, deliver shareholder value sustainably over the long term 
and to enable the Company to make a positive contribution to 
society. The Board sets the goals for the business, its culture and 
standards of conduct. The health of any business is measured  
in part by the extent to which risk and reward are balanced, how  
the business uses its strengths to reach its potential and how it 
effectively addresses its areas of weakness. Essentially, the Board 
establishes an entrepreneurial framework within which the business 
can flourish without promoting excessive risk taking. 
Alan Thomson manages and leads the Board as Chairman. The 
Chairman’s main objective is to ensure the Board performs all its 
functions effectively and sets the standard of leadership for the 
senior managers and employees to follow throughout the Group.  
As part of his formal remit, Alan:
•	 sets and manages the Board agenda;
•	 ensures the provision of sufficient, appropriate and timely 
information to all directors;
•	 ensures that effective communication takes place with 
shareholders and that the Board understands the views  
of shareholders;
•	 ensures the Board has adequate time to consider complex  
or strategically important issues;
•	 ensures the Board carries out regular risk management reviews 
and considers risk appetite; 
•	 ensures that the Board undertakes a regular review of the 
performance of executive management, Group succession 
planning and leadership development activities;
•	 ensures new directors receive appropriate induction training  
that is tailored to their specific requirements;
•	 is responsible for the development of the Board and its individual 
members, including ongoing training, ensuring optimal effectiveness 
and active engagement of all members; and
•	 ensures that the Board and its members are evaluated at least 
once a year and that this is externally facilitated every three years.
Alistair Cox manages and leads the Group’s business as Chief 
Executive. His core role is to carry out the strategic plans and policies 
established by the Board and to manage the business operations.  
In performing his remit, Alistair:
•	 formulates, develops and recommends the strategy and strategic 
priorities for the business;
•	 manages the implementation of the approved strategy and the 
strategic priorities;
•	 manages and optimises the operation and financial performance 
of the business;
•	 manages and delivers the appropriate communications to 
shareholders with the Group Finance Director;
•	 develops the effectiveness of the senior management team  
and manages the succession requirements; and
•	 ensures the Chairman is regularly appraised of current  
business issues.
The Company’s strategy is described in pages 14 and 15 of this 
Annual Report.
Paul Venables as Group Finance Director provides Board focus  
on the financial position of the Group, manages key stakeholder 
relationships, including shareholders and banks, oversees the 
Group’s financial reporting and control systems and assists the  
Chief Executive in operational matters. 
Paul Harrison represents the non-executive directors and is an 
alternative point of contact for shareholders in his role as Senior 
Independent Director. He also leads discussions on the Chairman’s 
performance and the succession of the Chairmanship, as required.  
In conjunction with his role as Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee, Paul is a key voice representing shareholder views  
on the Board.
Victoria Jarman chairs the Audit Committee and has a key role  
in the Company’s governance and control framework, including

Alison Yapp as Company Secretary and General Legal Counsel 
assists the Chairman in administering Board meetings, provides 
support and advice to the directors and acts as the principal adviser 
on governance and legal matters.
Biographie S, Skill S an D Contri Bution S
The effectiveness of the Board and its committees is determined  
by the qualities and experience of the individual directors. 
The non-executive directors bring an independent view to the 
Board’s discussions and the development of the Company’s strategy. 
Their range of skills and experience ensures that the performance  
of management in achieving the business goals is appropriately 
challenged. They also ensure that financial controls and systems  
of risk management are both rigorous and appropriate for the needs 
of the business.
The profiles on pages 38 and 39 demonstrate the range of experience, 
independent judgement and contribution each director brings to  
the Board.

The Board has agreed written terms of reference for each committee, 
which are available on the Company’s website, hays.com, and are 
also available upon request from the Company Secretary at the 
Registered Office. During the year, the Audit and Remuneration 
Committee reviewed their terms of reference to ensure that they 
remained in line with best practice guidance and the Company’s 
policies and practices. Two minor amendments were made to  
the Audit Committee terms of reference. The first related to the 
monitoring of the relationship with the Auditor whereby the 
Committee should consider whether the fees for audit and non-audit 
work provided by the Auditor were appropriate and whether an 
effective audit could be performed for the audit fee. The second was 
to confirm that the Committee should meet four times a year. No 
changes were considered necessary to the Nomination Committee 
and Remuneration Committee terms of reference.
o perational Manage Ment S tru Cture
Responsibility for the management and operations of the business  
is delegated to the Chief Executive who operates through the 
Management Board. The Management Board is chaired by the Chief 
Executive and consists of the Group Finance Director, Regional 
Managing Directors, the Group HR Director, the Group Marketing 
Director, the Group IT Director, the Group Digital & Innovation 
Director and the Company Secretary and General Legal Counsel. 
Clear levels of authority exist for the Management Board in their 
day-to-day activities.
Each of the Company’s Regional Managing Directors operates 
through their regional operating boards. Each regional board is led 
by the regional managing director and consists of key management 
from the region’s operations and business functions, including 
Finance, HR and Marketing.
As far as possible, each business is given autonomy, whilst being 
required to operate within the internal control environment established 
through the Group Policies and Procedures Manual, Anti-Bribery and 
Corruption Policy, Code of Conduct and Ethics Policy, Competition 
Compliance Policy, Financial Reporting Manual and schedule of 
Operational Delegated Authorities. Hays PLC Annu Al Repo Rt & Fin Anci Al St Atement S 2012 42
Managing ri Sk S an D internal C ontrol
The Board is responsible for the Group’s risk management process 
and its system of internal controls and for maintaining and reviewing 
their effectiveness. The Board annually reviews the nature and extent 
of significant risks identified by management both on a gross as well 
as a net (post mitigation) basis, and the status of mitigation plans. 
This exercise involves the presentation of risk findings to enable  
the Board to review and oversee the status of the key risks to the 
business. The Board in turn reflects on the level of risk appetite 
acceptable to the Group in order to achieve the Company’s strategic 
objectives. During the year, the Board reviewed the nature and extent 
of the significant risks in the Group on a gross and net basis and 
determined that the risks and their relative priority were appropriate 
and that actions had been defined and attributed to owners in order 
to treat the risks appropriately. The Board also considered the key 
regional risks that had been identified by management.
Day-to-day management of risk is overseen by the Management 
Board, which operates a risk management process involving 
assessment of key Group risks twice a year. The operating regions 
also conduct assessments of strategic and operational risks within 
each region. Each risk is assessed in terms of its likelihood to occur 
and the potential financial and reputational impact if it does so. 
Appropriate mitigation plans and strategies are put in place for those 
risks that are controllable. Progress on the management of risks is 
reported to the Management Board. During the year under review, 
the Management Board reviewed the progress of high-priority risks 
and also considered any new or emerging risks that were identified.
Risks are further controlled through delegated authorities and  
other written policies and procedures, which are approved by the 
Board, updated as necessary, and overseen by Group functional 
departments. The Group Policies and Procedures Manual, Financial 
Reporting Manual and the Operational Delegated Authorities, which 
encompass all of the Group’s operations, are designed to ensure that 
a minimum level of corporate, accounting, financial and operating 
controls are in place and allow matters to be appropriately and 
promptly escalated to senior management and the Board. The 
Group’s Anti-Bribery and Corruption, Code of Conduct and Ethics, 
and Competition Compliance Policies outline the way in which 
employees are expected to conduct themselves when carrying  
out their business activities. The manuals and policies are updated 
on an ongoing basis to reflect changes in procedures as and when 
they occur.
The Group operates a comprehensive budgeting, forecasting  
and financial reporting process. Annual budgets are reviewed  
and approved at business and Group levels. This process includes 
the identification and quantification of significant risks relating to 
markets and operations. Monthly performance is reported against 
budget and prior year. The monthly management accounts analyse 
and explain variances against budget and report on key indicators, 
with detailed explanations for variances and movements in forecasts 
provided to the Board. 
The Group’s Internal Audit department also focuses on facilitating 
the identification of risks and undertakes reviews and testing of the 
controls in place for their mitigation. The department’s resources  
are augmented with independent, expert external resource where 
necessary, to review risk and monitor compliance with the Group’s 
policies and procedures. Regular reviews of the most important 
controls are undertaken to ensure that key control objectives are 
achieved. Reports on the effectiveness of operational and financial 
controls are presented to management and to the Audit Committee 
at each meeting and recommendations are agreed upon with 
management and implemented.
The Group’s systems and controls are designed to manage  
risks, safeguard the Group’s assets and to ensure the reliability  
of information used both within the business and for publication. 
Systems are designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk  
of failure to achieve business objectives and can provide only 
reasonable and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. 
The principal risks disclosed on pages 22 and 23 represent the 
significant areas which the Board considers could most likely impact 
the Group’s financial performance and reputational standing.
internal C ontrol S tate Ment
Responsibility for reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s system 
of internal controls has been delegated to the Audit Committee. The 
Audit Committee has reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s 
system of internal controls for the year ended 30 June 2012, covering 
all material controls, including financial, operational and compliance 
controls and risk management systems and has concluded that it is 
in compliance with the revised Turnbull guidance – Internal Control: 
Revised Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code (October 
2005) published by the Financial Reporting Council. This internal 
control statement has been reviewed and approved by the Audit 
Committee. Further details on the Group’s internal control systems 
are reported in the Audit Committee Report on page 49.

Hays gains insight into the views of shareholders and other 
stakeholders through a variety of means. Feedback received through 
these engagement channels is regularly reported to the Board.
Primary responsibility for engaging with shareholders rests with the 
Chairman, Chief Executive and Group Finance Director, supported by 
the Investor Relations and Company Secretarial departments, and 
external advisers.
Should shareholders wish to raise any concern where the normal 
channels have failed to resolve the issue or are inappropriate for any 
reason, Paul Harrison is available to shareholders in his role as Senior 
Independent Director. Paul is a significant contributor to the Board 
on shareholders’ perspectives. 
h ow we engage with S harehol Der S
During the year, the Board has maintained a regular and open 
dialogue with investors. We have formal arrangements for engaging 
with shareholders including those described below.
investor meetings
The executive directors and the Investor Relations team regularly 
meet with analysts and major investors to discuss any concerns they 
may have and to explain the Company’s strategy.
The Group’s advisers maintain a dialogue with major shareholders 
and, following each investor roadshow, provide a report on the  
views of shareholders on key issues and management performance. 
A summary of this report is subsequently provided to the Board.
All non-executive directors are aware of the investor relations 
programme and are available should shareholders wish to meet 
them. Investors are offered the opportunity to meet the Chairman 
and Senior Independent Director.
annual general meeting
The annual general meeting provides an opportunity to communicate 
with all shareholders and in particular with our private shareholders. 
The Chairmen of the Audit, Nomination and Remuneration Committees 
are also available at the annual general meeting to answer any 
questions shareholders may have.
The Notice of Meeting sets out the resolutions being proposed at  
the Annual General Meeting to be held on 7 November 2012. It is  
the Company’s policy at present to take all resolutions at a general 
meeting on a poll.
Formal consultations
The Chairman of the Remuneration Committee consults with  
major investors and seeks their views on the proposed incentive 
arrangements for executive directors and senior management 
(where appropriate). From time to time, we specifically seek major 
shareholders’ views on other Company proposals.
Communications from shareholders and representative bodies
From time to time, we receive circulars directly from major 
shareholders and representative bodies, such as the Association  
of British Insurers, the National Association of Pension Funds and 
Pensions Investment Research Consultants Ltd. We also review the 
various environmental, social and governance reports published 
about us annually and endeavour to address any weaknesses or 
failings identified.
external advisers
Legal, financial, remuneration and communications advisers naturally 
have broad exposure to shareholder views and practice in the course 
of their research and work with their many clients. Appropriate 
external advice is sought by the Board, Board committees and 
Group departments when considering important issues.

Boar D eFFeCtivene SS
u n Der Stan Ding the B u Sine SS
We consider that, to function effectively, all members of the Board 
need appropriate knowledge of the Company and access to its 
operations and staff. Presentations and reports on commercial 
initiatives, our markets, our competitive position and general economic 
indicators are given periodically to the Board. In addition, we hold 
Board meetings away from the head office approximately three times  
a year, which allows focus on local markets and operations and enables 
the non-executive directors to meet the local management.
Boar D training an D Develop Ment
On appointment, directors receive a formal induction, which includes 
visits to relevant business units and functions and discussions with 
senior management. These are tailored to the needs of the individual 
director and continue throughout their tenure.
Briefing sessions on governance, legislative and accounting 
developments are held for the Board and its committees when 
appropriate. During the year, the Board received updates from the 
Company Secretarial department regarding corporate reporting 
trends, from Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP, the Company’s 
external legal advisers, about the potential impacts of a disorderly 
breakup of the Eurozone, and from the Auditor, Deloitte LLP,  
about trends in financial reporting, corporate governance and risk, 
and corporate responsibility. The Remuneration Committee received 
updates from their external advisers, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, 
regarding regulatory and governance changes and recent 
developments in shareholder sentiments, and the Audit Committee 
received updates from Deloitte LLP on developments in accounting 
standards and other regulatory and legislative changes.
per For Man Ce evaluation
This year the Board undertook an internal review of the effectiveness 
of the Board, its committees and individual members, having carried 
out an external review with Egon Zehnder in 2010. The next external 
review will take place in 2013 in line with the Code. As part of this 
year’s effectiveness review, each director (other than the Chairman) 
completed a questionnaire comprising questions relating to:
•	 information flows, Board papers and agenda composition;
•	 controls, risk management and risk appetite;
•	 board dynamics and relationships between Board members;
•	 the composition of the Board and its skills;
•	 discussion topics and decision making including the balance 
between operational and strategic matters;
•	 value creation, strategy and performance; and
•	 the effectiveness of the Audit, Nomination and Remuneration 
Committees.
The completed questionnaires were sent to the Company Secretary 
who compiled a report on the results of the evaluation for the 
Chairman’s consideration. The Chairman met with each of the 
directors individually to discuss the results of the review and their 
responses, and to provide constructive feedback. The findings of the 
2012 performance evaluation together with recommendations from 
the Chairman were then considered by the Board and certain actions 
will be implemented as a result. Hays PLC Annu Al Repo Rt & Fin Anci Al St Atement S 2012 46
Board and committee performance
The findings of the 2012 performance evaluation indicate that the 
structure and content of the Board meetings is considered to be 
appropriate and relationships between Board members are open 
and constructive. The balance between Board consideration of 
strategy and operational performance is considered to be appropriate. 
The strategy review away day is considered to be particularly useful 
and discussions were free-ranging and well informed. Overseas site 
visits are particularly valuable to Board members. The appointments 
in the year of Pippa Wicks and Victoria Jarman had increased 
business services experience on the Board, adding fresh energy  
and improving diversity. The Chairman provides strong leadership, 
encouraging open debate and challenge and Board members are 
satisfied that the Board is apprised of all material matters. The Board 
is aligned around the strategic objectives facing the business. 
The performance of each of the committees was also considered. 
The committees are well chaired and their structure and responsibilities 
are clear and appropriate. The Audit Committee also undertook its 
own separate review, details of which are reported in the Audit 
Committee Report on page 49.
This year the Senior Independent Director also undertook a separate 
review of the performance of the Chairman. He circulated a separate 
questionnaire relating to the performance of the Chairman, which  
all directors (other than the Chairman) and the Company Secretary 
completed. Following this the SID met with each of the directors to 
appraise the performance of the Chairman and also met with the 
Chairman to provide feedback. The results of the review were also 
presented to the Board.
Various actions arising from the 2011 performance evaluation review 
were addressed in the year, including the introduction of electronic 
board packs to facilitate meetings, increasing the Board’s focus  
on strategy and execution, facilitating external briefings on key 
issues affecting the Group, providing additional training updates  
on governance and regulatory matters, and continued operational 
focus in relation to efficiency improvements. 
Actions arising from this year’s review will include continuing focus 
on the Group’s key strategic objectives, further development of  
the Group’s senior talent pool, additional focus on mitigation of  
risk and consideration of risk appetite and enhancing the Board’s 
understanding of the business through specific site visits and 
discussion with employees. Looking forward, the Board will continue 
to ensure that it has the appropriate balance of skills and experience 
in relation to the strategic objectives of the business.
individual performance
The effectiveness of each member of the Board was reviewed  
in respect of the financial year. The Chairman, along with the 
non-executive directors, reviewed the performance of the executive 
directors individually against their objectives. The remuneration  
of the executive directors is linked to their respective performances 
and is determined by the Remuneration Committee based upon  
the result of these reviews. Further details are reported in the 
Remuneration Report on pages 54 to 65.
As reported above, the non-executive directors, led by the Senior 
Independent Director, met without the Chairman present to appraise 
his performance during the year.
Following the performance evaluation review, the Chairman is 
satisfied that each of the directors, who will all be put forward  
for reappointment at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, 
remains independent in character and judgement, taking into 
account their length of service. Each of the directors being put 
forward for reappointment at the 2012 Annual General Meeting 
continues to be effective. Their ongoing commitment to the role  
is undiminished and they continue to make a valuable contribution  
to the Board and its committees.

The Committee is chaired by the Chairman of the Board, as 
recommended by the Code. William Eccleshare, Paul Harrison, 
Richard Smelt and Paul Stoneham were members of the Committee 
throughout the year and Victoria Jarman was appointed as a 
member of the Committee with effect from 1 October 2011 and Pippa 
Wicks was appointed as a member of the Committee with effect 
from 1 January 2012. Lesley Knox stood down from the Committee

ROLE Of t HE nOmin Ati On C Ommitt EE
The Committee reviews the structure and composition of the Board 
annually to ensure it remains appropriate for the needs of the business 
and plans for the progressive refreshing of the Board. It leads the 
process for the identification and selection of new directors and makes 
recommendations to the Board in respect of such appointments, taking 
into consideration the benefits of diversity in terms of both gender and 
ethnicity. It also makes recommendations to the Board on committee 
membership, including the chairmanship of the committees.
mAin AC tiviti ES Of t HE nO minAti On C Ommitt EE
The Committee formally met four times during the year. The 
Committee considered the composition of the Board and the 
recommendation to appoint Victoria Jarman as a non-executive 
director of the Company and Chairman of the Audit Committee. 
Details regarding the search for Victoria Jarman, which was 
undertaken by The Zygos Partnership, were reported in the 2011 
Annual Report. The Committee also considered and approved  
the appointment of Paul Harrison as Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee and Senior Independent Director (SID). A description  
of the role of the SID, approved by the Committee, is available on the 
Company’s website at hays.com. As part of the Board performance 
evaluation process, and as required by the UK Corporate Governance 
Code, the effectiveness of Messrs Stoneham and Eccleshare as 
Directors was considered in view of their service extending beyond six 
years and the need to progressively refresh the Board. The Committee 
considered that both individuals continued to be effective and to 
demonstrate commitment to their respective roles. In accordance  
with the Code, the Committee considered that Richard Smelt, who 
was extending his term of membership of the Committee by a further 
three years, remained independent and continued to meet the criteria 
for membership. The Committee considered the recommendation to 
appoint Pippa Wicks as a non-executive director of the Company and 
shareholders will be asked to reappoint Pippa Wicks as a director at 
the Annual General Meeting. Further details regarding the search 
which resulted in Pippa Wicks’ appointment are described below.
Ski LLS An D COmp OSiti On
During the year the Committee reviewed the composition and  
skills of the Board with a view to considering the current and  
possible future skills and experience which the Board might require. 
As part of its review, the Board also considered executive director 
succession. It was noted that, at present, the majority of the Group’s 
net fees and all of the Group’s profit are earned outside the UK and  
it was therefore appropriate to consider the geographic diversity  
of the Board in any future Board appointments. The impact of 
technology on the business is another area of increasing importance 
and will form a key criterion when considering the future skills and 
experience of the Board.
SuCCESS iOn
During the year, as Chairman of the Committee, I led the process  
for appointing a new non-executive director to the Board. The Zygos 
Partnership, an external search consultancy, was engaged to lead 
the search. I briefed Zygos as to the personal attributes needed in 
the new non-executive director with regard to the business, its 
future direction and the role to be undertaken. The Board considered 
that individuals with business to business and professional services 
backgrounds would be particularly relevant, as would individuals with 
strong international experience and credibility within the investment 
community. Style and cultural fit with Hays were also important 
considerations, as was boardroom diversity in light of the Lord 
Davies report.
Zygos produced a shortlist of candidates. Selected members of the 
Board met with the shortlisted candidates and all members of the 
Committee and the executive directors met with Pippa Wicks prior 
to confirmation of her appointment.
Pippa was considered to be the ideal candidate given her 
background and experience and met the Board’s criteria. Pippa 
graduated in Zoology from Oxford University following which she 
spent nine years in various consulting and management roles with 
management consultants Bain & Company. She is currently Managing 
Director of AlixPartners LLP, the global business advisory firm. She 
was previously a non-executive director of Ladbrokes plc, where she 
was also a member of its audit committee, Group Finance Director  
of Courtaulds Textiles plc, Chief Executive of FT Knowledge at 
Pearson plc and a non-executive director of Hilton International plc 
and Arcadia plc. Pippa has considerable broad-ranging experience 
gained at a senior level and brings valuable strategic and operational 
insights to the Board’s decision making. 
At this year’s Annual General Meeting Paul Stoneham will be retiring 
as a non-executive director having served on the Board for eight 
years. As Chairman of the Committee I will be leading the process for 
the appointment of a new non-executive director giving particular 
attention to the diverse skills and experience required in the future 
for a Group with an expanding international footprint. We intend to 
use an external search consultancy to assist with this.
As Chairman of the Committee, I will be available at the 2012  
Annual General Meeting to answer any questions about the work  
of the Committee.

DEAR SHAREHOLDER
The Audit Committee (the Committee)  
is appointed by the Board from the 
non-executive directors of the Company. 
The Committee’s terms of reference 
include all matters indicated by the UK 
Corporate Governance Code (the Code) 
published by the Financial Reporting 
Council. Further information on the Code 
can be found on the Financial Reporting 
Council’s website, frc.org.uk. The terms of reference are considered 
annually by the Committee and any changes are recommended to 
the Board for approval.

Paul Harrison, who remains a member of the Committee, stood 
down as the Committee Chairman and was succeeded by Victoria 
Jarman on conclusion of the Company’s Annual General Meeting 
held on 9 November 2011. William Eccleshare, Richard Smelt and 
Paul Stoneham were members of the Committee throughout the 
year. Victoria Jarman was appointed a member of the Committee 
with effect from 1 October 2011 and Pippa Wicks was appointed as  
a member of the Committee with effect from 1 January 2012. Lesley 
Knox stood down from the Committee when she retired from the 
Board at the conclusion of the 2011 Annual General Meeting. 
Victoria Jarman, the Committee Chairman, is a Chartered Accountant, 
has a corporate finance and investment banking background and is 
considered suitably financially qualified to be the Audit Committee 
Chairman. Paul Harrison is also a Chartered Accountant. He is Group 
Finance Director of The Sage Group plc and is considered to have 
recent and relevant financial experience. The qualifications (both 
formal and by experience) of the other members of the Committee can 
be found in the Corporate Governance Report on pages 38 and 39.
At the invitation of the Committee, the Chairman of the Board, the 
Chief Executive, Group Finance Director, Head of Internal Audit, 
Group Financial Controller and external Auditor attend the 
Committee meetings.
Membership of the Committee is reviewed by the Chairman of the 
Committee and the Chairman of the Board, who is not a member  
of the Committee, and they recommend new appointments to the 
Nomination Committee for onward recommendation to the Board. 
The Committee comprises six independent non-executive directors 
and two members constitute a quorum. 
ROLE Of t HE Au Dit C Ommitt EE 
During the year, the Committee reviewed its terms of reference  
and two minor amendments were made. The first related to the 
monitoring of the relationship with the Auditor whereby the Committee 
should consider whether the fees for audit and non-audit work 
provided by the Auditor were appropriate and whether an effective 
audit could be provided for the audit fee. The second was to confirm 
that the Committee should meet four times a year. The terms  
of reference of the Committee are published on the Company’s 
website, hays.com, and are also available from the Company 
Secretary at the Registered Office. 
The key responsibilities of the Committee are to: 
•	 consider the appropriateness of the Company’s financial 
statements and, other than quarterly trading statements, examine 
formal announcements relating to its financial performance 
including any significant judgements;
•	 recommend to the Board for approval by shareholders, the 
appointment, reappointment or removal of the external Auditor;
•	 monitor the relationship with the Company’s Auditor, including 
consideration of its fees, the audit scope and the terms of its 
engagement;
•	 review the effectiveness and objectivity of the external audit  
and the Auditor’s independence;
•	 review the policy for the provision of non-audit services and 
monitor compliance;
•	 monitor and review the Company’s internal control and risk 
management systems and their effectiveness;
•	 monitor and review the effectiveness of the Company’s Internal 
Audit function and to approve the Internal Audit plan; and
•	 ensure compliance with laws, regulations, ethical and other areas 
and ensure that the Company maintains suitable arrangements  
for employees to raise concerns in confidence.
Quarterly trading statements are reviewed by a special committee 
established for the purpose comprising the Committee Chairman, 
the Senior Independent Director, the Group Finance Director and  
the Chairman.
ACtiviti ES Of t HE Au Dit C Ommitt EE 
The Committee met four times during the financial year ended  
30 June 2012. Attendance at meetings is shown on page 45.
During the year the Committee received updates and presentations 
from the Tax, Treasury, Insurance, Legal, Compliance and IT functions 
and the Committee also received a report on the performance of the 
Group’s key finance personnel. The Committee discharged its other 
responsibilities as follows: 
f inancial statements 
The Committee reviewed the draft annual financial statements  
and half year report prior to recommending their approval to the 
Board. The Committee discussed with the executive directors and 
external Auditor the appropriateness of accounting polices adopted, 
significant estimates and judgements, whether the financial 
statements gave a true and fair view and the appropriateness  
of the going concern assumption. 
External Auditor 
The Committee is responsible for recommending to the Board  
for approval by the shareholders the appointment of the external 
Auditor. Deloitte LLP is the external Auditor of the Company and, 
under ethical guidance, is required to introduce a new lead audit 
partner every five years. Following meetings with the Committee 
Chairman and the Group Finance Director, a new lead audit partner 
was appointed following the 2011 year end results. In line with its 
AuDit CO mmitt EE REp ORt 49 directors’ report Governance terms of reference, the Committee undertook a thorough annual 
assessment of the quality, effectiveness, value and independence  
of the audit provided by Deloitte LLP, seeking the views and feedback 
of the Committee and fellow Board members, together with those  
of Group and divisional management. There are no contractual 
restrictions on the Committee as to the choice of external Auditor.
The Committee considered the scope and materiality of the audit 
work, considered and approved the audit fee, reviewed the results  
of the Auditor’s work and considered the Auditor’s performance and 
effectiveness. The risk of the Auditor withdrawing from the market 
was also considered.
The Committee met the external Auditor twice during the year 
without management being present. 
The Committee reviewed the policy on the engagement of  
the Auditor for non-audit services and reduced the value of 
permitted non-audit services which may be provided in a year  
from 1.5 times the prior year’s audit fee to 1 times the fee. The 
Committee confirmed the applicability of that policy in satisfying 
itself that their independence and objectivity was not impaired. 
The key features of the non-audit services policy are as follows: 
•	 work closely related to the audit (e.g. taxation or financial 
reporting matters) can be awarded to the Auditor by the executive 
directors provided the work does not exceed £150,000 in fees per 
item; and
•	 all other work either requires Committee approval or forms part  
of a list of prohibited services where it is felt independence or 
objectivity may be impaired.
The Committee has reviewed the non-audit services performed by 
Deloitte LLP in the year and has concluded that the policy has been 
applied and the Auditor’s independence and objectivity has not 
been impaired as a result. Details of fees paid to Deloitte LLP and  
its associates during the financial year are set out in note 7 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements on page 76.
After due and careful consideration, taking account of the processes 
above, the Committee has recommended to the Board that Deloitte 
LLP be reappointed as the Company’s Auditor at the Annual General 
Meeting to be held on 7 November 2012.
Risk management and internal control
The Committee reviewed the Company’s risk management and 
internal control systems and their effectiveness by considering  
the Group’s risk assessment processes which included detail of  
the extent of coverage, the assessment methods employed and  
the effectiveness of the controls to mitigate those risks. It also 
considered the results of testing performed by both the internal and 
external audit teams in evaluating the effectiveness of such controls. 
internal Audit and risk
The Committee oversees the risk management and assurance 
activities including the work of Internal Audit.
During the year, the Committee reviewed the terms of reference  
of the Internal Audit function and determined that no changes  
were necessary.
During the year, the Committee reviewed the performance and 
effectiveness of the Head of Internal Audit and of the Internal Audit 
function through an internal review process, seeking views from a 
number of internal stakeholders. The Committee also reviewed the 
independence and objectivity of Internal Audit and approved the 
annual audit plan and resource requirements. The plan has delivered 
both geographic and financial coverage, as well as risk-based 
assurance in support of non-financial topics such as IT, contract 
management and compliance. 
Internal Audit reports include recommendations agreed with 
management to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of internal 
controls. At each meeting, the Committee received a summary  
of new audit findings and separate details of outstanding audit 
recommendations and those that were overdue, with management 
comments on progress made. 
The Committee also met the Head of Internal Audit twice during  
the year without management being present.
Raising concerns in confidence 
During the year the Committee reviewed the Group’s procedures 
enabling employees to raise concerns in confidence. Employees  
are able to raise concerns or report compliance issues through  
an independent third-party organisation. The Committee receives 
reports of any serious concerns raised. 
Audit Committee effectiveness 
The Committee undertook its own annual performance evaluation, 
which concluded that the Committee has acted in accordance with 
its terms of reference and is operating effectively. In the coming  
year the Committee will continue to focus on risk measures and 
mitigating actions, non-financial risk topics and further evolution  
of the Group’s risk management processes.
As Chairman of the Committee, I will be available at the 2012  
Annual General Meeting to answer any questions about the work  
of the Committee. 
On behalf of the Audit Committee.

s tructure of share capital
As at 30 June 2012, the Company’s issued share capital of 
£14,640,965.66 comprised 1,464,096,566 Ordinary shares  
of 1 pence each. No shares were allotted during the year.
During the year from 1 July 2011 to 30 June 2012, the Company  
did not purchase any Ordinary shares of the Company.
Chapter 6 of Part 18 of the Act allows companies to hold shares 
acquired by way of market purchase in treasury, rather than having 
to cancel them. The directors may use the authority to purchase 
shares and hold them in treasury (and subsequently sell or transfer 
them out of treasury as permitted in accordance with the Act) rather 
than cancel them, subject to institutional guidelines applicable at  
the time. As at 30 June 2012, 74,600,985 Ordinary shares of 1 pence 
each were held in treasury. During the year to 30 June 2012, 
5,250,650 shares held in treasury were transferred to satisfy  
awards of shares under the Company’s employee share schemes.  
No dividends have been paid on shares whilst held in treasury and 
no voting rights attach to the treasury shares. 
r ights an D obligations of o r Dinary shares
On a show of hands at a general meeting every holder of Ordinary 
shares present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall have 
one vote. On a poll, every member present in person or by proxy 
shall have one vote for every Ordinary share held. In accordance  
with the provisions of the Articles of Association, holders of Ordinary 
shares are entitled to a dividend where declared or paid out of 
profits available for such purposes. On a return of capital on a 
winding up, holders of Ordinary shares are entitled to participate  
in such a return. 
r estrictions on transfers of securities 
The restrictions on the transfer of shares in the Company are  
as follows: 
•	 the Board may, in its absolute discretion, refuse to register the 
transfer of a certificated share which is not fully paid, provided 
that the refusal does not prevent dealing in shares in the Company 
from taking place on an open and proper basis;
•	 the Board may also refuse to register the transfer of a certificated 
share unless the instrument of transfer is lodged, duly stamped (if 
stampable), at the Registered Office or at another place appointed 
by the Board accompanied by the certificate for the share to which 
it relates and such other evidence as the Board may reasonably 
require to show the right of the transferor to make the transfer;
•	 the Board may refuse to register a transfer of shares in favour of 
more than four persons jointly;
•	 where a shareholder has declined to provide certain information 
requested by the Company in accordance with the Act, the  
Board can in certain circumstances apply to the court for an order 
directing that the shares in question be subject to restrictions.  
If an order is so made, any transfer of (or any agreement to 
transfer) the shares will be void and no voting rights will be 
exercisable in respect of them;
•	 restrictions may be imposed on certain Group employees who  
are required to seek approval from the Company before dealing  
in shares in accordance with the requirements of the Listing Rules 
of the United Kingdom Listing Authority; and
•	 awards of shares under the Company’s incentive arrangements, 
the Performance Share Plan and the Deferred Annual Bonus Plan, 
are subject to restrictions on the transfer of shares prior to vesting.
The Company is unaware of any arrangements between its 
shareholders that may result in restrictions on the transfer of shares 
and/or voting rights. 
e xercise of rights of shares in employee share 
schemes 
Certain share awards under Company incentive arrangements  
are held in trust on behalf of the beneficiaries. Except where acting 
under instruction as a bare nominee, the Trustee of the Hays plc 
Employee Share Trust does not seek to exercise the voting rights  
on these shares. No voting rights are exercised in relation to shares 
unallocated to individual beneficiaries.
r estrictions on voting D ea Dlines
The notice of any general meeting shall specify the deadline for 
exercising voting rights and appointing a proxy or proxies to vote  
at a general meeting. It is the Company’s policy at present to take  
all resolutions at a general meeting on a poll and the results of the 
poll are published on the Company’s website, hays.com, shortly  
after the meeting.

other statutory information 51 directors’ report Governance powers of Directors
The directors are responsible for the management of the  
business and may exercise all powers of the Company subject  
to legislation, any directions given by special resolution and the 
Company’s constitution.
At the Annual General Meeting of the Company held on 9 November 
2011, shareholders authorised the directors, until the conclusion  
of the Annual General Meeting to be held on 7 November 2012,  
to purchase up to 138,425,462 Ordinary shares of 1 pence each in  
the Company and to allot new shares up to an aggregate nominal 
amount of £4,614,182, being approximately one-third of the Company’s 
issued share capital. The authority to allot shares was not used. 
Renewal of both authorities will be proposed to shareholders at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting. 
The Board intends to continue to return surplus cash to shareholders 
where circumstances allow and it is not required to finance the 
organic expansion of the business, acquisitions and dividend payments, 
via the on-market purchase of its own shares. Shares will only be 
purchased if to do so would result in an increase in earnings per 
share and it is in the best interests of shareholders generally.  
No share purchases are anticipated in the 2013 financial year. 
The Board will be seeking the approval of the shareholders to  
renew this authority at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting  
as detailed in the separate Circular to Shareholders. 
a ppointment an D replacement of D irectors
The Company may by ordinary resolution appoint any individual  
to the Board. The Board may appoint any individual willing to act  
as a director either to fill a vacancy or act as an additional director. 
The appointee can only hold office until the next annual general 
meeting whereupon he/she will be put forward for reappointment.
The Articles of Association prescribe that there shall be no less than 
five and no more than 15 directors. Should the number reduce below 
five, the Board shall, as soon as practicable, appoint an individual to 
fill the vacancy. The Company may by ordinary resolution vary the 
minimum number of directors. 
The Articles of Association prescribe that at each annual general 
meeting, not less than one-third of the directors must retire by 
rotation and any director who has been in office for three years or 
more since his/her last appointment or reappointment must retire  
by rotation. A retiring director is eligible for reappointment. The UK 
Corporate Governance Code recommends that all directors be 
subject to annual re-election by shareholders. Therefore, all directors 
will offer themselves for re-election at the Annual General Meeting 
to be held on 7 November 2012.

employees 
The Company’s business is dependent upon our employees. As a 
consequence, our people strategy continues to focus on ensuring 
that we have the necessary capabilities, resources and work 
environment appropriate for a high-performing organisation.
The Group continues to be committed to developing its employees 
and investing in training tailored to meet the needs of the business, 
including both structured training and on-the-job training and 
briefings. Our leadership development programmes for our top global 
leaders, Fast Forward and the Advanced Management Programme, 
continue to ensure the development of talent in our business. 
As part of creating a stimulating place to work, there are a number  
of ways we ensure our employees are involved in the business and 
issues relating to its performance, including senior management 
briefings, employee briefing groups, email messaging and our  
global Group intranet. To encourage employees to have a stake in 
the business, there are also a number of share schemes. 
As a responsible employer of thousands of people, the Group  
is committed to equal opportunities and its policy ensures that 
everyone has the opportunity to contribute to the business 
regardless of age, gender, ethnicity, sexuality, physical appearance, 
religion, education and beliefs. 
The Group has a structured approach towards internal recruitment 
and promotion with decisions based on an individual’s ability to 
perform the role. This means that full consideration is given to 
disabled applicants where they have the right skills and abilities  
for the role. Should an employee become disabled whilst working  
for the Group, every effort is made to accommodate them or to  
find a suitable alternative role and to assist with any re-training.  
The Group’s commitment to training and development includes 
consideration of any special training needs of disabled employees.

£300 million includes a provision for a lending counterparty to 
amend, alter or cancel the relevant commitment to the Group 
following a change of control of the Company. As at 30 June 2012, 
£130 million of this facility had not been drawn down.
There are no provisions contained within the service contracts  
of executive directors that will trigger in the event of a change  
of control. 
There are a number of commercial contracts that would alter in  
the event of a change in control but none is considered to be 
material in terms of the potential impact on the Group in this event.
Certain of the Company’s share award plans contain provisions that 
permit awards or options to vest or become exercisable on a change 
of control in accordance with the rules of the plans. 
c onflicts of interest 
In line with the Act, the Articles of Association allow the Board  
to authorise actual and potential conflicts of interest and duties  
that may arise and to impose such limits and conditions as it thinks  
fit. Conflicts of interest and duties can only be authorised by  
those directors who do not have an interest in the matter being 
considered, and in making such decision, the directors must act  
in a way they consider, in good faith, will most likely promote the 
success of the Company. The Company has established a procedure 
whereby actual and potential conflicts of interest and duties are 
advised to the Company Secretary and are reviewed annually. 
Appropriate authorisations are sought for any ad hoc notifications  
of any new conflicts of interest or duties, or any changes to existing 
conflicts of interest or duties. The Board has undertaken a review of 
these procedures and considers them to have operated effectively 
during the year. 
g oing concern
The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern 
basis as the directors are satisfied that the Group has adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. Further details can be found in note 2b to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements on page 71.
Directors’ responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report  
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law  
and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the directors are required  
to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by 
the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have 
elected to prepare the parent Company financial statements in 
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable 
law). Under company law the directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit 
or loss of the Company for that period.
In preparing the parent Company financial statements, the directors 
are required to:
•	 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
•	 make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
•	 state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements; and
•	 prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis  
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.
o ther statutory information continued 53 directors’ report Governance In preparing the Group financial statements, International 
Accounting Standard 1 requires that directors:
•	 properly select and apply accounting policies;
•	 present information, including accounting policies, in a manner 
that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information; 
•	 provide additional disclosures when compliance with the  
specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users  
to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events  
and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial 
performance; and
•	 make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as  
a going concern.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time  
the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements comply with the Act. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence 
for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of  
fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity  
of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing  
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may  
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
r esponsibility statement Each of the directors as at 29 August 2012 confirms to the best of  
his or her knowledge that: 
•	 the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the relevant 
financial reporting framework, give a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole; and
•	 the management report, which is incorporated into the Directors’ 
Report, includes a fair review of the development and performance 
of the business and the position of the Company and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.
Disclosure of information to the a u Ditor As required by Section 418 of the Act, each of the directors as at  
29 August 2012 confirms that: 
(a)  so far as the director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s Auditor is unaware; and 
(b)  the director has taken all the steps that he/she ought to have 
taken as a director in order to make himself/herself aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s 
Auditor is aware of that information. 
Words and phrases used in this confirmation should be interpreted  
in accordance with Section 418 of the Act.

DEAR SHAREHOLDER 
As the new Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, I am pleased 
to present the report of the Board covering the remuneration practice 
for the Company for the 2012 financial year and the policy to be 
applied in 2013. 
During the 2012 financial year, we have seen increasing public 
scrutiny of executive remuneration and concern around pay for 
failure amidst challenging economic conditions. The Committee is 
very aware of its responsibilities in this regard and our remuneration 
policy is premised on there being a strong link between reward and 
individual and Group performance.
The remuneration policy applied in 2012 was unchanged from  
that in 2011. With the exception of the introduction of malus 
provisions into the long-term incentive plans operated by the 
Company, no changes to the remuneration policy are proposed  
for 2013. In line with corporate governance principles and emerging 
market practice, the Committee considers it appropriate to introduce 
malus provisions, which will enable it to reduce or eliminate awards 
granted under the Deferred Annual Bonus plan (DAB) and the 
Performance Share Plan (PSP) in cases of material misstatement  
of accounts. 
2012 pERf ORmAnc E An D REw ARD
This year saw fast-changing, volatile market conditions around the 
world, with sentiment amongst our clients and candidates varying 
from quarter to quarter. Despite this challenging economic environment, 
we have delivered good net fee growth of 8%
(1)
 and operating profit 
growth of 9%
(1) (2)
, driven by a strong performance in our International 
business. We have continued to invest in order to capitalise on 
structural growth markets such as Germany, Japan and Brazil, but  
at the same time we have focused on strong cost control in more 
challenging markets.
Given the Group’s results, the Committee believes it is appropriate to 
pay bonuses that reflect achievement against performance targets 
for the 2012 financial year. Bonuses for the executive directors for 
2012 were 46% of salary (2011: range 101% to 102%) and are set out in 
more detail on pages 59 and 60. Of the bonus awarded, 60% will be 
paid in cash and 40% will be deferred into shares for a three-year 
period. The Committee retains discretion to reduce the number  
of shares vesting if the underlying financial performance of the 
Company has not been satisfactory over the deferral period.

the UK Corporate Governance Code. The Committee unanimously 
recommends that shareholders vote to approve the Remuneration 
Report at the 2012 Annual General Meeting.

This Remuneration Report has been prepared in accordance with 
Schedule 8 to The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 and will be submitted  
to shareholders for their approval at the Annual General Meeting 
(AGM) of the Company to be held on 7 November 2012. In carrying 
out its functions, the Remuneration Committee (the Committee)  
has followed the provisions of Schedule A to the June 2010 UK 
Corporate Governance Code (the Code) which is published by the

The Board has delegated to the Committee, under agreed terms  
of reference, responsibility for the remuneration policy and for 
determining specific packages for the executive directors, the 
Chairman and other senior executives. The Company consults  
with key shareholders in respect of remuneration policy and  
the introduction of new incentive arrangements. The terms  
of reference for the Committee are available on the Company’s 
website, hays.com, and from the Company Secretary at the 
Registered Office. 
The Committee was chaired by Lesley Knox until she stepped  
down as a director and Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 
following the Company’s Annual General Meeting on 9 November 
2011. Paul Harrison was appointed Chairman of the Committee from 
that date. 
All members of the Committee are independent non-executive 
directors. William Eccleshare, Richard Smelt and Paul Stoneham  
were Committee members throughout the year. During the year, two 
new members of the Committee were appointed – Victoria Jarman 
(with effect from 1 October 2011) and Pippa Wicks (with effect from  
1 January 2012). The Committee receives assistance from the 
Chairman, Group HR Director and Group Company Secretary, who 
attend meetings by invitation, except when issues relating to their 
own remuneration are being discussed. The Chief Executive and 
Group Finance Director also attend by invitation on occasions. The 
Committee met five times during the financial year ended 30 June 
2012. Meeting attendance is shown on page 45 of this Annual Report. 
The Committee’s activities for the 2012 financial year have included: 
•	 a review of the basic pay, bonus and PSP awards of the executive 
directors, and other senior executives;
•	 consideration of the appropriateness of the existing arrangements 
for the 2013 financial year;
•	 consideration of the proposals put forward by the Department for 
Business, Innovation & Skills in relation to executive remuneration;
•	 a review of the reward strategy in the context of Group risk; 
•	 consideration of the relationship between executive reward and 
the reward structures in place for other Group employees; and
•	 the introduction of malus provisions into the Company’s long-term 
incentive plans. Hays PLC Annu Al Repo Rt & Fin Anci Al St Atement S 2012 56

The Committee continues to engage the services of 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) as independent remuneration 
adviser. During the financial year, PwC advised the Committee  
on all aspects of remuneration policy for executive directors  
and members of the Management Board. PwC also advised the 
Company on corporate tax issues and on tax, administrative and 
compliance issues relating to the operation of the Company’s  
share schemes around the world. 
Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP, which acts as the Company’s 
principal legal adviser, provided legal advice to the Committee  
in the financial year. 
REmun ERAti On p OLicy
The Committee determines the remuneration policy for the executive 
directors, Chairman and other senior executives for current and 
future years and this is reviewed on an annual basis. The remuneration 
policy is designed to support the strategic objectives of the 
Company and to allow the business to attract, retain and motivate 
the quality of senior management needed to shape and execute 
strategy and deliver shareholder value. 
The policy is designed around the following key principles:
•	 a strong link between reward and individual and Company 
performance to align the interests of senior executives with  
those of shareholders;
•	 maintain a competitive package against businesses of a comparable 
size in the FTSE and comparable peer group businesses in the 
recruitment sector with reference to the breadth of the role and 
experience the role holder brings to the Company;
•	 operate a consistent reward and performance philosophy 
throughout the business;
•	 encourage a personal stake in the business and a long-term focus 
on sustained growth through long-term shareholding; 
•	 provide a balanced package with a focus on variable pay; and
•	 take into account the associated risks of each aspect of 
remuneration.
The ways in which these principles are reflected in the remuneration 
policy and its application are described on page 57 of this Report.
The Committee considers that a successful remuneration policy 
needs to be sufficiently flexible to take account of future changes in 
the Company’s business environment and in remuneration practice. 
Future reports, which will continue to be subject to shareholder 
approval, will describe any changes in this policy.
RiSk mAnA gEmEnt An D REw ARD
The Committee has considered how the remuneration policy  
reflects Hays’ principal risks (set out on pages 22 and 23) and, where 
appropriate, can mitigate these. The table below sets out how the 
incentive arrangements serve this purpose through the combination 
of the performance measures chosen and the overall link to share

organisation as whole. The Committee believed it was appropriate to 
increase the base pay of the executive directors by 2.5% with effect 
from 1 July 2012, in line with the average base pay increase for other

each executive director is the same and is unchanged from 2012. 
Variable remuneration includes potential maximum bonus awards

SummARy Of SHARE -bASED inc EntivE Sc HEmES 
This section describes the design of the Company’s current  
share-based incentive schemes and how they will be used in the 
2013 financial year. The Company’s long-term incentives primarily 
comprise the PSP and the DAB. The Committee reviews the 
operation of these plans annually to ensure that grant levels, 
performance criteria and other features remain appropriate to  
the Company’s current circumstances, and to ensure that there  
are no features of the plans that could inadvertently motivate 
irresponsible behaviour.
The Company follows the guidelines laid down by the ABI. These 
restrict the issue of new shares (and transfers of treasury shares) 
under all the Company’s share schemes in any 10-year period to  
10% of the issued Ordinary share capital (excluding shares held in 
treasury). In addition, under the Company’s discretionary schemes,  
it applies a limit of 5% in any 10-year period. Under the new 2012  
PSP (described in the next paragraph), share awards to executive 
directors and members of the management board will count towards 
the 5% limit and other awards will count towards the 10% limit only. 
Outstanding awards under the existing PSP will be satisfied on the 
same basis. As at 30 June 2012, the headroom available under these 
limits was 44% and 11%, respectively. 
performance Share plan
The Performance Share Plan is designed to link reward to the key 
long-term value drivers of the business and to align the interests  
of the executive directors and the global senior management 
population with the long-term interests of shareholders. In line  
with governance best practice, a new PSP (to be called the 2012 
PSP) will be submitted for shareholder approval at the AGM.  
This will contain substantially the same terms as the existing PSP  
but updated to reflect current legislation, the inclusion of malus 
provisions and an amendment to the scheme limits of the plan as  
a result of increased participation in the PSP by employees below 
Management Board level. The introduction of the 2012 PSP does  
not involve any change in the Company’s long-term incentive  
policy for executive directors in terms of the structure of the PSP,  
the award levels or the composition of the comparator group for  
the TSR component of the awards. The awards for 2012 will be 
granted following the AGM, subject to approval of the 2012 PSP  
by shareholders.
PSP awards are granted annually and vesting is dependent on the 
achievement of performance conditions measured over a three-year 
period. Awards below Management Board level are based on a 
one-year performance period and a further two-year holding period. 
Award levels for executive directors and other senior executives are 
determined each year by the Committee, but must not exceed 200% 
of a participant’s base salary in any financial year. Awards for the 2013 
financial year will be capped at 175% for executive directors and 120% 
for other senior executives, the same as for the 2012 financial year. 
Approximately 360 employees, including Alistair Cox, Paul Venables 
and seven other Management Board executives participated in the 
awards made in 2011 and a similar number are expected to be eligible 
to be granted PSP awards in 2012. Other employees may be eligible 
to participate in future awards at the discretion of the Committee. 
Awards to be granted to the executive directors under the PSP in 
2012 in respect of the 2013 financial year will be structured as follows:
PSP award as % base salary 175%
TSR target relative to comparator group 50% of award
 – Maximum (100% vesting) Upper quartile
 – Threshold (25% vesting) Median
Cumulative EPS target 50% of award
 – Maximum (100% vesting)
 – Threshold (25% vesting)
The EPS and TSR components will operate independently. There  
will be no payout for achieving less than threshold performance and 
vesting levels between threshold and maximum performance will  
be calculated on a straight-line basis. 59 remuneration report
In the same way as for the previous year’s awards, the Committee 
will set EPS targets using market consensus (reflecting the current 
point in any cycle) being a range of +/- 4% around the consensus 
forecast EPS as the first year of the three-year cycle with a range of 
RPI plus 4% to RPI plus 12% over the remaining two years of the cycle 
for threshold and maximum payment respectively. The Committee 
considers this range to remain appropriate over several cycles. For 
each new award granted, the Committee reviews the range to 
ensure it remains appropriate. 
The intended constituents of the comparator group for the 2013 PSP 
awards are shown below. There is no change to the group used in 2012:
•	 Adecco SA
•	 CDI Corporation
•	 Kelly Services Inc
•	 Manpower Inc
•	 Michael Page International plc
•	 Randstad Holdings NV 
•	 Robert Half International Inc
•	 Robert Walters plc
•	 SThree plc
•	 USG People NV
The peer group has been chosen to reflect most closely the mix  
of the Company’s business. 
Vesting of the TSR component is subject to satisfactory financial 
performance over the performance period as determined by  
the Committee. 
bonus deferral arrangements
Bonus deferral promotes a stronger link between short-term  
and long-term performance through deferral of annual bonuses  
into shares for a three-year period. The last deferral eligible for  
a matching award was made in respect of the 2009 financial year 
bonus and no further matching awards will be made. 
Only the executive directors and other members of the Management 
Board currently participate in the Company’s bonus deferral 
arrangements. Other employees may be invited to participate in 
future years at the Committee’s discretion.
In line with governance best practice, the Committee has agreed 
that the plan rules should be amended to include malus provisions 
similar to those of the PSP in respect of the deferred bonus. 
All-employee share schemes 
The Company has continued to operate the Hays UK Sharesave 
Scheme (which is HMRC approved and is open to all eligible staff  
in the United Kingdom) and the Hays International Sharesave 
Scheme (which is open to staff in certain other key countries where 
the Group has operations). In the 2012 financial year, options over 
4,657,392 shares at a price of 78 pence per share, representing a 10% 
discount to market value, were granted to 704 participants under 
both schemes. The overall participation rate for all current schemes 
remains good at 23.6% of eligible employees.
The executive directors’ interests in outstanding options and awards, 
including performance conditions, are detailed in the audited section 
of this Report on pages 62 to 65.
performance targets on incentives
The Committee considers that performance conditions for all 
incentives are suitably demanding, having regard to the business 
strategy, shareholder expectations, cyclicality of the recruitment 
markets in which the Group operates and on the basis of external 
advice. To the extent that any performance condition is not met,  
the relevant part of the award will lapse. There is no retesting  
of performance. 
bonus targets for 2012 financial year
The bonus awards payable to executive directors in respect of  
the 2012 financial year, as reported on page 62, were agreed by  
the Committee having reviewed the Company’s results and the 
executive directors’ performance against their personal objectives. 
Details of the targets used to determine 2012 bonuses and the extent 
to which they were satisfied are shown in the table below:

Cash Conversion (20%) Maximum 101% 100%

The performance levels between threshold, target and maximum 
were graduated on a straight-line basis. Hays PLC Annu Al Repo Rt & Fin Anci Al St Atement S 2012 60
REmun ERAti On REp ORt continued The basic EPS threshold was set at 90% of budget, target at 100%  
of budget and maximum at 110% of budget. The targets and actual 
performance were measured at budget exchange rates. On this basis 
the EPS result for the 2012 financial year was 5.79 pence, which was 
below the threshold and, as a consequence, the EPS element of the 
bonus is not payable.
Cash Conversion is the operating cash flow of the Company,  
after deducting net capital expenditure items (excluding capital 
expenditure incurred on the Group’s strategic IT projects) for the 
financial year, stated as a percentage of operating profit before 
exceptional items. The Cash Conversion result for the 2012 financial 
year of 116.94% was above the maximum target of 101% and so this 
element of the bonus will pay out in full.

Cash Conversion 41.9% 100%
The personal objectives for the Chief Executive included a number  
of objectives relating to the UK business, the optimisation of the 
Group’s IT systems and the upgrading of management capability 
across key markets. Those for the Group Finance Director included  
a number of objectives relating to the UK business, the closure of  
the UK defined benefit pension scheme to future accrual, the driving 
of efficiencies in back-office operations, costs and credit control 
performance, the strategy for the IT function and its resource 
requirements, and in relation to management information reporting. 
Progress against these objectives has been good but this element 
will not pay out in full.
Bonus payments earned for the 2012 financial year were therefore 
46% of salary, which equates to 37% of the maximum bonus 
opportunity for both Alistair Cox and Paul Venables.
Of this amount, 40% will be compulsorily deferred into restricted 
shares for a period of three years, subject only to continued 
employment. There is no matching award.
pEnS iOn, b En Efit S An D SHAREHOLDing S 
There will be no change to the policies relating to pensions, benefits 
or shareholdings for the 2013 financial year. 
SHAREHOLDing p OLicy 
To ensure that executive directors’ and other senior executives’ 
interests are aligned with those of shareholders over a longer time 
horizon, the Committee requires the Chief Executive to build and 
maintain a shareholding in the Company of at least two-times base 
salary and any other executive directors to build and maintain a 
shareholding of at least one-time base salary over a reasonable time 
frame, which would normally be five years. Other Management 
Board executives are actively encouraged to build a significant 
shareholding in the Company over a similar time frame. 
SERvicE c OntRA ct S 
The Company’s policy on service contracts is that executive 
directors’ contracts should be terminable on not more than one 
year’s notice. In the event of early termination of a director’s service 
contract, the Company would be required to pay compensation 
reflecting the salary and benefits to which the director would have 
become entitled under the contract during the notice period. 
Alternatively, the Company may, at its discretion, pay a predetermined 
termination sum in lieu of notice. In the event of early termination, 
the Committee will give careful consideration to what compensation 
should be paid taking into account the circumstances and the 
responsibility of the individual to mitigate loss.

Alan Thomson, the Chairman, serves the Company under a letter

nO n- EXEcutiv E DiREct ORS 
The payment policy for non-executive directors is to pay the market 
rate to secure persons of a suitable calibre for a group of this size. 
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined by 
the Board. The responsibility of the role and international nature of 
the Group are fully considered when setting the fee levels, along with 
external benchmarking market data on the chairmanship of, and 
participation in, Board committees. There has been no increase in 
the fees paid to the non-executive directors in the year. 61 remuneration report
The non-executive directors’ fees are non-pensionable and non-
executive directors are not eligible to participate in any incentive 
plans. The non-executive directors do not have service contracts 
with the Company, but are appointed to the Board under letters  
of appointment for an initial three-year period. They have agreed  
to annual retirement and reappointment by shareholders at the 
Company’s annual general meeting and appointments can be 
terminated immediately by the Company. Letters of appointment  
are available for review from the Company Secretary and a pro 
forma letter of appointment can be viewed on the Company’s 
website, hays.com.

The Company permits its executive directors to hold one external 
non-executive directorship and all fees paid are retained by the 
director. Alistair Cox is a non-executive director of 3i Group plc  
and Paul Venables is a non-executive director and the Senior 
Independent Director of Wincanton plc. The directors retained  
fees of £63,000 and £52,000 respectively from these external 
appointments during the year under review.

The graph below shows the value of £100 invested in the Company’s 
shares compared to the FTSE 350 index over a five-year period.  
The graph shows the total shareholder return generated by both the 
movement in share value and the reinvestment over the same period 
of dividend income. The Committee considers that the FTSE 350  
is the appropriate index because the Company has been a member 
of this index throughout the period.

Notes:
(1)  The directors were required to defer a minimum of 25% and could voluntarily defer up to 100% of their pre-tax bonuses for the 2007/08 financial year into shares subject to a 
three-year restricted period. Matching shares were awarded to the directors, subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions over a three-year period ending on 30 June 
2011. The number of matching shares was determined by reference to the pre-tax amount of deferred bonus. On 26 March 2010, in order to enable directors’ underpinning shares 
to be held on a post-tax basis (and as fully described in the 2010 Remuneration Report), the Committee accepted the waiver of certain deferred rights and awarded vested special 
awards for no monetary consideration (representing the original awards plus dividend equivalent shares accrued up to the date of award of the special awards). The special 
awards otherwise continued to be subject to the same restrictions and conditions as applied to the original awards. The matching awards and associated conditions remained 
unchanged. At the end of the restricted period on 18 October 2011, the vested special awards were released. The market prices per share on the original date of award was  
73.5 pence, on the date of award of the vested special award was 108.8 pence, and on the date of release was 73.1 pence.
(2)  The matching awards vested on 18 October 2011 as to 59.4% of shares under the award, calculated as 78.1% of the Cumulative International Net Fees performance condition 
(one-third of the award), 100% of the Cumulative Cash Conversion performance condition (one-third of the award) and 0% of the Cumulative Earnings per Share performance 
condition (one-third of the award). The market prices per share on the date of the award was 73.5 pence and on the date of vesting was 73.1 pence. 
(3)  Together with their vested special award and matching shares (see Notes 1 and 2), dividend equivalent shares in respect of the matching share awards were released to the 
directors in two tranches, on 18 October 2011 (when the market price was 73.1 pence per share) and on 9 November 2011 following the approval of the 2011 final dividend (when  
the market price was 73.7 pence per share). The shares released in the second tranche related to 24.1% of the aggregate dividend equivalent shares.
(4)  The directors were required to defer 70% of their bonuses for the 2008/09 financial year into shares subject to a three-year restricted period. The award in respect of 45% of the 
bonus earned was deferred on a pre-tax basis and is addressed in the first table opposite. Messrs Cox and Venables elected to defer 25% of the bonus on a post-tax basis under 
the Deferred Annual Bonus plan for a three-year period. Matching shares were awarded in respect of this element, which are subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions 
over a three-year period ending on 30 June 2012. Dividend equivalent shares will be transferred to the directors in respect of any matching shares that vest.

Notes:
(1)  The directors were required to defer 70% of their bonuses for the 2009 financial year into shares subject to a three-year restricted period. 45% of the bonus earned was deferred 
on a pre-tax basis and Messrs Cox and Venables were awarded a conditional right to receive shares at the end of a three-year period, subject only to remaining in employment. 
The balancing 25% of the bonuses were deferred on a post-tax basis and will potentially attract matching shares and are stated in the previous table. Dividend equivalent shares 
will be transferred to the directors in respect of any matching shares that vest. 
(2)  The directors were required to defer 40% of their bonuses for the 2010 financial year on a pre-tax basis into shares subject to a three-year restricted period. Messrs Cox and 
Venables were awarded a conditional right to receive shares at the end of a three-year period, subject only to remaining in employment. Dividend equivalent shares will be 
transferred to the directors in respect of any shares that vest.

Notes: 
(1)  For the purpose of ranking the performance of Hays shares against a sector group of comparator companies, TSR for each company is the difference between the average 
market values (in sterling terms) of a notional shareholding in that company on all dealing days for the three-month periods prior to the start and the end of the performance 
period divided by the average market values (in sterling terms) of a notional shareholding in that company on all dealing days for the three-month period prior to the start of  
the performance period. The TSR for Hays shares is ranked against the respective TSR performances of Adecco SA, CDI Corporation (2010 award onwards), Kelly Services Inc, 
Manpower Inc, Michael Page International plc, MPS Group Inc (2009 award only as subsequently acquired by Adecco SA and replaced by CDI Corporation within the comparator 
group for later awards), Randstad Holdings NV, Robert Half International Inc, Robert Walters plc, SThree plc and USG People NV. Vesting will be subject to satisfactory financial 
performance over the performance period as determined by the Committee. 
(2)  Cumulative Earnings per Shares is the consolidated basic earnings per share of the Company calculated in accordance with IAS 33 for each financial year cumulative over the 
performance period. Goodwill impairments arising from acquisitions prior to 30 June 2006 are excluded from the Earnings per Share calculation. Cumulative International Net 
Fees is the net fees of the Company excluding UK and Ireland, Australia and New Zealand for each financial year cumulative over the performance period. International net fees 
arising from any acquisition made from the start of the relevant performance period are excluded from the Cumulative International Net Fees calculation. Cumulative Cash 
Conversion is the operating cash flow of the Company, after deducting net capital expenditure (excluding capital expenditure incurred on the Group’s strategic IT projects),  
stated as a percentage of operating profit before exceptional items, for each financial year cumulative over the performance period. The Committee may make adjustments  
to the calculations of Cumulative Earnings per Share and Cumulative Cash Conversion, including taking account of unusual or non-recurring items that do not reflect  
underlying performance. 
(3)  The lower and upper Earnings per Share growth range for the first year of the performance period was based on consensus forecast for that year (being a range of +/- 4% around 
the consensus forecast Earnings per Share, being 4.9 pence per share for the 2010 awards and 6.22 pence per share for the 2011 awards). The Earnings per Share growth for the 
remaining two years requires additional growth of between RPI +4% and RPI +12% per annum to achieve threshold and maximum vesting respectively. 65 remuneration report

Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent

As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, 
the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. 
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require 
us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards 
for Auditors.
SCope o F the A ud It o F the FI n An CIAl S t Atement S
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes 
an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to 
the Group’s and the Parent Company’s circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness 
of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the 
overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read 
all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report to 
identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. 
If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

In our opinion:
•	 the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the 
Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 30 June 2012 and

•	 the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
•	 the Parent Company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted

Hays plc is a Company incorporated in England and Wales and its

The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) 
and International Financial Reporting Interpretation Committee 
interpretations (IFRICs) as adopted by the European Union and 
therefore comply with Article 4 of the European Union International 
Accounting Standard (IAS) Regulation.
new standards and interpretations
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on 
the basis of the accounting policies and methods of computation 
applicable for the year ending 30 June 2012. These accounting policies 
are consistent with those applied in the preparation of the accounts 
for the year ended 30 June 2011 with the exception of the following 
new accounting standards, amendments and interpretations which 
were mandatory for accounting periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2011.

There have been no alterations made to the accounting policies 
as a result of considering all amendments to other IFRS and IFRIC 
amendments and interpretations that became effective during the

operation, or were not relevant.

but which are only effective for our accounting periods beginning on 
or after 1 July 2012. These new pronouncements are listed below:

a basis of preparation
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs adopted for use in the European Union and 
therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on the 
historical cost basis.
b Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to 
effect its future development, performance and position are set out 
in the Business Review on pages 1 to 29. The financial position  
of the Group, its cash flows and liquidity position are described in the 
Financial Review on pages 30 to 33. In addition, notes 19 to 20 of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements include details of the Group’s 
treasury activities, long-term funding arrangements and exposure 
to financial risk.
The Group has sufficient financial resources which, together with 
internally generated cash flows, will continue to provide sufficient 
sources of liquidity to fund its current operations, including its 
contractual and commercial commitments and any proposed 
dividends. Therefore the Group is well placed to manage its 
business risks, despite the current uncertain economic outlook.
After making enquires the directors have formed the judgement that 
at the time of approving the Consolidated Financial Statements there 
is a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this 
reason, the directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements. Hays PLC Annu Al Repo Rt & Fin Anci Al St Atement S 2012 72

c basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which power  
to control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated  
from the date on which control ceases.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the 
acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group whereby the identifiable 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are measured at their fair 
values at the date of acquisition. The excess of the cost of acquisition 
over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets 
acquired is recorded as goodwill. The financial statements consolidate 
the accounts of Hays plc and all of its subsidiaries. The results of 
subsidiaries acquired or disposed during the year are included from 
the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal 
as appropriate.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are 
eliminated on consolidation.
d turnover
Turnover is measured at the fair value of the consideration received 
or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and 
services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, 
VAT and other sales-related taxes.
Turnover arising from the placement of permanent candidates 
is recognised at the time the candidate commences full-time 
employment. Provision is made for the expected cost of meeting 
obligations where employees do not work for the specified 
contractual period.
Turnover arising from temporary placements is recognised over the 
period that temporary workers are provided. Where the Group is 
acting as a principal, turnover represents the amounts billed for the 
services of the temporary workers, including the remuneration costs 
of the temporary workers. 
Where Hays acts as principal in arrangements that invoice on behalf 
of other recruitment agencies, turnover represents amounts invoiced 
and collected on behalf of other recruitment agencies, including 
arrangements where no commission is directly receivable by 
the Group.
Where the Group is acting as an agent, turnover represents commission 
receivable relating to the supply of temporary workers and does not 
include the remuneration costs of the temporary workers.
e n et fees
n et fees represent turnover less the remuneration costs of temporary 
workers for temporary assignments and remuneration of other 
recruitment agencies. For the placement of permanent candidates, 
net fees are equal to turnover.
f exceptional items
Exceptional items as disclosed on the face of the Consolidated Income 
Statement are items which due to their size and non-recurring nature 
have been classified separately in order to draw them to the attention 
of the reader of the financial statements and to show the underlying 
profits of the Group.
g Foreign currencies
On consolidation, the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities 
of subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies are translated into 
sterling at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date. Income and 
expense items are translated into sterling at average rates of exchange 
for the period. Any exchange differences which have arisen from 
an entity’s investment in a foreign subsidiary, including long-term 
loans, are recognised as a separate component of equity and are 
included in the Group’s translation reserve.
On disposal of a subsidiary, any amounts transferred to the translation 
reserve are included in the calculation of profit and loss on disposal. 
All other translation differences are dealt with in the Consolidated 
Income Statement.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of 
a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity 
and translated at the closing rate.
h r etirement benefit costs
The expense of defined benefit pension schemes and other post-
retirement employee benefits is determined using the projected-unit 
credit method and charged to the Consolidated Income Statement 
as an expense, based on actuarial assumptions reflecting market 
conditions at the beginning of the financial year. Actuarial gains and 
losses are recognised in full in the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income in the period in which they occur. Past service 
costs/curtailments are recognised immediately to the extent that 
benefits have vested or, if not vested, on a straight-line basis over 
the period until the benefits vest.
The Group has chosen under IFRS 1 to recognise in retained earnings 
all cumulative actuarial gains and losses as at 1 July 2004, the date 
of transition to IFRS. The Group has chosen to recognise all actuarial 
gains and losses arising subsequent to 1 July 2004 in the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the Consolidated 
Balance Sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit 
obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as 
reduced by the fair value of scheme assets. Any asset resulting from 
this calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the present value of 
available refunds and reductions in future contribution to the scheme.
Payments to defined contribution schemes are charged as an expense 
as they fall due. 73 financial statements i Share-based payments
The fair value of all share-based remuneration that is assessed upon 
market-based performance criteria is determined at the date of grant 
and recognised as an expense in the Consolidated Income Statement 
on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, taking account of the 
estimated number of shares that will vest.
The fair value of all share-based remuneration that is assessed upon 
non-market-based performance criteria is determined at the date 
of the grant and recognised as an expense in the Consolidated Income 
Statement over the vesting period, based on the number of shares 
that are expected to vest. The number of shares that are expected 
to vest is adjusted accordingly to the satisfaction of the performance 
criteria at each period end.
The fair values are determined by use of the relevant valuation models. 
All share-based remuneration is equity settled.
j borrowing costs
Interest costs are recognised as an expense in the Consolidated 
Income Statement in the period in which they are incurred. 
Arrangement fees incurred in respect of borrowings are amortised 
over the term of the agreement.
k taxation
The tax expense comprises both current and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. 
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Consolidated 
Income Statement because it excludes items of income or expense 
that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes 
items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for 
current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided in full on all temporary differences, at rates 
that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is 
probable that taxable profits will be available against which to offset 
the deductible temporary differences.
Temporary differences arise where there is a difference between the 
accounting carrying value in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the 
amount attributed to that asset or liability for tax purposes.
Deferred tax is provided on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries and 
associates where the Group is unable to control the timing of the 
distribution, and it is probable that the temporary difference will 
reverse in the future.
l Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of purchase 
consideration less the fair value of the identifiable tangible and 
intangible assets and liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment 
at least annually. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets 
are grouped at the lowest level for which there are separately 
identifiable cash flows, known as cash-generating units (CGUs). 
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the Consolidated 
Income Statement and is not subsequently reversed.
On disposal of a business the attributable amount of goodwill is 
included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS 
(1 July 2004) has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts, 
subject to being tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill arising 
on acquisitions prior to 1 July 1998 was written off direct to reserves 
under UK GAAP. This goodwill has not been reinstated and is not 
included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
m Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination are 
stated in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at their fair value as at the 
date of acquisition less accumulated amortisation and any provision 
for impairment. The directors review intangible assets for indications 
of impairment annually.
Internally generated intangible assets are stated in the Consolidated 
Balance Sheet at the directly attributable cost of creation of the asset, 
less accumulated amortisation. Intangible assets are amortised 
systematically over their estimated useful lives up to a maximum of 
10 years. Software incorporated into major ERP implementations that 
support the recruitment process and financial reporting process is 
amortised over a life of up to seven years. Other software is amortised 
between three and five years.
n property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost, net of depreciation 
and any provision for impairment. Depreciation is provided on 
a straight-line basis over the anticipated useful working lives of the 
assets, after they have been brought into use, at the following rates:
Freehold land – n o depreciation is provided
Freehold buildings – At rates varying between 2% and 10%
Leasehold properties –  The cost is written off over the unexpired 
term of the lease
Plant and machinery – At rates varying between 5% and 33%
Fixtures and fittings – At rates varying between 10% and 25%
o t rade receivables
Trade receivables are measured at fair value after appropriate 
allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts have been  
recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement where there  
is objective evidence that the asset is impaired. Hays PLC Annu Al Repo Rt & Fin Anci Al St Atement S 2012 74

2 SIGn IFICAnt ACC ount In G pol ICIeS COn TIn UED
p Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash-in-hand and current 
balances with banks and similar institutions, which are readily 
convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject  
to insignificant risk of changes in value.
q t rade payables
Trade payables are measured at fair value.
r bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the 
amount of the proceeds received, net of direct-issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or 
redemption and direct-issue costs, are accounted for on an accrual 
basis in profit or loss using the effective interest rate method and  
are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent  
that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
s derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The Group uses certain derivative financial instruments to reduce 
its exposure to interest rate movements. The Group does not hold 
or use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that 
are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are 
recognised directly in equity and any ineffective portion is recognised 
immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.
The Group uses a range of 80% to 125% for hedge effectiveness, in 
accordance with IAS 39, and any relationship which has effectiveness 
outside this range is deemed to be ineffective and hedge accounting 
is suspended.
The fair values of interest rate swaps represent the replacement costs 
calculated using observable market rates of interest and exchange. 
The fair value of long-term borrowing is calculated by discounting 
expected future cash flows at observable market rates.
Amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the Consolidated 
Income Statement in the same period in which the hedged item 
affects net income.
Cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued when a hedging 
instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer 
qualifies for hedge accounting. At that time any cumulative gain 
or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is either 
retained in equity until the firm commitment or forecasted 
transaction occurs, or where a hedge transaction is no longer 
expected to occur, is immediately credited or expensed in the 
Consolidated Income Statement.
t leases
Leases where a significant portion of risks and rewards of ownership 
are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases by 
the lessee.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the 
Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the 
lease term.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into 
an operating lease are recognised on a straight-line basis over the 
lease term.
u provisions
A provision is recognised when the Group has a present legal or 
constructive obligation as a result of a past event for which it is 
probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the 
obligation and when the amount can be reliably estimated. If the 
effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the 
expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects the current 
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific 
to the liability.

r etirement benefit obligations
Under IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’, the Group has recognised a pension 
deficit of £15.4 million (2011: £11.9 million). A number of assumptions 
have been made in determining the pension deficit and these are 
described in note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Goodwill impairment
Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually. In performing 
these tests assumptions are made in respect of future growth rates 
and the discount rate to be applied to the future cash flows of income-
generating units. These assumptions are set out in note 14 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements.
provisions in respect of disposed businesses
As described in note 23, provisions in respect of disposed businesses 
have been made. In assessing the adequacy of these provisions 
estimates are made of probable cash outflows in the future.
provisions in respect of recoverability of trade receivables
As described in note 18, provisions for impairment of trade receivables 
have been made. In reviewing the appropriateness of these provisions, 
consideration has been given to the ageing of the debt and the potential 
likelihood of default, taking into account current economic conditions. 75 financial statements 4 SeGmentA l I n Form At Ion 
Adoption of IFr S 8, o perating Segments
The Group has adopted IFRS 8, Operating Segments, with effect from 1 July 2009. IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified 
on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker to allocate 
resources to segments and to assess their performance.
As a result the Group continues to segment the business into three regions, Asia Pacific, Continental Europe & Rest of World, and 
United Kingdom & Ireland.
The Group’s continuing operations comprise one class of business, that of qualified, professional and skilled recruitment.
n et fees and operating profit from continuing operations
The Group’s Management Board, which is regarded as the chief operating decision maker, uses net fees by segment as its measure of revenue 
in internal reports. This is because net fees exclude the remuneration of temporary workers, and payments to other recruitment agencies where 
the Group acts as principal, which are not considered relevant in allocating resources to segments. The Group’s Management Board considers 
net fees for the purpose of making decisions about allocating resources. The reconciliation of turnover to net fees can be found in note 6.

be seen in the Group Consolidated Income Statement on page 67.
There is no material difference between the segmentation of the Group’s turnover by geographic origin and destination.
n et trade receivables
For the purpose of monitoring performance and allocating resources from a balance sheet perspective, the Group’s Management Board 
monitors trade receivables net of provisions for impairments only on a segment by segment basis. These are monitored on a constant currency 
basis for comparability through the year. These are shown below and reconciled to the totals as shown in note 18.

Included in turnover is an amount of approximately £587 million (2011: £540 million) which arose from sales to the Group’s largest customer, 
which were generated within the United Kingdom & Ireland. This is the only customer to exceed 10% of the Group’s turnover, however as it 
includes a significant element of remuneration of temporary workers and remuneration of other recruitment agencies, it represents less than

Goodwill arising on business combinations is reviewed and tested at least annually. Goodwill has been tested for impairment by comparing the 
carrying amount of each cash-generating unit (CGU), including goodwill, with the recoverable amount. The recoverable amounts of the CGUs 
are determined from value-in-use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations are those regarding operating profit, discount rates and growth rates. The operating 
profit is based on the latest one-year forecasts for the CGUs approved by management, and management uses estimated pre-tax discount 
rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs. The Group prepares cash flow 
forecasts derived from the most recent financial forecasts approved by management and extrapolates cash flows in perpetuity based on the 
long-term growth rates and expected cash conversion rates. The long-term growth rates are based on management forecasts, which are 
consistent with external sources of an average estimated growth rate of 3.0% (2011: 3.0%), reflecting long-term wage inflation driving fee 
growth. The pre-tax rate used to discount the forecast cash flows is 12.5% (2011: 12.0%).
Impairment reviews were performed at the year end by comparing the carrying value of goodwill with the recoverable amount of the CGUs 
to which goodwill has been allocated.
Management has determined that there has been no impairment to any of the CGUs and in respect of these a sensitivity analysis has been 
performed in assessing recoverable amounts of goodwill. This has been based on changes in key assumptions considered to be possible by 
management and included a change in the discount rate of up to 1% and changes in long-term growth rate between 0% and 5%. The sensitivity 
analysis shows that no impairment would arise under each scenario for any of the CGUs. 
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business 
combination. The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows:

The United Kingdom Government has announced that the rate of corporation tax will reduce from 24% to 23% with effect from 1 April 2013. 
If this change has been substantively enacted at 30 June 2012, the Group’s deferred tax asset would have been reduced by £0.9 million, 
with £0.7 million charged directly to other comprehensive income and £0.2 million charged to the Consolidated Income Statement.

The Group’s exposure to foreign currency translation is primarily in respect of the Euro and the Australian Dollar. The sensitivity of a one cent 
change versus the year end closing exchange rates in respect of the Euro and Australian Dollar would result in a £1.1 million and £0.4 million 
movement in trade receivables respectively.

The ageing of impaired trade receivables relates primarily to trade receivables over three months past due.
Credit risk 
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. The amounts presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet are net of 
allowances for doubtful receivables. An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous 
experience, is evidence of a likely reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows. The Group reduces risk through its credit control process  
and by contractual arrangements with other recruitment agencies in situations where the Group invoices on their behalf. The Group’s exposure 
is spread over a large number of customers.

A description of the Group’s treasury policy and controls is included in the Financial Review on page 33.
Interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to cash flow interest rate risk on floating rate bank loans and overdrafts. At 30 June 2012 the Group had drawn down 
£170 million (2011: £185 million) from its unsecured revolving credit facility. In the prior year, the Group entered into interest rate derivatives 
to partially hedge this risk. The fair value of these derivatives at 30 June was £(1.1) million (2011: £(0.7) million).
The interest rate profile of bank loans and overdrafts is as follows:
(In £s million) 2012 2011
Floating rate – sterling 171.6 189.9 
The floating rate liabilities comprise bank loans and unsecured overdrafts bearing interest at rates based on local market rates.
Committed facilities
The Group has an unsecured revolving credit facility of £300 million which expires in January 2014. The financial covenants under the existing 
facility require the Group’s interest cover to be at least 4:1 and its leverage ratio (net debt to EBITDA) to be no greater than 2.5:1. The interest 
rate of the facility is based on a ratchet mechanism with a margin payable over LIBOR in the range of 1.75% to 2.25%.
At 30 June 2012, £130 million of the committed facility was undrawn. 87 financial statements Interest rates
The weighted average interest rates paid were as follows:

Fair values of financial assets and bank loans and overdrafts
The fair value of financial assets and bank loans and overdrafts is not materially different to their book value due to the short-term maturity 
of the instruments, which are based on floating rates.
Capital management
The Board’s current priorities for the Group’s free cash flow are to fund Group development, maintain the strength of the Balance Sheet and 
to support a sustainable dividend policy. The Group’s overall strategy remains unchanged from last year in that it manages its capital to ensure 
that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns through the economic cycle.
The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt, which is represented by cash and cash equivalents (note 19), bank loans and overdrafts 
(note 20) and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued share capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed 
in notes 24 to 28.
The Group is not restricted to any externally imposed capital requirements.
Foreign currency risk
The Group did not have a material income statement exposure to foreign exchange gains or losses on monetary assets and liabilities denominated 
in foreign currencies at 30 June 2012.
The Group does not use derivatives to hedge balance sheet and income statement translation exposure.

Within the UK the Group operates one defined contribution scheme and two defined benefit schemes. The majority of overseas arrangements 
are either defined contribution or government-sponsored schemes and these arrangements are not material in the context of the Group results.
a uk defined Contribution Scheme
The Hays Stakeholder Pension Plan was established on 1 July 2001 and replaced by the Hays Group Personal Pension Plan in March 2012 
(together the money purchase arrangements). Money purchase benefits are funded by contributions from employees and, for eligible 
employees, from the employer. Employer contributions are in the range of 2% to 18% of pensionable salary depending on the level of employee 
contribution and seniority.
The total cost charged to the Consolidated Income Statement of £3.4 million (2011: £3.0 million) represents employer’s contributions payable 
to the money purchase arrangements. Contributions of £0.3 million (2011: £0.3 million) were outstanding at the end of the year. The assets of 
the money purchase arrangements are held separately from those of the Group.
b uk defined benefit Schemes
(i)   The Hays Pension Scheme is a defined benefit scheme where the benefits are based on employees’ length of service and final pensionable 
pay. It is a funded approved defined benefit scheme which is funded through a legally separate trustee administered fund.
(ii)  The Hays Supplementary Pension Scheme is a supplementary unfunded unapproved retirement benefit scheme for employees who 
were subject to HMRC’s earnings cap on pensionable salary.
On 30 June 2012 the Group closed its UK defined benefit pension schemes to the accrual of future benefits. The closure resulted in a curtailment 
gain of £6.0 million which has been recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement (see note 6). Employees in these schemes became eligible 
to join the Hays Group Personal Pension Plan.
A formal actuarial valuation of the Hays Pension Scheme is carried out every three years. The last formal actuarial valuation of the Hays Pension 
Scheme was performed at 30 June 2009. Following this valuation, the deficit was £150 million and a revised deficit funding schedule of £12 million 
per annum, subject to 3% per annum fixed uplift over a 12-year period, was agreed with effect from 1 July 2010. During the year the Group made 
a contribution of £12.4 million to the Hays Pension Scheme (2011: £12.0 million) in accordance with the agreed deficit funding schedule.
A roll forward of the actuarial valuation of the Hays Pension Scheme to 30 June 2012 and a valuation of the Hays Supplementary Pension 
Scheme have been performed by an independent actuary, who is an employee of Hymans Robertson LLP. The key assumptions used 
at 30 June 2012 are listed below.
IAS 19 accounting valuation
Hays plc has applied the accounting requirements of IAS 19 as follows:
•	 scheme assets are measured at fair value at the balance sheet date;
•	 scheme liabilities are measured using a projected-unit credit method and discounted at the current rate of return on high-quality corporate 
bonds of equivalent term to the liability; and
•	 actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur, outside the Consolidated Income Statement, in retained 
earnings and presented in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The principal long-term assumptions are as follows:
% 2012 2011
RPI inflation 3.3 3.6 
CPI inflation 2.6 2.9 
Discount rate 5.0 5.5 
Rate of increase in salaries n/a 3.9 
Rate of increase of pensions in payment and deferment 3.3 3.6 
Expected long-term rates of return on scheme assets 5.0 6.1  89 financial statements The assumption for the expected long-term rate of return for scheme assets is a weighted average based on the assumed expected return 
for each asset class and the proportions of each asset class held at the beginning of the year.
The long-term expected rate of return on scheme assets does not affect the level of the obligation but does affect the expected return 
on pension scheme assets within the net finance charge.
The mortality rates have been calculated using the S1n A generational mortality tables with a medium cohort projection and an underpin 
to future improvements of 1% per annum with age adjustments (minus 0.5 years for male pensioners). This assumes that a 65-year-old male 
current pensioner has a life expectancy of 21.5 years.
The amounts recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement for the defined benefit schemes are as follows:
(In £s million) 2012 2011
Expected return on pension scheme assets 26.9 22.7 
Interest on pension liabilities (24.6) (23.9)

Past service cost/curtailment 6.0 – 
Current service cost (2.7) (3.8)
Total amount credited/(charged) to the Consolidated Income Statement 5.6 (5.0)

Member contributions 0.9 0.4 
Benefits and expenses paid (14.8) (14.1)
Fair value of plan assets at 30 June 476.1 440.5 
The change in the deficit is mainly attributable to an actuarial loss partially offset by employer contributions. The actuarial loss due to changes 
in assumptions comprises a gain on account of higher than expected asset returns being offset by a loss due to the decrease in the net yield 
(discount rate versus RPI inflation rate).

476.1 5.0 440.5 6.1 
Other assets as at 30 June 2012 comprise a mix of absolute return funds, property, LDI funds and cash.
To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption used in determining the net pension cost for the year to 30 June 2012, 
the Group considered the level of expected returns on risk-free investments (primarily government bonds), the rate of return on AA rated 
corporate bonds, the level of risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for 
future returns of each asset class at 30 June 2011. The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the asset allocation 
to develop the expected long-term rate of return on asset assumption for the portfolio. This resulted in the selection of the 6.1% assumption 
for the year ended 30 June 2012. 91 financial statements The five-year history of experience adjustments is as follows:

Other provisions include potential warranty and environmental claim liabilities arising as a result of the business disposals that were concluded 
in 2004, deferred employee benefit provisions, and restructuring provisions. Of these provisions, £2.7 million is expected to be paid in the next

performance Share plan (pSp) and deferred Annual bonus (dAb)
The PSP is designed to link reward to the key long-term value drivers of the business and to align the interests of the executive directors and 
approximately 360 of the global senior management population with the long-term interests of shareholders. PSP awards are discretionary and 
vesting is dependent upon the achievement of performance conditions measured over either a three-year period or a one-year period with a 
two-year holding period.
Only the executive directors and other members of the Management Board participate in the DAB which promotes a stronger link between 
short-term and long-term performance through the deferral of annual bonuses into shares for a three-year period.
Further details of the schemes for the executive directors can be found in the Remuneration Report on pages 54 to 65. 95 financial statements 30 r el Ated p Art IeS

a Accounting basis
The separate financial statements of the Company are presented 
as required by the Companies Act 2006. They have been prepared 
under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable 
United Kingdom Accounting Standards and Law.
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the 
Company’s profit and loss account has not been presented.
The Company’s principal accounting policies adopted in the 
presentation of these financial statements are set out below 
and have been consistently applied to all periods presented.
b Cash flow statement and related party disclosures
The results, assets and liabilities of the Company are included in the 
Consolidated Financial Statements of Hays plc, which are publicly 
available. Consequently, the Company has taken exemption from 
preparing a cash flow statement under the terms of FRS 1 (revised) 
‘Cash Flow Statements’. The Company is also exempt under the terms 
of FRS 8 ‘Related Party Disclosures’ from disclosing related party 
transactions with entities that are part of the Group.
c Investments
Shares in subsidiaries are valued at cost less provision for impairment.
d property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost, net of depreciation 
and any provision for impairment. Depreciation is provided on a 
straight-line basis over the anticipated useful working lives of the 
assets, after they have been brought into use, at the following rates:
Plant and machinery – At rates varying between 5% and 33%
Fixture and fittings – At rates varying between 10% and 25%
e  deferred taxation
Deferred tax is provided in full on all timing differences which result 
in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right 
to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they 
crystallise. Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items of 
income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different 
from those in which they are included in financial statements. Deferred 
tax is not provided on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries and 
associates where there is no commitment to remit these earnings. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded 
as more likely than not that they will be recovered. Deferred tax assets 
and liabilities are not discounted.
f pension costs
For defined benefit schemes the amounts charged to operating profit 
are the current service costs and gains and losses on settlements and 
curtailments. They are included as part of staff costs. Past service 
costs/curtailments are recognised immediately in the profit and loss 
account if the benefits have vested. If the benefits have not vested 
immediately, the costs are recognised over the period until vesting 
occurs. The interest cost and the expected return on assets are shown 
as a net amount of other finance costs or credits adjacent to interest. 
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the 
Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses. 
The main defined benefit scheme is funded, with the assets of the 
scheme held separately from those of the Group, in separate trustee 
administered funds. Pension scheme assets are measured at fair value 
and liabilities are measured on an actuarial basis using the projected 
unit method and discounted at a rate equivalent to the current rate 
of return on a high-quality corporate bond of equivalent currency and 
term to the scheme liabilities. The actuarial valuations are obtained 
at least triennially and are updated at each balance sheet date. The 
resulting defined benefit asset or liability, net of the related deferred 
tax, is presented separately after other net assets on the face of the 
Company Balance Sheet.
g employee share option schemes
The Company operates a number of employee share option schemes. 
All equity-settled, share-based payments are measured at fair value 
at the date of grant and are recorded in the Balance Sheet within 
total equity shareholders’ interests in accordance with FRS 20, 
‘Share-based Payments’.
h dividends
Dividends are recognised in the period that they are declared 
and approved.

The Company is the sponsoring employer for all of the Hays defined benefit pension schemes and recognises the full liability on its Balance 
Sheet. Under FRS 17 the actual cost of providing pensions to the Company is charged to the profit and loss account as incurred during the 
year, net of costs paid by subsidiary companies. The Hays defined benefit pension schemes were closed to the accrual of future benefits 
on 30 June 2012 at which time active members became deferred members of the scheme.
The pension credit included in the Company’s profit and loss account of £5.2 million (2011 charge: £0.7 million) comprises a past service  
cost/curtailment credit of £6.0 million relating to the closure of the pension scheme on 30 June 2012 less the current service cost charge 
of £0.8 million.
The mortality rates have been calculated using the S1n A generational mortality tables with a medium cohort projection and an underpin 
to future improvements of 1% per annum with age adjustments (minus 0.5 years for male pensioners). This assumes that a 65-year-old male 
current pensioner has a life expectancy of 21.5 years.
The movement in the Group pension deficit during the year is analysed below:

Future profile of h ays pension Scheme
The Hays Pension Scheme was closed on 30 June 2012. The Group has considered the impact of the FRS 17 deficit in respect of the Group, 
its employees and pensioners. In the context of the prudent funding structure of the Group, the Group is in a strong position to manage 
this long-term liability to the satisfaction and benefit of all stakeholders.
The amount of deficit funding contributions which are expected to be paid to the scheme during the financial year to 30 June 2013 is 
£12.7 million.

c apital Gains t ax base cost of h ays s hares 
Following the demerger of DX Services on 1 November 2004, the 
original base cost of your Hays plc shares for Capital Gains Tax 
purposes should be allocated between your Hays plc shares and  
the DX Services plc shares that you received as follows: 
Hays plc shares 89.57%/DX Services plc shares 10.43%. 
For example, suppose you held 100 Hays plc shares for which the base 
cost is £100. Immediately after the demerger, you held 100 Hays plc 
shares and 5 DX Services plc shares. The £100 cost should be 
allocated between these shares as follows: 
Hays plc shares 89.57% x £100 = £89.57, or £0.90 per share  
DX Services plc shares 10.43%x £100 = £10.43, or £2.09 per share.
If you are in any doubt about the allocation of the base cost between 
the shares of the two companies, you should consult your tax adviser.

from suspect domain name registrations to brand 
abuse such as auction sites carrying fake consumer 
goods can be identified and action taken.

internet based brand abuse, counterfeiting, piracy 
and fraud. Its Discovery Engine can identify, filter

The Online Business operates in both 
the consumer and the SME marketplace under 
four brands offering a full range of domain name, 
shared hosting and email services through fully 
transactional websites.
Easily.co.uk has more than 120,000 customers with 
a focus on offering low cost, good quality products 
backed up by exceptional support. The brand 
targets a number of niche markets, including the 
small business start up market, and has strategic 
partnerships with, amongst others, Virgin Media 
and Orange.co.uk, to provide services to their 
customers. More recently it has launched an 
ecommerce package that is targeted at businesses 
making their first steps in trading online.
The Speednames.com brand operates throughout 
Scandinavia, having provided domain name services 
since 2000. Speednames.com offers a wide range 
of domain name suffixes, coupled with excellent 
service. The main focus of Speednames.com is the 
business customer who wishes to secure a number 
of domain names in a variety of overseas markets. 
NetNames and NetBenefit both provide services 
online. Although these brands are targeted at 
customers for managed services they retain unique 
or specialist services for which there is continued 
demand from customers who buy online.
NetBenefit provides managed hosting 
services in the UK and France. It is focused on 
providing reliable and flexible managed hosting 
solutions designed to meet customers’ business 
requirements. Customers range from small start-ups 
looking for scalable solutions that will grow with 
their business requirements to financial services 
companies and major UK retailers for whom just 
minutes of downtime would translate into 
thousands of pounds in lost revenue.
NetBenefit works with customers directly and through 
an indirect channel model comprising digital agencies 
and IT consultancies. NetBenefit partners with 
a number of the UK’s top 100 digital agencies 
providing the hosting for online advertising 
campaigns for some of the world’s most 
recognisable brands. 
Services range from single server solutions to complex 
database clusters, they include high availability or 
disaster recovery solutions through multiple data 
centres allowing the provision of resilient web 
hosting deployed over dual sites. NetBenefit also 
provides Content Delivery Network services; 
backup and recovery services with EVault; and 
virtualisation services which are based upon 
either VMware or Microsoft’s Hyper-V .
NetBenefit’s newest data centre is entirely powered 
by renewable energy . This combined with the adoption 
of virtualisation, where a physical server is split up into 
a number of virtual machines, will allow NetBenefit 
to be more efficient in the way that it uses power 
in its data centres.
Ascio provides a white-label domain name 
registration service for partners such as Internet 
Service Providers (ISPs), Telcos, domain name 
resellers and Intellectual Property law firms. Ascio 
works exclusively through partners with a clear focus 
on providing the premium quality and exceptional 
service that domain name professionals need. 
Ascio’s is an automated service with a broad range 
of ccTLDs. It provides a registration engine that offers 
access to 250 top level domains (TLDs) through 
one standard interface. It is easily integrated into 
any existing order provisioning system using an 
XML-based API or standard email template.

with particular emphasis on Continental Europe 
and has more than 1,000,000 domains under 
management. Partners include Cable and Wireless,

forms and media.

GROUP NBT PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2009
Chairman’s Statement
Group NBT made further strong progress over the year to 30 June 2009, demonstrating the strength of our business in the face of testing market conditions. 
We continue to benefit from the ongoing structural shift towards internet commerce.
Performance was especially strong in our two chief activities, which generate recurring revenues from corporate clients by managing their portfolios of internet 
domain names and by hosting their websites. We also achieved good growth in the Ascio Partner business providing infrastructure to companies who retail domain 
names to consumers.
Underlying pre-tax profit increased by 22% to £6.7 million, and underlying diluted EPS increased by 24% to 20.17 pence. These underlying figures exclude amortisation 
and restructuring costs. We had net gains from currency movements, and excluding these the growth rate would have been 13% for both underlying pre-tax 
profit and underlying diluted EPS.
In view of this performance, we are increasing the final dividend by 25% to 2.0 pence, subject to shareholder approval, making 3.0 pence for the full year – 
also 25% up from the previous year.
My thanks and best wishes for the future go to Jonathan Robinson, one of the founders of the Company, who stood down from the Board in June to pursue other 
interests. Following his departure, we have restructured our management team around our key services. My thanks also go to Tim Ashley who stepped down from 
the Board in October. Tim has been a Non-executive Director of Group NBT since 2000 and has played a significant part in the Group’s success. He will be replaced 
in due course.
The world economic slowdown has had some limited effects on us: specifically, slower new contract wins for corporate domain names, a higher churn rate 
in managed hosting, and a slower than anticipated take up of the innovative internet brand protection services of Envisional which we acquired two years ago.
Nevertheless, with our solid competitive position and attractive business model we see further good growth in the current year.
John Parcell chairman “
The strength of our business 
model is demonstrated by the 
strong progress we have made 
in these testing market conditions. 
” GROUP NBT PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2009

Group NBT has made excellent progress during the year under review, with good growth for both revenue and profit. This result has been achieved despite 
difficult and slowing markets and is testimony to the strength of our business model. As a result, during these turbulent times, Group NBT has consolidated 
its position as one of the leading international providers of brand protection and domain name management services and has become a significant provider 
of domain names to other ISPs through its reseller services.
Strategy Our ongoing strategy is to focus on our core markets, building streams of recurring revenue with further improvement in profitability . We have developed 
premium brands with high levels of added value for customers and will build on this position through geographic growth, continued automation of processes 
and by extending products into new markets.
Much of the Group’s revenue is contracted and most services provided are an essential part of our customers’ businesses. As a result, renewal rates have remained 
strong and new customer acquisition has been good. We also benefit from having customers from a broad spectrum of businesses internationally and from having 
a range of services that we provide to them.
market conditionS
Market conditions in the year under review were more challenging than in previous years. Customers’ projects took longer to come to fruition and lead times 
on new sales have extended. The market for domain names has had lower growth than in previous years. Overall there are around 183 million domain names 
registered with growth slowing from 26% in the previous year to 12% last year. 
Group NBT continues to be innovative, building new products to keep pace with technology and also to add value for our customers. This year we have redesigned 
our online management portal for domain names bringing additional functionality to create a market leading product. We have also replaced our network using the 
latest technology enabling us to provide highly resilient services.
Financial overview 
Revenue for the Group was £41.5 million for the year to 30 June 2009, up 18% on the previous year and up 10% on a constant currency basis. This growth 
is all organic but has benefited from currency movements as a significant part of our revenue is in other currencies. 
Profit before tax was £5.0 million, up 19% on the previous year. On an underlying basis excluding amortisation and restructuring costs, profit before tax was 
£6.7 million, up 22% on last year and up 13% on a constant currency basis. Underlying fully diluted earnings per share (EPS), excluding amortisation and 
restructuring costs, were 20.17 pence, up 24% on last year. As the integration of acquisitions made in the previous two years is largely complete we do not 
expect to incur significant costs related to this in the future.
The Company continues to be cash generative and at the end of the financial year the Group had net cash of £5.2 million, up from £0.7 million at the end 
of the previous year.
“
Group NBT has delivered an excellent set of 
results despite a challenging business environment. 
Our strategy remains constant and is focused 
on building increasingly profitable recurring 
revenue streams. Development of our premium 
services and brands combined with increased 
process efficiency will underpin long term 
profitable growth. The Board remains 
confident of further good performance.

c orPorate Brand ServiceS
Group NBT provides domain name management services and brand protection services to a wide range of companies internationally. We are the European market 
leader and one of only a small number of companies able to provide management of domain names from all registries worldwide. Our services, which we provide 
largely through the NetNames brand, allow users to keep control of their valuable intellectual property and help to protect against misuse of their name and brands 
on the Internet. Brand protection is provided through Envisional and is increasingly sold with domain name management services. Companies use our services to 
guard against fraud, the sale of counterfeit goods online, digital piracy and other infringements against their brands, products and services.
Revenue for Corporate Brand Services for the year under review was £20.7 million, up 21% on the previous year, up 13% on a constant currency basis. Within this, 
revenue for domain name management was £19.3 million and for brand protection services was £1.3 million. 
NetNames Platinum Service is the key product in this area, used by many large brand owners around the world. Companies are taking the management of their 
domain names more seriously as their use of the Internet grows and they understand the need to protect their brands. We continued to acquire new customers 
at a good rate during the last financial year, although at a slower pace than in the previous year. Performance was particularly good in the US, France, Switzerland 
and Germany. 
Speednames Business services are being integrated with NetNames; some customers will move to NetNames Platinum Service and the rest will form the basis 
for a lower tier service under the NetNames brand. Speednames will remain as an online brand. This process is under way and will be completed during this year. 
As the Internet matures it is increasingly difficult for companies to register their first choice of domain names, as a result our customers are using our services 
to buy names in the secondary market. Revenue from this service more than doubled in the year under review.
Envisional provides our brand protection services. Revenue for the year to 30 June 2009 was flat at £1.3 million. During the year we changed the structure of the 
product with the result that several unfavourable contracts were lost, without these losses revenue grew by 6%. In addition, during the year we launched a range 
of new products for sale to our NetNames Platinum Service customers with which we made good progress.
managed hoSting 
The Group provides managed hosting services in the UK and France. This market is not particularly international as the requirements for hosting have a local 
dimension better met by local suppliers. Revenue for managed hosting in the last financial year was £6.0 million, up 18% on the previous year . Our growth slowed 
last year for a number of reasons: we lost customers due to poor trading conditions, our customer base in this market proved to be less resilient than in domain 
management, growth in the market slowed globally with the UK particularly impacted, and we concentrated on improving our infrastructure which diverted 
resources from our sales effort. Nonetheless our performance remained solid and we are well placed to improve performance as the market improves.
During the year we completely replaced our technical infrastructure to allow the Group to provide resilient services to an increasingly demanding market. This significant 
investment in infrastructure included a completely new network capable of running a significantly larger number of customers. We also opened a new data centre 
facility and moved a significant number of customers to this new facility allowing us to close several older less efficient facilities. Technology changes in this market 
have moved rapidly, we are now able to offer customers the use of the latest technology including virtualisation and cloud computing.
aScio Partner BuSineSS
Ascio, our brand for resellers, had a very good year with revenue of £7.8 million, up 45% on the previous year and up 24% on a constant currency basis. 
Ascio allows ISPs and other companies to provide domain name services by linking to our technology on a white label basis. Ascio is particularly strong 
in Continental Europe where the requirement to register domain names with many different country suffixes gives Ascio a real competitive advantage.
The growth during the year was to some extent the result of exceptional sales made in the previous year where the transfer of these new customers’ business 
to Ascio was completed in the year under review. It is likely that this level of growth will not be repeated this year although the business continues to do well.
During the year under review we have added new partners at a steady rate similar to the previous year. These partners usually take time to build their business through 
the API so they will have more impact on revenue for this year than last year. We have been particularly successful in Eastern Europe but continue to build on our 
very good position in the Nordic countries. 
online ServiceS 
We provide a range of online services through multiple brands. We do not intend to compete in the mass markets, preferring to remain niche players where we can 
provide higher levels of service and charge premium prices. We concentrate on selling online services through Easily in the UK and Speednames Online in Europe. 
Revenue of £7.1 million for the year under review was down 8% on the previous year. This result is in line with expectations as we move sales in the NetNames 
and NetBenefit brands away from the online market. 
Chief Executive’s Review continued GROUP NBT PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2009
07
ProFit 
The overall gross margin rate was 73.2% in the year down from 77.5% in the previous year. This reduction was attributable to a number of factors; a change in revenue 
mix, data centre costs increasing, largely due to price rises; and higher domain name costs as the result of a stronger US Dollar relative to European currencies. 
Underlying operating profit, excluding amortisation and restructuring costs, at £6.7 million, increased 18% year-on-year and 10% on a constant currency basis. 
On this basis the margin was 16.2%, unchanged from last year. This was largely the result of a lower gross margin rate which was mitigated through cost control 
with normal operating costs increasing modestly on a constant currency basis. The result also benefited from net foreign currency gains arising from translation 
of monetary balances in the first half of the year. 
Underlying profit before tax, excluding amortisation and restructuring costs, at £6.7 million, increased 22% year-on-year and 13% on a constant currency basis. 
On this basis the margin was 16.2%, up from 15.6% last year, an improved net cash position and lower interest rates resulted in a lower net interest charge which 
increased the profit margin from last year. 
Given that a large proportion of the Group’s revenue and profit now arises outside the UK, currency fluctuations during the year have had a significant impact 
on the Group’s results through translation of the results of its foreign operations. Overall, this translation has had a beneficial impact on the Group’s results and 
to facilitate comparison, constant currency results have been provided as appropriate. The Group manages its currency exposure on an ongoing basis as part 
of its risk management process. 
On a statutory basis: operating profit was £5.0 million, up 14% from £4.4 million last year; profit before tax was £5.0 million, up 19% from £4.2 million last year; 
basic EPS was 15.68 pence, up 20% from 13.02 pence last year and diluted EPS was 15.30 pence, up 21% from 12.64 pence last year.
t aSxation A tax charge of £1.1 million (2008: £0.9 million) arose in the year representing an effective tax rate of 21.1% (2008: 22.3%). The effective tax rate on profit 
excluding amortisation, restructuring costs and related tax credits was 22.3% (2008: 23.4%).
The effective rate of tax is below the UK statutory rate of corporation tax of 28% due largely to utilisation and recognition of trading losses and other timing 
differences previously unrecognised given the uncertainty relating to their recoverability, and varying tax rates in non-UK jurisdictions. 
As a result of acquisitions made over recent years, the Group now operates in eight tax jurisdictions. The overall tax charge comprises the results from these 
businesses together with utilisation of losses as they become available. At 30 June 2009, the Group had estimated losses in excess of £11 million which had 
not been recognised as the timing of their utilisation and availability cannot be assessed with sufficient certainty at this time. 
caSh Strong cash generation in the second half of the year resulted in net cash balances of £5.2 million at year end, up from £1.8 million at 31 December 2008 
and £0.7 million at 30 June 2008.
Net cash inflow from operating activities in the year was £7.3 million compared to £7.8 million last year. While this level of cash generation is satisfactory, cash 
collection has been slower than anticipated due to a number of factors including economic conditions. We continue to monitor and manage our receivables closely. 
Expenditure on tangible fixed assets decreased to £1.5 million from £2.2 million last year, as anticipated, as the programme of upgrading our technical infrastructure 
started last year was largely completed during the year. During the year £0.2 million (2008: £1.0 million) was paid in respect of deferred consideration relating to 
the Envisional acquisition. 
At 30 June 2009, the Group had cash balances of £8.2 million (2008: £4.7 million) and debt of £3.0 million (2008: £4.0 million) before unamortised facility fees, 
resulting in a net cash balance of £5.2 million (2008: £0.7 million). The debt relates to a five-year bank loan of £5.0 million arranged in connection with the 
acquisition of our Danish business in January 2007 and is repayable in equal amounts over the loan term.
dividend An interim dividend of 1.0 pence was paid on 21 April 2009. A final dividend of 2.0 pence is proposed bringing the total for the year to 3.0 pence (2008: 2.4 pence). 
Subject to its approval at the Annual General Meeting on 26 November 2009, the final dividend will be payable on 11 January 2010 to shareholders on the register 
on 4 December 2009.

Report on Corporate Governance
The Company is listed on AIM and is not required to comply with the provisions of the 2003 FRC Combined Code (the Code) and therefore this is not a statement 
of compliance as required by the Code. Nevertheless the Board is committed to ensuring that proper standards of corporate governance operate throughout the 
Group and has followed the principles of the Code so far as is practicable and appropriate for the nature and size of the Group.
A statement of the Directors’ responsibilities in respect of the financial statements is set out on page 14. Below is a brief description of the role of the Board and its 
Committees, followed by a statement regarding the Group’s system of internal controls. The Directors recognise the value of, and are committed to, high standards 
of corporate governance.
Board of directors
The Board currently comprises the Non-executive Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer, a further Executive and three Non-executive Directors. The Directors’ 
biographies, set out on page 9, demonstrate the broad range of experience and knowledge they bring to the Company enabling them to offer sound judgement 
on the proper management of the Group.
The Board meets at least ten times per year and has a schedule of matters specifically reserved for it for decision. It is responsible for approving the overall Group 
strategy, acquisitions, major capital expenditure projects, reviewing the trading performance, ensuring adequate funding and reporting to shareholders. To enable 
the Board to discharge its duties, management provides appropriate and timely information in advance of each meeting. All Directors have access to advice from 
the Company Secretary and are able to take independent professional advice as required.
The longest serving Directors, since their last appointment or reappointment, are John Parcell and Raj Nagevadia who offer themselves for re-election at the next 
Annual General Meeting.
The Board of Directors considers all the Non-executive Directors to be independent of management and, in making this decision, have had regard to guidance 
issued by several of the Group’s largest institutional investors. Richard Madden is the Senior Independent Director.
The following Committees deal with specific aspects of the Group’s affairs:
remuneration c ommittee
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Keith Young. Its other members are John Parcell and Richard Madden. The Committee meets at least twice a year. 
The Committee’s report to shareholders on Directors’ remuneration is set out on pages 10 to 11. 
audit c ommittee
The Audit Committee is chaired by Richard Madden. Its other members are Keith Young and John Parcell. Meetings may also be attended, by invitation, by the 
Chief Executive Officer and the Finance Director. The Committee meets at least twice a year and provides a forum for reporting by the Group’s external auditors.
relationship with shareholders
Communication with shareholders is given high priority. The Chairman’s Statement and the Chief Executive’s Review on pages 4 to 7 include a detailed review 
of the business and future developments. There is regular dialogue with institutional shareholders including presentations after the Group’s announcements 
of the interim and annual results. The Company’s website carries reproductions of the Group’s financial reports and announcements.
The Annual General Meeting provides a further forum for private and institutional shareholders to communicate with the Board and their active participation 
is welcomed. Details of resolutions to be proposed at the Annual General Meeting are set out in the Notice of Annual General Meeting.
internal control
The Directors are responsible for the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. However, such a system can only provide reasonable, 
but not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss. The Board believes that the Group has internal control systems in place appropriate to the size 
and nature of its business.
An ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the Group has been in place throughout the year . That process 
is regularly reviewed by the Board and accords with the Internal Control: Guidance for Directors, in the Combined Code.
The Board intends to keep its risk control procedures under constant review particularly as regards the need to embed internal control and risk management 
procedures further into the operations of business, both in the UK and overseas, and to deal with areas of improvement which come to management and the 
Board’s attention.
financial reporting
There is a comprehensive budgeting system with an annual budget approved by the Board. Monthly trading results, balance sheets and cash flow statements 
are reported against the budget and prior year. Updated forecasts are presented in light of the reported trading performance.
operating control
Each Executive Director has defined responsibility for specific aspects of the Group’s operations. The Executive Directors, together with key senior executives, 
meet regularly to discuss day-to-day operational matters.
investment appraisal
Capital expenditure is controlled via the budgetary process and set levels of authorisation. For expenditure beyond a specified level, a written proposal is submitted 
to the Board for approval.
risk management
The Board is responsible for identifying the major business risks faced by the Group and for determining the appropriate course of action to manage such risks.
All potential acquisitions are subject to appropriate due diligence. GROUP NBT PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2009

The Company is listed on AIM and is therefore not required to prepare a report on Directors’ remuneration. The following information is voluntarily disclosed. 
remuneration c ommittee
The Committee consists of three Non-executive Directors: John Parcell and Richard Madden, under the chairmanship of Keith Young. None of the Committee 
members have any personal financial interests (other than as shareholders), conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships or day-to-day involvement in 
running the business. The Committee consults the Chief Executive Officer about its proposals and has access to professional advice from inside and outside 
the Company. The Committee makes recommendations to the Board. No Director plays a part in any discussions about their own remuneration.
remuneration policY
Executive remuneration packages are prudently designed to attract, motivate and retain directors of the high calibre needed to maintain the Company’s position 
as a market leader. The performance measurement of the Executive Directors and key members of senior management and the determination of their annual 
remuneration package are undertaken by the Committee. The remuneration of the Non-executive Directors is determined by the Board within the limits set 
out in the Articles of Association.
There are four main elements of the remuneration package for Executive Directors and senior management:
à basic annual salary (including Directors’ fees) and benefits;
à annual bonus payments;
à share option incentives; and
à pension arrangements.
Basic salar Y
An Executive Director’s basic salary is determined by the Committee at the beginning of each year and when an individual changes position or responsibility. 
In deciding appropriate levels the Committee considers the Group as a whole and relies on objective research and independent surveys. Executive Directors’ 
contracts of service, which include details of remuneration, will be available for inspection at the Annual General Meeting. The Executive Directors are entitled 
to accept appointments outside the Company providing the Chairman’s permission is sought in advance.
annual Bonus pa Yments
The Committee establishes the objectives that must be met for each financial year if a cash bonus is to be paid and these objectives target both revenue and profit 
growth. Account is also taken of the relative success of the different parts of the business for which the Executive Directors are responsible and the extent to which 
the strategic objectives set by the Board are being met.
share options
The Board believes that long-term incentive schemes are important in retaining and recruiting high-calibre individuals and ensuring that the performance 
of executives is focused on creating long term shareholder value. Awards of options will be considered by the Committee on an ongoing basis.
directors’ pensions
Up to 10% of salary is paid by the Company into Directors’ personal pension schemes, although they may also sacrifice basic annual salary to supplement pension contributions.
performance graph
The following graph shows the Company’s share price performance, compared with the performance of the FTSE AIM and the FTSE Small Cap Indices. The FTSE AIM 
Index was selected as the Company is a constituent of that index. The FTSE Small Cap Index was selected, as this is believed to be the most appropriate and broad 
comparator of the Company’s performance.
Jul Y 2004 to June 2009
directors’ contracts
Executive Directors currently have up to six-month rolling service contracts. The Company may have a contractual obligation to pay compensation 
for the unexpired portion of a Director’s contract if it is terminated early together with related payments, if any, at the discretion of the Committee.
non-executive directors
All Non-executive Directors have between six-month and twelve-month rolling contracts. Remuneration is determined by the Board based within the limits 
set out in the Articles of Association and based upon independent surveys of fees paid to non-executive directors of similar companies. The fee paid to each 
Non-executive Director in the year was £20,000 with the exception of Claus Anderson, who did not receive a fee. John Parcell received £27,500 for his services 
as Non-executive Chairman.

The Directors present their Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 June 2009.
principal activities
The principal activities of the Group during the year were the provision of domain name, web hosting, brand protection and other internet related services.
Business review
A review of the business and future developments together with the key performance indicators of business performance is set out in the Chairman’s Statement 
and the Chief Executive’s Review on pages 4 to 7.
results and dividends
The results of the Group for the year are shown in the Consolidated Income Statement on page 16.
An interim dividend of 1.0 pence (2008: 0.8 pence) per ordinary share was paid on 21 April 2009. The Directors recommend the payment of a final dividend 
of 2.0 pence per ordinary share making the total for the year of 3.0 pence per share (2008: 2.4 pence).
principal risks and future developments
The Directors believe that the principal risks faced by the Group arise in the areas of its products and services sold to customers, its technology platforms 
and its staff.
The Group’s services are primarily delivered over the Internet via a complex technical infrastructure. We operate in an environment where there may be rapid 
changes in the market, technology and operational methodologies. The Group therefore has an ongoing programme of market and competitive review, product 
and services development and infrastructure enhancement.
The Group operates in growing markets with varying degrees of competition in the different sectors it serves. In the domain name management market, where the 
Group has operations in both Europe and the US, it has a leading position in Europe primarily through its high market share in the UK. While its position in the US 
is steadily improving, this market is home to the Group’s major domain name management competitors. The managed hosting market, where the Group operates 
largely in the UK, has fragmented competition and the Group has positioned itself as a mid-market specialist provider. The online market is large with substantial 
competition and the Group differentiates its offering through cost effective solutions with after sales service.
The Group’s products, services and infrastructure are supported by skilled staff; from account management and fulfilment through to technical support. The Group 
is therefore reliant upon its ability to attract, train and retain the right mix of staff.
The Directors monitor the risks facing the Group on a regular basis.
financial risks
Details of the Group’s financial risks together with exposures to interest rate, credit, liquidity and currency risks are contained in note 19 Financial instruments, 
in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

emplo Yees
Group NBT offers a wide range of services to companies and relies on the knowledge and expertise of its staff. The Company endeavours to ensure that it consistently 
improves the Group’s performance by attracting and retaining the right people and by developing the skills of its staff through training and development programmes.
Performance is rewarded on merit without regard to gender, age, race, colour, religion, sexual orientation or marital status. The Company encourages the involvement 
and participation of staff in building a successful business. Communication plays a key part in creating an environment in which all staff can contribute and develop 
to their full potential.
environment
The Group acknowledges the importance of environmental matters and where possible utilises environment friendly policies in its offices such as recycling and 
energy efficient practices. The data centre facility opened during the year is powered by renewable energy and its design incorporates important initiatives which 
result in savings on energy used.
supplier pa Yment policY
The Group agrees terms and conditions with individual suppliers at the time orders for the services are placed. It is the Group’s policy to make payment 
in accordance with those terms and conditions providing they have been fully complied with by the supplier.
The Group’s creditor days at 30 June 2009, calculated in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006, were 29 (2008: 34). 
research and development
The Group operates within the rapidly developing internet environment. There are few, if any, proprietary systems available to meet its product requirements and 
as a result the Group has developed, in-house, the systems required to meet its customers’ needs. These costs of research and development have been written-off 
to the Consolidated Income Statement as they are incurred where permitted by IAS 38 Intangible Assets and not carried forward as assets in the Group’s Balance Sheet.
going concern
A review of the Group’s activities, market conditions, performance in the year under review, details of its cashflows and financial position are set out in the 
Chairman’s Statement and the Chief Executive’s Review on pages 4 to 7. 
After making appropriate enquiries, the Directors have formed a judgement at the time of approving the Annual Accounts that there is a reasonable expectation 
that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, the Directors continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the Annual Accounts.
annual general meeting
The Notice of the Annual General Meeting of the Company, which will be held on 26 November 2009, and the resolutions proposed are set out in the Notice of Annual 
General Meeting. The Board of Directors believes that the resolutions proposed are in the best interests of the shareholders and therefore recommend that the 
shareholders vote in favour of those resolutions.
auditors
All of the Directors have taken all the steps that they ought to have taken to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the 
auditors are aware of that information. The Directors are not aware of any relevant audit information of which the auditors are unaware.
A resolution to reappoint BDO LLP as auditors will be proposed at the next Annual General Meeting.

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have elected to prepare the Consolidated 
Financial Statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and the Company financial statements 
in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under company law the 
Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and Company and 
of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. The Directors are also required to prepare financial statements in accordance with the rules of the London Stock Exchange 
for companies trading securities on AIM. 
In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to:
à select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
à make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
à  state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, subject to any material departures disclosed 
and explained in the financial statements; and
à prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the requirements 
of the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
weBsite puBlication
The Directors are responsible for ensuring the Annual Report and the financial statements are made available on a website. Financial statements are published 
on the Company’s website in accordance with legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements, which 
may vary from legislation in other jurisdictions. The maintenance and integrity of the Company’s website is the responsibility of the Directors. The Directors’ 
responsibility also extends to the ongoing integrity of the financial statements contained therein. GROUP NBT PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2009

on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
scope of the audit of the financial statement s
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements 
are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s 
and the Parent company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates 
made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
opinion on financial statement s

à  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches 
not visited by us; or
à  the Parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
à  certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
à  we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
for the year ended 30 June 2009
1 accounting policies
general information
Group NBT plc (the Company) and its subsidiaries (together the Group) is a leading provider of domain names and internet-related services. 
Operating in eight countries, it has 290 employees.
The Company is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the UK. The address of the registered office is 3rd Floor, Prospero House, 
241 Borough High Street, London SE1 1GA.
The Company is listed on AIM.
a) Basis of preparation 
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with EU endorsed International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the IFRIC 
interpretations issued by the IASB and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared 
under the historic cost convention as modified by share options measured at fair value through the income statement.
The principal accounting policies of the Group are set out below:
b) Basis of consolidation
The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Group comprise the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries) 
at the balance sheet date. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of a subsidiary so as to obtain 
benefits from its activities. 
The results of subsidiaries acquired (or disposed of) in the year are included (or excluded) in the Consolidated Income Statement from the effective date 
of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
c) Business combinations
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the fair values of the underlying 
assets, liabilities and equity instruments in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination.
d) revenue recognition
Revenue is derived from the Group’s principal activity of the provision of internet-related services covering domain name management, web hosting and brand 
protection services. Revenue is measured as the fair value of the consideration received or receivable; and represents amounts receivable for services provided 
in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales related taxes. Where services are invoiced in advance, revenue is deferred in the balance 
sheet until the services are provided. 
e) goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of consideration over the fair value of the identifiable net assets at the date of their acquisition. Goodwill is recognised 
as an asset and reviewed annually for impairment. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed. On disposal 
of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit and loss on disposal. Goodwill is denominated in the functional 
currency in which the acquired entity operates.
f) impairment of assets
Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units for the purposes of impairment testing. The recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the goodwill 
relates is tested annually for impairment or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired. The carrying values of property, plant and 
equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill are reviewed for impairment only when events indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
In an impairment test, the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit or asset is estimated to determine the extent of any impairment loss. The recoverable 
amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell, and the value-in-use to the Group. An impairment loss is recognised to the extent that the carrying value exceeds 
the recoverable amount.
In determining a cash generating unit’s or asset’s value-in-use, estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a post-tax discount rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific to the cash generating unit or asset, that have not already been included in the 
estimate of future cash flows.
g) other intangible assets
Intangible assets purchased separately, such as domain names, are capitalised at cost and amortised over their useful economic life. Intangible assets acquired 
through a business combination such as customer lists and intellectual property are initially measured at fair value and amortised over their useful economic life. 
Amortisation of intangible assets is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each intangible asset. Intangible 
assets are amortised from the date they are available for use.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: 
à  domain names   – 20 years
à  technology-based assets – 5 to 7 years
à  non-compete agreements  – 1 year
à  customer lists  – 5 years GROUP NBT PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2009

1 accounting policies continued
general information continued
h) property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment comprises its purchase 
price and any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset into use. Depreciation is calculated to write down the cost of all property, plant and equipment 
to their estimated residual value over their expected useful economic life as follows:
à  computer equipment  – 2 to 4 years
à  fixtures, fittings and equipment – 3 years
à  leasehold improvements   – over the period of the lease
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date. The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement 
of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement. 
i) t axation
The tax expense represents the aggregate of the tax currently payable and deferred tax. The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the period. 
The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements 
and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax assets 
are generally recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. 
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable 
profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when 
the liability is settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited 
directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also charged or credited directly to equity.
j) f inancial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual terms of the financial instrument.
f inancial assets – loans and receivables
à  Cash and cash equivalents
 Cash and cash equivalents include cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity period of less than three months.
à  Trade and other receivables
  Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their fair value on initial recognition, and then subsequently at amortised cost as reduced 
by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
f inancial liabilities – held at amortised cost
à  Trade payables
 Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at their fair value on initial recognition, and then subsequently at amortised cost.
à  Loans and borrowings
  Bank borrowings represent interest bearing loans which are recorded at fair value on initial recognition, being proceeds received net of direct issue costs. 
Finance charges are accounted for on an accruals basis and are recognised in the income statement over the term of the borrowing using the effective 
interest rate method.
à  Capital
  Financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity if the holders have only a residual interest in the assets of the Group after the deduction of all 
liabilities. The Group’s ordinary shares are classified as equity instruments. For the purposes of the disclosures given in note 20 the Group considers its capital 
to comprise its ordinary share capital, share premium and accumulated retained earnings.
k) f oreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency, Sterling, at the rate ruling on the date of the transaction. Exchange differences arising 
from the movement in rates between the date of transaction and the date of settlement are taken to the income statement as they arise. 
Assets and liabilities (including goodwill and intangible assets which are allocated to overseas income generating units) of overseas subsidiaries are translated 
into Sterling at the rate ruling on the balance sheet date. The results of these subsidiaries are translated at an average rate of exchange for the year. 
Exchange gains or losses arising on the translation of the opening net assets of an overseas subsidiary, together with exchange differences arising on the use of the 
average rate of exchange, are taken directly to shareholders’ equity and recognised in the cumulative translation reserve. On disposal of a foreign subsidiary, the 
cumulative translation differences are recycled to the income statement and recognised as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
The main foreign currency exchange rates used in the financial statements to consolidate the overseas subsidiaries are as follows:
    Closing rate  Average rate
      2009  2008  2009  2008
US Dollar     1.65 1.99 1.61 2.00
Euro     1.18 1.26 1.17 1.37

l) l eases
Assets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised at their fair value on the inception of the leases and depreciated over the shorter of the 
period of the lease and the estimated useful economic life of the assets. The finance charges are allocated over the period of the lease in proportion to the capital 
amount outstanding and are charged to the income statement. Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement in equal amounts over the lease term.
m) retirement benefit costs
The Company makes contributions to a defined contribution plan for Directors and employees. The amount charged to the income statement in respect of pension 
costs is the contributions payable in the year.
n) share-based payments
The Group operates an equity-settled, share-based compensation plan. The fair value of the services received is determined by the fair value of the options granted 
which in turn is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value of an option is measured at the grant date using the 
Black-Scholes valuation model taking into account the terms and conditions of grant and the resulting fair value spread over the vesting period. Non-market vesting 
conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments expected to vest at each balance sheet date so that, ultimately, the cumulative 
amount recognised over the vesting period is based on the number of options that eventually vest.
o) dividends 
Equity dividends are recognised when they become legally payable. Interim dividends are recognised when paid. Final dividends are recognised when approved 
by the Company’s shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
p) segment reporting
A business segment is a group of assets and operations whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the Group’s Board, and for which discrete financial 
information is available. A geographical business segment is engaged in providing services within a particular economic environment that is subject to risks and 
returns that are different from those of segments operating in other economic environments.
The Group early adopted IFRS 8 Operating segments (effective on or after 1 January 2009). This standard replaces IAS 14 in respect of the disclosure of segmental 
information.
q) provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation. 
Provisions are measured at the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date and are discounted to present 
value where the effect is material.
r) research and development
An internally generated intangible asset arising from the Group’s development is recognised only if all the following conditions are met:
à  an asset is created that can be identified;
à  it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits; and
à  the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
Internally generated intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives. The amortisation charge is within total net operating expenses 
on the face of the income statement.
Where no internally generated asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
s) holiday pay accrual
Employee benefit accruals are made in respect of holiday entitlements that have accrued to employees but have not been taken at the balance sheet date.
t) adoption of new and revised ifrss
The following new standards and interpretations, which have been issued by the IASB and IFRIC, are effective for future periods and have not been adopted early 
in these Consolidated Financial Statements. The Directors anticipate that the future adoption of these standards, interpretations and amendments listed below will 
not have a material impact on the Group’s financial statements. Though the adoption of IAS 1 will impact disclosure within the financial statements and the adoption 
of IFRS 3 will impact the basis of accounting for future acquisitions.

2 critical accounting estimates and Judgements
In preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, management has to make judgements on how to apply the Group’s accounting policies and make estimates about 
the future. The critical judgements that have been made in arriving at the amounts recognised in the Consolidated Financial Statements and the key sources of estimation 
uncertainty that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities in the next financial year are discussed below:
acquisitions
When acquiring a business, the Directors have to make judgements and best estimates about the fair value allocation of the purchase price and seek appropriate 
competent and professional advice before making any such allocations. 
determination of fair values of intangiBle assets acquired in Business comBinations
Externally acquired intangible assets are initially recognised at cost and subsequently amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives. The amortisation 
expense is included within administrative expenses in the income statement. Intangible assets are recognised on business combinations if they are separable from 
the acquired entity or give rise to other contractual/legal rights. The amounts ascribed to such intangibles are arrived at by using appropriate valuation techniques.
deferred tax on Business comBinations
The recognition of a deferred tax asset in respect of trading losses is based on the assessment of future profits around which there is always a degree of uncertainty.
impairment reviews
The Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment, in accordance with the accounting policy stated above. The recoverable amounts of cash 
generating units have been determined based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations require the use of estimates (note 11). The use of this method requires 
the estimation of future cash flows and the choice of a discount rate in order to calculate the present value of the cash flows. Actual outcomes may vary .
income taxes
The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Significant judgement is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes (note 8). 
There are transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business. The Group recognises liabilities 
for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts 
that were recorded, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made.
useful lives of intangiBle assets and propertY , plant and equipment
Intangible assets are amortised and property, plant and equipment are depreciated over their useful lives. Useful lives are based on the management’s estimates 
of the period that the assets will generate revenue, which are periodically reviewed for continued appropriateness. Changes to estimates can result in significant 
variations in the carrying value and amounts charged to the income statement in specific periods. 
share-Based pa Yments
The Group has three equity-settled share-based remuneration schemes for employees. Employee services received, and the corresponding increase in equity, 
are measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments at the date of grant, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions. The fair value 
of share options is estimated by using the valuation model, Black-Scholes, on the date of grant based on certain assumptions. Those assumptions are described in 
note 21 and include, among others, the dividend growth rate, expected volatility, expected life of the options and number of options expected to vest. More details 
including carrying values are disclosed in note 21. The charge recognised in future periods in respect of these schemes will vary if changes are made in respect of 
the estimates for the rate of lapse of the options.
deferred tax on share options
The deferred tax asset on share option charges is affected by the difference between the grant price of the share options and the market price of the Company’s 
shares at the accounting year end. If the market value of the shares at the date of exercise were to be lower than the market value at the accounting year end, 
the amount of tax relief obtained would be less than anticipated in the deferred tax calculations. GROUP NBT PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2009

3 segmental anal Ysis
The Group has early adopted IFRS 8 Operating segments, and therefore the information below complies with IFRS guidance on the identification of operating segments.
At present the Group’s activities are operated largely through a common infrastructure and support functions and therefore in the opinion of the Directors its activities 
constitute one operating segment through which it provides its services.
The Group reviews the operating performance of the business by revenue from each of its following services: domain name services – management of corporate 
domain name portfolios; managed hosting services – dedicated hosting solutions for SMEs; reseller services – white-labelled domain name registration services for 
ISPs and other intermediaries; online services – domain names, email and shared hosting; and brand protection services – monitoring the Internet for brand abuse, 
fraud, piracy and counterfeiting.

 * Underlying operating profit is defined as operating profit excluding amortisation and restructuring costs and is shown on the face of the Consolidated Income Statement. Share-based payments 
are now no longer excluded from this measure as they are considered to be a fundamental part of the Group’s reward structure. 
**Underlying profit before tax is defined as pre-tax profit excluding amortisation and restructuring costs.
The assets and liabilities of the Group cannot be allocated to the above segments. For internal reporting purposes balance sheets are not split into segments.
The Group operates in three main geographic areas: UK, other European countries and the USA. Revenue, profit before tax and non-current assets by origin 
of geographical segment are as follows:

10 earnings per share
The basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended 30 June 2009 are based on the profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders, of £3,964,000 
(2008: £3,272,000) and on the weighted average number of shares of 25,279,000 (2008: 25,128,000).
An adjusted earnings per share has also been presented in addition to the earnings per share and is based on earnings adjusted to eliminate the effects of amortisation 
and restructuring costs. It has been calculated to allow shareholders to gain a clearer understanding of the trading performance of the Group.
The basis of the calculation of the basic and diluted profit per share is set out below:
        2009  2008

goodwill impairment tests
During the year, goodwill was reviewed for impairment in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy. Goodwill was allocated to individual cash generating 
units based on the Group’s operations and the carrying value of each unit is set out below: 
        2009  2008 
       £’000  £’000 
UK       8,889 9,094 
Other European countries       19,709 18,336 
       28,598 27,430
The recoverable amounts of the cash generating units were determined from value-in-use calculations. These calculations were based on cash flow projections 
from approved budgets and forecasts, past performance and management’s expectations of future performance of the relevant cash generating units which cover 
a five-year period. Other key assumptions used in these calculations were the discount rate applied to future cash flows, 10% (2008: 11%) and future perpetuity 
rates ranging from 1% to 3% (2008: 1% to 5%). As a result of these tests, no impairment provisions are considered necessary. GROUP NBT PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2009

Deferred tax has been calculated at 28% (2008: 28%) in respect of UK companies and at the appropriate rate for foreign companies.
The Group only recognises deferred tax assets to the extent that future taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities have been netted off as the Directors believe the unwinding of the deferred tax liability to be at the same time and in the same 
jurisdiction as the deferred tax assets.
The Group had potential deferred tax assets that were not recognised at 30 June 2009 as the timing of the relief could not be assessed with sufficient certainty 
and a proportion of the tax losses have yet to be agreed with the appropriate revenue authority. The unrecognised amounts shown below are the gross temporary 
differences, not their value in tax terms.

Bank loan
On 16 January 2007, a five-year term bank loan of £5,000,000 was arranged and drawn down in connection with the acquisition of Group NBT A/S. The loan bears 
interest based on LIBOR which for the year was at an average rate of 3.90%; and is secured by a fixed and floating charge over the Group’s assets and will be repaid 
by equal amounts over the loan term. The maturity of the bank loan is shown in note 19iii.
In the above table, loans are stated net of unamortised issue costs of £43,208 (2008: £60,208). The Group has charged to the Consolidated Income Statement issue 
costs of £17,000 (2008: £17,000) in respect of these facilities. These costs are allocated to the income statement over the term of the facility at a constant rate on the 
carrying amount.
18 provision 
The provision relates to a deferred contingent consideration arising in connection with the acquisition of Envisional Solutions Limited on 10 July 2007 (see note 25).

Of the above amount which is based on achieving revenue targets, £155,000 has been earned and was paid in April 2009. The balance of £284,000 is currently 
estimated to be payable within the first quarter of 2010. Further details of the consideration are included in note 25.
19 financial instruments
This note describes the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing those risks and the methods used to measure them. 
There have been no substantive changes in the Group’s exposure to financial instrument risks, its objectives, policies and processes for managing those risks 
or the methods used to measure them from previous periods unless otherwise stated in this note.
The Group’s financial instruments at 30 June 2009 comprised: trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, loans and borrowings, trade and other payables.
f air value of financial instruments
All the Group’s financial instruments are carried at amortised cost.
The Group believes that there is no material difference between the book and fair value of its financial instruments, in the current or prior year, 
due to the instruments bearing interest at floating rates or being of short term nature.
general oBJectives, policies and procedures
The Board has overall responsibility for the determination of the Group’s risk management objectives and policies and, whilst retaining ultimate responsibility 
for them, it has delegated the authority for designing and operating processes that ensure the effective implementation of the objectives and policies, to the 
Executive Directors and senior management.
The overall objective of the Board is to set policies that seek to reduce risk as far as possible, without unduly affecting the Group’s competitiveness and flexibility.
i) credit risk
Credit risk refers to the possibility that a financial loss will occur as a result of a customers’ inability to meet its financial obligations.
Credit risk arises principally from the Group’s trade and other receivables. Potential customers are subjected to credit verification procedures before credit terms 
are granted. The quality of existing debt which has not been provided for is considered to be collectable and procedures are in place to monitor trade receivables 
on an ongoing basis to minimise exposure to bad debts. Trade receivables are only written-off once all methods of collection have been exhausted. 
The maximum exposure to credit risk is the trade receivable balance at the year end. The Group has no significant exposure to large or key customers.
Loans and receivables are summarised as follows:
    Trade receivables  Cash and cash equivalents
      2009  2008  2009  2008 
     £’000  £’000  £’000  £’000

Net     4,752 3,006  8,158 4,658 
Since the year end, good progress has been made on reducing the trade receivables balance, and particular emphasis has been placed on receivables greater than 
90 days old and to date no significant write-off has been incurred. GROUP NBT PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2009

ii) market risk
Market risk refers to fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rates.
a) interest rate risk
The Group analyses the interest rate exposure on a quarterly basis and analyses the sensitivity of the net result for the year to a reasonable possible change 
in interest rates of +1% and –1%. The impact on the income and net assets of a 1% change would be £7,000 (2008: £19,000). The gain or loss potential is then 
compared to the limits determined by management.
b) currency risk
The Group has overseas subsidiaries, which operate in Continental Europe and the USA. Their activities and net assets are denominated in the functional currencies 
of the operating units. The Group’s principal exposure to exchange rate fluctuations arises on translation of the overseas net assets and results into Sterling for 
accounting purposes. In addition the Group as a whole is exposed to transactions which give rise to foreign exchange risk. The Group reviews its exposure on 
an on-going basis. The foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are as follows:

    (3,193) 5 1,017 (1,759) (3,930)
The Group’s currency exposures are in part minimised as natural hedging occurs through costs and revenues incurred in the same currency. The exposures that 
arise give rise to net currency gains and losses which are recognised in the income statement. Such exposures reflect the monetary assets and liabilities of the 
Group that are not denominated in the operating or functional currency of the operating unit involved. At 30 June 2009 and 30 June 2008, these exposures are 
immaterial to the Group.
If exchange rates had moved by +10% or -10% over and above the rates at the year end, the change in monetary assets and liabilities would be £115,000 (2008: £74,000). GROUP NBT PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2009

iii) liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group is unable to meet its payment obligations associated with its financial liabilities when they fall due, and to replace funds 
when they are withdrawn.
The Group seeks to manage financial risk by ensuring sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable needs and to invest cash assets safely and profitably, 
by the use of medium-term and long-term facilities. At the balance sheet date all borrowing facilities were held with the Bank of Scotland. The Group believes 
that there is a low likelihood on there being an immediate call on its liabilities.

21 share-Based pa Yments
The Group has a number of employee schemes as shown below. As at the date of transition to IFRS all options granted after 7 November 2002 had vested 
and therefore were not required to be accounted for in accordance with IFRS2 Share-based payments.
The Group operates an Enterprise Management Incentive Plan (EMI), an Inland Revenue Approved Scheme and an Unapproved Scheme.
The EMI Plan is an HM Revenue and Customs approved discretionary director and employee share option scheme. All options under this scheme have vested 
and no grants have been made since March 2007.
The Unapproved Scheme exists for grants to Directors and key management where the value of the options granted is in excess of the EMI scheme limits 
or where options cannot be granted under the EMI scheme. There are no performance conditions attached to the grant of options save for the vesting periods. 
The Group also has options outstanding under an HM Revenue and Customs Approved Scheme. No grants have been made under this scheme since September 2000.
The details of outstanding share options over ordinary shares of the Parent company are set out below. All option agreements are for a ten-year period. All of the 
options listed below had vested and were exercisable by 30 June 2009.

21 share-Based pa Yments continued
The fair value of the options granted under the unapproved scheme during the current and prior year was calculated using the Black-Scholes model as follows: 
      Options issued in year
        2009  2008
Share price        £2.29 £3.03
Expected life (years)       3.00 3.00

Risk free interest rate       4.5% 5.2%
Fair value of each option at measurement date       £0.57 £0.83
The volatility assumption is based upon a statistical analysis of daily share prices over a period of between two and three years. The expected life of options is based 
on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur.
Directors’ share options are set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report and total 1,062,610 (2008: 1,237,610).

The Group committed to grant 1,000,000 options at an exercise price of £2.75 per share, vesting immediately and exercisable over a five-year term, on 16 January 2007 
as part of the consideration in connection with the acquisition of Group NBT A/S. The total fair value of these options, £423,000 was calculated using the Black-Scholes 
model and was included as part of the cost of investment. At 30 June 2009 946,000 (2008: 970,000) options were in existence.

25 acquisition in prior period
envisional solutions limited 
On 10 July 2007 the Group acquired Envisional Solutions Limited (Envisional) for a maximum consideration of £4.25 million including acquisition expenses. Its principal 
activity is the provision of automated internet search and monitoring services to identify and deal with brand abuse, counterfeiting, piracy and fraud.
The consideration comprised an initial payment of £1.26 million in shares and further contingent payments for a maximum consideration of £2.8 million in cash 
payable as follows; £1.01 million paid in February 2008 based on the revenue target for the year ended 31 December 2007, and a maximum of £1.79 million 
relating to revenue targets for the years ending 31 December 2008 and 31 December 2009.

The intangible assets acquired relate to the recognition of intangible assets and the deferred tax thereon.
The accounting policy alignment arises from a change in the revenue recognition policy on a contract which has now been brought into line with the Group’s 
accounting policy. 
The goodwill arising on acquisition recognises the strategic industry knowledge of the staff and the benefit to the Group in its ability to cross-sell its services 
alongside the Group’s product portfolio.
The adjustment to deferred consideration has arisen as revenue targets have not been met.

As Envisional had been acquired soon after the financial year commenced, the Directors believe that the revenues and loss before tax for the full year to 30 June 2008 
would not have been materially different to that reported above. The post-acquisition results shown above include intra-group recharges.

Notes to the Company Financial Statements
for the year ended 30 June 2009
1 accounting policies
Basis of preparation
These Financial Statements present financial information for Group NBT plc as a separate entity, and have been prepared in accordance with the historical cost 
convention, the Companies Act 2006 and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice). The Company’s consolidated 
financial statements, prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, are separately presented. The principal accounting policies adopted 
in these Company Financial Statements are set out below and, unless otherwise indicated, have been consistently applied for all periods presented.
In accordance with FRS 18 Accounting policies, the Directors have reviewed the accounting policies of the Company as set out below and consider them 
to be appropriate. 
The principal accounting policies are:
share options
When shares and share options are granted to employees a charge is made to the profit and loss account and a reserve created in capital and reserves to record the 
fair value of the awards at the date of grant in accordance with FRS 20 Share-based payment. This charge is spread over the vesting period. When shares and share 
options are granted to employees of subsidiary companies, the fair value of the awards is treated as a capital contribution, increasing the cost of the investment and 
spread over the period of performance relating to the grant. The corresponding entry is made in reserves.
revenue
Revenue is the total amount receivable by the Company for management and other services provided to other Group companies, excluding VAT, and is recognised 
on performance of these services. 
t angiBle fixed assets
Depreciation is provided on tangible fixed assets at the rates calculated to write-off the cost of each asset evenly over its expected useful life as follows:
à  computer equipment  – 2 to 4 years
à  fixtures, fittings and equipment – 3 years
à  leasehold improvements   – over the period of the lease
investments 
Investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost less any provision for impairment in value. Where applicable, the Company takes advantage of merger relief, 
recording the investment in the Company’s balance sheet at the fair value of the shares issued, with any premium included within the merger reserve.
impairment of fixed assets
The need for any fixed asset impairment write-down is assessed by comparison of the carrying value of the asset against the higher of its net realisable value 
and value in use.
pension costs
Contributions to the Company personal pension scheme are charged to the profit and loss account in the period in which they become payable. The Company 
does not operate any defined benefit pension plans.
dividend income
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders’ rights to receive payment have been established.
equitY dividends
Final dividends are recognised in the Company’s financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by shareholders. Interim equity dividends 
are recognised in the period they are paid.
2 result for the financial Y ear
The Company has taken advantage of section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 and has not included its own profit and loss account in these financial statements. 
The Company profit for the year ended 30 June 2009 under UK GAAP was £3,883,000 (2008: loss £781,000).
Fees paid to BDO LLP and its associates for audit and other services to the Company itself are not disclosed in the individual accounts of Group NBT plc because 
the Company’s consolidated accounts are required to disclose such fees on a consolidated basis. GROUP NBT PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2009

14 share-Based pa Yments
The Company has a number of employee schemes as shown below and options were granted both before and after 7 November 2002, the applicable date from 
which FRS 20 Share-based payments became effective. As at 30 June 2005 all options granted after 7 November 2002 had vested and therefore were not required 
to be accounted for in accordance with FRS 20.
The Company operates an EMI Plan, an Inland Revenue Approved Scheme and an Unapproved Scheme.
The EMI Plan is an HM Revenue and Customs approved discretionary director and employee share option scheme. All options under this scheme have vested 
and no grants have been made since March 2007.
The Unapproved Scheme exists for grants to Directors and key management where the value of the options granted is in excess of the EMI scheme limits 
or where options cannot be granted under the EMI scheme. There are no performance conditions attached to the grant of options save for the vesting periods. 
The Company also has options outstanding under an HM Revenue and Customs Approved Scheme. No grants have been made under this scheme since September 2000.
The details of outstanding share options over ordinary shares of the Parent company are set out below. All option agreements are for a ten-year period. All of the 
options listed below had vested and were exercisable by 30 June 2009.

The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for the options exercised was nil (2008: nil). The total charge for the year relating to the scheme was nil 
(2008: nil).
The fair value of the options granted under the unapproved scheme during the current and prior year was calculated using the Black-Scholes model as follows:
      Options issued in year
        2009  2008
Share price        £2.29 £3.03
Expected life (years)       3.00 3.00

Volatility       31.5% 34.5%

Risk free interest rate       4.5% 5.2%
Fair value of each option at measurement date         £0.57 £0.83
The volatility assumption is based upon a statistical analysis of daily share prices over a period of between two and three years. The expected life of options is based 
on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur.
Directors’ share options are set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report and total 1,062,610 (2008: 1,237,610).
o ther share-Based pa Yments

as part of the consideration in connection with the acquisition of Group NBT A/S. The total fair value of these options, £423,000 was calculated using the Black-Scholes model 
and was included as part of the cost of investment. At 30 June 2009 946,000 (2008: 970,000) options were in existence.

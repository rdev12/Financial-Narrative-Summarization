Chairman’s Statement 
 
2 
I am very pleased to announce record profits for 2006 reflecting the 
quality of Atrium’s underwriting, the strong market conditions of 
2005 and 2006, the absence of catastrophe losses and generally 
benign claims experience last year. Profit before tax is £44.7m 
(2005 – £10.0m) with profit after tax of £32.2m (2005 – £7.0m) 
representing 63.7p earnings per share (2005 – 14.0p). I am also 
delighted to report that these strong earnings have enabled us  
to strengthen our dividend policy. Atrium remains committed  
to providing attractive returns to its shareholders and hence the 
Board has decided to increase the full year dividend to 15p across 
the cycle.  
Strong performance in 2006 
Our financial performance in 2006 was strong across all business 
segments. Our two managed syndicates have both made significant 
contributions to these profits generating combined ratios that are 
among the best in the sector. Our participation in non-managed 
syndicates has also produced some excellent returns and a number 
of syndicates have benefited from earlier year reserve releases. Our 
investment returns have picked up on the back of higher interest 
rates for both Sterling and US dollars and larger investment funds. 
The results have, however, been adversely affected by the 
weakening of the US dollar during the year. 
Increased Dividend 
The Board is recommending a final dividend of 13p to be paid on  
4 July 2007 to shareholders on the register at close of business on  
1 June 2007, giving a total dividend in respect of the year ended  
31 December 2006 of 15p (2005: 10p). This represents 24% of 
2006 earnings and is a 50% increase over 2005. 
Atrium continues to focus on return on equity as a measure of 
success and a key element of this is a clear focus on the level  
of capital retained in the business. The excellent 2006 result has 
strengthened our balance sheet, and raises the prospect of surplus 
capital within the business. Steve Cook covers our strategy in 
relation to capital management in more detail in his report. 
Changes to the Board 
During 2006 Raymond Dumas and Philip Swatman joined the  
Board of Atrium as on- xecutive irectors. I am delighted that  
we attracted such high calibre individuals to our Board. Raymond, 
well known in the Lloyd’s market, has over 25 years of experience 
in the insurance industry and currently serves on the Board of 
Managing Agency Partners, the managing agent of Syndicate  
2791 in which the Group participates. Philip, who is a Vice 
Chairman at Rothschild, brings with him significant investment 
banking and corporate finance experience, and now chairs our 
George Rivaz, who had been with the Group since July 2003 
stepped down at last year’s AGM to pursue his role as co-president 
of Ariel Holdings. I would like to thank George on behalf of the 
Group for his sterling efforts in his time with us.  
It is with some sadness that we announce that our Group Finance 
Director, Simon Curtis, intends to step down from his position, and 
the Board, in order to take a career break. Simon has been a very 
capable Finance Director and a valuable member of the Board. 
During his seven years at Atrium, he has led us through some 
challenging times, including the shift to annual accounting as well 
as the more recent transition to IFRS reporting standards. We will 
report progress in the search for his successor at our AGM at the 
end of June. 
Conclusion 
2006 has not only been a year of record profits it has also  
been a year of progress at Atrium. We remain committed to the 
development of our business with a strong focus on profitability 
and long term returns to shareholders across the insurance cycle. 
We believe that we are currently on a down slope in the insurance 
cycle but we see the weakening conditions as a challenge and  
an opportunity for Atrium to demonstrate once more its ability  
to outperform the Lloyd’s market and the non-life insurance 
industry generally.

Results 
These record results are a testament to our people and business 
model. Helped by the absence of natural catastrophes during 2006, 
our clear focus on generating the best possible underwriting profits 
from the prevailing market conditions, using the most efficient 
capital structure, has generated our 38% return on equity, giving  
a five year average return of 27%. Our underwriting portfolio for 
2006 was diverse and well balanced but focused on maximising 
the opportunities that arose following the 2005 hurricane season. 
Strategy 
Atrium remains focused on bottom line profitability and return on 
equity. We have a clear and successful organic growth strategy, 
focused on expanding our areas of expertise, building on our 
strengths, attracting the best people in the industry and developing 
new opportunities. We believe in growth but only at the right time. 
Our size enables us to be fast and nimble in responding to rapidly 
changing market conditions. Our managed syndicates grew 
threefold post September 11 into a rapidly hardening market. They 
have reduced written premium over the last two years consistent 
with our view that terms and conditions are no longer as strong as 
in 2003 and 2004. Our underwriting portfolio has also reflected this 
with our 2007 capacity reduced from its 2004 peak.  
Atrium has a strong track record of cycle management and has 
every intention of continuing this philosophy. As the market 
softens, our experienced teams scale back where necessary and 
appropriate. Our emphasis has shifted to those classes we believe 
exhibit the best rates, terms and conditions and to other ways of 
developing our insurance business. We continue to recruit high 
quality underwriters who share our underwriting values.  
In 2007 we launched the Atrium Space Insurance Consortium, 
managed by a newly authorised UK coverholder company wholly 
owned by the Atrium Group. The consortium is underwritten by 
David Wade, a leading satellite specialist, supported by 
underwriters and engineers with many years experience. It has 
$22m of capacity on any one launch or in-orbit satellite and is 
targeting $50m of premium income in 2007. The consortium 
protects and strengthens our managed syndicates’ access to the 
growing space market and, via our UK coverholder company, 
provides the potential for an attractive contribution to Group 
earnings for 2007 onwards.  
Capital management 
We keep our capital requirements under constant review since  
the cyclical nature of our business is such that our capital needs  
will vary over time. There are many factors that come into this 
assessment but with return on equity as a key performance 
indicator for the Group we always aim to ensure that we do not 
carry surplus capital. Recent strong results have strengthened our 
balance sheet and available capital.  
It is the Board’s intention to make a significant distribution  
of capital to shareholders later this year. This is subject to the 
expected release of our cash currently held as Funds at Lloyd’s  
and will follow the finalisation of our underwriting plans and  
capital requirements for 2008, in November of this year. 
Trading conditions and outlook 
Trading conditions remain good in most classes of business written 
by Atrium but some are seeing increasing signs of competitive 
pressure. Atrium continues to underwrite a diverse book of 
insurance business. However, the performance of many of the 
classes in which we operate is tied in with the frequency and 
severity of catastrophe events. We have benefited from the 
absence of such events in 2006 but cannot rely on a repeat of this 
for 2007. Nevertheless, based upon our underwriting experience 
and knowledge of the market we have increased our risk appetite 
for 2006 and 2007. Our portfolio structure is focused on business 
classes that are well rated and we continue to believe that the 
potential rewards from catastrophe exposed business compensate 
for the related risks. 
We began 2007 with net unearned premium of £58.2m, premium 
which was written in attractive underwriting conditions and which 
has the potential to generate further strong underwriting profits. 
With our managed syndicates continuing their excellent track 
records and the three remaining non-managed syndicate 
participations providing access to quality underwriting of 
predominantly reinsurance risks, we are well positioned for  
the future. Finally, thanks once more to all our people whose 
dedication and hard work has produced these excellent results.

Simon Curtis
Group Finance Director 
Introduction to Atrium 
Atrium Underwriting plc was formed in 1998 with the merger of the 
Atrium Cockell Group, a privately owned Lloyd’s managing agency 
business, and Lomond Underwriting plc, a listed Lloyd’s investment 
trust. That trust participated in 88 syndicates at that time whilst the 
Atrium Cockell Group managed two leading Lloyd’s syndicates, one 
non-marine (Syndicate 570) and one marine based (Syndicate 609) 
but both with exceptional track records of profitable underwriting. 
These two syndicates remain the core of Atrium’s business and  
the Group now owns approximately 25% of the capacity of both 
syndicates. In addition the Group continues to participate in three 
syndicates managed by other Lloyd’s managing agents. At the time 
of the merger in 1998 the new Board took the decision to reduce the 
underwriting portfolio significantly to just 25 syndicates for 1999. This 
number reduced gradually to the five participations now owned, with 
capacity sold or dropped depending on appetite at the Lloyd’s 
auctions. The current portfolio is set out below: 
Syndicate 570 
Syndicate 609 
Syndicate 958 
Syndicate 2791 
Syndicate 6103 
The above underwriting portfolio provides a diverse mix of business 
including a broad base of non-marine, marine, aviation and 
reinsurance lines. Neither Atrium managed syndicate underwrites 
much catastrophe reinsurance business and hence exposure is 
obtained to this class via Syndicates 2791 and 958 both of which 
specialise in reinsurance. Within both our managed syndicates we 
have specialists in their fields with many years of experience and 
excellent track records. In Syndicate 609 we specialise in high risk, 
high return classes such as aviation war, marine war, terrorism and 
energy and write the majority of risks on a facultative basis. In 
Syndicate 570 we specialise in smaller assureds in less volatile 
classes usually written on a delegated authority basis. This makes 
570 generally a lower risk, lower return syndicate. Both syndicates 
have excellent broker relationships and many long standing clients 
who appreciate the stability, experience and service levels provided 
by our teams. 
Strengths of Atrium 
The Group’s long term record of success is attributed to the 
following strengths: 
Both managed syndicates have teams of exceptional underwriters, 
experts in their field, many of whom have been with Atrium for 
many years. Kevin Wilkins was appointed Active Underwriter of 
Syndicate 570 in 2005 having been the Deputy Underwriter for  
16 years. Christine Dandridge has been Active Underwriter of 
Syndicate 609 since 1997, having been Deputy Underwriter since 
the syndicate’s inception in 1984. 
The Group has a track record of managing the insurance cycle 
aggressively and well. Both managed syndicates increased their 
capacity, and premium income, significantly for the 2002 year  
of account to take advantage of the dramatically improved 
underwriting conditions following the World Trade Center loss  
in 2001. Perhaps more importantly, both syndicates have 
demonstrated in the past that they are not afraid to reduce 
underwriting significantly if market conditions deteriorate. 
Both managed syndicates focus on generating a gross underwriting 
profit in all classes which they underwrite.  
The Group manages its exposure to single event losses carefully. 
Within the managed syndicates, the level of aggregate exposure is 
monitored closely to ensure that it is within agreed risk appetites.  
The overall exposure of the Group, via its participations on the various 
syndicates, is managed with reference to Lloyd’s defined Realistic 
Disaster Scenarios, as determined by each of those syndicates. 
Atrium’s management seek to ensure that optimal use is made of  
the Group’s underwriting capacity. As well as a long term strategy  
of directing capital toward the managed syndicates, specific decisions 
as to which syndicates to support are taken with reference to the 
market conditions in the classes which they underwrite. 
The Group believes in using balance sheet gearing, at the right 
time, to enhance returns to shareholders. In the exceptional 
underwriting years of 2002, 2003 and 2004, the Group utilised  
bank letters of credit and reinsurance to maximise the level of 
underwriting capacity and this has led to excellent returns on 
equity. For 2005 and 2006, the gearing was actively reduced. 
Both syndicates have a long term track record of prudent reserving. 
Atrium’s management believe that accurate reserving at an early 
stage is vital in order to price the business correctly.  ATRIUM UNDERWRITING PLC

As would be expected, Atrium has a series of underwriting controls 
in place. Within that framework, however, management retain  
a philosophy of allowing underwriters freedom and flexibility to  
use their talents to the full. We believe that this makes Atrium an 
attractive place to work for talented underwriters and our history  
of organic growth through employment of new underwriters bears 
this out. 
Strategy 
Atrium is an underwriting led business. Our strategy is driven not by 
corporate growth goals or premium targets but by making the best 
possible profits from the prevailing underwriting conditions. This 
approach applies not only at individual managed syndicate level 
but also at Group level in relation to our underwriting portfolio. We 
aim to manage the insurance cycle aggressively growing rapidly 
into a hardening market and scaling back as necessary and 
appropriate into a softening market. Our experienced underwriting 
teams have proven ability in this respect. We have applied a similar 
strong underwriting philosophy to our underwriting portfolio, 
shrinking into a softening market and expanding into a hardening 
one. Furthermore, we have used balance sheet gearing to good 
effect by being heavily geared at the peak of the cycle and 
significantly less geared as market conditions have softened. This 
strong underwriting philosophy is consistent with our focus on 
bottom line profitability and return on equity.  
Atrium’s view is that the market conditions are softening as 
competition increases and hence we have been gradually reducing 
our underwriting commitments both on our managed syndicates 
and within the underwriting portfolio. Whilst underwriting 
conditions remain sound we do not believe that this is the right 
time to be seeking significant premium growth. We have however, 
continued to look to develop the Group. We have continued to add 
good people and strengthen our support functions. We have 
continued to invest in new technology and look at ways to improve 
our business processes in line with Lloyd’s central developments in 
this area. We have also looked at new ways to expand existing 
areas of expertise leading to the creation of our new space 
consortium. Both Atrium managed syndicates have written space 
business in the past but it is a class that sits more naturally with 
Syndicate 609. Having identified space insurance as a growing and 
non-correlated class we took the decision to employ a highly 
regarded space underwriter and a support team to set up the 
consortium. This secured Atrium’s presence in the space market, 
protecting existing lines, and provides an opportunity to expand 
further as the market continues to develop. The space team is 
employed through an authorised UK coverholder company which 
recovers fees and profit commissions from participating syndicates 
including 570 and 609.  
We have a stated strategy of wanting to acquire further managed 
capacity. We have not however, been prepared to pay over the 
odds for this and in any event one cannot buy what someone does 
not wish to sell. Our two managed syndicates remain very popular 
with the traditional Lloyd’s Names and last year’s Lloyd’s capacity 
auctions saw very low volumes traded at relatively high prices. 
Recent offers to names have raised expectations as to the worth of 
capacity on the best syndicates and as a result we are unlikely to 
be able to make further material progress in managed capacity 
ownership at any price we could justify to shareholders. The upside 
of this position is the strong support of our capital providers and the 
fees and profit commissions they pay to us.   “Good team work has been
central to Syndicate 570’s
excellent track record”

Building teams
Atrium believes in team work. Bringing together the skills,
knowledge and experience of a cross section of Atrium
people has proved a powerful means of moving the
company forward. Our two managed syndicates have a very
strong team ethic and have managed to retain this over the
years as new underwriters have joined and the syndicates
have grown. Our support functions also operate within
teams. We have continued to look to encourage team work
across the business using project teams to look at new
opportunities, ways of improving and integrating our
business processes and how to continue to attract and
retain the best people.

Our managed syndicates, 570 and 609, once again generated  
a larger share of net earned premiums than in the prior year 
reflecting the reallocation of capacity to our own syndicates. Both 
syndicates also generated significant fees and profit commissions  
in 2006, although the amount of profit commission was reduced  
for Syndicate 609 as a result of the hurricane losses in 2005. In 
addition, the other syndicates in which we participate continued  
to perform well. 
Investment income was £11.7m (2005: £9.5m) reflecting higher 
yields on short dated bonds and increased investment funds. Other 
income of £5.8m (2005: £1.0m) includes profit on the sale of 
syndicate capacity of £5.4m (2005: £0.8m).  
Other operating expenses increased to £26.5m (2005: £12.0m)  
as a result of exchange losses of £8.6m in 2006 compared with 
exchange gains of £6.6m in 2005, a swing of £15.2m. 
Underwriting Performance 
The performance figures presented below for the managed 
syndicates are on an IFRS basis for 100% of the syndicate capacity 
and include the actual costs of the managing agency in place of the 
fees and profit commission charged to the syndicate. They are thus 
not comparable with those included in the syndicates’ own Annual 
Reports which are on a UK GAAP basis.

Claims ratio 31% 57% 
Expense ratio 47% 36% 
Combined ratio 78% 93% 
The Syndicate produced a combined ratio of 78% in 2006, much 
improved from that of 93% in 2005. Significant losses from US 
hurricanes adversely impacted the property and reinsurance 
accounts in 2005 while there were no major catastrophe losses 
during 2006. The most notable improvement was seen in the 
reinsurance class, in part due to a reduction in the loss estimates 
for the 2005 hurricanes. The accident and health and third party 
liability classes also produced improved combined ratios in 2006 
due, in part, to the release of prior year reserves following 
continued improvement in claim trends. The expense ratio was 
adversely affected by a material swing in the US dollar exchange 
rate which meant that a loss on exchange was recognised in 2006 
in contrast to a profit on exchange in 2005.  ATRIUM UNDERWRITING PLC

Combined ratio 72% 120% 
The Syndicate produced a combined ratio of 72% in 2006, 
significantly improved from that of 120% in 2005. After a difficult 
2005, which saw several large risk losses to the syndicate as well 
as the US hurricanes, 2006 saw Syndicate 609 return to a more 
typical strong performance. The marine, aviation and transport class 
and the property class both produced significant profits in 2006 
following losses the previous year, benefiting from excellent loss 
experience and releases from prior year reserves following 
continued improvement in claim trends and reductions in loss 
estimates for the 2005 hurricanes. As for Syndicate 570, the 
expense ratio was adversely affected by a material swing in the  
US dollar exchange rate. 
Underwriting Performance – Other Syndicates 
In line with our managed syndicates, the other syndicates in which 
we participate benefited from excellent loss experience in 2006 
and all produced good profits. At the end of the year, we accepted 
an offer to purchase our capacity on Wellington’s Syndicate 2020 at 
50p per £1 of capacity and this generated a gain of £5.4m on the 
sale. One of the run-off syndicates to which the Group is exposed 
closed at the end of 2006, allowing us to release the reserve held, 
and generating a gain of £0.9m. Overall, the contribution from 
other syndicates was well up on 2005 at £21.6m (2005: £12.5m). 
Investment Performance 
Investment income of £11.7m (2005: £9.5m) reflects both Atrium’s 
share of the investment income of the syndicates in which the 
Group participates and that earned on the Group’s own funds which 
support these participations. The vast majority of the investment 
return is derived from short dated bonds denominated in sterling, 
US dollars and Euros. Investment return as a percentage of average 
invested funds increased to 4.3% in 2006 (2005: 3.8%) while 
average invested funds increased to £273.4m (2005: 248.8m). 
Taxes 
The Group tax charge for 2006 is £12.5m (2005: £3.0m) which 
represents an effective tax rate of 28% (2005: 30%). The effective 
tax rate is lower than the expected 30% as a result of the release 
of an overprovision for tax relating to previous years. 
Financial Position 
Balance Sheet 
Cash and financial investments increased by £9.9m during 2006 
representing strong premium inflow and investment income, in 
spite of hurricane losses being paid. The payment of these losses 
led to the provision for claims incurred falling to £232.6m (2005: 
£304.9m) by the end of 2006. The corresponding amount due from 
reinsurers fell to £56.4m (2005: £98.1m). We remain confident that 
the security behind this asset is strong. 
Funds at Lloyd’s and Gearing 
The Funds at Lloyd’s (FAL) position of the Group for the 2007 and 
2006 years of account is set out in the table below:

Gearing % (LOCs/NTA) 26% 29%
We reduced our underwriting capacity marginally for the 2007  
year of account from £155.4m to £152.1m while our capital ratio 
remained at 40%, the Lloyd’s minimum. Although our net FAL 
requirement reduced from £62.6m to £60.8m, our overall FAL 
requirement increased to £83.2m as a result of solvency deficits  
of £22.4m relating to the 2005 hurricane losses. We were able  
to meet this additional requirement through the retention of 
underwriting profits as cash at Lloyd’s. We expect that the cash 
currently retained at Lloyd’s will be released in June 2007. We also 
increased our bank letters of credit to £25m from £20m, although 
our gearing ratio reduced due to increased net tangible assets. 
Atrium’s space venture 
Over the years Atrium has built an excellent reputation, offering 
coverage in many specialised classes, including aviation, energy, 
marine, property, professional indemnity and accident and health. 
Space is a complementary fit to these specialist classes providing 
diversity in a class that is uncorrelated and rarely accumulates.  
At the beginning of 2007 Atrium set up Atrium Insurance Agency 
Limited (AIAL), an FSA authorised UK coverholder business, to 
establish and manage the Atrium Space Insurance Consortium 
(ASIC). ASIC is led by Atrium’s Syndicate 609 with a further 4 
Lloyd’s syndicates delegating underwriting authority for ASIC to 
underwrite on their behalf. The consortium benefits from a line   “The creation of ASIC 
represents an exciting new 
development for the group”

Fifty years after the launch of Sputnik, the world’s first
satellite, the commercial space sector has grown into a
US$100 billion industry. Privately-owned communications
satellites girdle the Earth delivering data at unprecedented
speeds; Earth observation satellites image vast tracks 
of land for use in town planning, security, pollution
monitoring and agriculture and in the future commercial
navigation satellites will safely guide planes, trains, cars
and even the blind. 
Insurance plays an increasingly important role in the
commercial space sector. At the beginning of 2007,
Atrium established the Atrium Space Insurance
Consortium (ASIC) formed of five Lloyd’s syndicates. 
ASIC, the trading name of the Consortium, is managed 
by the coverholder Atrium Insurance Agency Limited
(AIAL), a wholly owned subsidiary of Atrium, which 
is authorised and regulated by the Financial Services
Authority and a Lloyd’s approved coverholder. 
ASIC has a market capacity of US$22m for any one
satellite or any one launch. A highly experienced team 
of space insurance and satellite engineering professionals
has been employed to run the Consortium. ASIC has
quickly established itself within the market and is 
well positioned to capitalise on the burgeoning space
market in the coming years.

Atrium has employed an exceptional team to manage ASIC, with  
a unique blend of underwriting and engineering experience. The 
underwriting team which is based in London is headed by Dave 
Wade. This team is supported by a Canadian based engineering 
team with many years experience of space consultancy. The  
initial response from brokers and clients to the consortium has 
been very positive. 
Market Conditions 
Current market conditions in each of the major classes underwritten 
by the Group are outlined below. 
Non Marine Property 
The direct and facultative property market is still buoyant with US 
rates remaining attractive. Rates for US risks which were substantially 
re-rated following the 2005 hurricane losses are now softening 
slightly while those for non-US rates are reducing 10% to 15%. The 
delegated authority account written by Syndicate 570 has seen slight 
softening in the US account with more competition in the UK. 
XL Reinsurance 
Rates hardened significantly for all US catastrophe business after 
the 2005 hurricanes. Accounts with losses from Hurricane Katrina 
saw rate increases in excess of 100% with clean renewals seeing 
25% to 40% rate increases. The International reinsurance market  
is stable but rates are under pressure. 
Non Marine Professional Liability 
There has been no material change in conditions in the US and it 
still possible to achieve some rate increases. Overall there has been 
a modest easing of terms. 
Energy Offshore 
There has been a huge increase in insured values as clients have 
discovered that their assets are under-insured following the hurricane 
losses of 2004 and 2005. The softening of rates is accelerating during 
2007, following dramatic increases in 2006, as competition for 
business in the Gulf of Mexico is beginning to increase. For non-US 
business, rate reductions of 10% to 15% are typical. 
Aviation 
Airline rates continue to fall and are down a further 20% in 2007. 
General Aviation rates are more stable and sensitive to loss activity. 
Aviation War rates are reducing by 10% to 20% and Space rates 
are falling by 10% to 15%, with conditions largely unchanged. 
Marine 
The marine market remains stable with rates flat and  
conditions unchanged. 
Accident and Health 
The treaty XL business is under pressure with some accounts 
receiving substantial rate reductions while the core attritional 
business of Syndicate 570 is holding up well. 
Infrastructure 
Atrium seeks to provide its underwriters with the optimum 
environment to transact their business and to process the ensuing 
data efficiently. This requires an infrastructure that allows flexibility 
of access whilst funnelling the dataflows into consistent and 
common storage and reporting functions. 
During 2006, Atrium implemented its largest infrastructure project 
to date by establishing both syndicates on a common risk recording 
platform. At the same time the demands on the Group to respond 
to greater levels of reporting and new market initiatives have never 
been higher. As a result our practitioners have seen and will 
continue to see changes in their practices. Ultimately the benefits 
are being felt across the Group. 
Project Guinness 
During 2006 the key stage of this project was delivered. The launch 
of both syndicates on the one underwriting platform was a result of 
tremendous efforts within Atrium and by its supplier, Room 
Insurance Systems, in managing the functionality, the conversion of 
the old data and considerable rounds of user testing. The benefits 
of having an integrated system have immediately been felt and the 
target in 2007 is to drive further value from this exercise. 
A significant further stage of the project, which will integrate the 
underwriting systems with new accounting software, is due for 
delivery in the second quarter of 2007.  
Business Solutions 
In 2006 we established a new Business Solutions unit which has 
provided Atrium with significant new resources with which to 
monitor its business, to aid reporting and to develop workflow 
solutions throughout the organisation. 
Internal Initiatives 
The operations functions have been restructured during the first 
quarter of 2007. It is an ongoing objective to continue enhancing 
our exposure management, price monitoring and data quality 
functions. All of these were covered within the Franchise 
Performance Directorate’s review of Underwriting Minimum 
Standards which were published in the second half of 2006.

Market Initiatives 
Atrium has responded positively to the initiatives of the electronic 
claims framework, contract certainty and the resolution of legacy 
contracts. These have all required new practices to be absorbed 
within the organisation and we have met or exceeded any 
measures that have been set. In 2007 we are managing the  
very significant changes to contract checking and the cessation  
of stage 2 policy checks. 
We are keeping a close eye on the peer to peer initiative and  
are well positioned to be fast followers once the benefits  
become obvious.  
Integration Programme 
We have taken steps towards becoming more integrated through 
the development of common standards, systems and business 
processes. A team, comprised of practitioners across all units, met 
throughout 2006 to anticipate and access the necessary future 
changes and opportunities. 
In 2007 we will continue to review all areas of our operations to 
ensure that we maximise the benefits of our integrated approach 
and to maintain the support of our underwriters and management. 
People 
At Atrium we are extremely proud of our people and the 
exceptional talent, enthusiasm and commitment they bring to  
the business. We have been able to consistently attract and retain 
highly talented people and to provide them with opportunities to 
learn new skills and to develop their careers within the Group. 
We aim to be a business that consistently attracts and retains 
people who are motivated, empowered, highly skilled and well 
rewarded. We have implemented numerous policies to support 
these aims and we are very encouraged that throughout 2006 we 
were able to maintain our very low staff turnover and absenteeism. 
In 2006 all staff turnover was 9% and voluntary staff turnover was 
6%. Staff absenteeism due to sickness was also very low, the 
average number of days’ sickness per employee was 2.6 in 2006 
and the total days lost as a result of sickness was 1.1%. Our staff 
turnover and sickness absence rates compare extremely favourably 
with industry and national averages.  
Recruitment and Induction 
We have been selectively recruiting where appropriate during  
2006 to target new talent and to further increase support to the 
underwriting teams. Staff numbers have grown by 7% during 2006. 
We recruited a new International Liability Underwriter for Syndicate 
570, a new Head Actuary and Actuarial team, a Head of Business 
Solutions, a Head of HR and a number of professional staff within 
the agency and syndicates.  
In 2006 we further strengthened our Induction Process to help 
people settle quickly at Atrium and to start making an early 
contribution to the business. 
Performance and Development (P&D) and Training  
Through the Atrium P&D process we aim to ensure that everyone is 
clear about what is expected of them and how their own roles and 
objectives relate to the business strategy and goals. All employees 
have at least one formal performance and development review 
each year as well as less formal discussions with their manager. 
As part of P&D all staff agree with their manager training and 
development needs and plans to address them. 
At Atrium we see training and development as very important to 
business success and in 2006 we further increased our investment 
in training resources. Our training and development budget is set  
at 3% of the payroll. A Training Committee comprising business 
leaders and training professionals oversees the training plan and 
budget. The Training Committee meets at least six times a year  
and reports quarterly to the Board. 
Leadership Development 
In 2006 we consolidated the Atrium Leadership framework and  
all members of the leadership team worked on their individual 
Personal Development Plans produced as a result of the 360 
degree survey process. We intend to repeat the process in 2007 
and extend this to other senior managers. 
Remuneration 
In 2006 we implemented the recommendations of the extensive 
Group remuneration strategy review completed in 2005 in 
conjunction with our advisers, New Bridge Street Consultants LLP. In 
the spirit of transparency we published, for the first time, to all our 
staff our full Remuneration policy. In 2006 we continued the move 
to a more formal performance related pay policy for the majority  
of employees, with the link between individual performance and 
variable pay (bonuses) being more clearly defined. We also 
implemented significant changes to contractual bonus arrangements 
for all class underwriters and other senior executives reflecting the 
move to annual accounting and a new methodology of determining 
bonus pools and individual shares of the pools. We continue to 
encourage wider employee share ownership and in 2006 made 
further awards to senior executives under the Atrium Performance 
Share Plan introduced in 2005. We have finalised details of the new 
approved all employee Share Incentive Plan (SIP), which will be 
launched in May 2007. We continue to make available to all eligible 
employees the very popular SAYE scheme and the take up of the 
offer in 2006 was encouraging. 
We pay close attention to market trends and practice in 
remuneration, particularly in our company sector and each year 
participate in a remuneration and benefits survey conducted by 
Watson Wyatt LLP, a firm of Executive remuneration consultants.  
Employee Communication, Consultation and Engagement 
We take effective two-way communication with employees 
seriously. In 2006 we continued to improve the frequency and  “Atrium has an excellent reputation

Delivering long-term returns
Atrium has always focused on long term returns to
shareholders. By long term we mean that we aim to
produce attractive returns for shareholders and outperform
across the insurance cycle. We believe the secret to long
term outperformance is to make the most of the market up
turns when they come and protect capital during the down
turns. We believe in growth but only at the right time in
the insurance cycle. When the upturn comes we aim to
grow our premium writings rapidly. Following September 11
we grew our managed syndicates threefold and produced
some excellent returns for capital providers. It is often said
that the measure of good underwriters is their performance
at the bottom of the insurance cycle. We believe our track
record speaks for itself in this regard having demonstrated
our ability to manage the insurance cycle over many years. 
The charts on this page show our performance over the last
5 years. We believe our average return on equity over this
period to be amongst the best in the sector. We remain
focused on making the best possible returns.

quality of communication with our people. In addition to presenting 
our half yearly Group results to all staff we introduced, in 2006, 
more frequent and informal all staff meetings to report progress 
against our strategy and to encourage open discussion and 
questions. Staff feedback has been positive and we are extending 
the process in 2007. 
Through consultation with all employees in 2006, we developed 
and published the Atrium Values Framework. More details on this 
framework can be found on page 11. 
Corporate and Social Responsibility (CSR) 
2006 has been productive for Atrium in our first year of tackling 
challenges arising from the CSR arena. Our CSR policy is central to 
our commitment to approach such challenges responsibly and 
effectively. Our policy reflects the following key priorities: 
• Atrium values  – that Atrium’s impact on society reflect the ethics 
and values of Atrium as a corporate citizen and those of its staff 
and shareholders. 
• Business profitability  – we recognise that efficient use of the 
earth’s resources and investment in our people is good business 
practice and represents value to shareholders. 
• Social issues  – the importance of community and social and 
environmental awareness as aspects of good citizenship. 
Review, Responsibility, Target Setting 
Atrium’s CSR policy includes a commitment to regularly review 
progress against Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). In 2006, this 
has been fulfilled quarterly via consideration by the Board. Steve 
Cook, Chief Executive Officer, is the Board Director with 
responsibility for CSR and Human Resource issues.  
Atrium has begun to lay some promising foundations in its first year 
of running a CSR programme. To varying degrees, progress has 
been made towards greater accountability, awareness, staff 
initiative and participation across the environmental, charitable and 
community aspects of the CSR arena. There are also areas where 
progress was limited, for example, in incorporating CSR risks into 
the risk management framework. Appropriate ways of addressing 
such areas are included in 2007 objectives. 
Atrium’s CSR policy addresses the above priorities in three areas – 
environmental, charities and social. 
Environmental 
Atrium is concerned to ensure that its operations do not jeopardise 
the environment unduly. Although our direct impact on the 
environment is low, we recognise the business profitability benefit 
and social necessity of minimising the use of resources and the 
environmental consequences of business operations. 
Atrium’s Directors and employees will at all times comply with all 
applicable laws and regulations relating to the environment. Atrium 
is committed to minimising the amount of waste produced and  
to recycle it wherever possible.  
As a tertiary sector business, Atrium’s operations have little  
direct impact on climatic conditions. Environmental change is 
nevertheless an area with both obvious societal impacts and 
implications for business profitability, particularly within the 
insurance industry. 
Atrium will endeavour to develop a proactive approach to 
understanding, identifying and managing environmental risks, 
utilising industry best practice and supporting relevant stakeholders 
in initiatives to develop renewable energy.  
Targets 
Atrium developed its first set of targets in 2006. We aimed to carry 
out external assessment of our current waste practices with the 
intention of identifying areas where resources can be more 
efficiently utilised and certain waste products can be recycled. In 
addition we hoped to develop a measurable system of targets. 
Atrium has made progress in meeting the targets set by the Board. 
We are now registered with the City of London’s Clean City Scheme 
who will be auditing our waste management process during 2007 
and providing feedback on performance. As a tenant of Lloyd’s, it 
has not been possible to develop independent targets for energy 
use and waste levels. However, energy usage will be monitored to 
ensure Lloyd’s continues to act in a responsible manner on our 
behalf and we will endeavour to reduce any unnecessary wastage 
by promoting good individual and corporate habits.  
Charities 
Charitable contributions are one way of using Atrium’s financial 
strength to fulfil its social responsibility, through a direct positive 
impact upon the alleviation of social need. A budget for corporate 
giving is determined annually by the Board. Destinations for these 
resources reflect both the importance of individual staff concerns 
and interests and those of Atrium as a corporate citizen. 
In 2006, a new charities policy was devised to shape our approach 
to charitable giving. We prioritise requests from employees to assist 
causes for which they are making a personal commitment or 
sacrifice (e.g. taking part in a sponsored event). This reflects both 
the centrality of staff values within Atrium and our belief in the 
importance of developing community awareness and the personal 
rewards derived from such involvement. 
Targets 
During 2006 Atrium aimed to give at least £5,000 to charity whilst 
also considering ways to increase its charitable contribution in real 
terms. We have donated £6,000 to charities in 2006 and 
experienced a 20 per cent increase in the number of sponsorship 
requests by staff from 2005. In total, Atrium has made financial 
contributions to 17 charities during 2006.  ATRIUM UNDERWRITING PLC
Operating and Financial Review
 
 
 
11
As with other areas of CSR work, our proactive approach to 
charitable activities is intended to develop greater awareness, 
amongst our workforce, of everyday opportunities to widen the 
range of actions which can have beneficial social impact beyond 
pure financial donations. The donation of 18 used PCs to charity this 
year is indicative of this approach. 
Social  
The Board proactively supports both corporate and individual 
involvement with local London community projects and is committed 
to providing the necessary support and information to enable these 
projects to be undertaken. Staff are encouraged to volunteer their 
time and find rewarding new experiences. 
Targets 
Atrium has sought to explore opportunities for greater involvement, 
for both individual staff and on a corporate basis, in local community 
programmes. In addition, we aimed to ensure these opportunities 
were communicated and appropriate resources made available  
to staff. 
Achievement of these targets has been an encouraging basis for 
future development of community links. Atrium’s 2006 community 
work has focused largely upon developing our relationship with the 
Lloyd’s Community Programme (LCP). Atrium makes an annual 
financial contribution to the work of the LCP but during the year we 
have looked to become more involved in its work. Atrium invited  
the LCP to give a presentation to staff to publicise volunteering 
opportunities in community projects. A number of staff already 
participate in the scheme and, in the year ahead, we will be 
encouraging more to get involved in LCP and appropriate alternative 
schemes. A company-wide team community challenge has also  
been included on Atrium’s Social Committee agenda for 2007. 
Business Ethics 
Atrium is committed to conducting business in an ethical and 
socially responsible manner. This relates to all aspects of our 
business, treating employees, clients, and shareholders in a fair  
and honest manner. 
Atrium demands from its employees the highest ethical standards 
in carrying out its business activities. Staff are encouraged to report 
promptly any potentially illegal, improper or unethical conduct that 
they become aware of. A whistle-blowing policy is in place that 
details the procedure that should be followed in the event of any 
suspected wrongdoing. 
In 2006, through consultation with employees, Atrium developed 
and published the Atrium Values Framework. The values define 
those things that are most important at Atrium and describe the 
behaviours we encourage in working together both internally and 
with our stakeholders. The Values are used in our recruitment and 
selection process and increasingly are being referred to in 
identifying training and development as part of the P&D process. 
For each of the six Values listed below there are four statements 
that describe the behaviours that both support and underpin the 
Values. Full details can be obtained from the Company Secretary  
or Head of Human Resources. 
• Progressive 
• Performance driven 
• Professional 
• Pride in Atrium 
• People Focused  
• Personally Aware 
Human Rights 
Atrium is committed to Human Rights principles as enshrined  
in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  
All employees shall have the right to freedom of association. 
Equal Opportunities & Diversity 
Atrium is an equal opportunity employer. Subject to applicable law, 
all individuals are considered for employment and advancement 
opportunities without regard to race, creed, colour, religion or 
belief, political opinion, gender, sexual orientation, marital status, 
ethnic or national origin, age or disability. 
As an organisation, Atrium is committed to these ideals as they 
relate to recruitment, selection, employment, promotions and 
transfers, compensation, benefits, services provided, disciplinary 
actions and dismissal, training opportunities and all other matters 
relating to employment. 
More specifically, Atrium also operates a recruitment policy through 
which it will create and sustain a highly professional, competent 
and diverse employee Group. 
Training and Development 
Training and development are key to the personal development of 
our employees and to our success. It is also vital in contributing to 
the capabilities of tomorrow’s workforce. In addition to providing 
ongoing training, Atrium provides a number of training incentives 
for staff: 
Full training is provided and paid for to encourage professional and 
personal development. 
Fees for professional training and examinations are reimbursed and 
paid study leave is available for such examinations. 
Employees receive a bonus on completion of professional examinations. 
In addition, Atrium ensures that provisions for staff development 
are dynamic, and that each employee’s training needs can be 
identified, through: 
• our training Committee; 
• annual Performance & Development review process; and 
• ongoing discussion with managers.  ATRIUM UNDERWRITING PLC

Employee Benefits 
All eligible employees are encouraged to join the Group Sharesave 
Scheme as this allows them the opportunity to take an active stake 
in the Group, and to participate in the growth and prosperity of 
Atrium. Share options have also been awarded to Directors and 
senior employees through the Executive Share Option Scheme in 
the past and more recently shares have been awarded under the 
Performance Share Plan. 
In 2006 Atrium obtained shareholder approval to implement a 
Share Incentive Plan (SIP). The SIP will be launched in May 2007 
and all UK employees with six months service will be eligible to 
participate in the SIP. 
Atrium provides a range of benefits to its staff including medical care, 
pension contributions, Life Assurance, Permanent Health Insurance, 
season ticket loan, gym and language training subscriptions. 
Health & Safety 
The Health & Safety at Work Act 1974 places upon the Group the 
statutory duty of securing the health, safety and welfare of persons 
at work and protecting other persons against risks of health or 
safety arising out of the activities of the Group’s employees. 
The Group is fully committed to ensuring that all its employees in 
the UK work in the safest possible conditions and follow not only 
the letter but the spirit of the Health & Safety at Work Act 1974. 
The Group is committed to ensuring the health, safety and welfare 
of its employees, so far as is reasonably practicable. We also fully 
accept our responsibility for other persons who may be affected by 
our activities. We will take steps to ensure that our statutory duties 
are met at all times. 
During 2006, Atrium arranged in-house health & safety training for 
a number of staff to ensure that health & safety issues are 
recognised and addressed. In addition, a workstation assessment 
has been carried out for all staff by means of an employee survey. 
Based on the results of that exercise, adjustments were made to  
a number of workstations. 
Lloyd’s has overall health and safety responsibilities for the building in 
which we work and any enquiries in this regard should be directed to 
the appropriate Lloyd’s department. A copy of Lloyd’s Health & Safety 
at Work Policy and Tenants Handbook are available from the Head of 
Administration and on the Atrium intranet for our staff.

at Lloyd’s through its subsidiaries, listed in note 29, on a limited 
liability basis on both managed and non-managed syndicates. 
Business Review and Key Performance Indicators 
A review of the Group’s business, and development during the 
year, is included in the Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive 
Officer’s Statement and the Operating and Financial Review (OFR). 
The OFR includes information and analysis required by section 
234ZZB of the Companies Act 1985 to be included in a Business 
Review, including information on Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). 
In addition, information on the Group’s financial risk management 
and policies is included in note 33 to the consolidated accounts. 
Such information and analysis is hereby incorporated by reference 
into this report. 
The Group measures a number of KPIs including return on equity,

Directors’ statement as to disclosure 
The Directors who were members of the Board at the time of 
approving the Directors’ Report are listed on page 14 and 15. 
Having made enquiries of fellow Directors and of the company’s 
auditors, each of these Directors confirms that: 
• To the best of their knowledge and belief, there is no information 
relevant to the preparation of their report of which the 
company’s auditors are unaware; and 
• He/She has taken all the steps a Director might reasonably  
be expected to have taken to be aware of relevant audit 
information and to establish that the company’s auditors  
are aware of that information 
Auditor 
Having reviewed the independence and effectiveness of the 
external auditor in the manner described on page 20, the Audit 
Committee has recommended to the Board that the existing 
auditor, Ernst & Young LLP, be reappointed. 
The auditor, Ernst & Young LLP, has expressed its willingness to 
continue in office and a resolution to reappoint Ernst & Young LLP 
as the Company’s auditor will be put to the forthcoming Annual 
General Meeting along with a resolution to authorise the Directors 
to determine its remuneration. 
Going Concern 
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason they continue to 
adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. 
Annual General Meeting 
The notice of the Annual General Meeting, which will be held at 
2.30 pm on Friday 29 June 2007, is included on pages 72 to 74 of

Statement of Corporate Governance

Governance at Atrium Underwriting plc 
Atrium Underwriting plc (Atrium) is committed to high standards  
of corporate governance and this statement describes how the 
principles identified in the revised Combined Code, issued in  
June 2006, on Corporate Governance (the Combined Code)  
have been applied by the Company throughout the year ended  
31 December 2006. 
The Board has put in place a framework for corporate governance 
which it believes is appropriate to the Company’s needs and which 
enabled it to comply with the provisions set out in Section 1 of the 
Combined Code, except as identified in this report.  
In reviewing this statement, shareholders are reminded that the 
Company qualifies as a ‘smaller company’ in relation to the Code 
and, whilst the Board recognises and endeavours to embrace the 
principles of the Combined Code in full, the Company is entitled to 
rely upon exemptions permitted for smaller companies. The Board 
believes the level of compliance the Company achieved during the 
year was appropriate.  
In addition Atrium Underwriters Limited (AUL) and Atrium Insurance 
Agency Limited (AIAL), the trading subsidiaries, are authorised and 
regulated by the Financial Services Authority, and therefore are 
separately required to adhere to additional strict rules and 
regulations which require high standards of corporate governance.  
Shareholders 
The Board recognises the need to provide timely and relevant 
information to the Company’s shareholders and to encourage 
dialogue with them. This is achieved by the measures set out below. 
As detailed on page 12, the Executive Directors have an annual 
programme of meetings with institutional shareholders, the 
outcome of which is reported back to the Board. 
The Company’s website (www.atrium-uw.com) is central to 
communication with shareholders and the general public and it  
is updated regularly. The website currently provides copies of all 
announcements made to the London Stock Exchange, analyst 
briefing presentations, Interim Reports and Annual Reports.  
There is a facility to receive e-mail alerts regarding Company 
announcements and the website makes clear that questions  
may also be raised at any time by e-mail addressed to 
‘info@atrium-uw.com’. Any substantial or material comments 
received from shareholders are reported to the Board. 
Atrium actively encourages shareholders to attend its Annual 
General Meetings (‘AGM’) and to use the opportunity to ask 
questions and hold discussions. To this end the Chairmen of the 
Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees attend the AGM 
and are available to answer questions. Notice of the AGM and  
the Annual Report and Accounts are sent to shareholders at least 
20 working days in advance of the meeting. Separate resolutions 
are proposed for each substantive issue and the results of the proxy 
votes received are made available at the meeting.  
Board of Directors 
The role of the Board is to provide leadership within a framework 
of prudent and effective controls. The Board has a formal schedule 
of matters reserved for it, which include: strategy and management, 
Group structure, capital management, financial reporting and 
corporate governance. Subject to this and where possible, the 
Board delegates matters to the Committees of the Board as set  
out on pages 19 and 20.  
To enable the Board to function effectively and allow Directors to 
discharge their responsibilities, full and timely access is given to all 
relevant information. In the case of Board meetings, this consists of 
a comprehensive set of papers, including discussion documents 
regarding specific matters. 
Directors are provided, on a regular basis, with key information on 
the Company’s policies, and regulatory and statutory requirements. 
Changes affecting Directors’ responsibilities are advised to the 
Board as they arise. 
The Board has segregated the duties of the Chairman and Chief 
Executive, by way of separate appointments, acknowledging  
a clear division between the running of the Board and the 
executive responsibility for running the Company’s business.  
No Director has unfettered powers of decision. 
In line with the Combined Code the Non-Executive Directors met 
during the year without Executive Directors or other executive 
management present. 
Board of Directors – Composition  
The Company aims to appoint Directors possessing a sound 
understanding of the Group, the Lloyd’s Market and financial 
services industry, whilst at the same time maintaining a 
programme to refresh the Board through acquisition of new  
skills and experience. In addition the Board seeks to comply  
with the requirements of the revised Combined Code as they  
relate to independence of Directors. The Board currently comprises 
a Non-Executive Chairman, five Executive Directors and three  
Non-Executive Directors as detailed on page 15. The planned  
Non-Executive Director appointments referred to in last years 
accounts have been made. Philip Swatman and Raymond Dumas 
were both appointed to the Board in June 2006.  
Chairman 
The Chairman was judged independent by the Board at the time of 
his appointment as Chairman in June 2006. The Chairman has no 
significant commitments to be disclosed and has undertaken to 
commit up to 45 days per annum to Atrium in order to discharge 
his role effectively.  
Senior Independent Non-Executive Director 
The Senior Independent Non-Executive Director (SINED) up until  
the AGM in 2006 was James Joll. When James Joll was appointed 
Chairman in June 2006, he stepped down as the SINED and was 
succeeded by Philip Swatman. Concerns relating to the Executive 
management of the Company or the performance of the other 
Non-Executive Directors can be raised with Philip Swatman  
or the Chairman. 
The SINED’s responsibilities include being available to shareholders if 
they have concerns that have not been resolved by contact through 
the normal channels or where contact in this way is inappropriate.   ATRIUM UNDERWRITING PLC

Independence 
The Board considers all of its Non-Executive Directors to be 
independent using the criteria set out in the Combined Code. 
However, in the case of Charles Bailey it is necessary to state  
the matters considered by the Board in reaching this conclusion. 
These are detailed below. 
Charles Bailey 
Mr Bailey joined the Company in December 1998 and has served  
as a Director of the Company for nine years. However, he was 
previously a Director of a number of predecessor companies, 
making his overall association with the Group 14 years of which  
for one he was Chairman of the Company. Mr Bailey contributes 
significantly as a Director through his individual skills and his 
considerable knowledge of the Group, the Lloyd’s Market and the 
financial services industry. He continues to demonstrate strong 
independence in the manner in which he discharges his 
responsibilities as a Non-Executive Director. Consequently, the 
Board concluded that despite his length of tenure and appointment 
as Chairman, this has not led to any association with management 
that could compromise his independence and that therefore  
Mr Bailey remains independent.  
The composition of the Board is currently compliant with the 
Combined Code’s requirement for smaller companies to have  
at least two independent Non-Executive Directors. 
The Chairman has confirmed that following evaluation, the Directors 
and Non-Executive Directors seeking re-election at the AGM are not 
only effective in their role and have shown commitment to the 
Group, but also make a valuable contribution to the Board. 
Induction and Training 
All Directors are provided with a formal induction process upon 
appointment. Training needs are identified as part of the Atrium 
Performance and Development framework and within the Board 
Evaluation process. 
Independent Advice 
Directors are able to seek independent professional advice, if 
necessary, at the Company’s expense in the furtherance of their 
duties as Directors. The Directors have access to the advice and 
services of the Company Secretary who is responsible to the Board 
for ensuring that Board procedures are followed and that applicable 
rules and regulations are complied with. 
Directors’ Terms of Appointment 
In accordance with the existing Articles of Association, all of the 
Company’s Directors (both Executive and Non-Executive) stand for 
election at the first AGM following their appointment, and all 
Directors must offer themselves for re-election at least once every 
three years. 
All Non-Executive Directors have committed a minimum of 15 days 
to fulfil their roles. 
The terms of appointment of all of the Company’s Directors are 
explained in detail in the Report on Directors’ Remuneration on 
pages 22 to 26.  
Directors’ Remuneration 
A statement of the Company’s remuneration policy is set out in the 
Report on Directors’ Remuneration on pages 22 to 26. 
Meetings 
The Board meets at least four times a year, and between those 
meetings, maintains regular contact with the senior management 
of the Company. The number of meetings and the attendance 
levels are detailed in the table on page 21. 
External Service Providers 
The Board has contractually delegated to external service providers 
the management of the investment portfolio, the custodial services 
(which include the safeguarding of assets), the registration services 
and company secretarial function. However, it retains responsibility 
for these areas. Each of these contracts was entered into after full 
and proper consideration by the Board of the quality and cost of 
services offered including the internal control systems in operation 
in so far as they relate to the affairs of the Group. The Investment 
Committee of the Board receives and considers reports from the 
investment managers on a regular basis. In addition ad hoc reports 
and information are supplied to the Board as requested. 
Board Committees 
The Board has delegated authority for specific aspects of 
management and control of the Group to a number of Committees. 
These Committees have specific terms of reference and meet on a 
regular basis. The terms of reference for the Audit, Remuneration 
and Nomination Committees are available on the company website 
(www.atrium-uw.com) and they reflect the requirements of the 
Combined Code and related recommendations. Details of Committee 
members and their biographies can be found on pages 14 and 15. 
Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee assists the Board in discharging its 
responsibilities for ensuring that appropriate and adequate internal 
controls, accounting policies, financial reporting, risk management 
framework and compliance procedures (including the review and 
approval of the work programme for internal controls) are in place 
and that the Group’s accounts are a true and fair reflection of its 
financial position. It also agrees the terms of appointment of the 
external auditors, including their remuneration, and reviews the 
non-audit services provided by them. The Committee conducted its 
annual review of, and approved, the Atrium whistle-blowing policy. 
The Committee meets at least three times during the year and its 
members are qualified Chartered Accountants. 
Remuneration Committee 
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for setting the 
remuneration packages of the Company’s Executive Directors and 
its Senior Employees. It also approves the terms of all share 
incentive schemes and any grants made under them. In considering 
remuneration matters the Committee has taken ad hoc advice from 
New Bridge Street Consultants LLP (Executive remuneration 
consultants). The Committee also commissioned an annual survey 
of remuneration for Lloyd’s agencies provided by Watson Wyatt 
LLP, another firm of Executive remuneration consultants. Neither 
New Bridge Street Consultants LLP nor Watson Wyatt LLP has any 
other connection with the Company. The Committee meets at least 
twice during the year. 
Nomination Committee 
The Nomination Committee reviews the structure, size and 
composition of the Board and considers succession planning for  
the Board and senior management. It leads the process for 
appointments to the Board, engaging the services of external 
search consultants to provide candidates from a wide range of 
backgrounds and, having considered the candidates put forward, 
makes recommendations for appointments to the Board. The 
Committee comprises a majority of independent Non-Executive 
Directors. During the year two Non-Executive Director appointments 
were made using external consultants.  ATRIUM UNDERWRITING PLC

Board Operational Committees 
Following the appointment of Steve Cook as Chief Executive Officer 
and Nick Marsh as Director of Corporate Underwriting, the Board 
reviewed the need for the Operational Committees, taking into 
consideration the responsibilities assigned to Executive Directors.  
As a result, on 30 March 2006 the Chairman’s Committee and 
Spread Capacity Committee ceased. 
The Operational Committees which served to discharge more 
operational responsibilities on behalf of the Board were the 
Executive Committee, which is responsible for the management 
and supervision of all the Group’s operations; the Investment 
Committee, which sets the investment strategy, performance 
measures and the appointment and remuneration of the 
investment managers and the Conflicts Committee which seeks  
to adjudicate on matters referred to it. All the Committees met  
as required.  
Performance Evaluation 
The Company has undertaken a performance evaluation which 
involved the completion of a questionnaire. The evaluation was 
conducted by all Executive and Non-Executive Directors, and  
sought to appraise not only the current position but to provide 
recommendations for improvements, where applicable. The review 
covered an appraisal of the Board, the Chairman, the Committees 
and the Executive and Non-Executive Directors. The findings were 
reported to the Board. 
Accountability and Audit 
The Statements of Directors’ Responsibilities in respect of the 
accounts are on pages 27 and 64 and a statement of going concern 
is on page 17. The Reports of the Independent Auditors are on 
pages 28 and 65. 
Internal Control 
The Board is ultimately responsible for the Group’s system of 
internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. However, such 
a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of 
failure to achieve business objectives, and can provide only 
reasonable and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. 
The Directors confirm that there is an ongoing process for identifying, 
evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the Group. This 
process was in place for the full year and up to the date of approval 
of the annual report and accounts, and it is regularly reviewed by the 
Board and accords with the Turnbull guidance. 
The system of internal control includes financial, operational and 
compliance controls and risk management. A risk management 
framework has been put in place, including a programme of testing 
which is approved by the Audit Committee. Internal control systems 
are monitored by the compliance function, which undertakes 
systematic and periodic examination of business processes and 
ensures that recommendations to improve controls are 
implemented. Risks have been identified through a risk register 
which is updated during the course of the year. This risk register 
identifies business activities and the risks associated with them. An 
overall risk assessment is attributed to each activity and a systems 
approach is taken in monitoring activities performed on behalf of 
the Group. Any errors or weaknesses identified are reported to the 
Audit Committee. 
During the year the Audit Committee received reports on internal 
control and, on behalf of the Board, reviewed the effectiveness of the 
system of internal control. It reviewed the process for identifying and 
evaluating significant risks affecting the Group, and the policies and 
procedures by which these risks are managed. The Audit Committee 
formally reported its recommendations to the Board. 
Internal Audit 
The Audit Committee and Board have considered the need for a 
formal separate internal audit function. The compliance function 
undertakes an equivalent role within the overall Group risk 
management framework which is reviewed annually by the Audit 
Committee. The compliance function has four staff comprising 
individuals with relevant Lloyd’s and internal audit experience. 
Reports are considered by the risk management forum of Atrium 
Underwriters Limited, before their inclusion in the risk register and 
internal control report reported to the Audit Committee and the 
Board. The compliance function has unfettered access across the 
business with the individual responsible for conducting the review 
of internal controls having unfettered access to the Chairman of the 
Audit Committee. The Board has concluded that the structure 
remains appropriate for the Group and that a formal separate 
internal audit function is not required. 
Executive Director – Other Appointments 
During the period no Executive Director was employed as a Non-
Executive Director of another company. Christine Dandridge was  
an elected Member of the Council of Lloyd’s, the governing body  
of Lloyd’s of London. For these services she received £42,500 for 
2006. This money was retained by her, as she undertook this role 
in addition to her Executive position at Atrium. Various other 
Directors participate on Lloyd’s Market Association Committees with 
their participation being ‘pro bono’. This involvement is actively 
encouraged by the Board as it is seen as a valuable mechanism  
to ensure Atrium remains up to date with current issues relating  
to the insurance market and Lloyd’s. 
Appointments to the Board  
During the year, the Board has considered the requirements of the 
Combined Code and succession planning and has appointed two 
new Non-Executive Directors with the relevant level of expertise. 
The Company used an open nomination process for these 
appointments, utilising the assistance of an external consultant  
who has no other connection with the Company. 
External Auditor Independence 
The Audit Committee reviews the independence of the external 
auditor and requires explicit confirmation from them annually that 
they do not perceive any conflicts of interest. The Audit Committee 
has delegated to the Finance Director responsibility for the 
monitoring of the performance of ‘non-audit service’ contracts. He 
is also required to ensure that suitable divisions are maintained 
between the external audit staff and those supplying non-audit 
services, and that the work undertaken to supply non-audit services 
does not, in any material aspect, influence their appointment as 
external auditors.  
Details of the amounts paid to the external auditor during the year 
for audit and non-audit services are set out in note 11. 
The Audit Committee is satisfied that the external auditor  
is independent.

Report on Directors’ Remuneration
 
Report on Directors’ Remuneration 
 
22 
This report is required by and prepared in accordance with the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 (the ‘Regulations’), 
the Companies Act 1985 and Schedule 7A thereto and the Listing 
Rules of the UK Listing Authority. A Resolution to approve the report 
will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting (AGM). 
The Regulations require the auditor to report to the Company’s 
members on the ‘audited information’ contained in the report and 
to state whether in their opinion that part of the report has been 
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985  
(as amended). The report has therefore been divided into separate 
sections for audited and unaudited information. 
UNAUDITED INFORMATION 
Remuneration Committee  
The Remuneration Committee currently consists of three 
independent Non-Executive Directors of the Company, and meets 
at least twice a year and otherwise as required. The Chairman  
of the Committee is Philip Swatman who was appointed on  
30 June 2006 replacing James Joll. Raymond Dumas was appointed 
as a Non-Executive Director on 30 June 2006 and joined the 
Remuneration Committee at the same time. Charles Bailey 
continues as a member of the Committee. The other members of 
the Committee who served for part of the year were George Rivaz 
and Richard Lewy. The Committee’s terms of reference are 
available on the Company’s website. 
The Committee is responsible for setting the remuneration 
packages of the Group’s Executive Directors and its Senior 
Employees. It also approves the terms of all share schemes  
and any grants made under them.  
In considering remuneration matters the Committee has taken 
advice from its appointed advisers New Bridge Street Consultants 
LLP who provide no other services to the Company save for the 
technical advice in relation to the operation of its share incentive 
schemes. The terms of reference of the independent consultants 
are available on request from the Company Secretary. The 
Committee also reviews an annual survey of remuneration for 
Lloyd’s agencies provided by Watson Wyatt LLP. Advice on 
employment law (including Executive contracts) is received from 
Linklaters LLP who provide other legal services to the Company.  
Policy on Directors’ Remuneration 
Non-Executive Directors 
The remuneration for the Non-Executive Directors, except for the 
Chairman of the Company, is determined by the full Board and 
consists entirely of fees. The Chairman’s fees are determined by the 
Board, with the Chairman absenting himself from such discussions. 
These fees are reviewed annually at the time of the AGM and fixed 
within limits contained in the Company’s Articles of Association, 
having regard to the time commitment required and the level of 
fees paid by similar companies.  
The basic fee for a Non-Executive Director is £25,000 per annum. 
The Chairmen of Committees receive an additional £5,000 per 
annum as does the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director.  
The Chairman of the Company receives £65,000 per annum.  
Non-Executive Directors who are also members of the managing 
agency Board receive a further £20,000 per annum. Additionally, 
prior to his resignation effective 1 July 2006, George Rivaz received 
£15,000 per annum for his membership of the Underwriting 
Review Committee of the Managing Agency Board. 
Executive Directors 
The Remuneration Committee’s policy is to ensure that 
remuneration arrangements at Atrium allow the Company to 
attract, retain and motivate the exceptional individuals required  
to drive the Company’s success.  
The Committee will ensure that it remains mindful of the pay 
practices elsewhere in the Company and in the general market (in 
particular, the Company’s sector) when setting remuneration levels. 
To align further the interests of the Executive Directors and 
shareholders, the Committee operates a guideline for Executive 
Directors under which they are required to retain shares equal to 
50% of the after tax gain made on the vesting of share awards 
until they have built up a shareholding equal to 100% of salary 
(taking existing shareholdings into account). 
The packages of the Executive Directors comprise the  
following elements: 
• Basic salaries; 
• Pensions and other benefits; 
• Discretionary annual bonuses or contractual entitlements  
to a percentage of profits of the managed syndicates; and 
• Long-term share-based incentives with Return on Capital and  
TSR performance criteria. 
A significant proportion of total remuneration is therefore 
dependent upon the profitability of the managed syndicates, the 
return on capital of the Group and Atrium’s share price performance. 
Packages (including the structure of share-based incentives) are 
reviewed annually to ensure that the Group’s objectives are likely 
to be met and that they take account of market and best practice, 
and pay and conditions elsewhere in the Group. 
Basic Salaries 
The Remuneration Committee reviews the basic salary of each 
Executive Director annually having regard to the role, responsibility, 
performance and experience of the individual, the rates prevailing 
in the market for comparable Executives and the remuneration paid 
to other Senior Executives within the Group. Basic salary is 
pensionable but bonuses and other benefits are not. 
Pensions and Other Benefits 
The details of the pension schemes operated by the Group are set 
out in note 26 to the accounts. The Company pension schemes are 
all defined contribution schemes. 
For Steve Cook the Group funds contributions equal to 20% of basic 
salary. These contributions were made to the Atrium Underwriters 
Pension Scheme until August 2006 and thereafter to the Atrium 
Group Personal Pension Scheme, Christine Dandridge participated  
in the Atrium Underwriters Pension Scheme until March 2006 when 
contributions were discontinued. The Group also made additional 
contributions in respect of Christine Dandridge in March 2006, as  
a result of her waiver of part of her contractual bonus. Simon Curtis 
participates in the Atrium Group Personal Pension Scheme in 
respect of which the Group funds contributions equal to 20% of 
basic salary (17.5% prior to 1 January 2006) which, until April 2006, 
was subject to the ‘pensions cap’. An additional contribution was 
made in April 2006 representing pension allowance not paid prior 
to that date due to the ‘pensions cap’. Kevin Wilkins has an 
individual pension arrangement for which the Group funds 
contributions of 20% of salary. No pension contributions were 
made by the Group in respect of Nick Marsh during 2006. The 
Committee is satisfied that, at this stage, no changes to the  ATRIUM UNDERWRITING PLC
Report on Directors’ Remuneration
 
 
 
23
company’s policy regarding pension provisions for the Executive 
Directors are necessary to take account of new pension legislation 
except the above mentioned discontinuing of pension contributions 
in favour of Nick Marsh and Christine Dandridge. 
Executive Directors also receive other benefits including life 
assurance, private healthcare insurance and travel insurance. 
Bonus Payments  
Christine Dandridge and Kevin Wilkins have contractual entitlements 
to differing percentages of the profit commissions derived from  
the profits of their respective syndicates. Those percentages are 
reviewed and agreed by the Committee annually. Steve Cook has  
a contractual entitlement to a percentage of the aggregate profit  
of the managed syndicates. In addition he has a contractual 
entitlement to be considered for a discretionary bonus. Simon Curtis 
also has a contractual entitlement to be considered for a discretionary 
bonus. These are accrued and paid after the closure of the relevant 
year of account, normally three years after it commences. With 
effect from 2007, Underwriter contractual entitlements have moved 
to a percentage share of the relevant syndicate underwriting profits 
calculated on an annual basis.  
The Committee does not consider it appropriate currently to apply  
a cap on the bonus opportunity of Christine Dandridge and Kevin 
Wilkins, the two Underwriting Executive Directors, as to do so 
would not accord with the general practice amongst the Company’s 
sector peers and would, therefore, place Atrium at a competitive 
disadvantage. For non-underwriting Executive Directors, bonus 
opportunity will be capped at a multiple of annual salary. 
Long-term Incentives 
In 2005 shareholders approved a Performance Share Plan to 
replace previous long-term incentive arrangements. Awards were 
made under the Plan to all the Executive Directors and other senior 
Executives in 2005 and 2006. Under the Performance Share Plan no 
individual can be granted an award over shares worth more than 
100% of salary each year. Awards made to date vest five years 
after grant subject to the extent to which both a sliding scale of 
annual average pre-tax return on capital and total shareholder 
return targets are met (as described more fully on page 26). The 
Committee currently intends that these performance conditions will 
apply to any awards made in 2007. The Executive Directors’ awards 
under the Atrium Performance Share Plan are shown in the table 
on page 26 together with the relevant performance conditions. 
Shareholder approval was also obtained at the 2005 AGM for the 
establishment of an Inland Revenue approved Share Incentive Plan 
under which all employees (including Executive Directors) will be 
invited to participate on similar terms in May 2007. For each 
Partnership Share purchased under the SIP arrangement one free 
Matching Share will be awarded to each participant in the SIP 
subject to Inland Revenue limits. 
The Executive Directors’ current ‘live’ share options are shown in 
the table on page 25 together with, where relevant, details of the 
performance conditions to which these options are subject. 
The cost of share based payments charged to the accounts in 2006 
was £364,000 (2005: £110,000). 
Performance Graph 
The following graph shows the total shareholder return of the 
Company over a five year period to 31 December 2006, compared 
with the total return performance of the FTSE Insurance Index. 
 
Service Contracts 
It is the Board’s policy that, under Executive Directors’ contracts of 
service, the notice period should not be more than 12 months from 
either side. The general policy is that there should be no provision 
in Directors’ service contracts for payments on termination of the 
contract and there are none at present. The Remuneration 
Committee will consider the circumstances of individual cases of 
early termination and may award compensation payments where 
considered appropriate, taking account of the departing individual’s 
duty to mitigate his/her loss. 
Executive Directors Date of Contract Notice Period 
Christine Dandridge 5 November 1998 12 months 
Nick Marsh 5 November 1998 12 months 
Kevin Wilkins 5 November 1998 12 months

Executive Directors are permitted to accept outside appointments 
on external Boards or Committees so long as these are not deemed 
to interfere with the business of the Company. Whether any fees 
received in respect of these appointments are remitted to the 
Company or retained by the Executive Director is decided by the 
Committee on a case by case basis. 
Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts. The most 
recent letter of appointment of the Chairman of the Company,  
and of the other Non-Executive Directors, is 30 June 2006.  
Non-Executive Directors are appointed for one year and are  
subject to their re-election each year under the existing Articles  
of Association. 
All Directors are subject to election by shareholders at the first 
general meeting after their appointment and to re-election 
thereafter at intervals of no more than three years.

the market price of the company’s shares was 266.25p. 
The market price of shares at the end of the year was 258.0 pence, and the highest and lowest market prices during the year were  
260.0 pence and 177.25 pence respectively. No payment was made by any Director for the grant of the options shown in the table  
above. The share options issued in July 2000 were at a discount to nominal value. No variation was made in the year in the terms  
and conditions of any share option. 
Summary of performance conditions: 
1. Options granted in December 1998 under the Atrium Approved Share Option Scheme 1998 and the Atrium Unapproved Share Option 
Scheme 1998. The performance condition is that:  
 The average of the combined profits (before members’ Agents’ fees) of the managed syndicates, expressed as a percentage of the 
syndicates’ capacity, for the three most recent closed years of account before options are exercised, exceeds the average for all Lloyd’s 
syndicates over the same period by at least 5% of that average. 
2. Options granted in July 2000 under the unapproved scheme. The performance conditions are: 
 (a) that the average result of the three most recent closed years of account for the managed syndicates of the Group is positive  
and has exceeded the equivalent average for the Lloyd’s market by 1%; and  
 (b) that the share price has increased such that the discount to net tangible asset value remains at less than 15% for the three 
successive reporting periods where the reporting periods are the 6 months to 30 June and the year to 31 December commencing 
with the 6 months ending 30 June 2000. 
3. Options granted to specific individuals since July 2000 under both the approved and unapproved schemes. The performance conditions 
are consistent with those for the July 2000 grants, with reporting period dates amended accordingly. 
4. The Atrium Sharesave Scheme was established in 2000 and has been running annually since then. This scheme enables employees who 
are prepared to save up to a maximum of £250 per month for either a three or five year period to be granted an option to buy shares in 
the Company with the accumulated fund at a 20% discount to the share price shortly before the options are granted. The funds can be 
used to exercise the options granted if the individual remains an Atrium employee at the end of the three or five year period.  ATRIUM UNDERWRITING PLC

The Atrium Performance Share Plan 2005 was approved at the AGM in July 2005 and the first grants were made under the scheme in 
December 2005 when the market price was 197.75p. Subsequent awards were made in November 2006 when the market price was 
240.25p. An award will normally vest on the fifth anniversary of the date the award was granted, provided that the performance conditions 
have been satisfied and the grantee remains an employee of the Atrium Group. 
The performance conditions set by the Remuneration Committee, for awards granted in 2005 and 2006, are primarily based on Atrium’s 
average annual pre-tax return on capital (‘ROC’) performance, over a period of five financial years. ROC is adjusted profit divided by 
adjusted opening capital for each of the five financial years.  
Where average annual pre-tax ROC over the five-year period is below 15%, no percentage of the award will provisionally vest. If it is 25% 
or over, 100% of the award will provisionally vest. Where it is between 15% and 25%, a pro-rata percentage of the award will 
provisionally vest.  
However, even if the above targets are satisfied, the award will only permanently vest if the Company’s Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’), 
over the performance period, is in the top 50% of a Group including fourteen other named insurance companies. TSR means share price 
growth plus dividends reinvested.  
The extent to which these performance conditions are satisfied will be first determined by a third party and then confirmed by the 
Committee to ensure an appropriate level of independent verification. 
When the award permanently vests the employee receives the number of Atrium shares awarded. The employee also receives an amount 
in cash or extra shares equal to the dividends that were declared, during the five-year period, on that number of shares.

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities 
 
27
 The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and 
the Group financial statements in accordance with the applicable 
United Kingdom law and those International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the European Union. 
The Directors are required to prepare Group financial statements for 
each financial year which present fairly the financial position of the 
Group and the financial performance and cash flows of the Group 
for that period. In preparing those Group financial statements the 
Directors are required to: 
• select suitable accounting policies in accordance with IAS 8: 
‘Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors’ 
and then apply them consistently; 
• present information, including accounting policies, in a  
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information; 
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific 
requirements in IFRSs is insufficient to enable users to understand 
the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions 
on the Group’s financial position and performance; and 
• state that the Group has complied with IFRSs, subject to any 
material departures disclosed and explained in the financial 
statements. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records 
which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial 
position of the Group and enable them to ensure that the Group 
financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985 and 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud  
and other irregularities. 
The Directors are responsible for ensuring the Annual Report 
includes information required by the Listing Rules of the  
Financial Services Authority. 
The Directors are also responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the corporate and financial information included  
on the Company’s website.  ATRIUM UNDERWRITING PLC
Consolidated Financial Statements
Independent Auditors’ Report to the Members of Atrium Underwriting plc 
 
28 
We have audited the Group financial statements of Atrium 
Underwriting plc for the year ended 31 December 2006 which 
comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated 
Balance Sheet, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, 
the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement and the related notes 1 to 
33. These Group financial statements have been prepared under  
the accounting policies set out therein. 
We have reported separately on the parent company financial 
statements of Atrium Underwriting plc for the year ended  
31 December 2006 and on the information in the Report on 
Directors’ Remuneration that is described as having been audited.  
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body,  
in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our 
audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
company’s members those matters we are required to state to 
them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest 
extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility 
to anyone other than the company and the company’s members  
as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions 
we have formed. 
Respective Responsibilities of Directors and Auditors 
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and 
the Group financial statements in accordance with applicable United 
Kingdom law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) 
as adopted by the European Union are set out in the Statement of 
Directors’ Responsibilities. 
Our responsibility is to audit the Group financial statements in 
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Group financial 
statements give a true and fair view and whether the Group 
financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance 
with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
We also report to you whether in our opinion the information given 
in the Directors’ report is consistent with the financial statements. 
The information given in the Directors’ report includes that specific 
information presented in the Operating and Financial Review  
that is cross referred from the Business Review section of the 
Directors’ report.  
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, we have not received 
all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if 
information specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and 
other transactions is not disclosed. 
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement reflects 
the company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2006 
Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the 
Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are  
not required to consider whether the Board’s statements on internal 
control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the 
effectiveness of the Group’s corporate governance procedures  
or its risk and control procedures. 
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and 
consider whether it is consistent with the audited Group financial 
statements. The other information comprises only the Chairman’s 
Statement, the Chief Executive Officer’s Statement, the Operating  
and Financial Review, Syndicate Participations, the Directors’ Report, 
the Statement of Corporate Governance and the unaudited part of  
the Report on Directors’ Remuneration. We consider the implications  
for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements  
or material inconsistencies with the Group financial statements.  
Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.  
Basis of Audit Opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. 
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant 
to the amounts and disclosures in the Group financial statements.  
It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and 
judgments made by the Directors in the preparation of the Group 
financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are 
appropriate to the Group’s circumstances, consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed. 
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the 
information and explanations which we considered necessary  
in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable 
assurance that the Group financial statements are free from 
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other 
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated  
the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the 
Group financial statements. 
Opinion 
In our opinion: 
• the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, of  
the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2006 and of  
its profit for the year then ended;  
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation; and 
• the information given in the Directors’ report is consistent with 
the Group financial statements.

1. Corporate information 
Atrium Underwriting plc is a public limited company registered in 
England and Wales. The Company’s ordinary shares are traded on 
the London Stock Exchange. The Group’s principal activities and the 
nature of its operations are described in the Operating and Financial 
Review on pages 4 to 12. 
2. Statement of Compliance with IFRSs 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) 
as adopted by the European Union (‘EU’) and issued by the IASB as 
they apply to the financial statements of the Group for the year 
ended 31 December 2006. The principal accounting policies adopted 
by the Group are set out in note 3. 
The solus accounts of the parent company are presented in a separate 
section of the annual report, under UK GAAP. 
3. Accounting policies 
Basis of preparation 
The Group’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with IFRS as adopted by the EU as they apply to the financial statements 
of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2006 and applied in 
accordance with the Companies Act 1985. The accounting policies 
which follow set out those policies which apply in preparing the 
financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2006. The 
Group financial statements are presented in Sterling and all values 
are rounded to the nearest thousand pounds (£’000) except when 
otherwise indicated. 
The syndicates in which the corporate member subsidiary undertakings 
participate are managed by their respective managing agents. The 
accounting information in respect of these participations has been 
provided by the managing agents and has been audited by the 
respective syndicate auditors.  
Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the 
Company and its subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are those entities in 
which the Group directly or indirectly has the power to govern the 
operating and financial policies in order to gain economic benefits. 
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same 
reporting year as the parent company. Consolidation adjustments 
are made to convert the company and subsidiary accounts prepared 
under UK GAAP into IFRS. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the 
date control is gained and cease to be consolidated from the date 
control is transferred out.  
For each syndicate in which the Group participates, the Group’s 
proportion of the syndicate income and expenses has been 
reflected in its consolidated income statement and the Group’s 
proportion of the syndicate’s assets and liabilities has been reflected 
in its Consolidated Balance Sheet. Syndicate assets are held subject 
to trust deeds for the benefit of the syndicate’s insurance creditors.  
All inter-company balances, profits and transactions are eliminated.  
Insurance Contracts 
Insurance contracts are those contracts that transfer significant 
insurance risk at the inception of the contract. Insurance risk is 
transferred when an insurer agrees to compensate a policyholder  
if a specified uncertain future event adversely affects the policyholder. 
Contracts that do not transfer significant insurance risk are 
accounted for as investment contracts. 
Premiums 
Gross premiums written relate to policies incepting during the 
financial year together with any difference between booked 
premiums for prior years and those previously accrued. Written 
premiums are stated inclusive of acquisition costs but exclusive  
of premium taxes and other similar deductions. 
Outwards reinsurance premiums are accounted for in the same 
accounting period as the related inwards business. 
Unearned premiums 
The provision for unearned premium represents the proportion of 
gross premiums and outwards reinsurance premiums written in the 
year which is to be earned or incurred after the balance sheet date. 
The recognition of premiums is based primarily on time 
apportionment with adjustments where necessary for the risk 
profile of certain classes of business.  
The change in the provision for unearned premiums is taken to  
the income statement in order that revenue and expense are 
recognised over the period of the risk. 
Acquisition costs 
Acquisition costs comprise brokerage incurred and other related 
expenses on insurance contracts written during the financial year. 
They are deferred over the period in which the related premiums 
are earned.  
Claims 
(a) Claims incurred 
Claims incurred comprise claims and claims handling costs paid  
in the year and changes in the provisions for outstanding claims, 
including provisions for claims incurred but not reported and related 
expenses, together with any adjustments to claims from prior years. 
Claims handling costs are mainly those external costs related to the 
negotiation and settlement of claims. The Group does not discount 
its liabilities for unpaid claims. Where applicable, deductions are 
made for salvage and other recoveries. 
(b) Outstanding claims provisions 
Claims outstanding represent the estimated ultimate cost of settling 
all claims (including direct and indirect claims settlement costs) 
arising from events which have occurred up to the balance sheet 
date, including provision for claims incurred but not reported, less 
any amounts paid in respect of those claims. Claims outstanding  
are reduced by anticipated salvage and other recoveries.  
The ultimate cost of outstanding claims is estimated by using a 
range of actuarial projection methods. The estimation process will 
vary from managing agent to managing agent but will include the 
use of statistical projections based on previous claims history, case 
by case reviews of notified losses, and the use of security ratings to 
help assess the financial ability of reinsurers to pay the reinsurance 
recoveries anticipated of them.  ATRIUM UNDERWRITING PLC

3. Accounting policies continued 
 
Significant delays can be experienced in the notification and 
settlement of certain claims, and accordingly the ultimate cost of 
such claims cannot be known with certainty at the balance sheet 
date. In particular, estimates of technical provisions inevitably 
contain inherent uncertainties because significant periods of time 
may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss, the 
reporting of that claim to the syndicate and the syndicate’s 
payment of the claim and the receipt of reinsurance recoveries.  
The primary sensitivity in these methods is the assumption  
that past experience is indicative of the final outcome of  
current business and, where past experience is insufficient, that  
market benchmarks are representative of the relevant syndicate’s 
own underwriting. 
Whilst the Directors consider that the estimate of claims outstanding 
is fairly calculated on the basis of the information currently available 
to them, there is inherent uncertainty in relation to the ultimate 
liability which will vary as a result of subsequent information and 
events and may result in the eventual cost of settling these liabilities 
being higher or lower than the amount calculated. 
(c) Salvage and subrogation reimbursements 
Estimates of salvage recoveries are included as an allowance in the 
measurement of the insurance liability for claims. The allowance is 
the amount that can reasonably be recovered from the disposal of 
the property.  
Subrogation reimbursements are also considered as an allowance 
in the measurement of the insurance liability for claims and are 
recognised in other assets when the liability is settled. The 
allowance is the assessment of the amount that can be recovered 
from the action against the liable third party. 
(d) Reinsurance to close (RITC) 
Each syndicate underwriting account is normally closed at the end 
of the third year by means of reinsurance into the following year, 
which reinsures all future liabilities for the closed year and all 
previous years in return for a premium calculated by the 
underwriter and approved by the managing agent. 
The payment of a reinsurance to close does not eliminate the 
liability of the closed year for outstanding claims. If the reinsuring 
syndicate were to be unable to meet its obligations and other 
elements of the Lloyd’s chain of security were to fail, then the 
members of the closed underwriting year would have to settle 
outstanding claims. The Directors consider the likelihood of such 
failure of the reinsurance to close is extremely remote and, 
therefore, the reinsurance to close has been deemed to settle 
liabilities outstanding at the closure of the underwriting account 
and no provision is made for the ultimate liability of that year  
of account. 
Liability adequacy test 
At each reporting date an assessment is made to determine 
whether recognised insurance liabilities are adequate. If that 
assessment shows that the carrying amount of insurance  
liabilities (less related acquisition costs) is inadequate in the light  
of estimated future cash flows, the entire deficiency is recognised  
in the income statement via the provision of an unexpired risks 
reserve. The provision for unexpired risks is included within 
‘Insurance contract liabilities’ in the balance sheet. 
The assessment of whether a provision is necessary is made on  
a syndicate by syndicate basis, using information supplied by the 
respective managing agents. 
Expenses incurred in insurance activities 
Expenses incurred in insurance activities are recognised on an accruals 
basis. These comprise the Group’s share of syndicate operating 
expenses, acquisition costs and the costs of membership of Lloyd’s 
and other expenses attributable to the Group’s underwriting. 
Fee and commission income 
Underwriting agency fees are brought into account in the year to 
which they relate. Profit commissions expected to arise on closure 
of a Lloyd’s year of account in respect of the managed syndicates 
are recognised as earned on an annual basis to match the related 
underwriting profits. The profit commission arrangements include  
a deficit clause under which any year of account loss on closure is 
carried forward against the profits of the following two years of 
account when calculating the profit commission due on those years 
of account, and profit commission accounting follows these terms. 
Profit commissions due after more than one year are held at fair 
value which is the discounted present value of the nominal amount 
expected to be received. Subsequent unwinding of the discount is 
recognised as investment income. 
Investment return 
Investment return comprises all investment income, realised investment 
gains and losses and movements in unrealised gains and losses net of 
investment management fees. Interest income is recognised on an 
effective interest method basis. Dividend income is recognised when 
the shareholders’ right to receive the payment is established.  
Income Tax 
The tax expense represents the sum of the current tax and  
deferred tax. 
(a) Current income tax 
The current tax charge is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable 
profit differs from profit as reported in the income statement 
because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable  
or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are 
never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is 
calculated using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date. 
Current income tax is charged or credited in the income statement, 
except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to 
equity, in which case the current tax is also dealt with in equity. 
(b) Deferred income tax 
Deferred income tax is generally provided in full, on temporary 
differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
and their carrying value in the consolidated financial statements. 
However, if the deferred income tax arises from the initial recognition 
of goodwill or the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a 
transaction other than a business combination that at the time of 
the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, 
it is not accounted for. Deferred income tax is determined using  
tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet 
date and which are expected to apply when the related tax is 
payable or receivable. 
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is 
probable that future taxable profit will be available against which 
the temporary differences can be used. 
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each 
balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow  
all or part of the asset to be recovered.  ATRIUM UNDERWRITING PLC

Deferred income tax is charged or credited in the income 
statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited 
directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with 
in equity. 
Investments 
The Group has classified its financial assets held for investment 
purposes as designated at “fair value through profit and loss” at 
inception. This is in accordance with the Group’s documented 
investment strategy. Information relating to investments is 
provided internally to the Group’s Directors and key managers  
on a fair value basis. The fair values of quoted financial investments 
are based on current bid prices.  
Unquoted equity investments are initially carried at cost as the best 
estimate of fair value and are adjusted thereafter whenever events 
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may 
not approximate to fair value. 
All purchases and sales of investments are accounted for at  
trade date, i.e. the date that the Group commits to purchase or  
sell the asset. Investments are initially recognised at fair value and 
derecognised when they have been sold. Realised and unrealised 
gains and losses arising from the change in fair value are included 
in the income statement in the period in which they arise.  
Intangible assets 
(a) Goodwill 
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of a business 
combination over the fair value of the Group’s share of the 
identifiable assets, liabilities and reliably measurable contingent 
liabilities of the business combination at the business combination 
date. Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less 
any accumulated impairment losses. At the acquisition date, any 
goodwill acquired is allocated to each of the cash generating units 
expected to benefit from the business combination’s synergies. 
Goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment or more frequently if 
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value 
may be impaired. 
For acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004, goodwill is included at  
the carrying value recorded under UK GAAP at the date of transition 
to IFRS. 
(b) Syndicate participations 
Managed syndicate capacity purchased at auction is capitalised at 
cost. Managed syndicate capacity is treated as an indefinite life asset 
and is carried at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.  
Managed syndicate capacity is reviewed annually for impairment  
or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate 
that the carrying value may be impaired. The amount of any 
impairment is charged to the income statement in the year  
in which the impairment arises. 
Third party syndicate capacity purchased at auction is capitalised at 
cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful 
life of 3 years. Amortisation is charged from the beginning of the 
first accounting period following acquisition, when the asset 
becomes available for use. 
(c) Computer software 
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis  
of the costs incurred to acquire and bring into use the specific 
software. These costs are amortised on a straight line basis over 
the expected useful life of the software which is 3 years. 
All other costs associated with developing or maintaining computer 
software programmes are recognised as an expense in the income 
statement as incurred. 
Plant and equipment 
Plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
and any impairment in value. Depreciation is calculated on a straight 
line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset as follows: 
Fixtures and fittings – over 5 years 
Computer hardware – over 3 years 
An item of plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or 
when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the 
continued use of the asset. A gain or loss arising on derecognition 
of the asset is calculated as the difference between the net 
disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the item. Any  
such gain or loss is included in the income statement in the year  
in which the item is derecognised. 
Impairment of assets 
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying 
amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine  
whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered  
an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable 
amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent 
of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate 
cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group 
estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit  
to which the asset belongs. An intangible asset with an indefinite 
life is tested for impairment annually, and whenever there is an 
indication that the asset may be impaired. 
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less cost to sell 
and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future 
cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax 
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time 
value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the 
estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted. 
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash generating unit) is 
estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount 
of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable 
amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense in the 
income statement in the period in which it arises. 
Except for goodwill where impairment losses cannot be reversed, 
where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying 
amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is increased to  
the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the 
increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount 
that would have been determined had no impairment loss been 
recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years.  
A reversal of the impairment loss is recognised as income in the 
income statement in the period in which it arises.  ATRIUM UNDERWRITING PLC

3. Accounting policies continued 
Cash and cash equivalents 
For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash 
equivalents comprise cash at bank and other short-term highly 
liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less from  
the date of acquisition net of bank overdrafts. 
Employee Benefits: Pensions 
The Group provides defined contribution pension plans for the 
benefit of employees. These plans are funded by the Group initially, 
with appropriate proportions recharged to the managed syndicates. 
Contributions in respect of these plans are charged to the income 
statement in the same period as the related service is provided. 
Share based payments 
The Group operates a number of executive and employee share 
schemes. The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees  
is measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instrument 
at the date at which they are granted, which includes the impact  
of market vesting conditions (any vesting condition related to the 
share price of Atrium Underwriting plc) but excludes the impact  
of non-market vesting conditions (all other vesting conditions).  
The fair value of the equity-settled transaction granted is  
calculated using an option pricing model and recognised as an 
expense, spread on a straight line basis over the vesting period  
of the instrument.  
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of  
the number of equity instruments that are expected to become 
exercisable with respect to the impact of non-market vesting 
conditions and recognises the impact of the revision of original 
estimates, if any, in the income statement and a corresponding 
adjustment is made to equity. 
Any proceeds received on the exercise of awards, net of any 
directly attributable transaction costs, are credited to equity. 
The Group has taken advantage of the exemption in IFRS 1 in 
respect of equity-settled awards so as to apply IFRS 2 only to those 
equity-settled awards granted after 7 November 2002 that had not 
vested before 1 January 2005. 
For share options not covered by IFRS 2, no expense is recognised 
in the income statement. When the options vest, share capital is 
increased by the number of options vesting with the excess or 
deficiency to par value of cash received taken to the share 
premium account. 
Own shares 
Atrium Underwriting plc shares are stated at cost and shown as a 
deduction from shareholders’ equity. No gain or loss is recognised 
in the income statement on the purchase, sale, issue or 
cancellation of equity shares. 
Leases 
Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives 
received from the lessor) are charged to the income statement  
on a straight line basis over the period of the lease. 
Long term assets and liabilities 
Where financial assets and liabilities are payable or recoverable in 
more than one year, they are initially recognised at their fair value 
which is the discounted nominal value of the asset or liability. 
Subsequently these are measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method and the unwinding of the related 
discount is recognised within investment income and other 
operating expenses as appropriate. 
Provisions and contingencies 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or 
constructive obligation as a result of past events, and it is probable 
that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation 
and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made. Where a 
reimbursement is expected, this is recognised only when it is 
virtually certain that the reimbursement will take place. 
Contingent liabilities are liabilities that represent a possible 
obligation arising from a past event whose existence is dependent 
on one or more uncertain future events not within the control of 
the Group, or a present obligation arising from a past event where 
it is not probable that an outflow will be required for settlement of 
the obligation, or where there is uncertainty as to the amount. 
Contingent liabilities are not disclosed where the likelihood of the 
uncertain future event is remote, unless the disclosure of the 
contingent liability adds clarity to the financial statements. 
Contingent assets are possible assets, depend on the outcome of 
uncertain future events and are not recognised. Such an asset is 
disclosed only where the inflow of economic benefit is probable. 
Foreign currency translation 
(a) Functional and presentation currency 
The functional currency used in the financial statements is sterling, 
being the currency of the primary economic environment of the 
companies within the Group. The consolidated financial statements  
are presented in sterling being the presentation currency for the Group. 
(b) Transactions and balances 
Foreign currency transactions are recorded in the functional 
currency for each entity using the average rates ruling during  
the year. The resulting exchange differences on translation are 
recorded in the income statement. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
are translated at period end exchange rates. Non-monetary  
assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency including 
unearned premium, reinsurer’s share of unearned premium and 
deferred acquisition costs are translated at the rate applicable  
on initial recognition and not retranslated. 
Dividends  
Dividends paid during the year are recognised in equity for that 
period. Dividends declared after the balance sheet date but before 
the financial statements are authorised are not recognised but 
disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.  ATRIUM UNDERWRITING PLC

The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards 
and interpretations will have a material impact on the Group’s 
financial statements in the period of initial application. 
Upon adoption of IFRS 7, the Group will have to disclose additional 
information about its financial instruments, their significance and 
the nature and extent of risks that they give rise to. More 
specifically, the Group will need to disclose the fair value of  
its financial instruments and its risk exposure in greater detail. 
There will be no effect on reported income or net assets. 
4. Critical accounting estimates and  
judgements in applying accounting policies 
The preparation of financial statements requires management to 
make estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts 
of assets and liabilities as at the balance sheet date and the 
amounts reported for revenues and expenses during the year. 
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and based  
on historical experience and other factors, including expectations  
of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the 
circumstances. The final outcome of these estimates and 
judgements could be significantly different to current expectations. 
Insurance contracts 
Estimates have to be made both for the expected ultimate cost  
of claims reported at the balance sheet date and for the expected 
ultimate cost of claims incurred but not yet reported (IBNR) at the 
balance sheet date. It can take a significant period of time before 
the ultimate claims cost can be established with certainty and for 
some classes of business, IBNR claims form the majority of the 
balance sheet claims provision. 
The primary technique adopted by management in estimating  
the cost of notified and IBNR claims, is that of using past claim 
settlement trends to predict future claims settlement trends. At 
each reporting date, prior year claims estimates are reassessed  
for adequacy and changes are made to the provision. Claims 
provisions are not discounted for the time value of money.

5. Segmental Analysis 
(a) Basis of segmentation 
As at 31 December 2006, the Group is organised into three business areas, Syndicate 570, Syndicate 609 and Other Syndicates. This is  
the basis on which the Group is reporting its primary business segments. 
Syndicates 570 and 609 are both managed by Atrium Underwriters Limited, the wholly owned managing agency subsidiary, and are 
engaged in underwriting activities. The Group derives income from these syndicates through underwriting activities, both directly as  
a capital provider to the syndicates and indirectly through fees and profit commission paid by third-party capital providers. 
Details of Other Syndicates are set out in note 30. The Group derives income from the underwriting activities of these syndicates as  
a capital provider.  
Any income and expenditure which cannot be allocated to any of the three segments has been classified as unallocated.

13. Earnings per ordinary share and net assets per share 
The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on earnings of £32,160,000 (31 December 2005: £7,027,000) being the profit after tax 
for the year, and on 50,523,304 (31 December 2005: 50,094,320) shares, being the weighted average number of shares in issue during the 
year after excluding shares held by the Atrium Employee Share Ownership Trust. 
The number of shares for the purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share is increased to 51,421,449 (31 December 2005: 
50,920,756) to reflect the dilutive effect of the future exercise of share options. 
The calculation of the net asset value per share is based on equity of £116,804,000 (31 December 2005: £88,884,000) and using the 
number of ordinary shares in issue at the year end, adjusted for own shares held, amounting to 50,695,223 shares (31 December 2005: 
50,326,150 shares). 
The net tangible assets value for the purposes of net tangible assets per share is based on equity less intangible assets – £95,334,000  
(31 December 2005: £68,343,000).

Impairment tests 
Goodwill and syndicate participations on managed syndicates are deemed to have indefinite lives. Consequently, they are not amortised 
but annually tested for impairment. They are allocated to the Group’s cash generating units (CGUs) as follows:

Syndicate participations 1,879 5,088 1,879 4,937
When testing for impairment, the recoverable amount of a CGU, is determined based on value in use. Value in use is calculated using 
projected cash flows based on financial budgets approved by management covering a five year period. Cash flows beyond a five year 
period are assumed to remain constant i.e. no growth is assumed. A period of more than 5 years is considered relevant, because it is 
assumed that Atrium Underwriters Limited will continue to manage Syndicates 570 and 609 for the foreseeable future. A pre-tax discount 
rate of 15% (2005: 15%) has been used to discount the projected cash flows. The discount rates are the Group’s weighted average cost of 
capital and have been loaded where significant uncertainties exist. Financial budgets assume that managed and owned syndicate capacity 
remains constant from the 2006 year of account onwards. Agency expenses are assumed to rise by the rate of inflation. Syndicate results 
are based on management expectations.

Insurance contracts – Terms, Assumptions and Sensitivities 
Detailed below is the process that the managed syndicates go through in order to establish their claims reserves. The estimation process  
for non-managed syndicates will vary from managing agent to managing agent but is likely to include the use of statistical projections 
based on previous claims history, case by case reviews of notified losses, and the use of security ratings to help assess the financial  
ability of reinsurers to pay the reinsurance recoveries anticipated of them. 
Terms 
The major classes of general insurance written by the managed syndicates comprise property, non-marine liability, energy, reinsurance, 
aviation, marine and accident and health. 
For general insurance contracts, claims provisions (comprising provisions for claims reported by policyholders and claims incurred but not 
reported) are established to cover the ultimate cost of settling the liabilities in respect of claims that have occurred and are estimated 
based on known facts at the balance sheet date.  
The provisions are refined quarterly as part of a regular ongoing process as claims experience develops, certain claims are settled and 
further claims are reported. Outstanding claims provisions are not discounted for the time value of money. 
The measurement process primarily includes projection of future claims costs through a combination of actuarial and statistical projection 
techniques like the Chain Ladder and Bornheutter-Ferguson method. In certain cases, where there is a lack of reliable historical data on 
which to estimate claims development, relevant benchmarks of similar business are used in developing claims estimates. Claims provisions 
are separately analysed by geographical area and class of business. In addition, larger claims are usually either separately assessed by loss 
adjusters or separately projected by the actuaries. The claims projection assumptions are generally intended to provide a best estimate of 
the most likely or expected outcome.  
Assumptions 
The principal assumption underlying the estimates is that the Group’s past claims development experience is a guide to the Group’s future 
claims experience. This includes assumptions in respect of average claim costs, claims handling costs, claims inflation factors, and claim 
numbers for each underwriting year. Judgement is used to assess the extent to which external factors such as judicial decisions and 
government legislation affect the estimates.  
Other key assumptions include changes in the mix of business, rating movements, and reporting and settlement delays. 
The Group did not change its assumptions for the insurance contracts disclosed in this note during the year. 
Sensitivities  
The Group’s results are most sensitive to claims loss ratios. The Group’s profit on ordinary activities before tax is sensitive to a 1%  
change in the net claims ratios by £1,216,000 (31 December 2005: £1,266,000). The effect on net equity would be £851,000  
(31 December 2005: £886,000). 
Loss development tables 
The tables overleaf show the development of claims over a period of time on a gross and net of reinsurance basis.  
The tables show the estimate of ultimate claims costs for each underwriting year at each successive balance sheet date, together with 
cumulative claims payments as at the current balance sheet date. Estimates of ultimate claims at the end of years one and two include  
an estimate of claims which will be incurred in later years as the unearned premium at those balance sheet dates is subsequently earned. 
This amount is adjusted in the tables in order to reconcile to the actual liability at the current balance sheet date. 
Claims estimates in currencies other than sterling have been restated at current exchange rates to make them comparable on a year by 
year basis. They have been grossed up to show 100% of each of the managed syndicate’s claims, with a reconciliation to the Group’s share 
of each of the two managed syndicates. The Group’s share of claims from third party syndicates on which it participates in 2007 (‘other 
current syndicates’) have also been shown on a 100% basis. This has then been reconciled to the balance sheet, along with the Group’s 
share of the other syndicates.   ATRIUM UNDERWRITING PLC

For the non-managed syndicates, advantage has been taken of the exemption within paragraph 44 of IFRS 4, as it is impracticable to 
disclose information relating to claims development that occurred before the beginning of the first year in which comparative information  
is presented. 
The Group has taken advantage of the exemption in IFRS 4 which permits an entity not to disclose information about claims development 
that occurred earlier than five years before the end of the first financial year in which it applies this standard. 
Reinsurance – Terms and Assumptions 
The Group limits its exposure to loss within insurance operations through participation in reinsurance arrangements in both Lloyd’s  
and company markets. Each managing agent will allocate the reinsurance premiums to reflect the protection purchased by each year  
of account. 
The Group is not relieved of its direct obligations to its policyholders, even though it has reinsurance protection in place. Therefore, there  
is a credit risk exposure in relation to reinsurance ceded to the extent that any reinsurer is unable to meet its obligations assumed under 
reinsurance agreements. Each managing agent will regularly review the security of its reinsurers to ensure that acceptable reinsurers are 
used by its syndicates and that appropriate levels of provision are made against doubtful debts. 
The Group is not substantially dependent on a single reinsurer nor a single reinsurance contract.  ATRIUM UNDERWRITING PLC

During the year new shares were issued for cash at a discount to satisfy the exercise of options by employees of the Group. Cash  
received in respect of the shares was £119,000 (2005: £444,000). In accordance with the Articles of Association, the difference between 
the nominal value and the issue price has been met by a transfer out of the share premium account. 
Share premium account 
The share premium account represents the difference between the price at which share issues are offered and the nominal share value. 
Expenses capitalised in relation to such issues are charged against this account. 
Own shares 
The market value of the company’s own shares, being 1,099,254 shares with a nominal value of £1 each (99,254 acquired at a cost of 
£1.51 each and 1,000,000 acquired at a cost of £0.66 each) held by Atrium Employee Share Ownership Trust, at 31 December 2006 was 
£2,836,000 (2005: £2,138,000); if they had been sold at this value there would be a liability to tax of £608,000 (2005: £398,000) on the 
capital gain arising on the sale. It is intended that these shares will be used to satisfy options exercised in due course by employees of the 
Group or for shares vesting under the Atrium Performance Share Plan, or other future employee incentive schemes. None of the shares are 
currently under option. 
Dividends on the shares owned by the trust, purchase of which was funded by an interest free loan to the trust from the Group, have been 
waived. All expenses incurred by the trust are settled directly by the Group. 
Merger Reserve and Other Reserve 
The merger reserve was created on 2 December 1998 to account for the merger with Atrium Cockell Group Limited. 
The other reserve has been established for issuing share options to employees of the Group. 
Retained earnings 
Retained earnings represents the cumulative profit retained by the Group after taxation and dividends.  ATRIUM UNDERWRITING PLC

The deferred tax liability in respect of underwriting results relates to the underwriting results that have arisen on the 2004, 2005 and 2006 
years of account. These results will be assessed to tax in 2007, 2008 and 2009 respectively. 
The Group has an unrecognised capital loss of £8,261,000 (2005: £8,261,000) which can be offset against future capital gains and has not 
been recognised in the financial statements. The Group is not expected to have any suitable taxable gains against which to offset this loss 
for the foreseeable future. A deferred tax asset has therefore not been recognised in respect of this loss.

National Insurance contributions on share options 
Provision has been made for National Insurance contributions on share options granted since 5 April 1999 under unapproved share option 
schemes, which are expected to be exercised. The provision has been calculated based on the difference between the year end share price 
of 258.0p and the various exercise prices in the range 79.5p to 166.9p and is being allocated over the period from the date of grant to the 
date the employee will become unconditionally entitled to the options. It is expected that the costs will be incurred during the exercise 
periods which span the period from the balance sheet date to 5 October 2013.

28. Share-based payments 
The fair value of share options awarded to staff is estimated on the date of grant using stochastic modelling techniques. The option term  
is split into a large number of small time intervals and in each time interval the share price can take a whole range of values. Stochastic 
modelling simulates a large number of possible share price movements (50,000). For each individual share price run, the effect of any 
performance test can be applied, and the resulting value calculated. These are then averaged over the 50,000 simulations to produce an 
estimated value of the option. 
The fair value of equity-settled share options granted is estimated at the date of grant using a stochastic model, such as the Monte Carlo  
or Random Walk model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. The following table lists the 
inputs to the model used for the Performance Share Plan (PSP) awards that were granted on 20 December 2005. Of the total share based 
payments charge for the year of £364,000 (31 December 2005 – £110,000), £230,000 (31 December 2005 – £8,000) relates to the PSP. 
The charges arising from all other share option schemes are not material to the Group results.

IFRS 2 ‘Share-based payments’ requires all share-based payments that were granted after 7 November 2002, but that had not yet vested at 
1 January 2005, to be expensed based on their fair value at the date of grant. The expense is recognised in the income statement over the 
vesting period of the share-based payment. The Group has taken advantage of the transitional arrangements that exist under IFRS 1 ‘First-
time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards’, in relation to IFRS 2. 
Atrium Performance Share Plan 2005 
Under the Atrium Performance Share Plan 2005, the Remuneration Committee grants ‘awards’. An award is a conditional award of Atrium 
shares. The grantee only actually receives the shares provided that over a five year period they remain an employee and the performance 
conditions are satisfied. The award vests on the fifth anniversary of the date of grant when the grantee is given fully paid ordinary shares  
in the company. The performance conditions will primarily be based on Atrium’s average annual pre-tax return on capital performance over 
five financial years. 
Dividends: the grantee does not receive dividends during the five year period but when the award vests they will be given cash or extra 
shares equal to the dividends declared during the five year period in respect of the shares in the award that actually vest. There is no such 
payment if the employee leaves the company. 
845,000 shares were awarded to employees of the Group on 20 December 2005. These awards will vest on 20 December 2010 provided 
that the performance conditions have been met. These awards of shares do not have an exercise price attached to them. The fair value  
of these at the date they were awarded was £1.36 per share, after taking into account the features noted above. These awards are not 
included in the two tables on page 54.  ATRIUM UNDERWRITING PLC

Active share option schemes 
Atrium Sharesave Scheme 2000 
The Atrium Sharesave Scheme was established in 2000 and has been running annually since then. This scheme enables employees who 
are prepared to save up to a maximum of £250 per month for either a three or five year period to be granted an option to buy shares  
in the company with the accumulated fund at a 20% discount to the share price shortly before the options are granted. The options are 
granted following receipt of applications from eligible employees. The funds can be used to exercise the options granted if the individual 
remains an Atrium employee at the end of the three or five year period. 
Atrium Approved Executive Share Option Scheme 1998 & Atrium Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme 1998 
Options granted in December 1998 under both of the above named schemes have the following performance condition. The average of the 
combined profit (before members’ agents’ fees) of the managed syndicates, expressed as a percentage of the syndicates’ capacity, for the 
three most recent closed years of account before options are exercised, exceeds the average for all Lloyd’s syndicates over the same period 
by at least 5% of that average. 
Options granted in July 2000 under the approved scheme have the following performance conditions: 
• that the average result of the three most recent closed years of account for the managed syndicates of the Group is positive and has 
exceeded the equivalent average for the Lloyd’s market by 1%; and 
• that the share price has increased such that the discount to net tangible asset value remains at less than 15% for the three successive 
reporting periods where the reporting periods are the 6 months to 30 June and the year to 31 December commencing with the 6 months 
ending 30 June 2000. 
Options granted to specific individuals since July 2000 under both the approved and unapproved schemes have performance conditions 
consistent with those for the July 2000 grants, with reporting period dates amended accordingly. 
There were the following movements in the number of share options held by employees:

Legal proceedings and regulations 
The Group operates in the insurance industry and is subject to legal proceedings in the normal course of business. While it is not practicable 
to forecast or determine the final results of all pending or threatened legal proceedings, management does not believe that such 
proceedings (including litigations) will have a material effect on its results and financial position.  
The Group is also subject to insurance solvency regulations in all the territories where it operates and has complied with all local solvency 
regulations. There are no contingencies associated with the Group’s compliance or lack of compliance with such regulations. 
Charge over assets 
On 23 December 1993 the Company, in order to enable its underwriting subsidiaries to underwrite as corporate members of Lloyd’s, 
entered into a Covenant and Charge arrangement with the Society of Lloyd’s. Under the arrangement the Company has provided a  
charge over all its assets in connection with covenants amounting to £40,500,000 to secure the underwriting obligations of each of  
those underwriting subsidiaries. The entire amount is included in the Balance Sheet. 
In addition the underwriting subsidiaries have given undertakings to the Society of Lloyd’s, supported by a commitment from the Company, 
that if one of them fails to meet any of its obligations to Lloyd’s the others will assign to Lloyd’s on demand their rights to current and 
future profits held in their Premium Trust Funds or contribute profits received out of their Trust Funds to the Central Fund of Lloyd’s in  
each case until the amounts owed by the defaulting subsidiary have been paid in full.  ATRIUM UNDERWRITING PLC

33. Risk management policies 
The activities of Atrium Underwriting plc (AUP / the Group) expose the business to a number of risks which could impact the ability of the 
Group to achieve its business objectives. The key activities of AUP are the Group’s investment in the corporate underwriting portfolio and 
the management of Atrium Underwriters Limited (AUL) and Atrium Insurance Agency Limited (AIAL). 
The Group has within its structure 11 corporate vehicles which support the underwriting activities of a number of third party syndicates  
in addition to the two that are directly managed by AUL. 
AUL, a wholly owned subsidiary of AUP, is responsible for managing the activities of Syndicates 570 and 609 and is authorised and 
regulated by the FSA. In addition to having to comply with FSA regulation, the Lloyd’s marketplace operates within a Franchise with  
the managing agents, of which AUL is one, as Franchisees and the Corporation of Lloyd’s (Corporation) as Franchisor. The Franchise  
Board within the Corporation expects Franchisees to operate in accordance within prescribed principles. 
AIAL is a separately regulated and authorised firm and subject to regulation by the FSA. 
The Board of AUP is responsible for the Group’s systems and internal controls and for reviewing their effectiveness. With respect to third 
party managed syndicates, it has been concluded by the Board that it is appropriate to assume that risk management policies should be in 
place which are similar to those in place at AUL in order for those firms to remain authorised and regulated by the FSA. An overview of the 
risks and the policies in place within AUL, which seek to mitigate these risks, is detailed below. It should be noted that AUL policies do not 
provide the definitive approach to the risk management strategy adopted by these external managing agencies as there will be differences 
in certain aspects of their risk management framework compared with that of AUL; for example AUL has stated that equities will not 
feature within its current investment strategy however other managing agencies may hold this type of investment. 
For the financial year, AUP’s underwriting portfolio of Lloyd’s syndicates comprised 45% managed syndicates’ capacity, based on insurance 
liabilities, with the remainder non-managed syndicates. 
Risk Management Framework (RMF) 
The primary objective of the risk management framework is to protect AUP (as far as possible) from events that hinder the sustainable 
achievement of its performance objectives. AUP recognises the importance of having suitable risk management systems in place but also 
recognises that it can only mitigate risks, and may not remove them completely. 
AUP’s framework encompasses a risk register, a programme of internal control testing and risk policies which set out the risk appetite, 
controls and business conduct standards for the Group’s operations.  
The Audit Committee on behalf of the Board has approved this framework and meets to discuss risk management within the Group and 
approves any amendments to the framework.  
Capital Management Framework 
The corporate vehicles within the Group are required to hold capital to mitigate the risk of insolvency to a selected remote level of risk 
applied to a number of tests (both financial and non-financial) on the capital position of the business, the basis of which is the Individual 
Capital Assessment (ICA) which is in line with the regulatory requirements of the FSA. 
The actual capital that each corporate vehicle is required to maintain is based upon their participation on the individual syndicates and is 
ultimately calculated by Lloyd’s. 
Financial Risk: 
(1) Credit Risk 
Credit risk is the exposure to loss if another party fails to perform its financial obligations to the firm, including failing to perform them  
in a timely manner. 
Exposure to Credit Risk 
Credit risk could arise from the following situations: 
• The policyholder fails to pay the premium and cover under the contract of insurance may either commence before the premium 
becomes due or it continues after the non-payment; 
• The broker fails to pass on the premium or reinsurance recovery collected from the third party either in a timely manner or at all; 
• The broker fails to pass on claims payments made by the syndicate to the third party either in a timely manner or at all; 
• The coverholder that has been appointed by the syndicates does not pass on the premium that has been collected either in a timely 
manner or at all;  
• The reinsurer does not fulfil its financial obligation to repay the syndicates upon submission of a claim; and 
• The underlying securities held by either the syndicates or AUP default. 
It should be noted that the risk of default by the broker or intermediary is borne by the syndicates rather than the policyholder.  ATRIUM UNDERWRITING PLC

Operational Controls to Mitigate Credit Risk 
Exposure to Brokers: The syndicates only transact business with Lloyd’s approved brokers, however even though a broker has been 
approved by Lloyd’s, AUL conducts its own assessment of a Lloyd’s approved broker prior to accepting business in order to determine 
whether the intermediary is suitable. AUL’s policy is to establish with each of the brokers with which it conducts business a signed Terms  
of Business Agreement (TOBA) that amongst other aspects sets out the requirements that are expected of the broker. 
Assessment of Coverholders: The syndicates perform checks on coverholders which aim to reduce the likelihood of credit risk arising  
from a coverholder.  
Exposure to Reinsurers: Reinsurance is placed with counterparties in line with the internal reinsurance policy as determined by the 
Reinsurance Security Committee (RISC). It is acknowledged that there is the potential that reinsurers fail and it is for this reason that a  
bad and doubtful debt provision is made on an individual reinsurer basis should it be warranted.  
Exposure to Financial Instruments: In order to reduce the exposure to the default of financial instruments, the Investment Manager, Credit 
Agricole Asset Management (CAAM), operates within agreed guidelines, for example the minimum rating of the issuer, the maximum 
concentration per issuer and the maximum aggregate per instrument type.  
Provisioning: The Reinsurance Security Committee (RISC) has established a provisioning policy for the non-recovery of balances from 
reinsurers. Provisions are held against particular exposures considered to be bad or doubtful. 
The following table provides information regarding the credit risk exposure of the Group’s assets, including its share of managed and third 
party syndicates, as at 31 December 2006 by classifying assets according to credit ratings of the counterparties with AAA being the highest 
possible rating. These amounts represent the maximum credit risk exposure.

(2) Market Risk 
Market risk is the risk of change in fair value of financial instruments from fluctuation in foreign exchange rates (currency risk), market 
interest rates (interest rate risk) and market prices (equity risk), whether such change in price is caused by factors specific to the individual 
instrument or its issuer or factors affecting all instruments traded in the market. 
Exposure to Market Risk 
Currency Risk: The major exposure to exchange rate risk arises from the fact that the majority of the Group’s business is generated from 
overseas activities, denominated mainly in US dollars.  
Interest Rate Risk: arises within a fixed income portfolio from the fluctuation of interest rates with the severity of the risk being directly 
related to the duration of the portfolio.  
Equity Risk: The Group is not materially exposed to equity risk as the Investment Committee has elected to hold funds as fixed income 
securities rather than as equities. Lloyd’s syndicates are permitted to invest in equities and it is through the Group’s participation on a 
number of third party syndicates that it has an exposure to equity risk. 
The effect of a 100 basis points hypothetical rise in the market interest rates on the fair value of the Group’s financial assets of 
£234,138,000 (2005: £229,868,000) would be a loss of £1,609,000 (2005: 2,915,000). 
Operational Controls to Mitigate Market Risk 
Management of Funds 
The responsibility of the management of funds for the Group is delegated to the Investment Committee, which reviews and sets the 
investment criteria. The Group employs Credit Agricole Asset Management (CAAM) to invest funds available on behalf of AUP and the 
managed syndicates. A Service Level Agreement is in place with AUP and each of the managed syndicates and this SLA states that CAAM 
must invest in accordance with these criteria. The Investment Committee measures CAAM’s performance against the benchmarks as set  
out by the Investment Committee and takes appropriate action where it is considered necessary.  
Currency Risk: The majority of the syndicates’ business is denominated in US dollars and the majority of assets are maintained in US dollars 
accordingly. The Group reviews whether it should hedge currency exposures, and to date has concluded that it is not appropriate. 
Interest Rate Risk: this risk is currently managed within AUP, and its managed syndicates, due to its fixed income portfolio having a 
relatively short-term duration and the Investment Committee setting and monitoring objectives and constraints on investments, 
diversification plans and limits on investments.

(3) Liquidity Risk 
Liquidity risk is the risk arising from short-term cash-flows rather than the risk arising from longer-term matching of assets and liabilities, 
which is considered to be within insurance risk. 
Exposure to Liquidity Risk 
Liquidity risk may result from the inability to sell financial assets quickly at their fair values; a counterparty failing on its repayment  
of a contractual obligation; an insurance liability falling due for payment earlier than expected or an inability to generate cash inflows  
as anticipated.  
Both AUP and the managed syndicates are subject to daily calls on their available cash resources in respect of claims arising from insurance 
contracts. These on-going calls may result in a cash call on a corporate vehicle should there be insufficient funds available within the 
managed syndicate to meet its financial commitments with a cash call needing to be met within 28 days of being made. 
In respect of US regulated business all syndicate funds are held in trust and therefore AUP cannot freely use these funds as there are  
strict regulations in place over the access of these accounts. These restrictions would further increase the liquidity risk. However this  
risk is managed by AUP holding sufficient liquid assets, or assets that can be converted into liquid assets at short notice. 
Operational Controls to Mitigate Liquidity Risk 
Credit Control: The controls surrounding credit control have been considered within Credit Risk. 
Cashflow Management: Cashflow projections are prepared to enable the Group to identify potential cash shortfalls at an early stage so  
that, where possible, these can be managed.  
Contingency Funding Plans: AUP has the opportunity to use an overdraft facility with the bank in the event that insufficient immediate  
funds are available to the Group. 
The table below analyses assets and liabilities of the Group, including its share of its managed and third party syndicates, into their relevant

(4) Insurance Risk 
Insurance risk arises from the fluctuations in the timing, frequency and severity of insured events, relative to the expectations of the  
Group at the time of underwriting (claims risk). In addition it can also arise from estimates of claim subsequently proving to be insufficient 
(reserving risk) and a policy being written for too low a premium or providing inappropriate cover (underwriting risk). 
Exposure to Insurance Risk 
Insurance risk would arise from the business written by the syndicates resulting in an underwriting loss. For general insurance contracts the 
most significant risks arise from natural disasters and terrorist activities. These risks vary significantly in relation to the location and type of 
risks insured. 
Operational Controls to Mitigate Insurance Risk 
Underwriting Criteria 
Concentration: The variability of risks is improved by diversification of risk of loss to a large portfolio of insurance contracts and geographical 
areas, as a more diversified portfolio is less likely to be affected across the Board by change in any subset of the portfolio as well as 
unexpected outcomes.  
Reinsurance: Within the managed syndicates the variability of risks is improved by implementation of underwriting strategies as well as  
the use of reinsurance arrangements. The reinsurance is placed in line with internal policies and its placement is diversified such that it 
should not be dependent on a single reinsurer nor should it be substantially dependent upon any single reinsurance contract.  
Claims review: Within Atrium there is an ongoing claims review process, as well as the investigation of possible fraudulent claims. 
Business Planning: formal business planning is conducted across both managed syndicates with review and Board approval. 
Review: In order to ensure that an adequate underwriting control environment exists AUL operates several review mechanisms  
including underwriting peer review, authority limits and review of risks written.  
Aggregation: AUL seeks to monitor and model the concentration of risk and uses catastrophe modelling software to model estimated 
maximum probable losses from catastrophe exposed business. AUL monitors the managed syndicates’ exposures relating to Lloyd’s 
prescribed Realistic Disaster Scenarios. 
The operational controls highlighted above seek to mitigate the insurance risk, however due to the potential severity, frequency  
and concentration, particularly of catastrophe insurance losses, the cost to the company could still be considerable.

(5) Operational Risk 
Operational risk is inherent within the business environment and is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, 
systems and controls. 
Controls to Mitigate Operational Risk 
AUL has in place a Risk Management Framework which seeks to identify and addresses those operational risks facing both the syndicates 
and Group which are summarised within the Risk Register. The potential financial impact and potential frequency of occurrence of each risk 
within the Risk Register is assessed. The output from the Risk Register is used for the operational risk element of the Individual Capital 
Assessment (ICA) calculation as well as serving to identify those areas of the business where review work is required either due to a 
control weakness or a heavy reliance on a particular control.

and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have elected  
to prepare the financial statements in accordance with United 
Kingdom GAAP (UK accounting standards and applicable law).  
The financial statements are required by law to give a true and  
fair view of the state of affairs of the company and of the profit  
or loss of the company for that period. In preparing these financial 
statements, the Directors are required to: 
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
• make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
• state whether applicable UK accounting standards have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements; and 
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will 
continue in business. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records 
that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial 
position of the company and enable them to ensure that the 
financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They 
are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company 
and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
The Directors are also responsible for ensuring the Annual Report 
includes information required by the Listing Rules of the Financial 
Services Authority. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity

them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest 
extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility 
to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as 
a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we 
have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors 
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report,  
the Report on Directors’ Remuneration and the parent company 
financial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom 
law and Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally  
Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the Statement of 
Directors’ Responsibilities. 
Our responsibility is to audit the parent company financial statements 
and the part of the Report on Directors’ Remuneration to be audited in 
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the parent company 
financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the 
parent company financial statements and the part of the Report on 
Directors’ Remuneration to be audited have been properly prepared 
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you 
whether in our opinion the information given in the parent company 
Directors’ report is consistent with the financial statements. The 
information given in the Directors’ report includes that specific 
information presented in the Operating and Financial Review  
that is cross referred from the Business Review section of the 
Directors’ report.  
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the company has  
not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all  
the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if 
information specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration  
and other transactions is not disclosed. 
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and 
consider whether it is consistent with the audited parent company 
financial statements. The other information comprises only the 
unaudited part of the Report on Directors’ Remuneration, the 
Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive Officer’s Statement,  
the Operating and Financial Review, Syndicate Participations, the 
Statement of Corporate Governance and the Directors’ Report. We 
consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any 
apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the parent 
company financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to 
any other information. 
Basis of audit opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. 
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant 
to the amounts and disclosures in the parent company financial 
statements and the part of the Report on Directors’ Remuneration 
to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the significant 
estimates and judgments made by the Directors in the preparation 
of the parent company financial statements, and of whether the 
accounting policies are appropriate to the company’s circumstances, 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed. 
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the 
information and explanations which we considered necessary  
in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable 
assurance that the parent company financial statements and the 
part of the Report on Directors’ Remuneration to be audited are 
free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other 
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the 
overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the parent 
company financial statements and the part of the Report on 
Directors’ Remuneration to be audited. 
Opinion 
In our opinion: 
• the parent company financial statements give a true and fair 
view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice, of the state of the company’s affairs as at 
31 December 2006;  
• the parent company financial statements and the part of  
the Report on Directors’ Remuneration to be audited have  
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies  
Act 1985; and 
• the information given in the Directors’ report is consistent with 
the parent company financial statements.

Notes to the Company Balance Sheet

1. Accounting policies 
Basis of preparation 
The parent company balance sheet is prepared in accordance with 
applicable UK accounting standards and law, section 226A of, and 
Schedule 4 to, the Companies Act 1985. No profit and loss account 
is presented for the parent company as permitted by section 230  
of the Companies Act 1985 and the Company has taken the 
exemption under FRS 1 not to present a cash flow statement.  
The profit dealt with in the financial statements of the parent 
company is £5,886,000 (2005: £11,185,000). 
The company has taken advantage of the exemption under FRS 8 
not to disclose related party transactions in a parent’s own financial 
statements when those statements are presented together with  
its consolidated financial statements. 
The company has taken advantage of the parent company exemption 
under FRS 25 not to present the disclosure requirements included  
in paragraphs 51-95. 
Other accounting policies 
Investment Income and Expenses 
Dividends are included as investment income when the investments 
to which they relate are declared “ex-dividend”. Interest income and 
investment expenses are recognised on an accruals basis. 
Realised investment gains and losses are calculated as the difference 
between net proceeds on disposal and their purchase price. 
Unrealised investment gains and losses are calculated as the 
difference between the valuation at the balance sheet date and their 
valuation at the last balance sheet date or purchase price, if acquired 
during the year. Unrealised investment gains and losses include 
adjustments in respect of unrealised gains and losses recorded in 
prior years that have been realised during the year and are reported 
as realised gains and losses in the current profit and loss account. 
Investments 
The company has classified its financial assets held for investment 
purposes as designated at “fair value through profit and loss” at 
inception. This is in accordance with the company’s documented 
investment strategy. Information relating to investments is provided 
internally to the company’s Directors and key managers on a fair 
value basis. The fair values of quoted financial investments are 
based on current bid prices.  
All purchases and sales of investments are accounted for at trade 
date, i.e. the date that the company commits to purchase or sell 
the asset. Investments are initially recognised at fair value and 
derecognised when they have been sold. Realised and unrealised 
gains and losses arising from the change in fair value are included 
in the income statement in the period in which they arise. 
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at the Directors’ 
valuation, being the cost of the investment, adjusted for the 
movement in underlying net assets applicable to the investments 
since their date of acquisition. Positive value adjustments are  
dealt with through the revaluation reserve whilst negative value 
adjustments, to the extent that they exceed previously recognised 
positive value adjustments, are dealt with through the profit and 
loss account. No adjustment is made to reduce the value of an 
investment below nil. An impairment review is carried out if  
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying  
value of any investment may not be recoverable. 
Deferred Tax 
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that 
have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where 
transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an 
obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less or to receive more, tax. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the 
Directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will  
be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the 
underlying timing differences can be deducted. 
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax  
rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing 
differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
Pension Costs 
The company operates two defined contribution schemes and 
certain Directors and staff have personal pension arrangements  
to which the Company contributes. Contributions are charged to  
the profit and loss account as they become payable in accordance 
with rules of the schemes. 
Foreign Currencies 
The company’s functional and presentation currency is pounds 
sterling. Transactions in foreign currencies during the year are 
translated into sterling at average rates of exchange ruling during 
the period. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are translated into sterling at the rates ruling at the 
balance sheet date. Translation differences are dealt with in the 
profit and loss account. 
Own Shares 
Atrium Underwriting plc shares are stated at cost and shown as a 
deduction from shareholders’ equity. No gain or loss is recognised 
in the income statement on the purchase, sale, issue or 
cancellation of equity shares. 
Share Based Payments 
The Company operates a number of executive and employee share 
schemes. The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is 
measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instrument at 
the date at which they are granted, which includes the impact of 
market vesting conditions (any vesting condition related to the 
share price of Atrium Underwriting plc) but excludes the impact  
of non-market vesting conditions (all other vesting conditions).  
The fair value of the equity-settled transaction granted is calculated 
using an option pricing model and recognised as an expense, spread 
on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the instrument.  
At each balance sheet date, the Company revises its estimate of 
the number of equity instruments that are expected to become 
exercisable with respect to the impact of non-market vesting 
conditions and recognises the impact of the revision of original 
estimates, if any, in the income statement and a corresponding 
adjustment is made to equity. 
Any proceeds received on the exercise of awards, net of any 
directly attributable transaction costs, are credited to equity. 
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in FRS 20 in 
respect of equity-settled awards so as to apply the standard only  
to those equity-settled awards granted after 7 November 2002  
that had not vested before 1 January 2005. 
For share options not covered by FRS 20, no expense is recognised 
in the income statement. When the options vest, share capital is 
increased by the number of options vesting with the excess or 
deficiency to par value of cash received taken to the share 
premium account.

10. Contingent liabilities 
Charge over assets 
On 23 December 1993 the Company, in order to enable its underwriting subsidiaries to underwrite as corporate members of Lloyd’s, 
entered into a Covenant and Charge arrangement with the Society of Lloyd’s. Under the arrangement the Company has provided a  
charge over all its assets in connection with covenants amounting to £40,500,000 to secure the underwriting obligations of each of  
those underwriting subsidiaries. The entire amount is included in the Balance Sheet. 
In addition the underwriting subsidiaries have given undertakings to the Society of Lloyd’s, supported by a commitment from the  
Company, that if one of them fails to meet any of its obligations to Lloyd’s the others will assign to Lloyd’s on demand their rights  
to current and future profits held in their Premium Trust Funds or contribute profits received out of their Trust Funds to the Central Fund  
of Lloyd’s in each case until the amounts owed by the defaulting subsidiary has been paid in full. 
11. Dividend 
See note 22 in the Consolidated Financial Statements for dividends paid in the year. 
The Directors in their meeting held on 28 March 2007 approved a proposal to be put before the Annual General Meeting of the 
shareholders, to be held on 29 June 2007, for payment of a final dividend per share of 13p for the year ended 31 December 2006.  
The amount is not recognised as a liability at 31 December 2006.  Notice of the Annual General Meeting for 2007

Annual General Meeting. 
4. To re-appoint Mr H R Dumas as a Director. 
5. To re-appoint Mr P H Swatman as a Director. 
Note: The Company’s articles of association and provisions of the 
Combined Code require a Director appointed by the Board during 
the year to stand for re-appointment by the shareholders at the 
next Annual General Meeting. Mr Dumas and Mr Swatman were 
appointed by the Board on 30 June 2006 and are accordingly 
seeking re-appointment. Further information about Mr Dumas and 
Mr Swatman is given on pages 14 and 15 and the Board confirms 
that both Directors continue to perform effectively and demonstrate 
commitment to their roles.

6. To re-elect Mr S J Cook as a Director.  
7. To re-elect Ms C E Dandridge as a Director.  
8. To re-elect Mr J A B Joll as a Director.  
Note: The Company’s articles of association require one-third of  
the Directors, excluding those appointed by the Board since the  
last Annual General Meeting, to retire by rotation each year. 
Accordingly Mr Cook, Ms Dandridge and Mr Joll are retiring by 
rotation and are seeking re-election at this Annual General 
Meeting. The Board confirms these Directors continue to perform 
effectively and demonstrate commitment to their roles. Further 
information about Mr Cook, Ms Dandridge and Mr Joll is given on 
pages 14 and 15. 
Re-election of a Director over the age of 70 years 
9. That Mr C H Bailey be re-elected as a Director of the Company.  
Note: Mr Bailey attained the age of 70 on 29 May 2004. The 
Company’s articles of association as currently drafted require any 
Director over the age of 70 years who has previously been re-
appointed on attaining this age, to retire at the Annual General 
Meeting each year. Accordingly, Mr Bailey is retiring and offering 
himself for re-election. Further information about Mr Bailey and  
the Board’s recommendation for his re-election is given on pages 
15 and 16. 
Re-appointment of Auditors 
10. To re-appoint Ernst & Young LLP as auditors until the conclusion 
of the next Annual General Meeting.  
Note: The Auditors are required to be re-appointed at each Annual 
General Meeting at which accounts are presented. The Board on 
the recommendation of the Audit Committee, which has evaluated 
the effectiveness and independence of the external auditors, is 
proposing the re-appointment of Ernst & Young LLP. 
Auditors’ Remuneration 
11. To authorise the Directors to determine the remuneration of 
the auditors.  
Note: Details of the remuneration paid to the auditors for 2006  
and details of how the Company monitors the effectiveness and 
independence of external auditors can be found in the Statement 
of Corporate Governance on pages 18 to 21 and note 11 of the 
Annual Report. 
Purchase of own shares 
12. That pursuant to section 166 of the Companies Act 1985 (“the 
Act”) the Company be generally and unconditionally authorised 
to make one or more market purchases (within the meaning  
of Section 163(3) of the Act) of ordinary shares of £1 each in 
the Company (“Shares”) and to hold such Shares as treasury 
shares, provided that:  
 (a) the maximum number of Shares to be repurchased shall  
be 2,610,645 Shares; 
 (b) the minimum price (exclusive of expenses) which may  
be paid for a Share shall be £1;  
 (c) the maximum price (exclusive of expenses) which may be 
paid for a Share shall be an amount equal to 105% of the 
average market values of the Shares (as derived from the 
Daily Official List of the London Stock Exchange) for the five 
business days immediately preceding the date on which 
the Share is purchased;  
 (d) any purchase of Shares will be made in the market for cash 
at prices below the prevailing net asset value per share as 
determined by the Directors;  
 (e) the authority hereby conferred shall expire at the 
conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting of the 
Company or, if earlier, on 29 September 2008; and  
 (f) the Company may make a contract to purchase Shares 
under the authority hereby conferred prior to the expiry  
of such authority which contract may or will be executed 
wholly or partly after such expiry and may make a purchase 
of Shares pursuant to any such contract notwithstanding 
such expiry.  
Note: This resolution is to authorise the Company to make market 
purchases of up to 5% of its own Shares currently in issue, subject 
to maximum and minimum prices specified by the UK Listing 
Authority as set out in the resolution. The authority will expire  
at the next Annual General Meeting or on 29 September 2008, 
whichever is earlier. 
The Directors consider that in certain circumstances it may be 
advantageous for the Company to purchase its own Shares at a 
discount to net asset value. Purchases will only be made on the 
London Stock Exchange within guidelines established from time  
to time by the Board.  
ATRIUM UNDERWRITING PLC  
 
73
The Directors would only consider exercising this authority if they 
considered that such purchases would be to the advantage of the 
Company and its shareholders as a whole. The principal aim of this 
share buy back facility is to enhance shareholder value by acquiring 
Shares at a discount to net asset value, as and when the Directors 
consider this to be appropriate. The purchase of Shares when they 
are trading at a discount to net asset value per Share, and their 
cancellation, should result in an increase in the resulting net asset 
value per Share for the remaining Shares. The Company will also be 
in a better position to address any imbalance between supply and 
demand for the Shares that may be reflected in any discount to net 
asset value at which the Company’s Shares trade on the London 
Stock Exchange.  
The Directors intend that any Shares purchased under this authority 
will be held by the Company as treasury shares, within the limits 
allowed by the law, unless the Directors consider that purchasing  
the Shares and cancelling them would be to the advantage of the 
Company and its shareholders. The Directors may dispose of treasury 
shares in accordance with relevant legislation and the authority 
relating to rights of pre-emption granted by shareholders in general 
meeting (see Resolutions 13 and 14 and the notes thereto).  
Authority to allot shares 
13. That the Directors be generally and unconditionally authorised  
in accordance with Section 80 of the Companies Act 1985 to 
exercise all the powers of the Company to allot relevant 
securities (as defined in that section) up to an aggregate nominal 
amount of £7,831,934 during the period expiring on the date  
of the next Annual General Meeting of the Company or on  
29 September 2008, whichever is earlier, but so that this 
authority shall allow the Company to make offers or agreements 
before the expiry of this authority which would or might require 
relevant securities to be allotted after such expiry.  
Note: The authority sought by this resolution is for the Directors  
to be authorised to allot Shares comprising up to 15% of the 
Company’s issued share capital on the date of this document and to 
dispose of treasury shares. This is similar to the authority granted at 
the last Annual General Meeting, which expires at the conclusion of 
this year’s meeting and is within guidelines issued by institutional 
investors. The Company does not currently hold any treasury 
shares, as defined in Section 162A(3) of the Act. This authority  
will expire at the next Annual General Meeting or on 29 September 
2008, whichever is earlier. 
Whilst the Directors have no intention at the present time of issuing 
relevant securities, other than pursuant to existing rights under 
employee share schemes, they are seeking annual renewal of  
this authority in accordance with best practice and to ensure the 
Company has maximum flexibility in managing its capital resources. 
Authority to disapply pre-emption rights 
14. That, subject to the passing of Resolution number 13 set out 
above, the Directors be and are hereby empowered, pursuant 
to Section 95 of the Companies Act 1985 (“the Act”), to allot 
equity securities (as defined in Section 94 of the Act) as if 
Section 89(1) of the Act did not apply to any such allotment, 
provided that this power shall be limited to the allotment of 
equity securities:  
 (a) during the period expiring on the date of the next Annual 
General Meeting of the Company or, if earlier, on 29 
September 2008, but so that this power shall enable the 
Company to make offers or agreements before the expiry 
of this power which would or might require equity 
securities to be allotted after such expiry; 
 
 (b) up to an aggregate nominal amount of £ 2,610,645; and  
 (c) shall include the power to sell treasury shares under 
Section 162(D) of the Act. 
Note: When shares are to be allotted for cash, section 89(1) of the 
Companies Act 1985 provides that existing shareholders have pre-
emption rights and that any new shares are offered first to such 
shareholders in proportion to their existing shareholdings. This 
resolution is seeking to authorise the Directors to allot Shares of up 
to an aggregate nominal amount of £2,610,645 otherwise than on 
a pro-rata basis. This represents 5% of the Company’s issued share 
capital on the date of this document. 
This is similar to the authority granted at the last Annual General 
Meeting, which expires at the conclusion of this year’s meeting and 
is within guidelines issued by institutional investors. This authority 
will expire at the next Annual General Meeting or on 29 September 
2008, whichever is earlier. 
Whilst the Directors have no intention at the present time of issuing 
equity securities, other than pursuant to existing rights under employee 
share schemes, they are seeking annual renewal of this authority  
in accordance with best practice and to ensure the Company has 
maximum flexibility in managing its capital resources. 
Amendments to the Articles of Association 
15. That the Company’s Articles of Association be amended by  
the deletion of the existing Article 95 in its entirety and the 
insertion of a new Article 95 as follows:- 
  ‘95. Section 157 of the Companies Act 2006 shall apply to the 
Company and there shall be no other restrictions on the age  
of Directors.’ 
Note: This change is being proposed to reflect removal of the 70 
year age limit by the Companies Act 2006 and implement the  
new lower 16 year age limit. 
16. That the Company’s Articles of Association be amended by the 
deletion of the existing Article 143 (A) in its entirety and the 
insertion of a new Article 143 (A) as follows:- 
  ‘143 (A) Subject to these Articles:- 
(i) Anything sent or supplied by or to the Company under these 
Articles (including but not limited to any notice, share certificate  
or other document) may be sent or supplied in any way in which 
the Companies Act 2006 provides for documents or information to 
be sent or supplied by or to the Company (including by means of  
a website and/or by use of electronic communications), and 
(ii) Any notice or document to be sent or supplied to a Director in 
connection with the taking of decisions by Directors may also be 
sent or supplied by the means by which that Director has asked  
to be sent or supplied with such notices or documents for the time 
being (including the use of electronic communications). 
(iii) A Director may agree with the Company that notices or 
documents sent to that Director in a particular way are to be 
deemed to have been received within a specified time of their 
being sent. 
(iv) Any notice or document served on or delivered to any member 
by the Company either personally or by post, shall be addressed to 
such member at his registered address or, if he has no registered 
address in the United Kingdom, the address in the United Kingdom 
provided by the member for such purposes. 
ATRIUM UNDERWRITING PLC Notice of the Annual General Meeting for 2007 continued
 
74 
Note: This change is being proposed to enable the Company to take 
advantage of enhancements to the use of electronic communication, 
introduced by Schedule 5 to the Companies Act 2006 and the 
Financial Service Authority’s Disclosure and Transparency Rules.  
New Article 143 (A) will make it possible for the Company to use 
electronic communication, in particular the website, as the default 
method of communication with shareholders. This has the potential 
to save paper and reduce production costs for communications.  
Subject to approval of this resolution and having consulted with all 
shareholders individually, the Company will be able to increase use 
of electronic communications with shareholders. Any shareholders 
who wish to continue to receive communications in paper form  
can request to do so at any time. In addition, the Company will 
continue to notify shareholders when certain key information is 
available on the website.’ 
17. That the Company’s Articles of Association be amended by the 
deletion of existing Articles 79 and 80 in their entirety and the 
insertion of new Articles 79 and 80 as follows:- 
‘79. Appointment of a Proxy. 
A proxy shall only be appointed in one of the following manners:- 
(A) A proxy may be appointed in writing in any usual or common 
form or in any other form which the Directors may approve and:- 
 (a) in the case of an individual shall be signed by the appointor 
or his attorney; and 
 (b) in the case of a corporation shall be either given under its 
common seal or signed on its behalf by an attorney or duly 
authorised officer of the corporation. 
The signature on any such appointment need not be witnessed. 
Where an appointment of a proxy is signed on behalf of the 
appointor by an attorney, the letter or power of attorney or a duly 
certified copy thereof must (failing previous registration with the 
Company) be lodged with the appointment of the proxy, failing 
which the appointment may be treated as invalid. 
(B) A proxy may be appointed by electronic communication or  
by any other lawful means from time to time authorised by the 
Directors. Such notification of address may be specified in the 
notice convening the meeting, the form of proxy for the meeting  
or by invitation in an electronic communication sent on behalf of 
the Directors about the meeting. Any means of appointing a proxy 
which is authorised by or under this paragraph shall be subject to 
any terms, limitations, conditions or restrictions that the Directors 
may from time to time prescribe. 
80 Deposit of proxy appointment. 
(A) An appointment of a proxy in relation to a general meeting, or 
any adjournment of it, must be deposited, delivered or received at 
the address or addresses (“proxy notification address”) specified for 
the purpose of receiving proxy appointments relating to that 
meeting, or any adjournment of it 
 (a) in the case of an appointment in writing , in the notice 
convening the meeting or in any document accompanying 
such notice or in any instrument of proxy sent out by the 
Company in relation to the meeting; or 
 (b) in the case of an appointment contained in an electronic 
communication, where an address has been specified for the 
purpose of receiving appointments by electronic communication; 
 (i) in the notice convening the meeting; or 
 (ii) in any instrument of proxy sent out by the Company in 
relation to the meeting; or 
 (iii) in any invitation contained in an electronic communication  
to appoint a proxy issued by the Company in relation to  
the meeting. 
(B) If a proxy appointment is made in relation to a general meeting 
or adjourned meeting, it must be deposited, delivered or received 
to or at the proxy notification address (or if no proxy notification 
address is specified, at the Transfer Office) not less than 48 hours 
before the general meeting or adjourned meeting to which it 
relates or (in the case of a poll taken otherwise than at or on the 
same day as the meeting or adjourned meeting) not less than 24 
hours before the time appointed for the taking of the poll at which 
it is to be used, and in default shall not be treated as valid. The 
appointment shall, unless the contrary is stated thereon, be valid  
as well for any adjournment of the meeting as for the meeting to 
which it relates. An appointment of proxy relating to more than 
one meeting (including any adjournment thereof) having once 
been so deposited, delivered or received for the purposes of  
any meeting shall not require again to be deposited, delivered  
or received for the purposes of any subsequent meeting to  
which it relates.’ 
Note: The purpose of this resolution is to clarify provisions in the 
Company’s articles of association to make clear that, subject to 
authorisation by the Directors, a proxy may be appointed by 
electronic means to an address notified for that purpose.

2	 Summar y	o f	significan t 	ac c oun ting	policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below. 
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
2.1	 Basis	 o f	 pr epar a tion
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for share based payments which are 
measured at value, in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the European Union, 
IFRIC interpretations and the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS for the first time. The 
standards used are those published by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) and endorsed by the EU at the 
time of preparing these statements (June 2008). A summary of the more important accounting policies is set out below.
The Group previously reported its annual consolidated financial statements under UK Generally Accepted Accounting 
Principles (“UK GAAP”). As part of the transition to IFRS, announced on 30 October 2007, InTechnology published the 
restatement of comparative financial information under IFRS for the year ended 31 March 2007 and 31 March 2006. This is 
available in note 27. The disclosures required by IFRS 1 ‘First time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards’ 
concerning the transition from UK GAAP to IFRS are given in note 2.23. The date of transition to IFRS was 1 April 2006.
Accounting estimates and judgements
The Group’s critical accounting policies under IFRS have been set by management with the approval of the Audit Committee. 
The application of these policies requires estimates and assumptions to be made concerning the future and judgements to be 
made on the applicability of policies to particular situations. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are 
based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable 
under the circumstances. Under IFRS an estimate or judgement may be considered critical if it involves matters that are highly 
uncertain, or where different estimation methods could reasonably have been used, or if changes in the estimate that would 
have a material impact on the Group’s results are likely to occur from period to period. The critical judgements required when 
preparing the Group’s accounts are as follows:
Goodwill and fair value of assets acquired – the Group’s goodwill carrying value increased in 2008 following the further 
investment in Mobile Tornado Group as disclosed in note 14. The Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any 
impairment and the Group’s goodwill value has been supported by detailed value-in-use calculations relating to the 
recoverable amounts of the underlying cash generating units. These calculations require the use of estimates, however as 
recoverable amounts significantly exceed carrying values, including goodwill, there is no impairment within a range of 
assumptions. InTechnology plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008
34
New IFRS standards, amendments and interpretations effective in 2008
The IASB and IFRIC have issued additional standards which are effective for this accounting period. The following standards 
and interpretations have been adopted by the Group:
(i) IFRS 7 (Financial Instruments: Disclosures) and amendment to IAS 1 (Presentation of financial statements – Capital 
disclosures) – These standards introduce new disclosures relating to financial instruments. The Group’s accounting 
policies and notes to the financial statements have been expanded to cover the required disclosures.
(ii) IFRIC 8 (Scope of IFRS 2) – This standard requires consideration of transactions involving the issuance of equity 
instruments, where the identifiable consideration received is less than the fair value of the equity instruments issued in 
order to establish whether or not they fall within the scope of IFRS 2. This interpretation was not relevant to the Group 
in 2008.
(iii) IFRIC 10 (Interim financial reporting and impairment) prohibits the impairment losses recognised in an interim 
period on goodwill and investments in equity instruments and in financial assets carried at cost to be reversed at a 
subsequent balance sheet date. This interpretation was not applicable to the Group in 2008.
New IFRS standards and interpretations not applied
The IASB and IFRIC have issued additional standards and interpretations which are effective for periods starting after the 
date of these financial statements. The following standards and interpretations have yet to be adopted by the Group:
(i) IFRS 8 (Operating Segments) – This standard will be applicable in 2009 and replaces IAS 14, aligning segment 
reporting with the requirements of the US standard SFAS 131, ‘Disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related 
information’. The new standard requires a ‘management approach’, under which segment information is presented on 
the same basis as that used for internal reporting purposes. The Group will apply IFRS 8 from 1 April 2009 but it is not 
expected to have any impact on the Group accounts.
(ii) IAS 23 (Amendment), (Borrowing Costs) – This amendment to the standard is still subject to European Union 
endorsement but will be applicable to the Group in 2009. It requires an entity to capitalise borrowing costs directly 
attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset (one that takes a substantial period of 
time to get ready for use or sale) as part of the cost of that asset. The option of immediately expensing these borrowing 
costs will be removed. The Group will apply IAS 23 (Amended) from 1 April 2009, subject to endorsement by the EU, but 
the standard is currently not applicable to the Group as there are no qualifying assets.
(iii) IFRIC 11 (IFRS 2 – Group and treasury share transactions) – IFRIC 11 provides guidance on whether share-based 
transactions involving treasury shares or involving group entities (for example, options over a parent’s shares) should be 
accounted for as equity-settled or cash-settled share-based payment transactions in the stand-alone accounts of the 
parent and Group companies. The Group will apply IFRIC 11 from 1 April 2009, but it is not expected to have any impact 
on the Group accounts.
Interpretations of existing standards that are not yet effective and not relevant for the Group’s operations
The following interpretations to existing standards have been published and are mandatory for the Group’s accounting 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2008 or later periods but are not relevant for the Group’s operations:
(i) IFRIC 12 (Service concession arrangements) - IFRIC 12 is effective from 1 January 2008 and applies to contractual 
arrangements whereby a private sector operator participates in the development, financing, operation and maintenance 
of infrastructure for public sector services. IFRIC 12 is not relevant to the Group’s operations as none of the Group’s 
companies provide for public sector services.
(ii) IFRIC 13 (Customer loyalty programmes) - IFRIC 13 clarifies that where goods or services are sold together with 
a customer loyalty incentive (for example, loyalty points or free products), the arrangement is a multiple-element 
arrangement and the consideration receivable from the customer is allocated between the components of the 
arrangement using fair values. IFRIC 13 is not relevant to the Group’s operations as none of the Group’s companies 
operate any loyalty programmes. The standard is effective from 1 July 2008.
Notes to the financial statements continued InTechnology plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008
35
(iii) IFRIC 14 (IAS 19 – The limit on a defined benefit asset, minimum funding requirements and their interaction) – This 
interpretation provides guidance on assessing the limit in IAS 19 on the amount of surplus that can be recognised as an 
asset. It also explains how the pension asset or liability may be affected by a statutory or contractual minimum funding 
requirement. IFRIC 14 is not relevant to the Group’s operations because it does not have any defined benefit pension schemes.
2.2	 Gr oup	ac c oun ts
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to 
govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing control, 
potential voting rights that are presently exercisable or convertible are taken into account. The financial statements of 
subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that 
control ceases.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of an 
acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given plus costs directly attributable to the acquisition. Identifiable 
assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their 
fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any minority interest. The excess of the cost of acquisition 
over the Group’s share of identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
Associates
Associated undertakings are those companies in which the Group has a beneficial interest of between 20% and 50% in 
the equity capital and where the Group exercises significant influence over commercial and financial policy decisions. The 
consolidated income statement includes the Group’s share of post-acquisition profits after tax, the consolidated statement 
of recognised income and expense includes the Group’s share of other recognised gains and losses, and the consolidated 
balance sheet includes the Group’s share of the net assets of associated undertakings.
2.3	 In tangible	assets
Goodwill
On the acquisition of a business, fair values are attributed to the net assets acquired. Goodwill arises where the fair value of 
the consideration given for a business exceeds such net assets. Goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised and subject to 
impairment review, both annually and when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is 
allocated to cash generating units for the purpose of this impairment testing. Goodwill arising on acquisitions after 26 January 
2000 and prior to 1 April 2006 was amortised over its estimated useful life; such amortisation ceased on 31 March 2006 due to 
the adoption of IFRS.
Acquired in a business combination
The Group recognises intangible assets acquired as part of business combinations at fair value at the date of acquisition. 
The determination of these fair values is based upon management’s judgement and includes assumptions on the timing 
and amount of future incremental cash flows generated by the assets and the selection of an appropriate cost of capital. 
Furthermore, management must estimate the expected useful lives of intangible assets and charge amortisation on these 
assets accordingly. The useful lives are estimated to be 3 years for EEscape Holdings Limited and 7 years for Mobile Tornado 
Group plc.
Research and development
Research expenditure, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding, 
is charged to income in the year in which it is incurred. Internal development expenditure, whereby research findings are 
applied to a plan for the production of new or substantially improved products or processes, is charged to income in the 
year in which it is incurred unless it meets the recognition criteria of IAS 38 ‘Intangible Assets’. Measurement and other 
uncertainties generally mean that such criteria are not met. Where, however, the recognition criteria are met, intangible 
assets are capitalised and amortised over their useful economic lives from product launch. Intangible assets relating 
to products in development are subject to impairment testing at each balance sheet date or earlier upon indication of 
impairment. Any impairment losses are written off immediately to income. InTechnology plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008
36
Computer software
Acquired computer software licences covering a period of greater than one year are capitalised on the basis of the costs 
incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific software. These costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives of 
three years.
2.4	 R e v enue	r ec ognition
Sales of services and goods
Revenue comprises the fair value for the sale of services and goods, excludes inter-company sales and value-added taxes and 
represents net invoice value less estimated rebates, returns and settlement discounts. Service revenues are recognised over 
the period to which the service relates. Unrecognised service revenue and associated costs of sale are included as deferred 
income and deferred cost respectively in the balance sheet. 
The Group only recognises revenue on the sale of equipment when the goods are received by the customer and when there 
are no unfulfilled obligations that affect the customer’s final acceptance of the equipment.
Interest income
Interest income is recognised on a time-proportion basis using the effective interest method.
2.5	 Segmen tal	r epor ting
A business segment is a group of assets and operations engaged in providing products and services that are subject to risks 
or returns that are different from those of other segments. A geographical segment operates within a particular economic 
environment that is subject to different risks and returns from other economic environments.
2.6	 Emplo y ee	benefits
Pension obligations
The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme for employees and directors. The assets of the scheme are held 
separately from those of the Group. The annual contributions payable are charged to the profit and loss account on an 
accruals basis. The Group provides no other post-retirement benefits to its employees and directors.
2.7	 Shar e	based	pa ymen ts
The fair value of employee share option plans is calculated using the Black-Scholes model. In accordance with IFRS 2 ‘Share-
based Payments’ the resulting cost is charged to the income statement over the vesting period of the options. The value 
of the charge is adjusted to reflect expected and actual levels of options vesting as the Group does not use market-based 
performance criteria.
2.8	 Curr ency	 tr ansla tions
Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which the entity operates (‘the functional currency’). The consolidated financial statements are 
presented in sterling, which is the Company’s functional and presentation currency.
Transactions and balances
Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates ruling at the end of the financial period. Exchange profits or losses 
on trading transactions are included in the Group income statement except when deferred in equity as qualifying cash flow 
hedges and qualifying net investment hedges, which, along with other exchange differences arising from non-trading items 
are dealt with through reserves.
Notes to the financial statements continued InTechnology plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008
37
Group companies
The results and financial position of all the Group entities that have a functional currency different from the presentation 
currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:
(i) assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet;
(ii) income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates (unless this average is not a 
reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income 
and expenses are translated at the dates of the transactions); and
(iii) all resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities, and of 
borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are taken to shareholders’ equity. 
When a foreign operation is sold, such exchange differences are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss 
on sale.
2.9	 T ax a tion
The charge for taxation is based on the profits for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of temporary 
differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and for accounting purposes. Temporary differences arise 
from the inclusion of profits and losses in the accounts in different periods from which they are recognised in tax assessments 
and primarily arise as a result of the difference between tax allowances on property, plant & equipment and the corresponding 
depreciation charge. Full provision is made for the tax effects of these differences using tax rates substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date. No provision is made for unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries where there is no commitment to 
remit such earnings. Similarly, no provision is made for temporary differences relating to investments in subsidiaries since 
realisation of such differences can be controlled and is not probable in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets are 
recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences 
can be utilised.
2.10	 E x c eptional	 items
Exceptional items are non-recurring material items which are outside the normal scope of the Group’s ordinary activities such 
as liabilities and costs arising from a fundamental restructuring of the Group’s operations. Such items are disclosed separately 
within the financial statements.
 2.11	 Pr oper ty , 	 plan t 	 &	 equipmen t
Property, plant & equipment is stated at historical cost less depreciation, with the exception of assets acquired as part of a 
business combination which are recorded at fair value. The Group’s policy is to write off the difference between the cost of all 
property, plant & equipment, except freehold land, and their residual value on a straight line basis over their estimated useful 
lives. Reviews are made annually of the estimated remaining lives and residual values of individual productive assets, taking 
account of commercial and technological obsolescence as well as normal wear and tear, and adjustments are made where 
appropriate. Under this policy it becomes impractical to calculate average asset lives exactly. However, the total lives range 
from approximately 5 to 50 years for buildings and leasehold improvements, and 2 to 10 years for plant and equipment. All 
individual assets are reviewed for impairment when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable. By far 
the bulk of the Group’s ‘plant and equipment’ asset class relates to the value of plant and equipment at the Group’s data 
centres, consequently the Group does not seek to analyse out of this class other items such as motor vehicles. InTechnology plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008
38
2.12 Impairmen t 	 o f	 non-financial	 assets
The Group assesses at each year end whether an asset may be impaired. If any evidence exists of impairment, the estimated 
recoverable amount is compared to the carrying value of the asset and an impairment loss is recognised where appropriate. 
Recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In addition to this, goodwill is tested 
for impairment at least annually.
2.13 Non- curr en t 	 assets	 held	 f or	 sale	 and	 disc on tinued	 oper a tions
Non-current assets are classified as assets held for sale and stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to 
sell if their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. A 
discontinued operation is a component of the Group’s business that represents a separate major line of business or 
geographical area of operations. Classification as a discontinued operation occurs upon disposal or when the operation meets 
the criteria to be classified as held for sale.
2.14 L eases
Assets acquired under finance leases are included in the balance sheet under property, plant & equipment at an amount 
reflecting the fair value of the asset and are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their estimated useful lives. The 
capital element of future lease rentals is included in creditors. Finance charges are allocated to the income statement each year in 
proportion to the capital element outstanding. The cost of operating leases is charged to the income statement as incurred.
2.15 F inancial	 risk	 f ac t ors
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: currency risk, interest-rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. The 
Group’s overall risk management strategy is approved by the Board and implemented and reviewed by the Executive 
Operating Board. Detailed financial risk management is then delegated to the Group Finance department which has a specific 
policy to manage financial risk. Regular reports are received to enable prompt identification of financial risks so that 
appropriate action may be taken.
Currency risk
The Group purchases internationally but has minimal exposure to currency risk arising from various currency exposures, 
primarily with respect to the US Dollar and the Euro. Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, 
recognised assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations. The Group uses foreign currency bank balances to 
manage its foreign exchange risk arising from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities. The Group has 
certain investments in foreign operations, whose net assets are exposed to foreign currency translation risk.
For 2008, had the Group’s basket of reporting currencies been 10% weaker/stronger against Sterling than the actual rates 
experienced, post-tax profit for the year would have been £0.1m (2007: £2.1m) lower/higher than reported and equity would 
have been £nil (2007: £nil) lower/higher.
Interest rate risk
The Group has both interest bearing assets and liabilities. All borrowings are fixed rate.
Had interest rates moved by 10 basis points, post tax profits would have moved by £11,000 (2007: £13,000).
Liquidity risk
The Group actively maintains a mixture of long-term and short-term committed facilities designed to ensure the Group has 
sufficient funds available for operations and planned investments.
On a regular basis, management monitors forecasts of the Group’s cash flows against both internal targets and those targets 
imposed by external lenders. As shown in note 18, the Group has substantial committed, unused facilities and the directors are 
confident this situation will remain the case for the foreseeable future.
Credit risk
The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk. It has policies in place to ensure that sales of products and 
services are made to customers with an appropriate credit history. Cash transactions are limited to high-credit quality 
financial institutions.
Notes to the financial statements continued InTechnology plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008
39
2.16	 C apital	risk	manag emen t
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order 
to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, as well as maintaining an optimal capital structure 
to reduce overall cost of capital.
In order to maintain this optimal structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid, issue new shares, return 
capital to shareholders or dispose of assets to reduce net debt.
2.17	 Borr o wings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Any difference between the proceeds (net 
of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings 
using the effective interest method. Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional 
right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
2.18 In v en t ories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable amount on a first in first out basis. Net realisable amount is 
the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less any applicable variable selling costs. Provision is made for 
obsolete, slow moving and defective inventory where appropriate. Profits arising on intra Group sales are eliminated in so far 
as the product remains in Group inventory at the year end.
2.19	 T r ade	and	other	r ec eiv ables
Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the 
effective interest method, less impairment losses.
2.20	 T r ade	and	other	pa y ables
Trade and other payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method.
2.21 	 C ash	and	cash	equiv alen ts
Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash balances and short term deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand 
and form an integral part of the Group’s cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for 
the purpose of the cash flow statement.
2.22	 In v estmen ts
Investments in quoted securities are stated at fair value, being the appropriate quoted market value, with movements in the 
fair value passing through the income statement. Investments in unquoted securities are carried at fair value unless such 
value cannot be reliably measured, in which case the investments are carried at cost. Investments are subject to impairment 
testing at each balance sheet date or earlier upon indication of impairment.
2.23	 I FR S	 tr ansitional	 arr ang emen ts
When preparing the Group’s IFRS balance sheet at 1 April 2006, the date of transition, the following optional exemptions, 
provided by IFRS 1 ‘First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards’ from full retrospective application of 
IFRS accounting policies, have been adopted:
(i) Investments in subsidiary and associate
The provisions of IFRS 3 ‘Business combinations’ have been applied from 1 April 2006. The net carrying value of goodwill at 
31 March 2006 under the previous accounting policies has been deemed to be the cost at 1 April 2006.
 (ii) Estimates
Where estimates had previously been made under UK GAAP , consistent estimates (after adjustments to reflect any 
difference in accounting policies) have been made for the same date on transition to IFRS (i.e. judgements affecting the 
Group’s opening balance sheet have not been revisited for the benefit of hindsight). InTechnology plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008

3	 Segmen tal	 analy sis
The Group is organised into two distinct business segments: MDS (data services) and MVS (voice services). As the Group only 
trades in the United Kingdom there is no geographical segmental reporting.
EEscape Holdings Limited and its subsidiaries, voice businesses, were acquired in January 2007 and in June 2007 the businesses 
were hived up to InTechnology and became the MVS division. Following the hive up certain support services were merged 
including the trade debtor and creditor accounting ledgers so it is not possible to accurately report assets and liabilities as 
required under IAS 14.

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
For diluted earnings per share the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all 
potentially dilutive ordinary shares.
Additional earnings per share measures are included above to give a better indication of the Group’s underlying performance.
11	 In tangible	 assets
Opening goodwill at 1 April 2006 arose on the Group’s acquisition of the trading assets of HOLF Technologies Limited and 
VData Limited in 2000, Allasso UK Limited in 2003 and NetConnect Training in 2004.
The goodwill arising during 2007 resulted from the acquisition of EEscape Holdings Limited and an investment in Mobile 
Tornado Group plc.
Goodwill is tested at each year end for impairment with reference to the Group’s recoverable amount compared to the Group’s 
carrying value including goodwill. The recoverable amount is based on value in use calculations using pre-tax discounted cash 
flow projections based on the Group’s strategic plan for the first five years and a growth rate thereafter of 2%.
The cash flows have been discounted using the Group’s weighted average cost of capital, which for these purposes has been 
calculated to be approximately 12.6% before tax.
The key assumptions underpinning the strategic plan employed in the value in use calculation are that market share will not 
change significantly and that gross and operating margins will remain broadly constant.

Investments in Group undertakings are stated at cost. As permitted by section 133 of the Companies Act 1985, where the relief 
afforded under section 131 of the Companies Act 1985 applies, cost is the aggregate of the nominal value of the relevant number of 
the Company’s shares and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the share capital of the subsidiary 
undertakings. The directors consider that to give full particulars of all subsidiary undertakings would lead to a statement of 
excessive length. A list of principal subsidiary undertakings and associates is given below. 
Details of the principal investments at 31 March 2008 in which the Group or Company holds more than 20% of the nominal 
value of ordinary share capital are as follows:

The main financial risks faced by the Group include interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign currency risk. The Board reviews 
and agrees policies for managing each of these risks.
The Group’s financial instruments comprise cash, liquid resources and various items, such as debtors and creditors that arise 
directly from its operations. It is, and has been throughout the year under review, the Group’s policy that no trading in financial 
instruments shall be undertaken. The year end position reflects these policies and there have been no changes in policies or 
risks since the year end.
Financial asset returns are maximised by ongoing review of the Group’s cash flow requirements. Any funds surplus to short-
term working capital requirements are placed on interest bearing deposit. InTechnology plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008

Liquidity risk is further managed by agreeing separate borrowing facilities for any additional working capital and investment 
requirements. In accordance with this policy, the Group has negotiated a 5 year term loan of £2.6m and a 3 year revolving credit 
facility of £2.5m (2007: invoice discounting facility of £1,750,000), of which £nil (2007: £1,181,000) was used as at 31 March 2008.

Fair value is the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arm’s length transaction between informed 
and willing parties, other than by a forced or liquidation sale, and excludes accrued interest. The fair values of financial assets 
and liabilities as at 31 March 2008 approximate to the book value at those dates based on comparison with similar instruments 
available from alternative providers.

The Group seeks to mitigate the effects of the currency exposures arising from its net investments overseas by borrowing as 
far as possible in the same currencies as the operating currencies of its main operating units. Gains and losses arising on net 
investments overseas and the financial instruments used to hedge the currency exposures are recognised in the statement of 
total recognised gains and losses.
The table below shows the extent to which group companies have monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other 
than their local currency. Foreign exchange differences on translation of earnings are taken to the profit and loss account 
of the Group.

Options are granted with a fixed exercise price equal to the market price of the shares under option at the date of grant. The 
contractual life of an option is 10 years. Options granted will become exercisable on the third anniversary of the date of grant. 
Exercise of an option is subject to continued employment. Options were valued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. 
No performance conditions were included in the fair value calculations. The fair value per option granted and the assumptions 
used in the calculations are as follows:

The goodwill is supported principally by the cost saving synergies arising as a result of bringing EEscape within InTechnology’s 
existing structure. Other factors supporting the goodwill include (i) the acquisition of a skilled workforce, and (ii) the fact that 
EEscape’s product portfolio complements InTechnology’s existing product offering.

27	 T r ansition	 t o	 In terna tional	 F inancial	 R epor ting	 Standar ds
This is the first year the Group and Company have presented their financial statements under IFRS. The following disclosures 
are required in the year of transition. The last financial statements under UK GAAP were for the year ended 31 March 2006 and 
the date of transition to IFRS was therefore 1 April 2006.
Reclassifications
• Under UK GAAP excess depreciation on the revalued freehold land and buildings was set off against a revaluation reserve. 
Under IFRS 1 the Group has elected to use the revalued amounts as the deemed cost of these assets and the balance on the 
revaluation reserve is transferred to retained earnings.
• Deferred tax has been reanalysed as a non-current asset.
• All amounts owed by/to Group undertakings have been reanalysed as non-current assets/liabilities.
• In accordance with IFRS 5 “Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations” the results of the disposed 
Distribution businesses and the loss on sale have been disclosed on a single line at the bottom of the income statement.
IAS 12 “Current Taxes”
There are a number of differences in the way that deferred tax is calculated under IFRS compared to UK GAAP . This has given 
rise to the adjustments as detailed below:
(i) Revaluation of property
Under UK GAAP no deferred tax was recognised when the freehold land and buildings were revalued. IFRS requires that 
deferred tax is recognised upon revaluation, accordingly deferred tax of £120,000 has been recognised in the revaluation 
reserve at 1 April 2006.
(ii) Share options
Under UK GAAP deferred tax is recognised on the charge for share based payments in the profit and loss account. Under IFRS 
deferred tax is calculated on the best estimate of the potential tax deduction available in the future. Accordingly deferred tax 
on share options has been recalculated under IFRS as follows:

(iii) Other adjustments
Adjustments have also arisen on deferred tax relating to capital allowances, giving rise to the following adjustments which 
have resulted in an increase in the deferred tax held on the balance sheet:

Adjustmen t 	 338 298
IFRS 3 “Business Combinations” and IAS 38 “Intangible Assets”
IFRS 3 deals with accounting for business combinations including goodwill and intangible fixed assets.
Under UK GAAP , the Group adopted FRS 10 “Goodwill and intangible assets” from 26 January 2000 and goodwill arising on 
acquisitions after this date was capitalised and amortised over its useful economic life, which was presumed to be twenty 
years. In addition, the Group tested for impairment when there was an indication that the carrying value of an asset might be 
impaired.
Under IAS 38 this policy has been replaced by impairment tests performed annually or whenever there is an indication that the 
carrying value of an asset might be impaired. Goodwill is no longer amortised.
At the transition date, the Group had goodwill assets with a net book value of £65,104,000, which under the transitional 
arrangements laid down in IFRS 1 was deemed to be the costs carried forward for these assets from that date. £32,431,000 was 
disposed of in 2007 with the Distribution division.
During the year ended 31 March 2007, under UK GAAP , a goodwill amortisation charge of £2,280,000 was booked for 
continuing operations, which has been credited back to the income statement under IFRS.
During the year ended 31 March 2007 the Group completed the acquisition of EEscape Holdings Limited on 9 January 2007 and 
also made an investment in Mobile Tornado Group plc on 23 October 2006. The accounting treatment of these transactions 
has therefore been reviewed in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 3. As a result of this review, intangible assets totalling 
£1,795,000 have been separately identified and goodwill previously recognised under UK GAAP has been reduced by the 
corresponding net amount. The newly identified intangible assets are being amortised over three years for EEscape Holdings 
Limited and seven years for Mobile Tornado Group plc, resulting in a charge to the income statement of £88,000 for the year 
ended 31 March 2007.
Adjustments
Adjustments have been made to the opening balance sheet under UK GAAP in relation to errors in accounting for share based 
payments and elimination of balances with dormant group companies. The effect of this is shown in the adjustments column.
IAS 7 “Cash Flow Statements”
The adoption of IFRS does not affect the Group’s underlying cash flows, however the presentation of the cash flow statement is 
somewhat different from that required under UK GAAP .
Reconciliations between IFRS and UK GAAP
The following reconciliations provide a quantification of the effect of the transition to IFRS on total equity at the transition 
date, being 1 April 2006, and on total equity and net income at 31 March 2007 as reported in these financial statements. InTechnology plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008

Summar y	o f	 the	principle	f ea tur es	
o f	 the	InT echnolog y	plc	Equity	
P ar ticipa tion	Plan	(the	 “EPP ”)
In tr oduc tion
1 A summary of the main features of 
the EPP is set out below, together 
with details of the way in which the 
EPP is intended to operate. The EPP 
will be operated by the Board.
2 The EPP allows selected participants 
to subscribe for shares on ‘nil-paid’ 
terms. Participants will be required to 
pay the full, unrestricted market 
value of the shares at the date of 
acquisition when a call is made for 
those amounts by the Company. 
3 The participants will have full legal 
and beneficial ownership of the 
shares from the subscription date. 
4 The EPP has been established as an 
‘employee share scheme’ for the 
purposes of the Companies Act 1985.
Emplo y ee	 eligibility
5 The Board will offer Directors and 
senior employees of the Company 
the opportunity to acquire ordinary 
shares in InTechnology plc under the 
terms of the EPP on a discretionary 
basis.
P ar ticipa tion	 limits
6 There are no individual participation 
limits under the EPP apart from the 
overall limits set out in paragraphs 7 
and 8 below.
Shar eholder	 dilution
7 The EPP rules contain limits on the 
number of new shares to be issued 
under the EPP . These limits apply to 
both awards under the EPP and all 
other employee share schemes 
operated by the Company. Awards 
which have lapsed or been renounced 
will be disregarded.
8 The rules of the EPP provide that no 
more than 15% of the issued ordinary 
share capital of the Company, from 
time to time, should be issued under 
all incentive schemes operated by the 
Company.
Making	 o f	 a w ar ds
9 An award will be personal to the 
participant and not transferable.
10 No awards can be made under the 
EPP more than 10 years after 
adoption date.
P er f ormanc e	 tar g ets
11 The Board may, if they decide, apply 
performance conditions to the grant 
of awards under the EPP . To the 
extent that any performance 
conditions are not satisfied, 
participants will be required to 
forfeit their EPP shares.
Acquisition	 pric e
12 The acquisition price shall be 
determined by the Board and will be 
payable when the Company calls for 
the acquisition price from the 
participants. To the extent that HM 
Revenue & Customs determine that 
the unrestricted market value of the 
shares is greater than the acquisition 
price determined by the Board, the 
acquisition price shall be amended 
such that the participant is liable to 
pay unrestricted market value for 
the shares when the Company 
makes a call.
In terim	 P eriod
13 The Interim Period runs from the 
date of subscription for the shares 
until all of the following conditions 
have been satisfied:
 (i) the acquisition price has been 
paid in full;
 (ii) the third anniversary of the 
subscription date has passed, or the 
participant has  ceased employment 
with the Company; and
 (iii) any performance conditions 
attached to the award of shares has 
been satisfied.
14 During the Interim Period:
 (i) the participant appoints the 
Company as its attorney in relation 
to the shares;
 (ii) the participant is not entitled to 
any dividends, nor are they entitled 
to vote on their shares; and
 (iii) the participant agrees not to 
create any encumbrance over the 
shares or to transfer them.
P a ymen t 	 o f	 the	 call	 amoun ts
15 The Company will call for the 
Subscription Amounts no later than 
the fifth anniversary of the 
subscription date, but may call 
sooner in certain circumstances 
(such as cessation of employment in 
certain circumstances, or on a sale of 
the Company).
16 The participant may request that the 
Company calls for the call amount at 
any time after the third anniversary 
of the subscription date, or on 
becoming a leaver if earlier.
17 The participant may not request 
that the Company calls for the call 
amounts before the third

18 If participants cease employment as 
a good leaver (which includes but is 
not limited to cessation of 
employment by reason of injury, 
disability, redundancy, retirement or 
death) then they will be able to 
request that the Company makes a 
call for the call amounts in the six 
months following cessation of 
employment. If they do not make 
such a request then the Company 
would call for the call amounts on 
the normal due dates. InTechnology plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008
79
19 If a good leaver does make a request 
for the Company to make a call 
within the required period and the 
Company makes a call for the call 
amounts then they may sell their 
shares for the higher of acquisition 
price and market value on cessation.
20 If a participant in the EPP ceases 
employment for a reason where they 
are not a ‘good leaver’ they will be 
required to pay up any call amounts 
immediately and their shares must 
be sold back as directed by the 
Company for the lower of cost or 
market value.
T ax	 tr ea tmen t 	 o f	 the	 EPP
21 As participants are being required 
to pay unrestricted market value for 
their shares (and will complete 
section 431 ‘restricted security’ 
elections as a term of the 
acquisition of their shares) any 
future growth in value will be 
subject to capital gains tax. No 
charge to income tax will arise in 
relation to the acquisition of shares.
22 The acquisition of shares on ‘nil paid’ 
terms may give rise to a benefit in 
kind for any participants who are not 
involved in the ‘actual management 
and conduct’ of the Company. This 
benefit will equate to 6.25% of the 
call amount and is subject to income 
tax at the participant’s marginal 
rate. In addition the Company will 
pay Class 1A national insurance 
contributions (“NIC”) on this benefit.
23 For participants who satisfy HMRC 
requirements and are involved in the 
actual management and conduct of 
the company no benefit in kind will 
arise for so long as the Company is 
close for tax purposes.
24 The Company has agreed to pay 
participants a cash bonus such that 
any ‘carrying cost’ of the EPP is 
neutral for all participants.
25 Good leavers are allowed to sell their 
shares within 6 months of ceasing 
employment for the higher of the 
acquisition price and market value to 
put them in a similar position to that 
which they would be in if they held a 
share option. T o the extent that the 
price they receive is in excess of the 
market value of the shares at that 
time a charge to PAYE and NIC (both 
employer’s and employees’) will arise.
P ensionability
26 Awards under the EPP will not be 
pensionable.
Sour c e	 o f	 shar es
27 The EPP provides for the use of newly 
issued shares.
Amendmen ts	 t o	 the	 EPP
28 The EPP is administered by the Board 
and may be amended by the Board. 
29 However, the provisions in the EPP 
relating to the limits on the number 
of new shares which may be issued 
pursuant to the EPP and any other 
Company share scheme will not be 
altered for the benefit of existing or 
future participants without the prior 
approval of the shareholders in 
general meeting. 
30 Additionally, no amendment can be 
made which would adversely affect 
the rights of participants without 
their consent. InTechnology plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008

Appendix 2
Memor andum	 to	shar eholders	–	
Appr o v al	o f	cr edit 	 tr ansac tion	
Na tur e	 o f	 the	 tr ansac tion
It is proposed that a number of 
directors who are participants under 
the InTechnology plc Equity 
Participation Plan (the “EPP”) are to be 
offered the opportunity to subscribe for 
ordinary shares on ‘nil-paid’ terms with 
the call amount equal to the 
unrestricted market value (“UMV”) of 
the shares as agreed with HM Revenue 
& Customs. 
The acquisition of nil-paid shares is a 
‘credit transaction’ as defined in s202 
Companies Act 2006 which in 
accordance with s201 Companies Act 
2006 requires the consent of the 
members.
The call amount will be repaid upon call 
from the Company at any time, 
although it is anticipated that the 
Company will only make a call for the 
call amount on the earlier of:
(i)  immediately before an exit (being a 
share sale, an asset sale or a listing);
(ii)  if there is no exit by the fifth 
anniversary of the date of grant; or
(iii) the participant ceasing to be 
employed by the Company.
V alue	 o f	 cr edit 	 tr ansac tion	 and	 purpose	
f or	 which	 it 	 is	 r equir ed
The amount of the credit transaction 
with the Directors of InT echnology is 
anticipated to be £618,523 (being 
3,638,368 shares at an acquisition price 
of £0.17 per share (being the market 
value of the shares as agreed with HMRC 
on 22 April 2008 for the purposes of 
granting options under the Company’s 
Approved Share Option Plan)). 
However, to the extent that HMRC 
contend that the UMV of the shares is 
greater than £0.17 per share the 
participants will be required to pay that 
greater amount when the Company 
makes a call for the shares.
The purpose of the credit transaction is 
to offer directors the opportunity to 
subscribe for shares under an employee 
share scheme (the EPP). The EPP is being 
introduced in order to incentivise and 
retain key employees and directors.
E xten t 	 o f	 the	 c ompan y’ s	 liability	 under	
an y	 tr ansac tion	 c onnec ted	 with	 the	
cr edit 	 tr ansac tion
The call amount is payable by the 
participants when the Company makes 
a call which will be no later than five 
years from the subscription date. The 
call may be made sooner in certain 
circumstances, such as in the event of a 
change of control of the Company. 81

Notes	 t o	 the	 pr o xy	 f orm:
1	 As a member of the Company you are entitled to appoint a proxy to exercise all or any of your 
rights to attend, speak and vote at a general meeting of the Company. You can only appoint a 
proxy using the procedures set out in these notes and the notes to the Notice of AGM.
2 Submission of a proxy form does not preclude you from attending the meeting and voting 
in person. If you have appointed a proxy and attend the meeting in person, your proxy 
appointment will automatically be terminated.
3	 A proxy does not need to be a member of the Company but must attend the meeting to 
represent you. To appoint as your proxy a person other than the Chairman of the meeting, 
insert their full name in the box. If you sign and return this proxy form with no name inserted 
in the box, the Chairman of the meeting will be deemed to be your proxy. Where you appoint 
as your proxy someone other than the Chairman, you are responsible for ensuring that they 
attend the meeting and are aware of your voting intentions. If you wish your proxy to make 
any comments on your behalf, you will need to appoint someone other than the Chairman 
and give them the relevant instructions directly.
4	 You may appoint more than one proxy provided each proxy is appointed to exercise rights 
attached to different shares. You may not appoint more than one proxy to exercise rights 
attached to any one share. To appoint more than one proxy, please contact Capita Registrars 
at Proxy Department, The Registry, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent, BR3 4TU.
5	 To direct your proxy how to vote on the resolutions mark the appropriate box with an ‘X’. If 
no voting indication is given, your proxy will vote or abstain from voting at his or her discretion. 
Your proxy will vote (or abstain from voting) as he or she thinks fit in relation to any other 
matter which is put before the meeting.
6 To appoint a proxy using this form, the form must be: 
• completed and signed;
• sent or delivered to Capita Registrars at Proxy Department, The Registry, 34 Beckenham 
 Road, Beckenham, Kent, BR3 4TU; and
• received by Capita Registrars by no later than 14 July 2008 at 3pm.
7 	 In the case of a member which is a company, this form of proxy must be executed under its 
common seal or signed on its behalf by an officer of the company or an attorney for the 
company.
8	 Any power of attorney or any other authority under which this proxy form is signed (or a 
duly certified copy of such power or authority) must be included with the proxy form.
9	 In the case of joint holders, where more than one of the joint holders purports to appoint a 
proxy, only the appointment submitted by the most senior holder will be accepted. Seniority 
is determined by the order in which the names of the joint holders appear in the Company’s 
register of members in respect of the joint holding (the first-named being the most senior).
10 If you submit more than one valid proxy appointment, the appointment received last 
before the latest time for the receipt of proxies will take precedence.
11	 For details of how to change your proxy instructions or revoke your proxy appointment see 
the notes to the Notice of AGM.

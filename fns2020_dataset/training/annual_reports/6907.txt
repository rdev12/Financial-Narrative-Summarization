02 GSH Group Annual Report and Accounts 2003
Our Offer
GSH is a leading provider of facilities management services
in the UK. The Group operates from a network of offices
across Great Britain and Ireland and undertakes every
aspect of facilities management, tailoring contracts to
clients’ individual requirements. GSH also has a presence 
in the United States and Continental Europe.
The Group advises clients in a range of sectors, including
banking, industrial, retail, media, telecomms and 
manufacturing as well as governmental. Our contracts are
scaleable and we also offer existing customers an innovative
energy management service, which provides guaranteed 
savings on energy expenditure. 
Our expertise is based on substantial experience and 
knowledge of clients’ requirement and we have a well-
established reputation for delivering first class service levels.
The range of services we offer encompasses: 
■ Building Engineering
■ Energy Management
■ Environmental Services
■ Fabric Maintenance
■ Helpdesk
■ Landscaping
■ Security
■ Specialist & General Cleaning
■ Waste Management
Training & Staff Development
We place great importance on staff development and GSH was
one of the first facilities management companies to attain an
Investors in People accreditation. We pay considerable attention
to training at all levels in the Group, from graduate level through
to management, so that employees are able to develop their 
skills in a structured way. We also provide one of the best 
trade apprenticeship training programmes in our industry. 
Our culture fosters professionalism and integrity and we 
were delighted when a recent Investors in People assessment
praised our “innovative programme”.  Our Technology
Over recent years, we have made significant investment in 
our operating systems and have adopted and integrated
new technologies. 
Our clients now benefit from tailored solutions that utilise the
latest information and communication technology. Management
information is held in real-time and can be accessed remotely
via a secure on-line connection. Wireless hand-held devices
enable both our staff and clients to retrieve information and
update files whenever and wherever it is required. 
We believe our powerful combination of exceptional people and
cutting edge technology will continue to ensure that our service
levels remain the highest in our industry. 
Lying at the heart of GSH’s systems is Maximo. Delivered 
over a dedicated and private data network, contract data 
is available to staff, operatives and clients alike.
GSH Group Annual Report and Accounts 2003  03
Vehicle Management 
GSH tracks its fleet of operatives’ vehicles via a Global
Positioning System (GPS). This enables our helpdesk to rapidly
locate engineers by skill and proximity to a work request. As
well as speeding up our response times, we can also provide
clients with estimated times of arrival and other key benefits.
With effective logistics management, our vehicle tracking
capability also means that we can reduce our own operational
costs. All in all, this makes the GSH mobile fleet more efficient
and more cost effective.
2003: Award for Information and 
Communications Technology The Group has made excellent progress during the year and 
I am pleased to be able to report another strong set of results.
Results
For the year ended 31 July 2003, operating profit rose by 18% 
to £2.96m (2002: £2.50m) and profit before tax by 20% to
£2.87m (2002: £2.38m), maintaining our record of consistently
high profit growth. While turnover increased by 6% to £86.13m
(2002: £80.98m), this increase does not reflect the Group’s
underlying rate of growth, since we withdrew from a number 
of contracts over the period. This streamlining of our portfolio
followed a review of our contract base to ensure that all contracts
generate an acceptable level of return. GSH’s underlying rate of
growth was significant, with a total of £100.6m of new business
secured during the year. At the year end, our order book stood at
approximately £435m.
During the twelve months, pre-tax margin strengthened to 3.3%,
compared to 2.9% for the previous year. Our cash position
remains very healthy, with net cash balances at £3.8m at the 
year end. 
Operations
The year has seen the Group take some significant steps forward.
We have secured a number of important new contract wins and
customer retention remains very high. Reflecting the success we
have achieved in both expanding the scope of our contracts and
extending average contract terms, we have reorganised the way 
in which we support major clients. All major clients are now
managed by dedicated Key Account Directors. This enables us 
to provide superior service levels and sets the basis for a closer
working partnership. 
We have continued to add to the range of services we offer 
our clients. Our energyplus business, introduced two years ago,
continues to grow strongly. From a standing start, the business
which enables our clients to take advantage of significant cost
savings on their energy expenditure with no loss in efficiency, 
now represents a meaningful proportion of Group turnover. 
The service has potential for our entire customer base and 
we therefore expect its growth rate over the next few years 
to remain high. We have therefore decided to manage energyplus
separately with representation at Group level. The benefits of our
investment in new IT systems in 2001/02 and new IT initiatives
over the year have been very much in evidence. Our systems not
only provide us with the most up-to-date information in real time
but also enable our clients to access management information via
our in-house developed portal. We firmly believe our emphasis on
using the latest information and communication technology helps
to underpin our high service standards as well as ensure that we
operate with maximum efficiency as a Group. We view staff
training and product innovation in the same light and these will
remain cornerstones of our growth plans. 
The Future 
The Group’s history goes back to 1895 when my grandfather
started the business. Now, over 100 years later, I am proud to be
able to say that GSH has established itself as a leading provider of
facilities management services in the UK, providing consistently
superior service levels. Our client base today, which includes many
leading blue chip companies, such as Land Securities Trillium,
Hewlett Packard and HBOS, reflects our increasing success. It is
also pleasing to note that our growth to date has been achieved
organically.
The Group’s prospects remain very encouraging. Outstanding bids
at present total in excess of £300m and we are ahead of targeted
revenue growth for 2004. In particular, energyplus represents an
exciting new income stream and we expect it to continue to grow
vigorously. This, together with our record of success in winning
new bids and the highly visible nature of our earnings, gives me
great confidence of reporting another year of excellent progress. 
Finally, I would like to thank all our staff for their energy and
commitment over the year. GSH’s continuing success is based 
on their hard work and contribution. 
Ian Scarr-Hall
Chairman
Chairman’s Statement
“The Group has made excellent progress during the year, 
with profit before tax rising by 20%. ”
04 GSH Group Annual Report and Accounts 2003
2003 Achievements
■ Excellent organic growth.
■ Profit before tax up by 20% to £2.9m.
■ Record level of new business secured over year.
■ Very healthy order book at £435m at 31 July 2003.
■ Prospects remain very encouraging. Introduction
The year to 31 July 2003 saw continuing strong organic growth
across all our markets and our excellent results maintain our
track record of double-digit profit growth. Over the period, we
secured 319 new contracts, worth approximately £100.6m in
total and maintaining our target of winning one in three new
bids. The total number of contracts the Group now manages
stands at 1,731. 
Significant new contract wins include, Hewlett-Packard, Diageo,
Hilton Hotels and the Office of Public Works in Ireland which
covers 7million sq ft of government buildings.
Our success in the management of clients’ complex service
requirements is reflected in our high level of contract retentions
and extensions. HBOS has extended its partnership with us to
the end of 2006. We now manage over 2million sq ft of HBOS
properties in England, Wales and Ireland. Our contract with T-
Mobile has been expanded to incorporate all of T-Mobile’s base
stations in over 6,000 locations. Marks & Spencer has expanded
our portfolio to include the North West region in addition to the
Midlands, Wales, Scotland and Ireland, taking the total number
of stores that we manage to over 190. Our work with Land
Securities Trillium for the Department for Work and Pensions
has been highly successful and reflecting this, our contract has
been extended to a new term of 14 years. 
Business Development
Our focus remains on enhancing our service offering and 
its delivery and, during the year, we introduced a number 
of important new initiatives in both these areas. 
Reorganisation
An important operational change this year was the roll out of
Dedicated Client Teams across all our major contracts. These
Teams, headed by Key Account Directors, complement our
existing service network. Each Team operates with a high
degree of autonomy and is well positioned to manage contracts
on any scale, national or international. Most importantly, this
approach promotes a closer working relationship with our major
clients and feedback has been very positive indeed. Clients who
now benefit from this new approach include British Airways
Avionic Engineering, Merrill Lynch and Tesco.
New Services
The year saw us continue to make very good progress in further
enhancing the range of services we offer. While we continue to
use sub-contractors to deliver certain services, we now provide 
a wider range of services as principal, allowing for margin
improvement. Reviewing our progress over the year, it has been
encouraging to see that a significant portion of our growth has
been as a result of add-ons to existing contracts and I expect 
the increasing breadth of our service offering to support our
success in this area. 
Our energy management service, energyplus, which we
introduced as a branded product two years ago, continued 
to make excellent progress over the period. The service 
enables us to offer clients significant cost savings on their
energy expenditure as well as other benefits. Savings, which 
we can guarantee, are achieved using our expertise in
engineering and property & asset management. Clients benefit
not only from reduced energy costs but also higher service
standards, which invariably exceed recognised ‘best practice’. 
We are very excited by the tremendous growth potential of
energyplus and over the year secured new contracts worth a
total of £4.4m. Our energyplus clients now include Carpetright,
Sheraton Hotels and American International University.
Chief Executive’s Review
“I am excited at the opportunities ahead and confident 
that we will achieve our objectives in the coming year.”
GSH Group Annual Report and Accounts 2003  05
2003 Achievements
■ Significant wins include: Hewlett Packard, HBOS and New Jersey Transit Company.
■ High level of contract extensions, including Marks & Spencer and T -Mobile.
■ Continuing excellent growth of energyplus, our energy management service.
■ Product offering enhanced.
■ Ahead of target revenue growth for 2004. Technology and Staff Training
We have always believed that in order to deliver first class
service levels and ensure a solid platform for continuing
successful growth, it is important to invest in new technology
and staff development.
The new ICT systems implemented over the last financial year
are now yielding real benefits. We have continued with our
programme to enhance functionality and, during the period,
introduced new initiatives. Our data gathering and analysis has
been strengthened, enabling us to mobilise new contracts 
faster and improve asset lifecycle management. Operational
information is now available in real-time and access is more
flexible. Information can be delivered via hand-held computers,
extranets and our global wide area network. This means that, 
at the point of delivery, the most current information is always
to hand. We have also enabled our clients to access
management information via our portal, improving visibility 
of our service delivery. In October 2003, we were delighted 
to appoint Maxwell Segal as Group Technology & Innovations
Director. Maxwell, who joined GSH in 2001 and has over 24
years of IT experience, is now responsible for the design, 
delivery and maintenance of the Group’s ICT strategy. 
As an Investors in People accredited Group, we focus on
training at all levels within the Group. Our fast-track graduate
development programme attracted some excellent candidates
this year and continues to provide the platform of opportunity
for ambitious young professionals. Alongside this, our
management development programme enables our employees
to develop their skills in a structured way, with all the necessary
support and guidance. 
Awards 
In October 2003, we were delighted to win the IMBM British
Building Maintenance Award 2003 for Energy Management.
Our service was commended for its innovation and high levels 
of customer satisfaction. During the period under review, we
also received our ISO 14001 accreditation and the prestigious 
Energy Star Partnership award (a symbol often seen on white
goods). We are one of the first companies in our industry to
receive this recognition.
Prospects
Much has been achieved during the year in all aspects of the
business. I am very pleased with the significant contract wins
we have made, the Group’s level of profitability and the overall
shape of the business. The management team is highly
experienced and our operational and administrative teams
second to none.
With our strong operational delivery, tight financial controls and
importantly, excellent client base, we have a strong platform to
build on going forward.
Our strategy is to continue to establish long-term relationships
with blue chip clients. We will continue to differentiate
ourselves by our innovative use of technology and our
energyplus programme. We remain totally committed to
developing long-term, multi service contracts throughout 
our geographic marketplaces.
I am excited at the opportunities ahead and confident that we
will achieve our objectives in the coming year. With our range 
of product offering and geographical coverage, I believe we are
ideally placed to take full advantage of the expanding facilities
management marketplace.

Chief Executive Officer
Chief Executive’s Review cont.
“I am very pleased with the significant contract wins we have
made, the Group’s level of profitability and the overall shape
of the business.”
06 GSH Group Annual Report and Accounts 2003 As reported in the Chairman’s Statement, the Group continues 
to show healthy financial results, with turnover increasing to
£86.1m. All geographic sectors contributed to this growth.
Tight control of our overheads saw administration costs increase
by less than 1% despite continued investment in our IT
infrastructure as well as in staff training and development. As a
result, the 6% increase in turnover translated into a 20% increase
in profit before tax at £2.9m (2002: £2.4m). 
Our continued emphasis on working capital management and
cash collection has again shown healthy cash inflow from
operations of £3.8m. The Group’s net cash position is £3.8m and,
for the sake of flexibility, bank overdraft facilities are maintained
across the Group.
Treasury management 
The Group funds its ongoing activities through cash generated
from its operations. The cash flow is analysed in detail in Note 
19-21 to the accounts.
The Group finance function is responsible for treasury
management throughout the Group’s operations. The cash flow
dynamics are such that, even with significant growth, there is an
overall inflow of cash. Strong cash collection processes ensure that
this is maintained. It is our policy to pay all suppliers to agreed
credit terms.
The Group’s business does not involve any material cross-border
trade and, accordingly, there is no material exposure to any foreign
currency transaction risk.
Inflation is covered through trade relevant escalation clauses within
contracts or part of specific contract pricing agreements.
Taxation
The Group’s effective tax rate, including deferred taxation, in 2003
was 34%. The variation between this and the UK corporation tax
rate of 30% is explained in Note 6 to the accounts.
Dividends
For the year to 31 July 2003, a total of £0.8m was paid to
shareholders. No dividend was paid in the prior financial year.
Pensions
The Group operates various pension schemes in the operating
Divisions. In terms of employee membership, 94% of the
employees are members of, or eligible to join, money purchase
schemes. The remaining 6% is covered by two defined benefits
schemes. These are included within contractual agreements with
clients and are part of the relevant contract pricing structure. As
such, they hold no material risk to the Group.
Staff and Systems
Our ability to manage complex facilities management contracts is
a key strength of the Group. It is therefore important for me as
Chief Financial Officer to ensure this whole process is underpinned
by an experienced financial team, working within a framework of
tight financial controls, relevant policies and robust systems. 
All the finance and accounting for GB and Ireland is performed 
at our head office in Stoke-on-Trent. For good practice reasons, 
the Finance Directors for Continental Europe and USA have local
structures based in Rotterdam and New Jersey respectively. 
The Group Finance function performs an overall control and
management function as well as supporting the Executive 
Board in achieving its profit and growth plans. 
Our finance systems and controls are strong and integrated 
with operations. Furthermore, our finance staff have energy 
and experience. We are positioned well to play our part in the 
further growth of the Group.

Directors’ Report
The Directors submit their report and the Group financial statements of GSH Group Limited (formerly George S
Hall Limited) for the year ended 31 July 2003.
Principal Activities
The principal activity of the company is that of a holding company providing management services to its
subsidiary companies.
The principal activity of subsidiary undertakings is the provision of facilities management services and 
asset management.
On 15 April 2003 the company changed its name from George S Hall Limited to GSH Group Limited.
Results and Dividends
The Group trading profit for the year, after taxation, was £1,892,000 (2002: £1,104,000).
The Directors do not recommend the payment of a final dividend (2002: £nil) making a total for the year 
of £800,000 (2002: £nil) which leaves a profit of £1,092,000 (2002: £1,104,000) to be retained.
Review of the Business
A review of the business for the year ended 31 July 2003 is included within the Chairman’s Statement on 
page 4, the Chief Executive’s Review on page 5 and the Financial Review on page 7.
Political and Charitable Contributions
The Group made no political contributions during the year. Donations to UK charities amounted to £7,639
(2002: £6,993).
Market Value of Land and Buildings
The Directors are of the opinion that the market value of property at 31 July 2003 would significantly exceed
the net book value included in the financial statements, but they are unable to quantify this excess in the
absence of a professional valuation, the costs of which are not considered justifiable in view of the Group’s
intention to retain ownership of its existing property for use in its business for the foreseeable future.
Employee Involvement
The Group’s policy is to consult and discuss with employees matters likely to affect employees’ interests.
Information on matters of concern to employees is given through information bulletins and reports, which 
seek to achieve a common awareness on the part of all employees of the regular and frequent financial and
economic factors affecting the Group’s performance.
The Group’s policy is to recruit disabled workers for those vacancies that they are able to fill. All necessary
assistance with initial training courses is given. Once employed, a career plan is developed so as to ensure
suitable opportunities for each disabled person. Arrangements are made, wherever possible, for retraining
employees who become disabled to enable them to perform work identified as appropriate to their aptitudes.
Environmental Policy
The Group has been involved in the management, carriage and disposal of both special and non-special waste
for a number of years including waste management, recycling and management. As licensed waste carriers, 
the company provides 24 hour, year round service from experienced and dedicated personnel.
The Group is compliant with BS EN ISO 9001:2000 and ISO 14001 and can offer advice and bespoke reporting
as part of the service; the company can also help clients to achieve ISO 14001. Directors’ Report cont

18 GSH Group Annual Report and Accounts 2003 Directors’ Responsibilities in the Preparation 
of Financial Statements
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true
and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for
that period. In preparing those financial statements, the Directors are required to:
a. select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
b. make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
c. state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures
disclosed and explained in the financial statements;
d. prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the
company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at
any time the financial position of the company and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements
comply with the requirements of the Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for safeguarding the
assets of the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other
irregularities.
GSH Group Annual Report and Accounts 2003 19 Independent Auditors’ Report to the Members of 
GSH Group Limited (Formerly George S Hall Limited)
We have audited the financial statements on pages 21 to 43.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the
Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members
those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest
extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the
company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective Responsibilities of Directors and Auditors 
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with
applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards are set out in the Statement of Directors’
Responsibilities. 
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory
requirements and United Kingdom Auditing Standards. 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the
financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report
to you if, in our opinion, the Directors’ Report is not consistent with the financial statements, if the company
has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we
require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and transactions 
with the company and other members of the Group is not disclosed. 
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report, and consider whether it is consistent with the
audited financial statements. This other information comprises only the Directors’ Report. We consider the
implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with
the financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information. 
Basis of Opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with United Kingdom Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices
Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the
Directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate
to the company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed. 
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered
necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements
are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion
we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements. 
Opinion 
In our opinion the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and the
Group at 31 July 2003 and of the Group profit for the year then ended and have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

26 GSH Group Annual Report and Accounts 2003 Accounting Policies
Basis of Accounting 
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention modified to include the
revaluation of freehold and leasehold properties and in accordance with applicable accounting standards. 
The company has taken advantage of the exemption contained in Financial Reporting Standard 8 and has
therefore not disclosed transactions or balances with entities which form part of the GSH Group Limited Group
(or investees of the Group qualifying as related parties).
Basis of Consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements incorporate those of GSH Group Limited (formerly George S Hall Limited)
and all of its subsidiary undertakings for the year. The difference between the cost of acquisition of shares in
subsidiaries and the fair value of the separable net assets acquired is capitalised and written off on a straight
line basis over its estimated economic life. Provision is made for impairment. All financial statements are made
up to 31 July 2003.
As permitted by Section 230(4) of the Companies Act 1985, the company has not presented its own profit and
loss account.
Purchased Goodwill
Goodwill representing the excess of the purchase price compared with the fair value of net assets acquired is
capitalised and written off evenly over 20 years as in the opinion of the Directors this represents the period
over which the goodwill is effective.
Negative goodwill arising on business combinations in respect of acquisitions since 1 January 1998 is included
within fixed assets and released to the profit and loss account in the period in which the fair values of the 
non-monetary assets purchased on the same acquisition are recovered whether through depreciation or sale.
Intangible Fixed Assets
Intangible fixed assets purchased separately from a business are capitalised at their cost.
Licences capitalised, during the year, are amortised to nil by equal annual instalments over their expected useful
life of 4 years.
Tangible Fixed Assets 
Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets at rates calculated to write each asset down to its
estimated residual value evenly over its expected useful life, as follows: 
Leasehold properties – over the life of the lease
Plant and machinery – 14-25% per annum straight line
Fixtures, fittings and equipment – 20-50% per annum straight line or 15% reducing balance
Motor vehicles – 25% per annum straight line
Investment properties are revalued annually by the Directors on an open market basis. No depreciation is
provided on freehold investment properties or on leasehold investment properties where the unexpired lease
term exceeds 20 years.
Depreciation on freehold buildings is not provided, as any uncharged depreciation for the year and the
accumulated uncharged depreciation would be immaterial in aggregate, as a result of the company’s policy to
maintain the properties in good condition, which substantially prolongs this useful life, and the estimated high
residual values of the properties.
GSH Group Annual Report and Accounts 2003 27 Accounting Policies cont
Tangible Fixed Assets cont
Tangible fixed assets which are not depreciated will be reviewed for impairment annually by the Directors in
accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 11.
Investments
Fixed asset investments are stated at cost. Provision is made for any impairment in the value of fixed asset
investments.
Stocks and Work in Progress 
Stocks and work in progress are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. In determining the cost 
of raw materials, consumables and goods purchased for resale the weighted average purchase price is used.
For work in progress and finished goods, cost is taken as production cost, which includes an appropriate
proportion of attributable overheads.
Provision is made where necessary for obsolete, slow moving stock and for work in progress over 120 days old.
Foreign Currencies 
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the
balance sheet date. Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the
transaction. All differences are taken to the profit and loss account. 
Assets, liabilities and results of overseas subsidiaries are translated at the rate ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising are dealt with through reserves.
Deferred Taxation 
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the
balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a
right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date. Timing differences are differences
between the company’s taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements that arise from the
inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in
the financial statements. 
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing
differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially
enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
Leased Assets and Obligations 
Where assets are financed by leasing agreements that give rights approximating to ownership (“finance
leases”), the assets are treated as if they had been purchased outright. The amount capitalised is the present
value of the minimum lease payments payable during the lease term. The corresponding leasing commitments
are shown as obligations to the lessor. 
Lease payments are treated as consisting of capital and interest elements, and the interest is charged to the
profit and loss account in proportion to the remaining balance outstanding. 
All other leases are “operating leases” and the annual rentals are charged to profit and loss on a straight line
basis over the lease term. 
28 GSH Group Annual Report and Accounts 2003 Accounting Policies cont
Retirement Benefits 
The Group operates a defined contribution scheme. The amount charged to the profit and loss account in
respect of pension costs and other post retirement benefits is the contributions payable in the year. Differences
between contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or
prepayments in the balance sheet.
Employee Share Ownership Plans
The company operates an ESOP trust and has de facto control of the shares held by the trust and bears their
benefits and risks. The company records certain assets and liabilities of the trust as its own. Finance costs and
administrative expenses are charged as they accrue.
Turnover 
Turnover represents the invoiced value, net of Value Added Tax of goods and services provided to customers.
Turnover is derived entirely from the company’s principal activities. Revenue is recognised when substantially all
of the obligations under a sales contract have been fulfilled.
Maintenance contracts are accounted for on a time apportionment basis over the period of the contact.

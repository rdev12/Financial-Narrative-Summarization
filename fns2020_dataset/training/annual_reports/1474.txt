the business
b  developing  
The Group employs specialist staff to identify potential new surface mines and colliery 
spoil tips that contain sufficient reserves of high quality coal for economic extraction. 
Formal planning applications are submitted to replace current coal production with 
new reserves, securing the long term sustainability of the business. ATH Regeneration 
is continuing negotiations to deploy its unique tip washing technology in Australia.
b  producing  
The Group utilises modern plant and equipment to extract coal deposits from surface 
mines and recover coal from spoil tips. Whilst the majority of the coal is utilised in power 
generation, ATH produces significant tonnages for the premium domestic and industrial 
markets, making the Group one of the largest producers of household coal in the UK.
b  restoring  
The Group, working closely with third parties including Local Authorities and 
Environmental Agencies, utilises innovative techniques to minimise its impact on the 
environment. The patent pending ATH Regeneration tip washing technology provides 
an environmental clean up service restoring derelict land to a high specification. 
Surface mines undergo progressive restoration during coal extraction periods and, 
following the completion of mining activities, land is returned to an agreed condition 
and profile.

Surface Mining
The Surface Mining business uses modern hydraulic 
excavating equipment to remove the overlying material and 
coal. The majority of the coal is utilised in power generation 
and is transported by rail through the Group railhead facility 
at Crowbandsgate. High quality household and industrial coals 
are produced to satisfy demand in these important markets. 
The mining methods employed ensure that operations are 
efficient and minimise the impact on the environment. 
Land Regeneration
The legacy of the UK deep coal mining industry is 
redundant land containing mining discard tips that 
represent a financial and environmental liability. 
Landowners, including Local Authorities and Regional 
Development Agencies, want to develop this land for 
a number of uses. ATH Regeneration has over 25 years’ 
experience of dealing with brownfield sites existing as 
a result of coal mining activity. The unique technology 
utilised by the Group provides an efficient and effective 
solution by extracting the coal to leave an environment 
suitable for a number of uses.

Chairman’s statement
The Board was delighted to hear following 
the year end that the Group was successful 
in the appeal against the planning refusal 
at the Langton site. 
BuSiNeSS pRoGReSS
Sales revenue generated by the Mining business was up 18% 
to £77.5 million (2008: £65.7 million) with sales volumes and 
average prices both increasing. This resulted in profit before interest 
and tax in the Mining business increasing by 20% to £11.8 million 
(2008: £9.8 million).
However, ATH Regeneration, as expected, had no production 
in the year (2008: 0.3 million tonnes) following the refusal by 
Derbyshire County Council of the Group’s planning application 
at Langton in Nottinghamshire and the completion of the 
Grimethorpe site in 2008.
This resulted in an overall reduction in Group sales volumes 
of around 10% to 1.8 million tonnes (2008: 2.0 million tonnes) 
and a consequent fall in earnings.
Although the fall in earnings was disappointing, the Board 
was delighted to hear following the year end that the Group 
was successful in the appeal against the planning refusal at 
the Langton site. Plans are well advanced to restart production 
from ATH Regeneration in 2010. 
DeveLopMeNT
The Group has been successful in developing the reserve base with 
three planning applications receiving approval in the Mining business, 
representing in excess of 2 million tonnes of coal in total. This led 
to a 4% increase in proven reserves to 4.7 million tonnes 
(2008: 4.5 million tonnes).
Proven and probable coal reserves at 4 October 2009 are unchanged 
at 8.2 million tonnes (2008: 8.2 million tonnes). 
DiviDeNDS
The Board is recommending a final dividend of 6.15 pence per share 
(2008: 2.64 pence per share), payable on 27 January 2010, subject to 
approval by the members at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 
20 January 2010, to members on the share register at 8 January 2010. 
The final dividend incorporates the deferred interim dividend

Coal will remain an integral part of UK energy production for the foreseeable 
future. To replace production with new reserves of coal, the Group employs 
an experienced and dedicated specialist team to identify suitable projects and 
manage them through the planning approval process. The Surface Mining 
Development Team has consistently delivered new coal reserves, with a further 
2.4 million tonnes added to proven reserves in the year and other projects in 
the planning process.
producing
The Group utilises modern hydraulic equipment to remove the overlaying 
material and the coal with techniques aimed at minimising the impact on the 
environment. The majority of the coal produced is used in the energy generation 
industry and is generally transported via rail either through the Group rail‑head 
at Crowbandsgate or other rail‑heads in the region. The Group operates three 
surface mines in Scotland: Skares Road in East Ayrshire; Glenmuckloch in 
Dumfries and Galloway; and Muir Dean in Fife.
restoring
Upon completion of the coal extraction at a mine, the project enters a period 
of restoration. The Group returns each site to an agreed condition and profile, 
which includes the replacement of base materials, soils and the re‑introduction 
of appropriate plant life. The Group has continued to restore the former surface 
mine at Garleffan in the year and commenced restoration work at Grievehill 
following the planned completion of production.

Regenerated land
ATH Regeneration returns sites 
to a variety of uses.
ATH Regeneration
developing
The UK has several areas where the footprint of former deep mining activity 
remains through the existence of colliery spoil tips. The Group has experience of 
operating in these areas, returning many derelict sites to a variety of productive 
uses. ATH Regeneration targets the remaining colliery spoil tips and enters into 
discussions with landowners and other stakeholders setting out the benefits of 
utilising the Group’s unique technology as the most environmentally efficient 
means of removing an ongoing liability.
producing
ATH Regeneration utilises unique washing technology to process colliery spoil 
tips. The spoil is processed through a high specification custom built washing 
facility that removes the coal and renders remaining pollutants inert. Non‑coal 
material is processed further through press plants to remove excess water which 
is retained to be reused in the plant. After processing, all non‑coal material is 
returned to the land where it is suitable to be used in the restoration process. 
The recovered coal is sold to UK power generating companies.
restoring
Integral to each site is a detailed restoration plan to return the land to an agreed 
use. Previous restoration tasks have returned restored land to parklands, wetlands 
and commercial use. The material treated in the washing process is used in the 
final restoration phase of the project and the Group restores to agreed contours, 
reintroducing soils and indigenous plant life. Ongoing maintenance is provided 
for several years through an aftercare programme. Restored sites form suitable 
habitats for various forms of wildlife and have been populated by several at risk 
breeds of bird. The Group continued the restoration of the former Grimethorpe 
site in 2009 and has a number of ongoing aftercare programmes at previously 
restored sites.

Review of THe peRioD
The results of the Group for the period were adversely affected by the 
absence of production at ATH Regeneration and, despite significant 
profit growth in the Mining business, profit before tax reduced 
by 36% to £5.8 million (2008: £9.0 million). Cash generated from 
operations reflected the fall in profitability but remained in excess 
of £17.7 million (2008: £22.6 million) and, with capital expenditure 
falling significantly, the Group’s net debt fell by £5.9 million during 
the year to £39.4 million (2008: £45.3 million). 
opeRATioNAL Review
SuRf ACe MiNiNG
Profit before interest and tax grew by 20% during the year to 
£11.8 million (2008: £9.8 million). There was a full year contribution 
from the Muir Dean and Grievehill mines with, as planned, production 
completing at Grievehill towards the end of the year and temporarily 
ceasing at Laigh Glenmuir whilst planning consent for an extension 
to the mine is received. 
The improved performance would have been even better but high 
water levels at the Muir Dean mine and poor weather in the late 
summer during the opening up of two mine extensions at Skares Road 
and Glenmuckloch temporarily hampered production. Following the 
implementation of a continuing water management plan, the Muir Dean 
site is now back to a normal production profile and, although further 
reductions in water levels will be necessary at the mine, coal production 
from the site overall may exceed initial expectations. Operations at 
the new extensions are now proceeding to expectations. 
During the year, new planning consents were received for a new mine at 
Rigg (1.1 million tonnes) in Dumfries and Galloway and extensions at the 
Skares Road (0.6 million tonnes) and Glenmuckloch (0.7 million tonnes) 
sites. A planning application for a 0.8 million tonnes extension to the 
Laigh Glenmuir site was submitted to the local planning authority in the 
year with the result expected mid 2010. In addition, an extension to the 
Muir Dean mine for 0.3 million tonnes was identified during the year. 
Changes in engineering estimates resulted in 0.4 million tonnes of 
reserves being transferred into coal resources.
Chief executive’s statement
The Mining business has recovered strongly and 
increases in proven reserves and average selling 
prices, together with reducing debt levels, demonstrate 
the underlying strength of the business.

Following the year end, a planning application for 1.8 million tonnes 
of coal reserves was submitted for a new mine at Netherton, a site 
close to Skares Road. The Netherton site will be important going

reserves, subject to geological assessment. 
ReGeNeRATioN
The business incurred a loss before interest and tax of £2.4 million 
(2008: profit £3.2 million) reflecting the completion of coal production 
at Grimethorpe in 2008 and the refusal by Derbyshire County Council 
to grant the Group’s planning submission for the Langton site. 
In November 2009, the Group received confirmation that it was 
successful in the appeal against the decision to refuse planning 
consent at Langton and plans are well advanced to commence 
production in 2010. The Group is negotiating coal sales agreements 
for the Langton coal prior to commencing plant construction.
The Group remains very positive for the longer term prospects for 
ATH Regeneration in the UK. With significantly reduced UK public 
spending and a consequent reduction in the subsidy available to 
clean up sites, the reclamation of former colliery spoil sites through 
use of the Group’s unique tip washing technology becomes even 
more attractive, potentially releasing additional sites for washing 
than previously expected. 
In addition, the Group continues to develop the business in Australia 
and, although progress has been slower than previously expected 
due to the current difficult economic climate, active development 
of the first key opportunity is ongoing at the mine with the potential 
client. The Board remains confident of securing regeneration contracts 
in Australia.
ReSeRveS
Estimated reserves of recoverable coal at the year end were 
8.2 million tonnes (2008: 8.2 million tonnes). Current planning 
activity levels are expected to replace coal produced with new

Demand for coal in the UK is likely to reduce to less than 50 million tonnes 
during 2009 with indigenous coal production meeting approximately 
one third of total usage.
International coal prices reduced from their 2008 peak during the 
period but ended the year around $70 per tonne despite difficult 
economic conditions. Forward price indices indicate a significant 
increase in prices over the next two to three years to over $100 
per tonne by 2012. 
The Group held agreements at the period end with a number of 
major UK electricity generators covering the supply of 3.3 million 
tonnes of coal up to 2012. Since the period end, agreement has 
been reached in principle with a major UK generating company for 
an extension of contract volumes which will result in an increase in 
pricing per tonne under the current contract, subject to certain quality 
and other criteria being satisfied. 
HeALTH AND SAfeTy The Board understands the potentially hazardous nature of the 
work undertaken in the Group’s operations and takes very seriously 
its responsibilities for health and safety. Operational sites have a

in 80% of the workforce qualified to NVQ standards on their chosen 
piece of equipment, which together with other training initiatives, 
means that ATH has one of the best qualified and competent 
workforces within the industry. 
The Board would like to join me in thanking our people for all of 
the efforts they have made in the past year and the commitment 
that they continue to demonstrate in delivering the success of 
the business.
SuMMARy The absence of production at ATH Regeneration has led to a 
challenging year for the Group. However, the Mining business has 
recovered strongly and increases in proven reserves and average 
selling prices, together with reducing debt levels, demonstrate the 
underlying strength of the business. With success at the Langton 
appeal, the Group is well placed to return to growth in revenue 
and earnings over the next few years.

The results are presented for the 53 week period to 4 October 2009 
against a 52 week period to 28 September 2008.
ReveNue
The Group’s revenue for the year was £77.5 million (2008: £76.9 million) 
on sales of 1.8 million tonnes (2008: 2.0 million tonnes). The average 
coal price was £43 per tonne (2008: £38 per tonne).
Revenues from the Mining business were £77.5 million (2008: £65.7 million) 
and from ATH Regeneration were £nil (2008: £11.2 million).
The increase in revenue from the Mining business reflects an increase 
in sales volumes and higher coal prices. Sales volumes benefitted from 
a full year contribution from the Muir Dean and Grievehill mines offset 
by the temporary cessation of production from the Laigh Glenmuir 
mine. Higher coal prices were secured on the renewal of existing supply 
contracts and new contracts in certain industrial markets. 
Revenues from ATH Regeneration reflected the completion of production 
at the Grimethorpe site in 2008. 
pRofiT BefoRe iNTeReST AND TAx Profit before interest and tax (“PBIT”) was £8.6 million (2008: £11.9 million) 
and earnings before interest, tax and depreciation were £24.1 million 
(2008: £25.7 million).
The return on PBIT of 23% (2008: 35%) reflects the loss of lower cost 
production from ATH Regeneration and an increase in depreciation 
following the Group’s investment programme offset by the increase 
in average selling price.
fiNANCe CoSTS
Net finance costs of £2.9 million (2008: £2.9 million) were 
charged in the year. Hire purchase interest charges were £1.3 million 
(2008: £1.1 million) reflecting the full year impact of the previous 
year’s investment. £0.6 million (2008: £0.4 million) was charged in 
respect of the unwinding of the discount on restoration provisions. 
Lower interest rates during the year were the primary reason for 
the reduction in bank and overdraft interest charges of £0.9 million 
(2008: £1.3 million).
Financial review
The Group’s revenue for the year was £77.5 million 
(2008: £76.9 million) on sales of 1.8 million tonnes 
(2008: 2.0 million tonnes).

TAxATioN
The effective rate of tax was 30% (2008: 32%) compared with a 
standard rate of tax of 28% (2008: 29%). The difference between 
the actual and standard rate is primarily due to expenses that are 
not allowable against tax.
eARNiNGS peR SHARe
Earnings per share were 10.1 pence (2008: 15.3 pence), a decrease 
of 34%. Fully diluted earnings per share, taking into account shares 
expected to be issued under employee share schemes, were 10.1 pence 
(2008: 14.9 pence).
NeT ASSeTS
Net assets were £37.2 million (2008: £34.2 million). The rate of 
capital expenditure has fallen significantly from 2008 with spend 
in 2009 of £7.5 million (2008: £27.9 million).
CASH fLowS
The Group generates strong cash flows from its operations, with a 
net cash inflow from operations of £17.8 million (2008: £22.6 million). 
Cash inflow before financing grew by £2.0 million to £7.2 million 
(2008: £5.2 million). Repayment of debt was a significant feature of 
the year with total repayments of £15.3 million which contributed 
to a total net cash outflow of £6.4 million (2008: £9.3 million inflow). 
The cash inflow in 2008 benefitted from a significant cash inflow 
from a refinancing of the Group’s debt.
fiNANCiNG
Bank loans and hire purchase liabilities reduced by £12.4 million 
to £34.1 million and, in the year, a working capital facility was put 
in place with amounts drawn during the period of £5.6 million, 
resulting in total debt at the period end of £39.7 million. 
During the year, the Group was successful in attracting new and 
extending existing bonding facilities totalling £11 million to meet 
the requirements of local authorities and land owners to cover 
the costs of final restoration of active sites in the Mining business. 
Further bonding cover will be required in the future to open up 
new sites as and when required. 
Following the year end, the Group agreed a new £30 million revolving 
credit facility (“RCF”) in a club deal with HSBC and Yorkshire Bank. 
The RCF extends for a three year period ending in November 2012. 
Maximum permitted borrowings under the RCF are £30 million during 
the first year of the new arrangements, £27.5 million during the 
second year and £22.5 million during the final year. 
The new arrangements secure attractive, long term funding for the 
Group and provide a more appropriate capital structure and the financial 
resources to continue developing surface mining and coal recovery 
projects within the UK. The RCF replaces the Group’s existing term debt 
arrangements, which were due to expire in February 2011, and working 
capital facilities. The combined outstanding balances under the previous 
arrangements totalled £19.8 million at 4 October 2009.

Corporate social responsibility
The Group strategy is to integrate its policies 
to maximise the training and other opportunities 
for its people whilst minimising the impact of 
its operations on the environment, neighbours 
and other interested parties. 
The Group is aware that operational activities can have a significant 
impact on a wide range of stakeholders including employees, 
neighbouring communities and local and national governments. 
The Group strategy is to integrate its policies to maximise the training 
and other opportunities for its people whilst minimising the impact 
of its operations on the environment, neighbours and other 
interested parties. 
eNviRoNMeNT
The Group considers the potential environmental impact of its 
operations at every stage of a project’s life cycle from initial planning 
to final restoration. Promoting excellence in environmental standards 
is a primary objective of the business and these issues are key to 
the strategic development of each site.
During the planning phase of projects, a full environmental assessment 
is carried out which is included within a formal planning application 
as the Environmental Impact Assessment. The potential impact on the 
environment at each stage of the development and operation of a site 
is considered and reported by senior mine management who engage 
specialist external consultants as required. 
The Group implements many initiatives to improve the local 
environment and legacy environmental issues. At the Grievehill 
site in Ayrshire, the Group employs rangers to assist in supporting 
suitable nesting areas for birds of prey, including the rare hen harrier. 
At the adjacent site at Garleffan, the restoration plan created a cliff 
face suitable for raptor nesting sites.

At Muir Dean in Fife, the Group is implementing a scheme to resolve what 
is considered to be the worst coal mine legacy pollution of a water course 
in Scotland. Working closely with the Scottish Environmental Protection 
Agency, the scheme involves the creation of a minewater treatment facility 
to remove iron and other pollutants from the Fordell Day Level, an old 
underground minewater drainage tunnel. The polluted minewater is 
pumped through water cascades and lagoons and filtered through 
organic reed beds before being discharged back into its original course. 
ATH is a partner of the East Ayrshire Coalfield Environment Initiative, 
a partnership involving the local authority, conservation bodies and 
industry, working to enhance, promote and conserve the environment. 
This initiative has included the creation and enhancement of wildlife 
habitats and schools liaison, amongst others.
The Group’s coal tip washing business provides an efficient and highly 
effective contaminated site clean‑up service. Existing contaminants are 
rendered inert by the processes employed to remove the coal and sites 
are returned to a variety of uses including commercial development, 
leisure or natural habitat. Agreed restoration plans include the planting 
of hundreds of thousands of trees and the reintroduction of wildlife. 
Uncommon species inhabiting previously restored sites include deer 
and birds, with the little ringed plover, the yellow wagtail and the 
short eared owl of particular interest.
During the year, the restoration continued at the former Grimethorpe 
site in South Yorkshire with the planting of over 75,000 trees. The site 
is already benefiting from the works undertaken with many bird and 
animal species returning. 
Bird nesting sites
The Group assists in supporting nesting 
areas suitable for raptors, including the 
at risk hen harrier.

Corporate social responsibility continued
ATH operates community liaison groups at each 
of its sites. These groups meet on a regular basis 
and allow the exchange of information on site 
progress enabling community representatives 
to raise any issues for discussion. 
peopLe
The Group recognises that its people are the most important assets 
within the business and an open and challenging working environment 
is encouraged. ATH is committed to providing opportunity and training 
to all staff to enable employees to fulfil their potential. 
The Group’s activities involve the use of large plant and machinery and 
staff are properly trained to use the equipment safely and efficiently. 
The Group has undertaken a wide ranging review of skills within the 
business and implemented a comprehensive training plan to ensure 
that ATH is an industry leader in employee skills.
opeRATioNAL TRAiNiNG
During the year, the Group created the Mining Training School at the 
Garleffan restoration site. This School is responsible for all the new 
starter inductions and delivery of all the NVQ assessments. Conducting 
both the assessments and inductions on a restoration site ensures the 
highest standard of training is delivered in a safe environment under 
the close supervision of a qualified trainer and assessor.
The high level of training capability has seen the school train 
approximately 80% of the workforce to NVQ Level 2 standards on 
their chosen piece of equipment which, when combined with the 
large amount of tertiary training delivered to the workforce, means 
that ATH has one of the best qualified and competent workforces 
within the industry.
MANAGeMeNT TRAiNiNG
During the year, the Directors refocused the ATH approach to 
both talent management and career development, which resulted 
in the creation of ‘career ladders’ for key departments. These ladders 
provide a career progression plan for each department, setting out 
the expected qualifications and anticipated experience required for 
an employee to be considered for promotion.
The learning and development plan has amalgamated all the training 
identified during the annual performance reviews. This plan was initiated 
to provide cost effective, targeted training in order to develop the skills 
and capabilities of the management of ATH.
RoSPA Silver Award
The Group’s continued commitment to 
excellence in health and safety procedures 
and practices was recognised in the year 
with the presentation of the RoSPA Silver 
Award in Occupational Health and Safety.

For the forthcoming year individual career ladders for the other 
departments will be developed. The main focus will be the delivery 
of a leadership development programme focusing on key employees. 
This programme will be run in conjunction with comprehensive core 
management training delivered to the whole management team.
HeALTH AND SAfeTy A key strategic objective of the Group is to provide safe working 
environments for all employees and people visiting ATH mines, 
sites and facilities.
The Group health and safety policies and procedures are managed 
through the ATH Resources plc Health and Safety Assessment Model 
which drives Group performance through four key stages. The policy 
strives for continuous improvement through Awareness, Competence, 
Compliance and Excellence.
The Group provides ongoing high quality training to all employees 
in every aspect of health and safety and promotes an open culture 
where unsafe practices are challenged and reported to achieve 
targets of excellence and continuous improvement. 
The Group had four reportable injuries during the year (2008: seven) 
and suffered no major injuries. The Group accident performance 
statistics are 16% better than the industry average for Riddor injuries.
RoSpA SiLveR Aw ARD
During the year, ATH was awarded the RoSPA (Royal Society for the 
Prevention of Accidents) Silver Award. This prestigious accreditation 
was received in recognition of the Group’s performance in promoting 
and attaining a high standard in the management of health and safety. 
Areas of particular strength were in hazard identification, the use of 
safe working practices, compliance with industry regulations and the 
involvement of safety representatives in new initiatives. This achievement 
is shared by all employees of the Group without whose commitment 
and effort the award would not have been achieved.
SoCiAL AND CoMMuNiTy The Group understands the importance of communication and 
interaction with neighbouring communities to provide information 
about operations and support through sponsorship and donations. 
ATH operates community liaison groups at each of its sites. These 
groups meet on a regular basis and allow the exchange of information 
on site progress enabling community representatives to raise any 
issues for discussion. 
The Group provides support to community groups and projects 
and provides financial support through either direct sponsorship 
or through community and environmental trusts. These include the 
Cumnock and Doon Valley Minerals Trust, the Kirkconnel Coalfield Trust 
and the Coalfields Environment Initiative. During the year, the Group 
established the Muir Dean Environmental Trust with a contribution of 
an initial £100,000. Overall, the Group contributed £426,000 to these 
initiatives. These schemes provide support to a wide range of good 
causes including Scout and Guide groups, local Church organisations 
and sports clubs.
Following the receipt of the Langton planning consent, the Group 
will create a liaison committee involving representatives from local 
communities within both Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire.

ATH Resources plc
annual report and accounts 2009
The Directors submit their report and the audited financial statements of ATH Resources plc for the year ended 4 October 2009.
PrIncIPAl ActIvItIes
The principal activity of the Company is that of a holding company. The principal activities of the Group are the operation of surface coal 
mines and the recovery of coal via tip washing and its subsequent sale to UK electricity generators, industrial and domestic customers. 
The Group operates under the title of ATH Resources.
revIew OF devel OPMents And Future PrOsPects
The Group’s trading performance for the year was in line with Directors’ revised expectations and is discussed in greater detail in the 
Chief Executive’s Statement. The Directors are pleased with the Group’s position and believe the businesses are well placed to continue 
to develop new opportunities.
st AteMent OF dIrectOrs’ resPOnsIbIlItIes
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Directors’ Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
The Directors are required to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRS”) as adopted by the European Union (“EU”). Company law requires the Directors to prepare such financial statements in accordance 
with IFRS as adopted by the EU and the Companies Act 2006. 
In the case of the Company accounts, UK company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. 
Under that law the Directors have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under company law the Directors must not approve 
the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company as at the 
end of the financial year. In preparing those financial statements, the Directors are required to:
b select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
b make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
b  state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained 
in the financial statements; and
b  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue 
in business.
In the case of IFRS accounts for the Group, International Accounting Standard 1 requires that financial statements present fairly for each 
financial year the Group’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows. This requires the faithful representation of the effects 
of transactions, other events and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and 
expenses set out in the International Accounting Standards Board’s “Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements”.
In virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation will be achieved by compliance with all applicable IFRS as adopted by the EU.
Directors are also required to:
b properly select and apply accounting policies;
b  present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information; and
b  provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRS as adopted by the EU is insufficient to enable users 
to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial performance.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements 
comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable 
steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the ATH Resources plc 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation 
in other jurisdictions.

PrIncIPAl rIsKs And uncert AIntIes FAcInG tHe GrOuP
rePlAceMent OF PrOductIOn
The Group’s operations have a finite life due to the geology of each site and will become exhausted at some point in the future. Production 
is replaced through the development or acquisition of new sites and extensions to existing sites.
exPl OrA tIOn And devel OPMent
The exploration for, and development of, coal deposits involves significant risks, which are managed through the combination of careful 
evaluation, experience and knowledge. Not all properties which are explored are ultimately developed into producing mines. There can be 
no guarantee that estimates of quantities and qualities made will be realised or that appropriate consents will be granted. With all mining 
operations there is uncertainty and therefore risks associated with operating parameters and costs. 
GenerAl MInInG And PrOcessInG rIsKs
The Group’s operations are subject to all of the hazards and risks normally encountered in the exploration, development and production 
of coal. Appropriate levels of site investigation are undertaken to minimise the risk but these risks could include unusual and unexpected 
geological formations, geo-technical instability, flooding and other conditions involved in the extraction of material.
vOlA tIlIty OF PrIce OF cOAl
The market price of coal is volatile and is affected by numerous factors which are beyond the Group’s control. These include international 
supply and demand, the level of consumer product demand, international economic trends, currency exchange rate fluctuations, the level 
of interest rates, the rate of inflation, the cost of freight, global or regional political events and international events, as well as a range of 
other market forces. This volatility is managed through the entering into of long term, fixed price, supply agreements with electricity 
generating companies.
envIrOnMent Al Issues
The Group’s activities and the markets in which it operates are subject to environmental regulation. Such regulations typically cover a wide 
variety of matters including prevention of waste, pollution and protection of the environment. The risk is managed by daily inspections of 
all operations with a potential to cause environmental breaches and by careful design of the operations to mitigate any potential risk.
HeAltH And sAFety
The Group’s activities are, and will continue to be, subject to health and safety standards and regulations. Failure to comply with such 
requirements may result in fines, penalties and/or litigation. Risk assessments are carried out by management as well as retaining the 
services of external risk consultants to identify any potential risks and ensure safe methods of working.
restOrA tIOn bOnds
The Group’s activities result in the creation of working sites and mining voids that require substantial remedial and restoration works 
at the end of coaling operations. As part of the planning approvals process, the Group is normally required to obtain agreed restoration 
bonds that cover the anticipated remedial works, which are substantial in certain instances. The impact of recent uncertainty in the financial 
markets has reduced the potential sources of restoration bonds, although the Group has good relationships with a number of providers.
FInAncIAl InstruMents
Details relating to financial instruments are given in note 24.
eMPl Oyees
The Directors recognise the importance of the Group’s employees in the success of the business. 
The Group is committed to equal opportunities in employment and seeks to ensure that all current employees or applicants are treated equally 
regardless of age, sex, nationality, race, colour, creed or disability.
The Directors retain regular contact with employees using both formal and informal lines of communication to ensure relevant financial and 
operational information is disseminated. Regular meetings take place to allow employees of all levels to contribute to the Group’s development.

IntrOductIOn
Although the rules of AIM do not require the Company to comply with the Combined Code on Corporate Governance (“the Code”), the Company 
fully supports the principles set out in the Code and will attempt to comply wherever possible, given both the size and resources available to 
the Company. Details are provided below of how the Company applies the Code.
tHe bOArd
The Board of Directors comprised three Executive Directors and three independent Non-executive Directors, one of whom is the Chairman. 
During the year, Mrs Ivana Ridler resigned as an independent Non-executive Director and Mr Tim Stokeld was appointed as an independent 
Non-executive Director.
The Alchemy Plan has the right to nominate a Non-executive Director but has chosen not to do so. If the Alchemy Plan’s shareholding in the 
Company falls below 10% of the issued share capital, the right to appoint ceases.
The Board generally meets each month and receives a Board pack comprising individual reports from each of the Executive Directors, together 
with any other material deemed necessary for the Board to discharge its duties. It is the Board’s responsibility for formulating, reviewing and 
approving the Group’s strategy, budgets, major items of expenditure and acquisitions.
During the year ended 4 October 2009 the Board met a total of twelve times.
bOArd cOMMIttees
The Board has established three committees: Audit, Remuneration and Nominations, all having written terms of delegated responsibilities.
AudIt cOMMIttee
The Audit Committee comprises the three Non-executive Directors and is scheduled to meet twice a year. It is the Audit Committee’s role 
to provide formal and transparent arrangements for considering how to apply the financial reporting and internal control requirements of the 
Code, whilst maintaining an appropriate relationship with the independent auditors of the Group. In order to comply with the requirement 
of the Code that at least one member has relevant financial experience, the Chairman of the Board sits on the Audit Committee.
During the year ended 4 October 2009 the Audit Committee met on two occasions.
reMunerA tIOn cOMMIttee
The Remuneration Committee comprises the three Non-executive Directors and meets at least once a year, normally in June. It is the Remuneration 
Committee’s role to establish a formal and transparent policy on Executive remuneration and to set remuneration packages for individual Directors.
During the year ended 4 October 2009 the Remuneration Committee met on four occasions.
nOMInA tIOns cOMMIttee
The Nominations Committee comprises the three Non-executive Directors and the Chief Executive and meets as required to consider and make 
recommendations on the appointment of Directors to the Board.
sHAreHOlder relA tIOns
The Company meets with its institutional shareholders and analysts as appropriate and encourages communication with private shareholders via 
the Annual General Meeting. In addition, the Company uses the Annual Report and Accounts, Interim Statement and website (www.ath.co.uk) 
to provide further information to shareholders.
The Board considers Mr Vaughan Williams to be the Senior Independent Director.

InternAl cOntrOl And rIsK MAnAGeMent
The Board is responsible for the system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. Such systems are designed to manage rather 
than eliminate risks and can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. Each year, on behalf 
of the Board, the Audit Committee reviews the effectiveness of these systems. This is achieved primarily by considering the risks potentially 
affecting the Group and discussions with the external auditors.
The Group does not currently have an internal audit function due to the small size of the administrative function and the high level of Director 
review and authorisation of transactions.
A comprehensive budgeting process is completed once a year and is reviewed and approved by the Board. The Group’s results, as compared 
against budget, are reported to the Board on a monthly basis and discussed in detail at each meeting of the Board.
The Group maintains appropriate insurance cover in respect of legal actions against the Directors as well as against material loss or claims 
against the Group and reviews the adequacy of the cover regularly.
FInAncIAl InstruMents
Details of the Group’s financial instruments and associated policies are set out in note 24.
GOInG cOncern bAsIs
After making enquiries, the Directors have formed a judgment, at the time of approving the financial statements, that there is a reasonable 
expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason the Directors 
continue to adopt the going concern basis in the financial statements.

Companies trading on AIM are not required to provide a formal Remuneration Report. However, in line with current best practice, this report 
provides information to enable a greater level of understanding as to how Directors’ remuneration is determined. The Remuneration Committee 
of the Board is responsible for considering Directors’ remuneration packages and makes its recommendations to the Board. The Committee 
comprises the three Non-executive Directors and meets at least once a year, normally in June. 
reMunerA tIOn POlIcy
Remuneration packages are designed to be competitive and to reward above average performance. Executive Directors receive salary, fully 
financed company car or car allowance, death in service benefit, critical illness and medical cover, pension contribution, annual bonuses 
and share options.
servIce cOntrActs
The Executive Directors have service agreements with the Company. Mr Tom Allchurch and Mr Alistair Black’s agreements are dated 
28 November 2003 for an initial twelve months, thereafter subject to termination upon twelve months’ notice being given by either party. 
Mr Steven Beaumont’s agreement is dated 9 October 2006 with an initial notice period of six months which increased to twelve months 
after one year’s service.
PensIOns
The Group does not have a pension scheme, instead it makes contributions to Executive Directors’ personal pension schemes of 12.5% 
of annual salary.
nOn-executIve dIrectOrs
Mr David Port and Mr Vaughan Williams entered into Letters of Appointment dated 12 May 2004 which were renewed in October 2009. 
Mr Port and Mr Williams were appointed for an initial three year term, which can be terminated upon six months’ notice being given by 
either party. They received fees of £69,628 and £29,994 respectively. Mrs Ivana Ridler was initially appointed as a Non-executive Director 
as the Alchemy Plan’s representative and then as an independent Non-executive Director on 31 October 2006 for an initial three year term. 
Mrs Ridler resigned as a Non-executive Director on 23 February 2009 and received a fee of £11,158. Mr Tim Stokeld was appointed as an 
independent Non-executive Director on 6 May 2009 and received a fee of £10,417. The appointment is subject to an annual review and can be 
terminated upon three months’ notice being given by either party.

Group accounting policies
bAsIs OF AccOuntInG
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS. The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with 
IFRS adopted by the EU and therefore these financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments which 
are carried at fair value. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
The Directors have prepared cash flow projections for the coming twelve months which show that the level of cash requirements are within 
the Group’s existing borrowing facilities. On the basis of this cash flow information, the Directors consider that the Group will continue to 
operate within the facilities currently and anticipated to be available to the Group. On this basis, the Directors consider it is appropriate to 
prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that would result 
from this not being the case.
bAsIs OF cOnsOlIdA tIOn 
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of ATH Resources plc and entities controlled by the Company made 
up to the end of September each year. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies 
of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
Aardvark TMC Limited (“Aardvark”) has 20,000 ‘B’ ordinary shares not owned by ATH Resources plc, subscribed at their nominal value 
of 1 pence each in addition to the ordinary shares wholly owned by ATH Resources plc.
The ‘B’ ordinary shares only carry the rights to receive a one off dividend in the event that Aardvark TFC Limited or SRMMC (Aardvark’s subsidiary 
and sub-subsidiary) are awarded damages in respect of existing and future litigation against the French State. The ‘B’ ordinary shares carry no 
voting rights or rights to receive any other dividend. As a result, the ‘B’ ordinary shares are not accounted for as a minority interest as it is not 
material for the purposes of giving a true and fair view.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date 
of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those 
used by the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
revenue recOGnItIOn
Revenue from the sale of coal is recognised when the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer. This is usually when 
the coal is delivered to the location specified by the customer, generally on loading into transport where the customer is responsible for the 
transportation. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and is shown net of discounts, VAT and other 
sales-related taxes. 
Additional revenue earned from customer contributions in respect of land remediation work is recognised over the life of the coal tip washing 
operation. The amount of revenue included reflects the proportion of contracted work completed.
retIreMent beneFIt cOsts 
The Group only makes payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes which are charged as an expense as they fall due. 
bOrrOwInG cOsts
All borrowing costs are recognised in the consolidated income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
dIvIdends
Dividends are recorded in the Group’s financial statements in the period in which they are declared and paid.

tAxA tIOn
Income tax on the profit or loss for the periods presented comprises both current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the 
consolidated income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised 
in the consolidated statement of recognised changes in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted 
by the balance sheet date and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. T axable profit differs from net profit as reported in the consolidated income statement 
because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable 
or deductible.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the 
financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet 
liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised 
to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
The following temporary differences are not provided for in accordance with IFRS:
b goodwill not deductible for taxation purposes;
b initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit; and
b differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that these will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised using 
tax rates enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities 
and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities 
on a net basis.
GOvernMent GrAnts
Government grants relating to property, plant and equipment are released to profit or loss over the expected useful lives of the assets concerned. 
The grant received is deducted from the carrying amount of the asset and the income is recognised by way of a reduced depreciation charge. 
The consolidated cash flow statement discloses the purchase of assets and the receipt of related grants as separate items.
sHAre-bAsed PA yMents
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value 
(excluding the effect of non market-based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled 
share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually 
vest and adjusted for the effect of non market-based vesting conditions. Fair value is measured by use of a Binomial model.
GOOdwIll And busIness cOMbInA tIOns
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the 
fair values at the date of exchange of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange 
for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination. The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date.
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the identifiable 
assets and liabilities of a subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured 
at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Negative goodwill arising on an acquisition is recognised immediately in the consolidated 
income statement.
Goodwill, which is recognised as an asset, is reviewed for impairment at least annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the 
consolidated income statement and is not subsequently reversed. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each 
of the Group’s cash-generating units (“CGUs”) expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. CGUs to which goodwill has been 
allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable 
amount of the CGU is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any 
goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. 
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.

Group accounting policies continued
PrOPerty , PlAnt And equIPMent 
All property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss. Depreciation 
commences when the asset is brought into use or, in the case of mine purchase and development costs, on the commencement of 
full production.
Mine exploration and development costs are expensed until such time that the Group has the legal rights to explore the prospective site. 
Exploration and evaluation costs, incurred after legal rights are obtained, are capitalised and subsequently impaired if facts and circumstances 
indicate that the site is not commercially viable and will not therefore be worked. 
Costs incurred in preparing and developing sites which are considered commercially viable and technically feasible are capitalised up to the 
start of production.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets less estimated residual value, over their estimated useful lives, in annual instalments, 
on the following bases:
Freehold land:  not depreciated 
Freehold buildings:  4% 
Mine purchase and development: tonnage basis over the estimated total recoverable reserve 
Plant and machinery:  10–50%
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or over the term of the 
relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying 
amount of the asset and is recognised in income.
IMPAIrMent OF PlAnt, PrOPerty And equIPMent And Int AnGIble Assets excludInG GOOdwIll
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its plant, property and equipment and intangible assets to determine 
whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of 
the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that 
are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows 
are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money 
and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or CGU) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (CGU) 
is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (CGU) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable 
amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment 
loss been recognised for the asset (CGU) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately.
leAsInG
The Group only acts as a lessee. Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks 
and rewards of ownership. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, at the present value of the minimum lease 
payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the consolidated balance sheet 
as a finance lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve 
a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged directly against income.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
InventOrIes 
Inventories include coal stocks, work in progress and spare parts and tyres stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Coal stocks 
are mined coal stocks on hand. Work in progress represents the costs incurred on mining operations where the related coal has not yet 
been extracted from the ground.
Cost comprises direct materials, plant costs, direct labour and relevant overheads that have been incurred in bringing the coal and work 
in progress to its present location and condition. Cost is calculated using the weighted average method. Net realisable value represents 
the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.

ATH Resources plc
annual report and accounts 2009
FInAncIAl InstruMents
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the consolidated balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument, and are only derecognised when the contractual provisions expire or have been discharged, or substantially 
all the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred.
FInAncIAl Assets
Financial assets are principally made up of items classified under IFRS as “loans and receivables”. The classification depends on the nature 
and purpose of the financial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition.
Loans and receivables constitute trade receivables, loans and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in 
an active market. Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment. Interest income 
is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for short term receivables when the recognition of interest would be immaterial.
These financial assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date. Financial assets are impaired where there is 
objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, its estimated future 
cash flows have been impacted. 
For certain categories of financial asset, such as trade receivables, assets that are assessed not to be impaired individually are subsequently 
assessed for impairment on a collective basis. Objective evidence of impairment for a portfolio of receivables could include the Group’s past 
experience of collecting payments, an increase in the number of delayed payments in the portfolio past the average credit period of 60 days, 
as well as observable changes in national or local economic conditions that correlate with default on receivables.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception of trade receivables, 
where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance for bad debts. When a trade receivable is considered uncollectible, it is 
written off against the allowance for bad debts. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the allowance 
for bad debts. Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in the consolidated income statement.
cAsH And cAsH equIv Alents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at hand, cash on demand deposits, and other short term highly liquid investments that are readily 
convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
FInAncIAl lIAbIlItIes And equIty
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. 
equIty InstruMents
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. 
Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
FInAncIAl lIAbIlItIes 
Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities at “fair value through profit or loss” (“FVTPL”) or “other financial liabilities”. 
Financial liabilities are classified as FVTPL where the financial liability is either held for trading or it is designated as at FVTPL.
Other financial liabilities, including borrowings and trade and other payables, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs. 
Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised 
on an effective yield basis. The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating 
interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through 
the expected life of the financial liability or, where appropriate, a shorter period.
PrOvIsIOns
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Group will be 
required to settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation 
at the balance sheet date and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.

Group accounting policies continued
FInAl vOId PrOvIsIOns
Following the conclusion of coal extraction the final working void of a surface coal site must be back filled. The total cost of this operation 
is recognised as a provision on site commissioning when the obligation arises. The amount provided represents the present value of the 
expected costs. Costs are charged to the provision as incurred and the unwinding of the discount, being the difference between the present 
value and the total cost of the provision, is included in the interest charge for the period. An asset is created for an amount equivalent to 
the initial provision. This is charged to the consolidated income statement on a tonnage basis over the estimated life of the recoverable reserves.
new st AndArds And InterPret AtIOns nOt APPlIed
At the date of issue of these financial statements, the following standards and interpretations which have not been applied in these 
financial statements were in issue but not yet effective:
IFRIC 17 ’Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners’
IFRIC 18 ‘Transfers of Assets from Customers’
IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’
Amendments to IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements – a Revised Presentation’
Amendments to IAS 23 ‘Borrowing Costs’
IFRS 3 (revised) ‘Business Combinations’
Amendments to IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement – Eligible Hedged Items’
IAS 27 ‘Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements’
The Directors do not anticipate that adoption of these standards and interpretations would have a material impact on these consolidated 
financial statements. 
sIGnIFIcAnt JudGMents
Management exercises significant judgment in the determination of the provisions for the costs required in respect of restoring the final void 
and site to an agreed condition. Amounts provided are based on management experience and historical out-turns, together with regular 
external expert consultation as is deemed appropriate.
Key AssuMPtIOns And estIMA tes
Amounts in the consolidated financial statements that are subject to significant estimates are as follows:
b  coal reserves and overburden – capitalised mine purchase and development costs are amortised over the tonnage of coal expected to be 
extracted in the future which has been calculated using experience and geo-technical engineering findings. If the amount of coal expected to 
be extracted varies, this will impact on the amount of the asset which should be carried in the consolidated balance sheet. Work in progress 
balances are based on an analysis of the remaining coal and overburden volumes at the period end. If the amount of remaining coal or 
overburden varies, this will impact on the work in progress volume that should be carried;
b  restoration and closure provisions – estimated provisions are established in the consolidated balance sheet and amortised in proportion to 
the coal expected to be extracted from a site. If that expected tonnage or the actual cost varies, then the provision may be under or overstated. 
Final void provision values are assessed using experience and detailed restoration plans. The Group appoints independent experts to review 
the carrying value of final void provisions on an annual basis. The provisions are disclosed in note 16; and
b  goodwill impairment – determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units 
to which these assets have been allocated. The value in use calculation requires the entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to 
arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.

Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed annually for impairment, or more frequently if internal or external factors indicate that goodwill might 
be impaired. Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the CGU which is expected to benefit from that acquisition. CGUs are 
the lowest level of trading operation at which goodwill is separately considered and are consistent with the segmental analysis set out in note 2.
The carrying value is allocated to CGUs as follows:
         2009 2008 
         £000 £000
Surface Mining        1,413 1,413
Regeneration        6,244 6,244
         7,657  7,657
A goodwill asset is impaired if its carrying value exceeds the CGUs recoverable amount which is based on its value in use. At both 
28 September 2008 and 4 October 2009, impairment reviews were performed by calculating the value in use of each CGU and comparing this 
with the carrying value of goodwill. The value in use is calculated using cash flow forecasts from the most recent budget and business plan for 
the next five years and then at a terminal value based on a five year multiple of earnings. The forecasts include the following key assumptions:
         Surface  
         Mining Regeneration
Growth rate        2% 2%
Discount rate        10% 10%
Direct costs growth        3% 3%
Sales prices growth        3% 3%
The estimated growth rates are based on past experience, knowledge of the market sectors and the current forecast of the opportunities 
open to the business in all of their markets.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to each CGU.
Changes in direct costs are based on past experience and expectations of the future, particularly the impact of oil prices.
Sales price growth is based on current contractual agreements and expectation of the future changes given the market forward price curves 
and estimate of exchange rates, particularly sterling and the US dollar.
There are no instances of goodwill impairment from the annual impairment tests performed in 2008 and 2009.
The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis on the impairment test of the carrying value of each CGU. In the Surface Mining business, 
an increase in the discount rate of 5% would result in the carrying value being reduced to its carrying amount. In the Regeneration business 
forecast cash flows would need to reduce by 73% to reduce the carrying value to its carrying amount.
The goodwill impairment review analysing the carrying value of the Regeneration CGU considered the lack of productive operations and the loss 
reported by the segment in the year (note 2). The post year end planning consent for the Langton site, enabling the CGU to return to production, 
and the planned future business opportunities mean the Group is satisfied that the goodwill relating to the Regeneration CGU is not impaired.

The Group pledged £2.8 million (2008: £nil) of coal inventories as security for borrowings drawn under the debtors and stock based 
short term lending facility. During the year, the Group reviewed the direct production costs allocated to the various Surface Mining activities. 
This resulted in a revised allocation of certain mining costs into categories which led to their proper inclusion in the valuation of work in progress. 
This refinement led to the recognition of an additional £0.7 million in work in progress.

The average credit period taken on sales of goods in 2009 is 39 days (2008: 49). No allowance for bad debts is held due to the insignificant 
levels of default arising in recent years and the credit insurance held.
Due to the nature of the Group’s activities, trade receivables consist of a relatively small number of individual balances. Credit insurance 
is maintained and the Directors monitor receivable balances to ensure any exposure is minimised. Before accepting any new customer the 
Directors review and consider the potential customer’s credit worthiness using experience of the relevant company, the industries into which 
it sells and the availability of insurance.

The Board has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework. A formal risk assessment 
and management framework for assessing, monitoring and managing the strategic, operational and financial risks of the Group is in place 
to ensure appropriate risk management of its operations. Internal control and risk management systems are embedded in the operations 
of the divisions.
cAPIt Al rIsK MAnAGeMent
The Group manages its capital to ensure that the Group will be able to continue as a going concern whilst taking advantage of the opportunities 
in its chosen markets, providing returns for its shareholders and to maintain an optimal level of both debt and equity finance.
The Group’s capital structure consists of debt, including the borrowings as set out in note 15; bank overdraft and cash and cash equivalents; and 
equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued share capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in notes 17 and 19.
The Group has satisfied all reportable banking covenants during the current and previous years. 
The Group uses its gearing ratio to monitor its capital structure, gearing being calculated as net debt divided by total capital. Net debt is bank 
loans, bank overdrafts and finance lease liabilities less cash and cash equivalents. Total capital is net debt and the equity attributable to equity 
holders of the parent.
The gearing ratio at the year end is as follows:
         2009 2008 
         £000 £000
Bank loans, bank overdrafts and finance lease liabilities       39,720 46,459
Cash and cash equivalents        (370) (1,207)
Net debt        39,350 45,252
Total equity        37,181 34,246
Total capital        76,531 79,498
Gearing ratio        51% 57%
The movement in the year is attributable to reducing levels of capital investment and significant repayment of debt.

The carrying amount of financial assets and financial liabilities are recorded at amortised cost in the financial statements and are considered 
to approximate to their fair value.
Cash and cash equivalents are cash balances held by the Group. All financial assets are classified as loans and receivables and all financial liabilities 
are classified as other liabilities.
In November 2008 the Group entered into a new financing arrangement with its bankers replacing an overdraft facility with a debtors and 
stock based short term lending facility. 
The Group pledged £2.8 million of trade receivables (2008: £nil) as security for borrowings drawn under the debtors and stock based  
short term lending facility.
In November 2009, all existing bank loan, overdraft and asset-backed facilities were replaced by a new £30 million revolving credit facility 
in a club deal with two new banks. By agreement, the facilities available step down to £27.5 million after one year and to £22.5 million after 
two years. Overall, the arrangement secures facilities until November 2012.
FInAncIAl rIsK MAnAGeMent ObJectIves
The Group has exposure to a variety of financial risks through the conduct of its operations. The overall risk management policies of the Group 
are designed to minimise implicit credit risk, market risk, foreign currency risk and liquidity risk. Risk management is governed by the Group’s 
operational policies which are managed and reviewed by the Board of Directors. 
MArKet rIsK
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in credit risks, foreign currency risk, liquidity risk and interest rate 
movements described below.
Market risk exposures are monitored and are supplemented by sensitivity analysis. There has been no change to the Group’s exposure to 
market risks or the manner in which it manages and measures the risk.
The Group enters into hedging agreements to fix the forward price of gas oil, a significant operating cost. These instruments are deemed 
“own use” contracts and are not required to be stated at fair value under IFRS. These instruments are entered into to minimise the price 
of oil on the Group.
FOreIGn currency rIsK MAnAGeMent
The Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies when purchasing significant capital equipment from abroad 
and exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise. Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising forward 
foreign exchange contracts if considered appropriate.
The carrying amounts of the Group’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities were insignificant at each 
balance sheet date.

credIt rIsK
Credit risk predominantly arises from trade receivables and cash and cash equivalents and refers to the risk that a counterparty will default 
on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. The Group has a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties 
and obtaining sufficient insurance where appropriate as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults.
The Group generally transacts with large entities that are in the power generating, coal wholesale and manufacturing industries and has 
had little history of default in recent years. Credit exposures are reviewed by the Board regularly. 
The Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty or any group of counterparties having similar characteristics. 
The Group defines counterparties as having similar characteristics if they are connected entities.
Cash and cash equivalents are held with banks.
The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk relating to its financial assets is equivalent to their carrying value as disclosed below:
         2009 2008 
         £000 £000
Trade receivables        8,403 10,321
Cash and cash equivalents        370 1,207
         8,773 11,528
The Group carries credit risk insurance to mitigate the risk of default from trade receivables.
lIquIdIty rIsK MAnAGeMent
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which has built an appropriate liquidity risk management 
framework for the management of the Group’s short, medium and long term funding and liquidity management requirements. 
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowings facilities by continuously monitoring 
forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities. Included in note 15 is an analysis of the maturity 
of the Group’s borrowings along with a description of additional undrawn facilities that the Group has at its disposal to further reduce liquidity risk.
The average credit period taken for trade purchases is 63 days (2008: 67 days) which reflects the mix of when these amounts are contractually due.
Interest rA te rIsK MAnAGeMent
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as entities in the Group borrow funds at both fixed and floating interest rates. The risk is managed 
by the Group by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings, and by the use of interest rate swap contracts 
when necessary. Hedging activities are evaluated regularly with a policy of aligning interest rate views and defined risk profiles to ensure 
optimal hedging strategies are applied, as considered appropriate.
The Group’s interest rate profile on financial liabilities is as follows:
 2009  2008
     Fixed Floating  Fixed Floating

Interest rA te sensItIvIty AnAlysIs
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates in respect of the Group’s borrowings. For floating 
rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole 
year. A 2% increase (2008: 2%) or 1% decrease (2008: 2%) represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest 
rates, which is attributable to the Group’s exposure to interest rates on its variable rate borrowings.

Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions 
or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet 
date. Timing differences are differences between the Group’s taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements that arise from 
the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the financial statements.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences are expected to reverse, 
based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is measured on a 
non-discounted basis.

Notice of annual general meeting – ATH Resources plc continued
nOtes:
1.  A member who is entitled to attend and vote at the Annual General Meeting is entitled to appoint one or more proxies (who need 
not be a member of the Company) to attend and, on a poll, vote instead of the member. Completion and return of a form of proxy 
will not preclude a member from attending and voting at the meeting in person, should he subsequently decide to do so.
  The right to appoint a proxy does not apply to persons whose shares are held on their behalf by another person and who have been nominated 
to receive communications from the Company in accordance with section 146 of the Companies Act 2006 (“nominated persons”). Nominated 
persons may have a right under an agreement with the registered shareholder who holds the shares on their behalf to be appointed (or to have 
someone else appointed) as a proxy. Alternatively, if nominated persons do not have such a right, or do not wish to exercise it, they may 
have a right under such an agreement to give instructions to the person holding the shares as to the exercise of voting rights.
2.  In order to be valid, any form of proxy and power of attorney or other authority under which it is signed, or notarially certified or office 
copy of such power or authority, must reach the Company’s registrars, Capita Registrars, The Registry, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, 
Kent, BR3 4TU not less than 48 hours before the time of the meeting or of any adjournment of the meeting. 
3.  CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so for 
the Annual General Meeting to be held on 20 January 2010 and any adjournment(s) thereof by using the procedures described in the 
CREST Manual. CREST personal members or other CREST sponsored members, and those CREST members who have appointed a voting 
service provider(s), should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s), who will be able to take the appropriate action on 
their behalf.
  In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST service to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a “CREST Proxy 
Instruction”) must be properly authenticated in accordance with CRESTCo’s specifications and must contain the information required for 
such instructions, as described in the CREST Manual. The message, regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or to 
an amendment to the instruction given to a previously appointed proxy must, in order to be valid, be transmitted so as to be received by 
the issuer’s agent (ID RA10) by the latest time(s) for receipt of proxy appointments specified in the notice of meeting. For this purpose, 
the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Applications Host) 
from which the issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. After this time any 
change of instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should be communicated to the appointee through other means.
  CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers should note that CRESTCo does not make available 
special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input 
of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or, if the CREST member is a CREST personal 
member or sponsored member or has appointed a voting service provider(s), to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) 
take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. 
In this connection, CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers are referred, in particular, 
to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings.
  The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertificated 
Securities Regulations 2001.
4.  As permitted by Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001, shareholders who hold shares in uncertificated form 
must be entered on the Company’s share register at 6:00 pm on 18 January 2010 in order to be entitled to attend and vote at the 
Annual General Meeting. Such shareholders may only cast votes in respect of shares held at such time. Changes to entries on the 
relevant register after that time shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend or vote at the meeting.

1.  Every holder has the right to appoint some other person(s) of their choice, who need not be a shareholder as his proxy to exercise all or any of his rights, to attend, 
speak and vote on their behalf at the meeting. If you wish to appoint a person other than the Chairman, please insert the name of your chosen proxy holder in the space 
provided above. If the proxy is being appointed in relation to less than your full voting entitlement, please enter the number of shares in relation to which they are 
authorised to act as your proxy. If left blank your proxy will be deemed to be authorised in respect of your full voting entitlement (or if this proxy form has been issued 
in respect of a designated account for a shareholder, the full voting entitlement for that designated account).
2.  To appoint more than one proxy you may photocopy this form. Please indicate the proxy holder’s name and the number of shares in relation to which they are authorised to 
act as your proxy (which, in aggregate, should not exceed the number of shares held by you). Please also indicate if the proxy instruction is one of multiple instructions being 
given. All forms must be signed and should be returned together in the same envelope.
3.  The vote withheld option is provided to enable you to abstain on any particular resolution. However, it should be noted that a “vote withheld” is not a vote in law, 
and will not be counted in the calculation of the proportion of votes “For” and “Against” a resolution. 
4.  If a member is a corporation, this form of proxy must be executed under its common seal or by the signature of an officer or attorney duly authorised in writing. 
5.  Entitlement to attend and vote at the meeting and the number of votes which may be cast thereat will be determined by reference to the Register of Members 
of the Company as at 6:00 pm on 18 January 2010. Changes to entries on the Register of Members after that time shall be disregarded in determining the rights 
of any person to attend and vote at the meeting.
6.  Shares held in uncertificated form (i.e. in CREST) may be voted through the CREST Proxy Voting Service in accordance with the procedures set out in the CREST Manual. 
7.  The completion and return of this form will not preclude a member from attending the meeting and voting in person. If you attend the meeting in person, your proxy 
appointment will automatically be terminated.
8.  In the case of joint holders, the signature of any one holder will be sufficient, but the names of all joint holders should be stated, and the vote of the senior holder who 
tenders a vote will be accepted to the exclusion of the vote(s) of other joint holder(s), seniority being determined by the order in which the names stand in the register 
of members of the Company.
9. Any alterations made to this form of proxy should be initialled.

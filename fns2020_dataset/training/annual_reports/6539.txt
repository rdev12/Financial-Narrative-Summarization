w ho we are
Genus is a world leader in 
advancing the science of 
animal breeding and genetic 
improvement. We breed the 
world’s best pigs and bulls, 
scientifically selecting livestock 
whose offspring will increase value 
for customers around the world.
In the porcine market, we 
provide customers with access to 
continuous genetic improvement, 
through our genetically superior 
boar and sow product lines. In 
the dairy and beef markets, our 
primary product is bull semen. All 
our products enable customers to 
achieve desirable characteristics in 
their herds, such as higher carcass 
value, feed-efficient growth, 
leaner meat or higher milk yield.
We combine our product and 
scientific excellence with a global 
supply chain, technical services 
and sales network, ensuring we 
can meet our customers’ needs 
and help them to maximise their 
benefits from our products. This 
approach has given us market-
leading positions and the ability 
to create value for customers 
and shareholders alike.

A WORLD-LEADING 
BUSINESS
GeNus at a GLa Nce
Genus	plays	an	important	role	in	
the	world’s	agricultural	economy.	
Our	products	enable	our	
customers	to	meet	the	growing	
demand	for	pork,	beef	and	milk,	
driven	by	urbanisation	and	rising	
populations	and	incomes,	and	to	
cope	with	tightening	limits	on	the	
land	and	water	resources	available	
for	food	production.	
Genus’s Competitive Advantage
Our	competitive	edge	comes	from	owning	and	controlling	proprietary	
lines	of	breeding	animals	and	using	biotechnology	to	continuously	improve	
them.	We	combine	this	product	and	scientific	excellence	with	a	global	
supply	chain,	technical	service,	and	distribution	and	sales	network,	
ensuring	we	can	meet	our	customers’	needs	and	help	them	to	maximise	
their	benefits	from	our	products.
The	majority	of	our	competitors	are	traditional	co-operatives,	making	
Genus	unique	as	a	listed	company.	Our	business	model	and	multi-species	
approach	allow	us	to	continually	strengthen	and	leverage	our	technology	
platform	more	broadly,	thereby	delivering	value	to	customers	and	
shareholders	alike.	
Our	success	has	given	us	market-leading	positions.	We	have	25%	of		
the	porcine	market,	more	than	double	our	nearest	competitor,	as	well		
as	25%	in	beef	and	8%	of	global	dairy	sales.	We	sell	under	well-known	
trademarks,	‘PIC’	for	pigs	and	‘ABS’	for	dairy	and	beef	cattle,	in	more		
than	70	countries	worldwide.
What We Do
Genus	is	a	world	leader	in	applying	
biotechnology	to	advance	the	
science	of	animal	breeding	
and	genetic	improvement.	
Our	technology	is	applicable	
to	all	livestock	species	and	we	
currently	commercialise	it	in	the	
dairy,	beef	and	pork	sectors.
To	do	this,	we	breed	the	world’s	best	
pigs	and	bulls,	scientifically	selecting	
livestock	whose	offspring	will	
increase	value	for	farmers	and	food	
producers	around	the	world,	with	
the	ultimate	goal	of	making	pork,	
beef	and	milk	more	affordable,	better	
quality	and	safer	for	consumers.	
In	the	porcine	market,	we	offer	
genetically	superior	boars	and	
sows	that	produce	high-quality	
and	efficient	offspring,	with	
higher	carcass	value	and	desirable	
characteristics	such	as	feed-
efficient	growth	or	leaner	meat.
In	the	dairy	and	beef	markets,	our	
primary	product	is	bull	semen,	
which	we	produce	in-house	in	
five	locations	worldwide.	Artificial	
insemination	from	semen	straws	
produces	high-quality	cattle,	
enabling	our	customers	to	improve	
their	herds	and	their	efficiency.
Our Vision
Pioneering	animal	genetic	
improvement	to	help	nourish	
the world.
How We Operate
With	headquarters	in	Basingstoke,	UK,	Genus	companies	operate	in	30	
countries	on	six	continents,	with	research	laboratories	located	in	Madison,	
Wisconsin,	USA.	We	also	sell	to	customers	in	another	40	countries	through	
distribution	channels.	
Genus	operates	through	three	business	units:
•	 Genus	PIC	services	porcine	customers	in	North	America,	Latin	America		
and	Europe
•	 Genus	ABS	services	dairy	and	beef	customers	in	North	America,	Latin	
America	and	Europe
•	 Genus	Asia	focuses	on	the	fast-growing	Asian	market,	in	both	the	porcine	
and	bovine	segments
A	shared	research	and	development	function	supports	our	operating	divisions. Genus plc Annual Report 2013 | 05

Our Business Model
r obust Genetic improvement
Generating	robust	and	continuous	
genetic	improvement	is	at	the	
heart	of	our	business	model.	
We	are	leveraging	genomics	
to	accelerate	our	delivery	of	
valuable	genetic	improvements.	
In	porcine,	we	base	our	core	genetic	
improvement	programme	in	two	
nucleus	farms,	in	Canada	and	the	US.	
We	combine	quantitative	sciences	
with	leading-edge	biotechnology,	
while	adopting	a	‘discovery	without	
walls’	approach	to	external	genes,	
where	they	can	add	to	our	portfolio	
and	meet	customer	needs.
Our	dairy	and	beef	product	
development	creates	elite	bulls	
from	a	range	of	progeny-testing	
and	young-sire	programmes.	We	
are	adapting	our	genetic	selection	
programme	to	focus	on	traits	
of	high	economic	importance	
to	our	customers	and	to	gain	
greater	control	over	the	genes.	
These	development	programmes	
are	supported	by	our	research	
division,	which	aims	to	develop	
proprietary	technologies	in	areas	
such	as	gender	skew	and	disease	
resistance,	which	help	to	increase	
the	affordability	and	quality	of	pork,	
beef	and	milk.	We	employ	more	than	
100	scientists	and	skilled	technicians,	
and	have	a	track	record	of	working	
successfully	in	partnership	with	
universities,	consortia	and	others.	
r ealised Product Differentiation
Consumers	around	the	world	have	
different	preferences	and	our	
genetic	improvement	programmes	
deliver	a	wide	range	of	products	
and	services	tailored	to	them.	
Successful	product	development	
therefore	starts	from	our	customers’	
perspective.	Understanding	
their	needs	helps	us	to	develop	
outstanding	and	differentiated	
products	and	services,	and	we	aim	to	
get	our	products	to	market	quickly,	
so	we	can	rapidly	transfer	the	best	
genes	to	our	customers’	systems.	
Global s upply c hain
In	our	porcine	business,	we		
outsource	more	than	95%	of	our		
pig	multiplication	requirements		
to	third-party	producers	or	
customers.	Our	network	of	
multiplication	partners	is	a	
significant	strength,	allowing	us	
to	meet	demand	for	our	genetics	
while	reducing	our	exposure	to	
farming	and	commodity	risk.	
In	dairy	and	beef,	Genus	ABS	
leverages	both	its	distribution	and	
sales	networks	directly	with	in-
house	employees,	independent	
representatives	or	distributors,	to	
efficiently	reach	our	customers	
and	build	brand	loyalty.	
t echnical s upport s ervices
Ensuring	our	products	meet	
customers’	expectations	is	critical,	
so	experienced	technical	service	
teams	support	our	distribution	
and	sales	efforts.	These	teams	
ensure	the	product	is	right	and	
help	our	customers	to	achieve	the	
best	results.	This	creates	a	winning	
situation	for	us	and	our	customers,	
enhancing	customer	loyalty.	
We	support	our	customers	with	
technical	services	in	important	areas	
such	as	nutrition,	reproduction,	
health	management	and	genetics.	
For	example,	in	dairy,	our	global	
Genetic	Management	System	
helps	customers	through	sire	
selection,	to	create	the	progeny	
that	will	develop	their	herd	in	the	
way	they	wish.	Our	Reproductive	
Management	System	team	also	
helps	customers	to	improve	
reproduction,	a	critical	contributor	
to	their	profitability.	In	porcine,	we	
provide	performance	comparisons	
across	our	customers,	so	they	
can	benchmark	their	operational	
performance	and	the	impact	of	
genetics	against	industry	peers.
Key a ccount Management
In	porcine,	we	are	increasingly	
working	in	long-term	relationships	
with	our	customers,	under	multi-
year	royalty	contracts.	This	aligns	
our	goals	with	our	customers’	
key	performance	metrics,	as	
they	pay	Genus	based	on	the	
performance	and	value	we	deliver.	
It	also	reduces	volatility	in	our	
results,	by	mitigating	the	impact	
of	cyclical	price	reductions	or	
cost	increases	in	pig	production.	
In	2013,	74%	of	porcine	volumes	
were	under	royalty	contracts.
In	bovine,	we	sell	the	majority	of	
our	semen	on	a	per	dose	basis	and	
use	our	service	offerings	to	create	
longer-lasting	relationships.	Our	
customer	segmentation	and	focus	
on	account	management	allows	
us	to	increasingly	focus	on	the	
customers	who	place	the	highest	
value	on	these	relationships. 06 | Genus plc Annual Report 2013

A YEAR OF 
GOOD STRATEGIC 
PROGRESS
c hair Ma N’s st ate MeNt
BOB Laws ON
I	am	pleased	to	report	a	year	of	good	
progress,	as	we	implemented	the	
Group	strategy	that	we	introduced	
in	2012.	Following	last	year’s	record	
results,	financial	progress	was	more	
limited,	against	a	backdrop	of	very	
challenging	market	conditions	for	
the	Group’s	customers.	Despite	these	
tough	conditions,	Genus	continued	
to	invest	in	the	capabilities	it	needs	
to	capture	the	significant	long-term	
growth	opportunity	for	genetics.
The	strategy	and	organisational	
changes	arising	from	Karim’s	
strategic	review	gave	Genus	a	
sharp	focus	in	2013.	Aligning	the	
business	around	species	and	key	
customers	has	given	the	Group	a	
clarity	of	purpose	and	energy	that	
has	been	very	evident	to	the	Board.	
r esults
Genus’s	results	for	the	year	to	30	
June	2013	showed	modest	growth	
on	last	year’s	record	performance.	
Revenues	and	adjusted	operating	
profit	were	at	similar	levels	to	the	
prior	year,	while	adjusted	profit	
before	tax	rose	2%	to	£47.2m.	
Once	again,	Asia	led	the	way,	with	
profits	rising	by	14%.	However,	
high	feed	costs	and	low	output	
prices	for	our	customers	held	
back	performance	in	the	rest	of	
the	Group.	In	addition,	we	made	
planned	investments	in	resources	to	
strengthen	our	business.	Adjusted	
earnings	per	share	grew	3%	to	55p,	
benefiting	from	a	1%	lower	tax	rate.
On	a	statutory	basis,	profit	before	
tax	was	lower	than	the	previous	year,	
due	to	a	reduction	in	the	fair	value	
calculation	of	our	bovine	biological	
assets	under	IAS	41,	as	we	anticipate	
a	shift	towards	more	genomic	sales.	
The	prior	year	had	benefited	from	
an	IAS	41	exceptional	credit.	As	we	
have	consistently	said,	the	nature	
and	volatility	of	this	non-cash	
accounting	item	does	not	reflect	our	
underlying	business	performance.	
We	therefore	use	adjusted	profits	
to	report	externally	and	to	measure	
our	performance	internally.	
During	the	year,	we	reduced	net	
debt	to	£52.9m,	which	is	below	
one	times	EBITDA.	This	gives	
the	Group	substantial	financial	
flexibility	to	pursue	its	plans.
Dividend
The	Board	is	recommending	a	final	
dividend	of	11.1	pence	per	share,	
which	together	with	the	interim	
dividend	of	5	pence	per	share,	
would	result	in	a	dividend	for	the	
year	of	16.1	pence	per	share,	an	
increase	of	10%	over	last	year’s	
dividend.	This	continues	our	
progressive	dividend	policy	and	
reflects	the	Board’s	confidence	in	
Genus’s	future.	It	is	proposed	that	
the	final	dividend	will	be	paid	on	
6	December	2013,	to	shareholders	
on	the	register	at	the	close	of	
business	on	22	November	2013.
strategy
Following	his	appointment	in	
September	2011,	Karim	initiated	
a	thorough	strategic	review.	We	
announced	the	outcome	of	this	
process	in	May	2012.	Our	focus	in	
2013	has	been	to	implement	this	
strategy	and	to	invest,	so	that	Genus	
can	seize	the	significant	opportunities	
presented	by	the	growing	use	of	
genetics	to	make	animal	protein	
more	affordable	and	sustainable,	
to feed	a	growing	world	population.
As	I	reported	last	year,	the	
strategy	started	by	focusing	on	
our	customers’	needs.	To	serve	
them	better,	we	introduced	a	
new	organisation	that	aligned	our	
resources	around	species	and	key	
growth	areas,	with	a	particular	focus	
on	Asia.	This	has	enabled	us	to	
focus	on	disseminating	best	practice	
around	the	world,	whilst	adapting	our	
business	to	meet	the	unique	needs	
of	the	major	developing	nations.
Second,	we	renewed	our	emphasis	
on	leading	through	innovation	in	
research	and	development.	The	early	
results	of	this	investment	have	been

over	eight	years	and	contributed	
enormously	to	the	Group’s	progress	
over	this	time,	through	his	energy,	
wisdom	and	skill.	He	leaves	us	
with	our	deeply	felt	thanks	and	
very	best	wishes	for	the	future.
The	Board	was	pleased	to

Transforming Our 
Customers’ Herd Fertility 
Performance
We know that efficiently producing high 
genetic quality pregnancies drives herd 
profitability, and that customers’ goals 
and production systems vary. 
Our Reproductive Management System (‘RMS’) team 
therefore optimises customers’ herd pregnancies by 
providing tailored solutions based on sound science, 
training and vast field experience. 
In the UK and Ireland, RMS has grown rapidly to service 
686 farms, with nearly 170,000 cows or 10% of the 
national herd. The service is provided by 131 technicians, 
nine leaders and eight RMS trainers, supported by a 
technical services team.
Our unique combination of skilled people, accurate data and 
standardised working has transformed fertility performance. 
The average pregnancy rate for UK and Ireland RMS 
customers’ herds is 18%, well above the national average of 
14%. RMS has also hugely influenced herd expansion and our 
customers’ businesses. For example we have worked with 
Bowe Dairy Farming Company as a breeding company and 
farm consultants since 1998. Since then the business has 
grown from 80 to 600 cows. RMS has been an integral 
support to the business since 2007, helping the company 
achieve a pregnancy rate of 24%.

LAYING THE 
FOUNDATIONS 
FOR GROWTH
c hie F executive’s r ePOr t
Kari M Bitar
Last	year,	I	set	out	our	new	vision,	
strategy	and	organisation.	In	2013,	
we	made	substantial	progress	
implementing	the	strategy	and	
laying	the	foundations	for	growth.	
Aligning	the	organisation	by	species,	
giving	more	focus	to	research	
and	development	and	Asia,	and	
strengthening	our	core	capabilities	
have	been	very	well	received	by	
both	customers	and	employees.	
I am	encouraged	by	the	energy	and	
pace	of	change.	The	opportunity	for	
Genus	is	large	and	we	are	now	better	
placed	to	capture	a	growing	share.	
We	made	these	changes	in	a	
challenging	year	for	the	global	
agriculture	industry,	with	record	
feed	costs	holding	back	customer	
demand.	Despite	this,	Genus	was	able	
to	fund	its	investment	plans	while	
surpassing	last	year’s	record	results.
Group Performance
Revenue	was	1%	higher	than	in	2012,	
at	£345.3m.	Porcine	volumes	grew	by	
6%,	with	strong	increases	in	Asia	and	
particularly	in	China.	Bovine	volumes	
rose	5%,	driven	by	semen	produced	
in	India	at	lower	price	points.	Sales	of	
our	globally	produced	semen	grew	
1%,	held	back	by	poor	conditions	
in	Latin	America	in	the	first	half.
Adjusted	operating	profit	including	
joint	ventures	increased	by	1%	to	
£49.1m.	Higher	porcine	volumes	
drove	double-digit	profit	growth	
in	Asia.	Genus	PIC	grew	4%,	with	
positive	contributions	from	all	
regions	and	particular	strength	in	
Latin	America,	where	we	continue	
to	transition	customers	to	our	
royalty	model.	In	Genus	ABS,	
trading	was	challenging	and	profit	
declined	by	5%.	Drought	affected	
key	markets	including	Brazil	and	
North	America,	leading	to	subdued	
demand.	Research	and	development	
costs	increased	by	12%,	as	we	
invested	in	key	research	projects	
and	were	affected	by	high	feed	
costs	in	our	genetic	nucleus	farms.	
strategy 
The	strategy	we	defined	in	2012	
is	designed	to	deliver	our	vision	
of	‘Pioneering	animal	genetic	
improvement	to	help	nourish	the	
world’.	Our	focus	in	2013	has	been	
on	implementing	this	strategy.	
increasing Genetic c ontrol 
and Product Differentiation
In	2013,	we	became	the	first	
company	to	implement	single-
step	genomic	evaluation	across	
a	full	range	of	animal	traits	in	our	
porcine	business.	The	early	results	
are	very	encouraging,	with	the	
much	higher	accuracy	in	breeding	
programmes	more	than	doubling	
the	rate	of	genetic	improvement	
in	key	traits	such	as	litter	size.
In	dairy	product	development,		
we	have	established	a	very	
large	animal	database,	enabling	
us	to	produce	proprietary	and	
economically	focused	indices	
of	bull	merit,	specific	to	our	
customers’	needs.	In	North	
America,	we	launched	Real	World	
Data
TM
,	a	genetic	index	focused	
on	economic	traits	such	as	milk	
production,	fertility	and	lifetime	
feed	efficiency.	We	initiated	an	elite	
female	programme	to	gain	greater	
genetic	control	and	increased	the	
proportion	of	genomic	young	sires	
in	our	dairy	product	portfolio.
Our	research	programmes	focus	on	
areas	that	can	produce	step	changes	
in	product	differentiation,	including	
genomic	evaluations,	disease	
resistance	and	gender	skew.	Our	
‘discovery	without	walls’	approach	
has	continued	to	bring	the	best	
genetics	into	Genus	from	wherever	
we	find	them.
t argeting Key Markets and s egments
Over	half	the	world’s	porcine	market	
is	in	China.	To	build	a	business	
to	address	it	effectively,	we	have	
invested	in	high-health	production	
capacity	and	strengthening	
customer	relationships.	In	2013,	
we	opened	a	new	porcine	nucleus	
farm,	Chun	Hua,	stocked	with	the	
latest	North	American	genetics,	
to	reduce	the	genetic	lag	of	our	
Chinese	product	offering.	We	
recruited	a	general	manager	for	
our	porcine	business	in	China	and	
significantly	grew	the	team’s	size	
and	capability	across	all	disciplines.	
We	also	announced	two	joint	
ventures	with	customers,	to	provide	
multiplication	capacity	and	to	serve	
these	growing	integrated	pork	
producers.	The	first,	Besun,	is	now	
operational	and	delivering	very	
good	performance.	The	second,	with	
Shennong,	is	on	track	to	establish	
operations	in	a	new	farm	in	2014.	We	
continue	to	have	active	discussions	
with	other	customers	and	partners.	
Genus	also	made	good	progress	
in	a	wide	range	of	other	growth	
markets	in	2013,	including	the	
Philippines,	Russia	and	Mexico,	while	
in	the	important	North	American	
market	our	performance	was	solid	
in	both	porcine	and	bovine.
In	dairy,	we	are	focusing	on	ten	key	
markets	and	targeting	the	rapidly	
growing	large	commercial	and	
enterprise	farms.	This	segment	
requires	profit-focused	indices	
and	high-touch	technical	services.	
We	are	steadily	introducing	this	
model	in	the	US,	with	plans	to	
expand	it	in	other	key	markets.
t ailoring the Business Model
Our	focus	here	is	to	ensure	our	
products	meet	the	needs	of	our	
target	markets	and	to	implement	best	 Genus plc Annual Report 2013 | 13

practices	to	maximise	value	capture.	
For	example,	to	provide	differentiated	
high-merit	genetics	in	the	large	
Indian	dairy	market,	we	imported	
embryos	from	North	America	and	
now	have	four	young	bulls	and	a	
pipeline	of	further	pregnancies.
In	porcine	in	Europe,	we	have	
moved	away	from	direct	sales	of	
parent	gilts	and	rebuilt	our	team	to	
create	the	skills	and	structure	for	
an	indirect,	royalty-based	business,	
similar	to	our	successful	Americas	
porcine	business.	We	are	making	
clear	progress	and	this	transition	
will	gather	momentum	over	time.
strengthening c ore c ompetencies
We	have	implemented	globally	
consistent	organisations	
and	practices	in	key	account	
management,	technical	services	
and	supply	chain.	This	has	enabled	
us	to	spread	best	practice	to	
customers	around	the	world.	We	
have	strengthened	these	teams	with	
targeted	hiring	and	international	
assignments.	In	addition,	we	created	
a	marketing	organisation	to	improve	
product	branding	and	pricing.	
Lastly,	we	introduced	a	consistent	
performance	management	process	
across	geographies	and	functions,	to	
ensure	we	embed	our	values	and	to	
strengthen	our	performance	culture.
Our People
In	March	2013,	John	Worby	
retired	from	Genus.	I	would	like	
to	pay	tribute	to	his	outstanding	
contribution	and	to	thank	him	for	
helping	my	induction	to	the	Company	
and	for	assisting	Stephen	Wilson,	our	
new	Group	Finance	Director,	with	his	
seamless	transition	into	the	role.	John	
was	a	source	of	great	knowledge	
and	wisdom	and	we	wish	him	well.	
The	Genus	Executive	Leadership	
Team	(‘GELT’)	welcomed	three	
new	members	during	the	year.	In	
addition	to	Stephen,	Saskia	Korink	
Romani	joined	us	as	Chief	Marketing	
Officer	and	Tom	Kilroy	is	our	new	
Group	General	Counsel	&	Company	
Secretary.	Each	brings	a	wealth	
of	experience	and	talent	and	I	am	
delighted	with	the	way	that	they	
have	integrated	with	the	team.	In	
July	2013,	Ricardo	Campos,	the	
Chief	Operating	Officer,	Genus	ABS,	
decided	for	personal	reasons	to	step	
down	from	GELT	and	refocus	on	
the	important	Latin	America	ABS	
business.	His	passion	and	energy	will	
continue	to	be	valuable	to	Genus.	
Saskia	Korink	Romani	has	assumed	
the	role	of	acting	Chief	Operating	
Officer,	Genus	ABS,	to	provide	
leadership	to	our	bovine	business.
Over	the	course	of	the	year,	we	
introduced	new	Company-wide	
performance,	development	and	
talent	processes.	We	also	added	
strength	and	depth	by	recruiting	
many	talented	individuals.	I	would	
like	to	thank	all	employees	for	
their	commitment	to	our	new	
strategic	direction	and	for	delivering	
results	in	challenging	markets.	
Outlook
Good	harvests	are	predicted	in	the	
northern	hemisphere	which	should	
result	in	lower	input	costs	and	an	
improvement	in	profitability	in	the	
dairy,	beef	and	porcine	industries.	
We	expect	this	to	lead	to	a	gradual	
improvement	in	market	conditions	
for	our	customers	and	demand	for	
our	products.	We	therefore	expect	
the	second	half	of	this	fiscal	year	
to	be	stronger	than	the	first.	
Our	strategic	initiatives	better	
position	Genus	to	capture	the	
significant	growth	potential	in	
the	animal	genetics	market.	I	am	
confident	that	2014	will	be	a	year	
of	accelerating	progress,	both	
operationally	and	financially.

Helping Customers to 
Benefit from Our Genetic 
Improvements
Genus PIC’s Genetic Services team works 
with more than 150 customers around 
the world. 
It ensures customers understand the value that genetic 
improvement brings, helps them to optimise their use  
of our genetics, and encourages them to multiply our 
genetics quickly, so they can rapidly realise the benefits. 
Finally, the team manages on-farm implementation of  
our genetic programme in our customers’ herds.
Our commitment to delivering results for customers  
is evident in Genetic Services’s approach to hiring and 
training its people. In the last two years alone, the team 
has added five highly talented PhD geneticists from 
Asia, Europe, North America and Latin America. This 
focus on quality helps Genetic Services achieve notable 
results, with the rate of genetic improvement in North 
American boar studs doubling in 2013, compared with 
the three previous years.  Genus plc Annual Report 2013 | 15

CHALLENGING CONDITIONS 
IN 2013; FAVOURABLE 
LONG-TERM GROWTH 
DRIVERS
Mar Ket Overview
The	Food	and	Agriculture	
Organization	of	the	United	
Nations	(‘FAO’)	predicts	that	
global	demand	for	animal	protein	
will	double	by	2050,	driven	by	
population	and	income	growth	
in	developing	countries,	as	well	
as	urbanisation	and	changing	
consumption	patterns.	China,	India	
and	Russia	are	also	striving	to	
become	self-sufficient	in	protein,	
making	protein	production	a	
growth	industry	in	these	countries.
At	the	same	time,	protein	demand	
in	developed	countries	is	generally	
subdued,	as	a	result	of	ageing	and	
slowly	growing	populations,	together	
with	policy	changes	in	areas	such	as	
animal	welfare.	On	the	supply	side,	
high	feed	grain	prices	have	reduced	
livestock	producers’	margins,	and	
livestock	inventories	have	fallen	in	
some	of	the	major	meat-producing	
countries,	such	as	the	US.	
Tight	margins	in	both	bovine	and	
porcine	production	are	accelerating	
the	trend	for	industry	consolidation.	
The	need	for	production	yield	
increases	is	also	pushing	the	
industry	towards	larger	production	
units	and	more	sophistication	and	
professionalism,	increasing	the	need	
for	enhanced	farming	systems,	
nutrition,	bio-security	and	more	
efficient	farming	practices	in	general.
These	trends	create	favourable	
long-term	growth	opportunities	
for	our	value-added	genetics.	
2013 Global t rends
Despite	this	favourable	long-term	
backdrop,	market	conditions	in	2013	
were	especially	challenging	for	our	
customers.	The	US	drought	and	
poor	harvests	in	other	countries	
contributed	to	a	worldwide	surge	
in	input	cereal	prices.	During	the	
first	half	of	our	financial	year,	wheat	
prices	increased	by	21%,	soybean	
prices	went	up	by	29%	and	US	
corn	prices	rose	by	18%	compared	
with	the	previous	six	months.

During	the	second	half	of	our

which	should	mitigate	some	of	the	
volatility	experienced	over	the	last	
five	years.	As	a	result,	the	outlook	
for	input	prices	is	better	for	our	
customers	in	the	year	to	come.

The	global	pork	sector	has	
experienced	one	of	its	most	turbulent	
years	in	history,	with	dramatically

the	pork	producing	regions.	During	
the	first	half	of	our	financial	year,	
large	price	drops	occurred	in	the	US,	
Canada	and	South	Korea,	due	to	a	
relatively	large	seasonal	supply	boost	
and	the	beginning	of	herd	liquidation,	
as	hog	farmers	looked	to	limit	their	
losses	as	a	result	of	high	feed	costs.

festival	was	short-lived	and	the	
government	intervened	in	the		
market	to	stabilise	prices	
in	late	spring.	
Demand	for	pork	continues		
to	grow,	with	global	consumption		
rising	by	2%	per	annum.	The		
OECD-FAO	Agricultural	Outlook	
2013-2022	report	shows	that	in		
2022,	China	will	overtake	the		
EU	as	the	largest	per	capita	
consumer	of	pig	meat,	at	34kg		
per	person.	The	Chinese		
government	continues	to	use	
subsidies	to	accelerate	local	
production	of	more	competitive	
and	food-safe	pork,	although	
environmental	policy	on	reducing	
ammonia	and	nitrogen	emissions	
from	animal	husbandry	will	make	
pig	production	more	costly.	In	these	
conditions,	larger	farming	systems	
are	expanding	and	the	outlook		
for	pork	prices	seems	stable		
to	positive.	
Dairy and Beef 
At	the	start	of	our	financial	year,	dairy	
farmers	were	left	between	break-
even	and	loss-making,	depending	
on	the	region	and	their	exposure	to	
feed.	This	was	a	result	of	low	milk	
prices	and	high	feed	costs.	Global	
dairy	commodity	prices	saw	a	strong	
recovery	during	the	course	of	our	
financial	year.	The	Fonterra	auction	
price,	for	example,	peaked	at	83%	
above	June	2012	price	levels.	In	all	
markets,	reduced	supply	was	the	main	
cause	of	rising	prices,	with	drought	
in	New	Zealand	–	the	largest	milk	
exporter	–	a	particular	contributor.	
Milk	production	is	expected	to	return	
to	modest	growth	in	most	regions,	
given	higher	farmgate	milk	prices	
compared	to	twelve	months	ago	and	
lower	feed	costs.	Demand	will	recover	
to	0%	to	2%	growth,	depending	on	
the	region,	led	by	emerging	markets	
and	the	US.	In	the	EU,	demand	
will	be	subdued	given	higher	dairy	
prices	and	sluggish	economies.
In	the	beef	market,	the	Rabobank	
Global	Cattle	Price	Index	was	down	
6%	relative	to	Q1	2013	after	a	period	
of	some	stability.	This	was	the	
result	of	a	worldwide	downtrend	
in	cattle	prices,	particularly	in	two	
important	export	countries,	Australia	
and	Brazil.	Worldwide,	industry	
performance	has	been	mixed,	with	
some	companies	in	Brazil	and	other	
Latin	American	countries	achieving	
reasonable	margins	due	to	relatively	
strong	exports	to	China	on	the	back	
of	a	weakening	Real.	In	the	US,	high	
feed	cost	reduced	performance	
and	supply	decreased,	driven	by	
drought-induced	herd	liquidations.	
European	demand	for	real	beef	was	
boosted	by	the	‘horse-gate’	scandal.	
In	China,	beef	demand	is	strong,	
pulling	in	imports	from	countries	like	
Uruguay,	Australia	and	New	Zealand.
However,	the	broader	picture	for	
demand	still	points	to	tempered	
consumer	appetite,	as	beef	prices	
have	risen	relative	to	chicken	
and	pork,	while	increases	in	
disposable	income	worldwide	
appear	to	be	slowing.

strategy	to	capture	
the	very	significant	
growth	opportunities	
in	the	animal	genetics	
market,	particularly	in	
the	BRIC	countries.	
Our	strategy	for	
growth	has	four	
elements:
Increasing	
Genetic	Control	
and	Product	
Differentiation
Targeting	Key	
Markets	and	
Segments
Tailoring	the	
Business	Model
Strengthening	
Core	
Competencies
Aim: to maintain our 
products’ lead over 
our competitors. 
Aim: to make sure we 
have the right offer for 
the right customers.
Aim: to adapt our approach 
to suit different markets 
and customer segments.
Aim: to have the core 
competencies we need to 
implement our strategy.
We do this by:
•	 understanding	our	
customers’	requirements	
and	building	an	R&D	
programme	and	supply	
chain	to	support	them;
•	 enhancing	our	use	of	
genomics	in	our	breeding	
programmes,	to	strongly	
accelerate	the	rate	of	
genetic	improvement;
•	 investing	in	proprietary	
technologies,	with	a	focus	
on	disease	resistance	and	
gender	skew,	to	boost	
commercial	viability	
and	productivity;	and
•	 collaborating	with	
universities,	research	
institutes	and	biotechnology	
companies,	to	explore	
the	latest	developments	
in	quantitative	and	
molecular	genetics.
We do this by:
•	 ensuring	we	have	the	right	
products,	in	the	critical	
geographies,	to	meet	
the	needs	of	our	target	
customers,	typically:
	 – 	 integrated	pork	producers	
and	farrow-to-finish	
pig	producers
	 – enterprise	and	large	
commercial	dairies
•	 aligning	our	products	and	
services	to	key	customer	
segments,	which	value	our	
genetics	and	value-added	
technical	services;	and
•	 seeking	further	growth	
in	the	BRIC	economies,	
while	strengthening	our	
position	with	customers	in	
more	mature	markets	such	
as	the	US	and	Europe.
We do this by:
•	 developing	products	that	
meet	each	market’s	specific	
requirements,	such	as	a	
need	for	leaner	meat	or	
better	flavour	in	porcine,	or	
increased	milk	yields	in	dairy;
•	 ensuring	we	have	the	right	
commercial	model,	notably:
	 – evaluating	carefully	when	
to	transition	from	direct	
sales	to	royalties	in	our	
porcine	business;	and
	 – adjusting	our	dairy	and	
beef	customer	interface,	
based	on	cost	to	serve	and	
customer	segmentation
•	 working	with	joint	venture	
partners	to	access	or	
create	capacity	to	serve	
new	markets	such	as	
porcine	in	China.
We do this by:
•	 developing	our	
marketing	capability	and	
strengthening	our	key	
account	management;
•	 strengthening	our	supply	
chain	allowing	us	to	be	
more	cost	effective	and	able	
to	deploy	genetics	more	
efficiently	to	our	customers;
•	 stepping	up	our	technical	
support	to	customers;	and
•	 enhancing	our	people	
through	performance	and	
talent	management,	and	
by	transferring	people	and	
skills	to	key	target	markets. Genus plc Annual Report 2013 | 19

Pioneering Improved 
Genetics in India
BG Chitale is the largest dairy processor in 
the Maharashtra region of India, which has 
a population of 112 million. The company 
has a passion for making Indian dairy 
farmers more productive, through 
technology and the best genetics. 
“The US achieves 10,000 litres of milk per cow but India 
is at about 2,000 litres,” explains Vishvas Chitale, CEO, 
BG Chitale. “We have around 50,000 farmers supplying 
us with milk. If we can reduce the number of animals they 
need, they will remain in business and get better returns. 
And fewer cows means lower greenhouse gas emissions 
and a greener world.”
To do this, BG Chitale is focused on improving genetics 
and operates one of India’s few private artificial 
insemination studs. For the last three years, it has worked 
with Genus to increase annual semen production from 
200,000 to 1.8 million units. “We need a partner who  
can help us improve animal productivity through the  
best genetics,” says Vishvas. “It was a natural choice  
to go with the best in the field.”
Our strategy is to deliver value-added and differentiated 
products for India. We have created a pipeline of new 
bulls by importing embryos from North America, with  
the first bull (‘Pioneer’) born in August 2012. We have  
also genomically tested several young bulls – a first for 
the Indian dairy industry.

ExTENDING OUR 
LEADERSHIP
The	porcine	industry’s	globalisation	continues	to	create	significant	
opportunities	for	Genus	PIC	to	deliver	added	value	to	the	leading	
producers	of	today	and	tomorrow.	
Although	2013	was	a	very	challenging	
year,	with	record	feed	input	costs	
causing	many	producers	to	lose	
money,	we	continued	to	invest	in	
product	development	and	technical	
services	initiatives	required	to	
help	our	growing	global	customer	
base	become	stronger	and	more	
differentiated	in	their	regions.	
Despite	the	difficult	economic	
environment	for	many	of	our	
customers,	Genus	PIC	grew	its	
profit	by	4%	on	volume	growth	of	
3%	in	the	year.	We	also	made	strong	
progress	against	our	strategic	
objectives,	as	detailed	below.

GeNus r &D
Dr Denny Funk
Chief Scientific Officer, Genus R&D
Disease	
Resilience
Genus and The Roslin 
Institute, University 
of Edinburgh, have 
embarked on a multi-year 
collaborative research 
agreement, focusing on 
genetic improvement in 
resilience to disease.
We	are	working	on	research	projects	
to	deliver	animals	that	are	more	
robust	or	less	affected	by	diseases	
such	as	porcine	reproductive	and	
respiratory	syndrome	(‘PRRS’),	porcine	
influenza	and	African	swine	fever.
Gender	
Skewing
Genus is actively pursuing 
sexed semen R&D to 
deliver an improved and 
more efficient bovine 
product offering, as well 
as enabling a practical 
method for producing 
sexed porcine semen.
Sexed	semen	has	great	potential	
value	in	countries	like	India,	where	
demand	for	milk	is	growing	at	4%	per	
year.	Our	aim	is	to	double	the	number	
of	heifers	available	for	replacement	
or	herd	expansion,	while	minimising	
the	number	of	male	calf	births.
Genomic	
Selection
Genomic selection 
uses genetic markers, 
called single-nucleotide 
polymorphisms, to increase 
the frequency with which we 
identify elite individuals to 
use in breeding programmes.
We	genotype	tens	of	thousands	of	
animals	each	year,	combining	genetic	
markers	with	traditional	performance	
and	pedigree	information	in	state-of-
the-art	genetic	evaluation	programmes,	
called	single-step	genomic	evaluations.	
These	sophisticated	computer	
programs	accurately	rank	individual	
animals’	genetic	merit	for	traits	of	high	
economic	value	to	our	customers,	
such	as	prolificacy	and	robustness. Genus plc Annual Report 2013 | 29

t he Genus Product a dvantage
Our	research	is	all	about	turning	
science	into	differentiated	and	value-
added	products	for	our	customers.	
We	frequently	benchmark	ourselves	
against	our	competitors,	to	ensure	we	
are	delivering	the	product	advantages	
our	customers	expect	from	us.	
For	example,	when	we	compare	
the	economic	advantages	from	
weaning	through	carcass	value,	PIC’s	
genetics	consistently	outperform	
our	competitors,	generating	
more	profit	for	our	customers.
Dairy	customers	also	look	to	ABS	
for	the	best	and	most	reliable	
genetics	in	the	industry.	ABS	has	
more	high-ranking	daughter	proven	
bulls	than	any	of	our	competitors.

t he Power of s ingle-step 
Genomic evaluations
Genomics	helps	us	to	
estimate	an	animal’s	genetic	
merit	more	accurately,	so	we	
can	drive	improvement.	We	
consider	more	than	35,000	
genetic	markers,	creating	
billions	of	data	points	
across	tens	of	thousands	
of	animals.	Combining	all	
the	data	is	complex	but	it	
has	increased	the	accuracy	
of	estimates	for	traits	such	
as	pig	litter	size	by	68%.
Dr	Selma	Forni	is	one	
of	the	scientists	leading	
our	single-step	genomic	
evaluations.	“I was	
challenged	to	transform	
complex	genome	data	into	
a	simple	tool,	to	deliver	
value	to	our	customers.	
It	is	a	great	example	
of	Genus	transforming	
scientific	knowledge	into	
real-world	solutions.”

In	the	year	ended	30	June	2013,	
Genus	delivered	a	solid	performance	
which	surpassed	last	year’s	
strong	results,	while	investing	in	
implementing	its	new	strategy.	
Revenue	was	1%	ahead	of	last	year	
at	£345.3m	and	adjusted	profit

continue	to	use	adjusted	operating

•	 net	IAS	41	valuation	movement	in	
biological	assets;
•	 amortisation	of	acquired	intangible

Revenue	rose	1%,	from	£341.8m	
to	£345.3m.	Revenue	growth	was	
particularly	strong	in	Asia,	with	a	
15%	increase,	more	than	offsetting	
lower	revenues	in	Genus	PIC	in	
Latin	America	and	Europe,	which	
were	due	to	an	increased	mix	of	
royalty	business	and	the	planned	
exit	from	the	European	parent	gilt

focus	on	higher	value	business.

Adjusted	operating	profit,	including	
joint	ventures,	increased	by	1%	
(2%	in	constant	currency)	to

profit	before	tax	increased	by	
2%	to	£47.2m	(2012:	£46.5m).	
Profit	growth	was	strongest	in	Asia	
as	a	result	of	significant	porcine	
volume	growth,	especially	from	
new	stockings	in	China,	leading	to	
a	14%	increase	in	profits	to	£12.3m.	
In	Genus	PIC,	profits	increased	by	
4%	to	£48.2m.	This	was	driven	by	
strong	double	digit	growth	in	Latin	
America,	as	a	result	of	a	higher	mix	
of	royalty	business.	In	Genus	ABS,	
profits	fell	5%	to	£22.8m,	reflecting	
difficult	market	conditions,	caused	
by	higher	feed	costs	and	low	milk	
prices	in	key	markets	such	as	the	
US	and	parts	of	Latin	America,	and	
the	severe	weather	conditions	which

increased	investment	in	research	
activities,	particularly	in	relation	to	
genomic	evaluation	work.	Product	
development	costs	in	porcine	were

Net	finance	costs	reduced	by	
£0.2m	to	£1.9m	(2012:	£2.1m).	The	
reduction	reflected	the	combination	
of	lower	net	borrowings	and	a	
reduced	average	interest	rate.	
Next	year,	a	change	in	accounting	
standard	(IAS	19	revised)	will	lead	
to	a	significantly	higher	non-cash	
pension	interest	charge,	with	an	
offsetting	gain	in	the	Statement	
of	Comprehensive	Income.	As	a	
result,	we	expect	an	increase	in	
finance	costs	of	approximately	£4m	
in	2014	and	a	restatement	of	prior	
year	results	on	the	same	basis.
exceptional items
There	was	a	£4.2m	(2012:	£0.9m)	
net	exceptional	credit	this	year.	
This	comprises	two	elements:
1.	a	restructuring	charge	of	£2.8m,	
principally	relating	to	the	
restructuring	of	our	European	
porcine	business,	to	implement	our	
strategy	of	focusing	on	larger	
integrated	customers	and	exiting	
the	parent	gilt	business;	and	
2.	during	the	year,	the	multi-employer	
Milk	Pension	Fund	(‘MPF’)	triennial	
valuation	as	at	31	March	2012	was	
completed	and	a	new	funding	
agreement	between	the	employers	
was	agreed.	In	addition,	two	
participating	employers	exited	the	
scheme	and	made	cash	payments	
of	£31m.	These	changes	gave	rise	
to	an	exceptional	credit	of	£7m.	
This	credit	reflects	Genus’s	share	of	
deficit	repair	contributions	agreed	
in	the	valuation	and	the	effect	of	
the	two	employers’	exits,	compared	
with	the	pension	provision	of	
£20.1m	made	in	the	previous	year	
to	recognise	the	risk	that	some	
employers	could	be	unable	to		
meet	their	share	of	the	deficit.	
Biological a ssets
A	feature	of	the	Group’s	net	assets	is	
a	substantial	investment	in	biological	
assets,	which	are	required	by	IAS	41	
to	be	held	at	fair	value.	At	30	June	
2013,	the	carrying	value	of	biological	
assets	was	£289.0m	(2012:	£282.2m),	
as	set	out	in	the	table	below:

Represented by:
Porcine 117.5 107.6
Dairy and beef 171.5 174.6

The	movement	in	the	overall	
carrying	value	of	biological	assets	
excluding	the	effect	of	exchange	
rate	translation	changes	includes	a	
£4.4m	increase	in	the	carrying	value	
of	porcine	biological	assets	and	a	
£9.3m	decrease	in	dairy	and	beef	
biological	assets.	In	porcine,	the	
increase	is	due	principally	to	higher	
value	animals,	particularly	boars,	in	
the	pure	line	herds.	The	decrease	
related	to	dairy	and	beef	is	mainly	
due	to	an	expected	increase	in	sales	
of	genomic	young	sires	over	time,	
meaning	that	less	of	Genus’s	future

statutory Profit Before t ax
Operating	profit	on	a	statutory	basis	
was	£37.2m,	compared	with	£54.2m	
last	year.	The	statutory	profit	before	
tax	was	£38.1m	(2012: £54.4m).	These	
statutory	results	reflect	the	impact	
of	the	exceptional	items	discussed	
above	and	the	net	fair	value	debit	
on	biological	assets	under	IAS	41	
of	£4.9m	(2012:	credit	including	
exceptional	item	£38.8m),	as	
explained	above.	The	Board	believes	
the	volatile	non-cash	nature	of	these	
items	is	not	representative	of	the	
Group’s	underlying	performance.	
The	performance	as	measured	by	
adjusted	operating	profit	including	
joint	ventures	showed	growth	
of	1%,	and	adjusted	profit	before	
tax	showed	growth	of	2%.	
t axation
The	effective	rate	of	tax	for	the	
year,	based	on	adjusted	profit	
before	tax,	was	30%	(2012:	31%),	
with	the	decrease	primarily	due	
to	higher	R&D	tax	credits	and	
lower	UK	statutory	rates.
The	effective	rate	remains	higher	
than	the	UK	corporate	tax	rate.	
This	is	due	to	the	mix	of	overseas	
profits,	particularly	the	proportion	
of	profits	generated	in	North	
America,	where	the	statutory	
tax	rate	is	approximately	39%.
earnings Per s hare
Adjusted	basic	earnings	per	
share	rose	by	3%	to	55.0	pence	
(2012:	53.5	pence)	reflecting	
the	increase	in	profit	before	
tax	and	the	lower	tax	rate.
Basic	earnings	per	share	on	a

(2012:	65.9	pence),	and	were	affected

Dividend
The	Board	is	recommending	to	
shareholders	a	final	dividend	of	
11.1 pence	per	ordinary	share.	Taking	
into	account	the	interim	dividend	
of	5.0	pence	per	share	paid	in	April	
2013,	this	will	result	in	a	total	dividend	
for	the	year	of	16.1	pence	per	ordinary	
share,	representing	an	increase	
of	10%	for	the	year	as	a	whole.	
Subject	to	shareholder	approval	at	
Genus’s	forthcoming	Annual	General	
Meeting,	this	dividend	will	be	paid	
on	6	December	2013	to	shareholders	
on	the	register	at	the	close	of

Latin	America	and	Europe.	It	also	
includes	the	technical	services	and	
supply	chain	functions	supporting	
the	porcine	business	globally.
Market
Market	conditions	during	2013	
were	very	challenging	in	North	
America,	with	high	feed	prices	and	
low	slaughter	prices	pushing	the	
industry	into	losses.	As	a	result,	
customers	put	expansion	plans	on	
hold	and	delayed	genetic	updates	
within	royalty	contracts.	In	Latin	
America,	conditions	were	more	
favourable,	with	pig	prices	higher	
than	historical	averages.	In	Europe,	
the	impact	of	higher	feed	costs	
was	reduced	by	rising	pig	prices,	
as	industry	capacity	reduced	as	
sow	stalls	were	phased	out.	
Performance
Volumes	grew	by	3%,	with	
particularly	strong	growth	in	Latin	
America.	However,	revenue	fell	
by	3% to	£133.5m	due	to	limited	
customer	expansions,	the	continuing	
move	to	royalty	contracts	and	the	
exit	from	low-margin	parent	gilt	
sales.	Operating	profit	increased	by	
4%	and	operating	margin	improved	
by	two	percentage	points	to	36%	
as	our	business	model	continued	
its	favourable	shift	to	a	royalty	
basis.	In	addition,	we	successfully	
pursued	the	CBVPlus	and	CBVMax	
programmes	to	produce	boars	of	
high	genetic	merit,	delivering	margin	
improvements	while	providing	a	
better	quality	product	to	customers.		
North	American	profits	were	up	
3%	on	a	2%	increase	in	volumes.	
Royalty	income	was	4%	higher	than	
the	previous	year,	compensating	
for	lower	animal	sales,	which	were	
suppressed	by	a	lack	of	expansion	
activity	in	a	tough	market.	
In	Latin	America,	volumes	grew	
by	10%,	with	significant	progress	
on	conversions	to	royalty	
contracts,	pushing	profits	up	
21%	and	substantially	improving	
margins	across	the	region.	
Our	joint	venture	in	Brazil	had	
a	successful	year	and	progress	
continues	with	converting	more	
customers	to	the	royalty	model.		
As a	result,	profits	increased	by	14%.	
The	planned	restructure	of	the	
European	business,	to	target	the	
larger	integrated	pork	producers	and	
reduce	exposure	to	directly	owned	
operations,	continued	apace	and	
is	expected	to	yield	further	profit	
improvements	in	2014.	During	the	
year,	the	owned	farm	in	the	Czech	
Republic	was	franchised	and	several	
other	cost-saving	initiatives	were	
undertaken.	Despite	the	reduction	in	
volumes	from	the	Czech	operation,	
volumes	were	up	2%	for	the	region,	
driven	by	increases	in	Germany	
and	Spain.	The	restructuring	
activities	have	reduced	revenue	but	
improved	profits	and	margins. Genus plc Annual Report 2013 | 37

Genus	ABS	comprises	the	Group’s	
dairy	and	beef	business	in	North	
America,	Latin	America	and	Europe.	
It	also	includes	the	technical	services,	
marketing,	production	and	supply	
chain	functions	supporting	the	
dairy	and	beef	business	globally.
Market 
High	feed	costs	and	low	milk	prices	
in	all	the	key	markets	created	difficult	
conditions,	with	many	customers	
trending	towards	breakeven	through	
the	year.	While	there	was	a	recovery	
in	prices	in	the	second	half	of	the	
fiscal	year,	customer	confidence	
was	slow	to	return.	Certain	markets	
such	as	Brazil	were	substantially	
affected	by	unusual	weather,	which	
disrupted	normal	breeding	seasons.
Performance
The	dairy	and	beef	business	had	
a	difficult	year,	experiencing	a	
combination	of	adverse	weather	
conditions,	particularly	in	Latin	
America,	and	lower	milk	prices,	
affecting	the	demand	for	dairy	
semen.	Overall,	volumes	for	Genus	
ABS	were	down	1%,	principally	driven	
by	Brazil,	but	partially	offset	by	
improvement	in	Europe.	Effective	
sales	management	enabled	a	small	
improvement	in	average	selling	
prices	across	the	Group,	with	average	
sales	prices	up	2%	overall,	leading	
to	an	increase	in	revenue	of	1%.	
In	North	America,	profits	were	up	
5%	on	volumes	and	blends	which	
were	essentially	flat	on	last	year,	
due	to	a	strong	focus	on	increasing	
efficiencies	and	cost	management.	
In	Europe,	4%	growth	in	volumes	
was	achieved	with	modest	blend	
increases	driven	by	France	and	Italy.	
Profits	were	2%	up	on	last	year.
Across	Latin	America,	extreme	
weather	conditions	affected	
customers	and	volumes	were	down	
6%	in	the	region.	This	decline	was	
driven	by	Brazil,	where	the	beef	
breeding	season	was	affected	and	
total	volumes	were	down	10%.	In	spite	
of	this,	average	sales	prices	increased	
on	last	year	and	market	share	
remained	stable.	Profits	declined	13%	
(down	6%	in	constant	currency).
Reflecting	the	above,	and	whilst	
there	was	a	continued	focus	
on	cost	management,	profits	in	
Genus	ABS	were	down	5%	on	last	
year	(3%	in	constant	currency)	as	
it	invested	in	technical	services	
and	marketing,	and	revamped	its	
global	supply	chain	function. 38 | Genus plc Annual Report 2013

Genus	Asia	includes	the	porcine	
and	bovine	businesses	across	the	
region.	In	addition	to	the	businesses	
in	China,	the	Philippines	and	India,	
the	region	also	includes	the	Group’s	
operations	in	Russia	and	Australia.
Market
In	China,	pork	prices	were	low	
through	the	year	after	the	record	
highs	enjoyed	last	year	and	it	is	
estimated	that	a	majority	of	farms	
were	loss	making	in	the	spring.	The	
government’s	inventory	purchase	
scheme	in	April	and	May	firmed	
prices	and	stabilised	the	market.
Elsewhere,	the	Russian	pig	industry	
experienced	a	difficult	year	as	
import	barriers	were	removed.	
Slaughter	prices	dropped	by	30%	
before	rallying	in	May	and	June,	and	
high	feed	prices	reduced	producer	
profitability.	In	the	Philippines,	
live	pig	prices	increased	by	13%	
as	a	result	of	supply	shortfalls,	
keeping	farmers	profitable.	
Australian	milk	prices	were		
low	through	the	year,	with		
many	producers	struggling.		
As	a	consequence,	there	has		
been	less	spend	on	breeding	
programmes.	Milk	prices		
in	China,	India	and	Russia		
were	stable.	
Performance
The	division	achieved	strong	growth	
across	the	region	in	the	porcine	
and	dairy	and	beef	businesses.	
Revenues	increased	by	15%	and	
operating	profits	(including	joint	
ventures)	by	14%	to	£13.1m.	This	was	
in	spite	of	substantial	investment	
in	key	skills	and	infrastructure,	to	
support	future	growth.	We	have	
strengthened	the	management	and	
supporting	functions	in	the	areas	
of	business	development,	supply	
chain	and	technical	services.
Volumes	grew	by	24%	in	porcine	
and	by	29%	in	dairy	and	beef.	
The	porcine	volume	growth	reflects	
particularly	strong	growth	in	upfront	
animal	sales	in	China,	including	
the	animals	transferred	to	Besun	
as	part	of	the	initial	stocking	of	
this	4,250-sow	nucleus	farm,	and	
in	the	Philippines,	where	volumes	
grew	by	54%,	as	we	pursued	
the	policy	of	converting	more	
customers	to	the	royalty	model.
In	China,	operating	profits	were	
up	38%	on	last	year,	after	bearing	
the	initial	start-up	costs	on	the	
new	Chun	Hua	genetic	nucleus	
farm,	which	has	been	established	
to	bring	Genus’s	latest	genetics	
into	the	Chinese	market.	
Milk	prices	were	stable	in	China,	India	
and	Russia,	and	steadily	increased	
in	most	of	our	other	key	dairy	
markets	in	Asia,	with	the	exception	
of	Australia.	This,	combined	with	
growing	demand,	resulted	in	the	
volume	of	semen	sold	by	our	dairy	
and	beef	business	increasing	by	29%.	
Semen	produced	locally	from	studs	
in	China,	India	and	Russia	was	the	key	
driver	of	this	growth,	supplemented	
by	higher	volumes	of	imported	
semen	from	Genus’s	global	studs.	
Our	Australian	business	struggled	
against	the	backdrop	of	low	milk	
prices	and	volumes	were	down	9%.
Considerable	strategic	progress	
was	made	in	the	region	during	the	
year	and	Genus	continues	to	pursue	
joint	venture	opportunities	in	China,	
to	maximise	the	opportunities	
presented	by	this	expanding	market.

Investment	in	research	and	product

higher	research	expenditure,	as	well	
as	further	investment	in	product	
development	to	ensure	our	products	
meet	customer	needs	and	keep	
us	ahead	of	our	competitors.
Genus’s	research	activities	during	the	
year	were	focused	on	the	following	
key	programmes:	genomic	evaluation	
and	selection,	gender	skew	and	
disease	resistance.	We	continue	to	
make	progress	in	all	these	areas.	
Porcine Product Development
Porcine	product	development	
costs	rose	principally	as	a	result	
of	higher	feed	costs,	net	of	
decreased	slaughter	revenue,	
as part	of	the	running	of	the	two	
nucleus	farms	in	North	America,	
and	increased	investment	in	
additional	product	validation	
trials,	focused	on	demonstrating	
our	product	differentiation.	
Leveraging	our	extensive	
proprietary	database	of	over	14	
million	performance	records,	we	
have	achieved	progress	in	single-
step	genomic	evaluation	in	our	
breeding	programme,	which	is	
improving	selection	accuracy	and	
speeding	up	the	rate	of	genetic	
progress.	In	addition,	we	have	
completed	the	development	of	
imputation	programmes	that	will	
allow	us	to	use	this	information	to	
genotype	an	even	larger	number	
of	animals	going	forward,	at	a	
much	lower	cost	per	animal.
Bovine Product Development
In	dairy	product	development,	we	
successfully	launched	proprietary	
customer-tailored	indexes	(Real	
World	Data™)	for	our	enterprise	
and	large	commercial	customers	
in	the	US,	and	have	since	
expanded	to	incorporate	data	
from	Mexico,	Chile,	Argentina,	
Brazil	and	UK.	This	will	provide	
a platform	to	tailor	differentiated	
customer-centric	products.	
Throughout	the	year,	we	were	
committed	to	increasing	the	
competitiveness	of	the	core	bull	
programme.	ABS	bulls	continued	to	
perform	well	in	the	national	rankings	
of	the	countries	where	we	progeny-
test.	In	the	US,	ABS	achieved	28 bulls	
(2012: 28)	in	the	internationally	
important	top	100	Net	Merit	rankings	
in	the	most	recent	sire	summary.	
The	UK	had	similar	results,	while	
Italy	contributed	with	some	key	bulls	
that	drove	additional	volume	and	
improved	prices.	In	China,	Genus	
leads	the	rankings	of	imported	bulls	
based	on	overall	genetic	merit.
Genus	also	introduced	more	genomic	
young	sires	into	its	portfolio,	
initiated	an	elite	female	programme	
to	gain	greater	genetic	control	
and	invested	in	additional	facilities	
to	support	these	programmes.

Our	risk	management	system	identifies	and	prioritises	risks	and	threats	to	
the	achievement	of	our	strategic	objectives.	We	respond	to	these	risks	
through	well-defined	mitigation	activities,	which	we	regularly	assess.
Progress a gainst 2013 Objectives
Last	year,	we	committed	to	
continuing	to	improve	our	risk	
management	system.	In	particular,	
we	planned	to:
•	 implement	Group-wide	reviews	of	
selected	risks	identified	on	the	
corporate	risk	register;	and	
•	 arrange	for	senior	operational	and	
financial	management	to	present	to	
the	Audit	Committee	or	Board	on	
the	risk	areas	they	own.	
In	2013,	we	delivered	on	these	
commitments	by:
•	 improving	the	process	of	
identifying	and	evaluating	risks,	by	
implementing	both	top-down	and	
bottom-up	methods;
•	 embedding	risk	management	into	
our	major	projects	and	change	
initiatives,	to	ensure	we	respond		
to	changes	in	our	operating	
environment;
•	 simplifying	our	internal	risk-
reporting	process	and	further	
aligning	it	to	our	decision-making	
process;	and
•	 providing	regular	updates	to	the	
Audit	Committee	and	Board	by		
risk	owners.
Our Priorities in 2014 
In	2014,	we	will	continue	to	review,	
refine	and	enhance	our	risk	
management	system.	In	particular,	
we	plan	to:
•	 further	embed	risk	management	
into	our	day-to-day	decision-
making	process;	and
•	 test	many	of	our	risk	mitigation	
activities	as	we	deliver	our	risk-

provide	assurance	that	these	are	
operating	effectively.

Developing Skilled and 
Capable People
Apex is our newest porcine genetic 
nucleus facility, located in South Dakota, 
USA. Construction began in 2008 and 
Apex produced its first litter the 
following year. 
The team now includes 55 full-time employees, making 
us the largest employer in an area where jobs are 
highly valued. Around 40% of the team are female.
At such an important facility, it is essential that we 
have well-trained and capable people. Training begins 
immediately, with new staff completing eight hours of 
orientation in their first two days. This covers health and 
safety, bio-security, animal welfare and a full site tour. 
Staff then spend their first month shadowing 
colleagues, so they can learn the processes and 
become proficient. During this time, they complete a 
further three hours of orientation, covering areas such 
as our Genus University and other online resources. 
Our successful approach has allowed us to fill all our 
departmental head positions with local people, who 
joined us with limited industry experience and who 
we have developed to take on management roles. The 
team has built up deep expertise in running this centre 
of elite porcine genetics, setting world-class standards 
that are the pride of the business and the industry.

CREATING THE 
FOUNDATIONS 
FOR GROWTH
Our PeOPLe
In	2013,	we	aligned	the	business	
behind	our	strategy	and	recruited	
high-calibre	people	to	lay	the	
foundations	for	growth.
a ligning the Business Behind 
the strategy
We	briefed	our	2,400	staff	on	
our	vision,	values	and	strategy,	
so	they	are	clear	and	confident	
about	our	future	and	their	part	in	
it.	Our	new	structure,	aligned	to	
our	customers	and	species,	has	set	
and	networked	global	standards	
in	Genus	PIC	and	Genus	ABS,	
and	has	been	a	key	contributor	to	
Genus	Asia’s	accelerated	growth.	
PIC	Genetic	Services,	which	works	
with	all	our	PIC	businesses,	is	
recognised	as	an	internal	beacon	
of	best	practice,	setting	standards	
and	delivering	training,	so	we	
continually	raise	performance.
We	introduced	performance	
management	for	our	leaders,	
setting	stretching	objectives	and	
having	high	quality	performance	
conversations	and	performance	
ratings,	to	help	employees	calibrate	
their	achievements.	This	has	
ensured	that	leaders	are	clear	on	
their	accountabilities	and	goals.	
Changes	to	remuneration	for	the	
Genus	Executive	Leadership	Team	
(‘GELT’)	have	been	cascaded	
to	managers’	rewards,	aligning	
them	with	strategic	delivery.
We	have	also	defined	and	shared	
the	competencies	we	need	in	
two	vital	areas,	key	account	
management	and	technical	service,	
and	are	using	them	for	recruitment,	
performance	and	development.
r esourcing for Growth
Genus	is	committed	to	recognising,	
developing	and	recruiting	new	talent.
During	the	year,	we	strengthened	
GELT	with	high-quality	recruits.	
Stephen	Wilson	replaced	John	
Worby,	who	retired	as	Group	Finance	
Director.	Saskia	Korink	Romani	joined	
to	develop	our	marketing	function	
across	species	and	subsequently	
took	on	the	role	of	acting	Chief	
Operating	Officer,	Genus	ABS.	
Tom	Kilroy,	our	new	Group	General	
Counsel	&	Company	Secretary,	
brings	intellectual	property	
expertise	and	global	experience.
We	also	recruited	talent	across	
the	global	teams,	strengthening	
our	supply	chain	function	in	Genus	
ABS	and	our	European	leadership	
and	product	development	in	
Genus	PIC.	In	Asia,	we	invested	
significantly	in	the	China	team.	We	
recruited	local	heads	for	operations	
in	China	dairy	and	porcine,	and	
in	Genus	ABS	India,	as	well	as	a	
new	finance	director	for	Asia.
Towards	the	end	of	the	financial	
year,	we	completed	our	first	talent	
plan,	focusing	on	our	top	100	leaders	
and	their	successors.	Our	talent	
plan	takes	into	account	diversity	
of	gender	and	backgrounds.
Our Priorities for 2014
We	will	continue	to	resource	for	
growth,	extending	the	talent	and	
succession	plan	to	around	half	
our	employees	and	focusing	on	
individuals	with	potential,	to	deliver	
on	our	commitment	to	develop	more	
leaders	from	within	the	business.	Our	
online	performance	management	
tool	has	also	been	extended,	and	
will	cover	more	than	2,000	staff	
this	year.	We	will	continue	to	
recruit,	with	investment	in	product	
development	and	sales	in	dairy,	and	
additions	to	our	marketing,	technical	
services	and	Chinese	teams.
Personal	growth	is	important	to	
our	staff,	so	we	will	deliver	key	
programmes	through	Genus	
University.	These	include:
•	 Key	Account	Manager	and	
Technical	Service	Academies		
for	Genus	ABS	and	Genus	PIC,	
networking	the	communities,	
sharing	best	practice	and		
raising	the	bar	through	global	
benchmarking	and	standard	setting;	
•	 management	development	
programmes	for	our	leaders;	and
•	 tailored	development	for	our	senior	
leaders	and	people	with	long-term	
potential	in	the	business.
We	will	perform	our	first	in-
house	employee	survey,	
creating	action	plans	based	on	
the	feedback.	We	also	aim	to	
improve	internal	communication,	
with	each	business	sharing	its	
customer	successes	and	financial	
performance,	and	networking	
the	teams	through	technology.
We	have	had	a	very	solid	year	of	
delivery,	with	full	commitment	from	
the	management	team	to	delivering	
our	key	initiatives.	We	embark	on	
the	second	year	of	our	people	plan	
with	much	more	experience	behind	
us	and	a	clear	understanding	of	
the	priorities	needed	to	continue	
to	support	our	strategic	delivery.

Providing the Highest 
Standards of Care
Our animals are our business, so we take 
excellent care of them.
The housing at our bull stud facility in Dekorra, Wisconsin, 
is designed to provide the best animal welfare and protect 
our employees’ safety.
The barns are globally qualified, so they meet the highest 
standards for international trade, animal health and 
bio-security. Side-curtain ventilation allows maximum air 
flow and the animals are freely housed in individual pens, 
giving them the greatest freedom of movement. We clean 
and rebed the pens three times a week. All feed is grown 
in fields free from animal waste and we store the feed 
securely, eliminating bio-security threats from wildlife.
The livestock workers at Dekorra average 27 years of 
service and the facilities are led by Darel Smith, who has 
worked for ABS for more than 30 years. To protect their 
wellbeing, we provide continuous training in safety, 
including bull handling, working in confined spaces 
and first responder training.

we	are	establishing	a	committee

It	will	be	chaired	by	Tom	Kilroy,	our

Secretary,	and	include	health	and	
safety,	environmental	and	animal

Health	and	safety	is	critically

develop	our	approach.	We	have	a	
global	team	of	health	and	safety	
advisors	and	are	working	to	align	
our	efforts	and	share	best	practice.	
During	the	year,	our	first	Global	
Health	and	Safety	Conference	
focused	on	incident	trends,	risk	
assessment,	training,	communication	
and	aligning	for	the	future.	We	
developed	a	new	Health	and	Safety	
General	Policy	Statement,	detailing	
responsibilities	at	all	levels.	A	
further	17	policies,	which	set	out	
our	health	and	safety	framework

We	look	to	continuously	improve.

engage	employees	in	health	and	
safety.	Monthly	management	
reports	will	allow	us	to	measure

employee	newsletters	will	explain	
health	and	safety	successes	and	
opportunities.	As	we	roll	out	our	
global	policies,	we	will	bring	the	
principles	alive	through	training.
In	2014,	we	will	also	use	our	global	
SMS	to	track	facility	audits	and	
their	outcomes.	We	have	more	than	
50	facilities,	ranging	from	offices	
to	production	units.	Our	goal	is	to	
visit	every	facility	at	least	once,	
to	ensure	we	meet	the	highest	
standards	and	follow	regulations.	
In	most	locations,	a	site-level	safety	
committee	reviews	the	facility	
audit	reports,	the	actions	required	
and	the	results	of	those	actions.
Genus’s	best	practice	farm	and	
animal	handling	protocols	reflect	
our	industry	leadership.	In	2014,	
we	will	focus	on	incorporating	
all	protocols	into	one	uniform	
structure	and	making	them	
more	readily	available	to	staff.
t he environment
Genus	is	committed	to	conducting	
business	in	ways	that	are	sensitive	to	
the	environmental	needs	of	our	local	
communities.	Our	locations	therefore	
integrate	environmental	management	
into	their	systems	and	procedures.	
Monitoring	and	reporting	our	
environmental	performance	is	
integral	to	our	operations	and	our	
risk	management	programme.	
We	assess	the	environmental	risks	
associated	with	existing	and	new	
facilities,	and	establish	controls	to	
keep	risks	at	acceptable	levels.	We	
train	employees	at	our	facilities	
in	environmental	compliance	and	
have	comprehensive	environmental	
protocols	at	our	facilities,	which	
are	subject	to	independent	checks.	
During	the	year,	we	had	independent	
checks	at	PIC’s	farms	in	North	
America	and	the	Besun	farm	in	China.
Genus	ABS	is	required	to	comply	with	
local	legislation	governing	manure	
storage,	and	the	rate	and	timing	of	
manure	application	to	land	on	which	
we	grow	feed	crops.	We	complete	
annual	audits	and	file	reports	with	
the	relevant	authorities	as	required.

Genus	aims	to	be	valued	by	its

We	work	hard	to	provide	interesting

Genus executive Leadership t eam
Over the last year, we have 
enhanced the Genus Executive 
Leadership Team (‘GELT’), appointing 
executives who bring new skills 
and expertise to an already strong 
team. GELT sets our vision and 
culture, leads our strategic delivery 
and demonstrates the values 
at the heart of our business.
GeLt ’s r esponsibilities
In 2012, GELT developed Genus’s 
vision and values, which are 
described on pages 1 and 6. 
We have now fully embedded 
them in the business, giving the 
entire Genus team a clear and 
compelling purpose and direction.
GELT ensures organisational 
alignment, engagement and efficient 
execution throughout the Group. 
This involves crucial commercial, 
scientific, operational and people 
decisions. Equally important is GELT’s 
stewardship of Genus’s reputation, 
ethical working and compliance. 
GELT is focused on delivering the 
following:
•	 corporate strategy – developing 
and implementing our strategy to 
achieve sustained growth, and 
strengthening key capabilities such 
as our world-class product 
development;
•	 operations management – driving 
organisational results, with 
operational excellence; ensuring 
core processes are reliable and 
efficient; regularly reviewing R&D 
plans; managing risk, including risk 
mitigation; and managing the 
Genus balanced scorecard, 
including customer equity metrics;
•	 people – developing high-
performing teams by rigorous 
selection, development and setting 
stretching goals, together with 
nurturing talent to bring through 
the next generation of leaders; and 
•	 resources – astute and judicious 
investment in the business, 
including capital expenditure 
and human resources.
divisional structure
In FY 2013, we implemented a 
new divisional structure, which 
is aligned to our strategy. This 
has proved highly effective, 
supporting the acceleration of our 
strategy and growth, particularly 
in developing markets. Through a 
matrix design, we have leveraged 
our global expertise to network 
best practice, set global standards 
and raise performance across the 
business units and Asia. This has 
enabled us to deliver a solid year of 
performance in the following areas:
•	 insight-driven research;
•	 strong product development;
•	 strategic marketing;
•	 sales and technical services, 
targeted at key customer 
segments;
•	 supply-chain optimisation; and
•	 continued focus on developing 
markets.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
LETTER f ROm Th E Ch AiRmAN
Corporate governance plays a 
vital role in business success, 
and I am pleased to report that 
the standard of governance 
in Genus remains high.
Good corporate governance allows 
boards to direct their companies 
effectively, entrepreneurially and 
prudently, to deliver long-term 
success. The strategy and business 
must therefore be the starting point 
for the Company’s governance 
approach. Corporate governance 
should be a facilitator, providing 
the framework within which the 
Company can operate successfully.
Complying with the Code
The UK Corporate Governance 
Code (the ‘Code’) supports this 
view. We strongly believe that its 
principles-based approach is the 
right one. It gives companies the 
flexibility to develop governance 
arrangements that suit them and 
allows shareholders to judge if those 
arrangements are appropriate.
We have continued to comply 
with all the provisions in the 2010 
edition of the Code, which was 
the applicable standard for this 
financial year. The 2012 Code 
will apply from our next financial 
year onwards and we expect 
to be fully compliant with it.
Evaluating the Board’s 
Effectiveness
Complying with the Code, however, 
is only one element of good 
governance. It is also important 
that the Board operates effectively 
and this year we had a rigorous 
external evaluation. This found that 
the Board works well, with a number 
of particular strengths as well as 
areas where we can develop. More 
information about the evaluation 
can be found on page 56.
Strengthening Our  
management Team
There was one change to the Board 
during the year. John Worby retired 
as Group Finance Director, with 
Stephen Wilson joining us to take 
up the role. We were delighted to 
recruit Stephen, who brings strong 
financial and business development 
skills, experience of working in large 
global enterprises and a record of 
building sound finance teams.
Since the end of the financial year, 
Tom Kilroy has joined Genus as 
Group General Counsel & Company 
Secretary. Tom brings essential 
legal and commercial skills to 
the Group, including valuable 
experience of optimising and 
protecting intellectual property.
Considering Diversity
As Genus grows, we need to 
ensure that the Board evolves 
to keep pace. We are therefore 
beginning the process of recruiting 
a Non-Executive Director with 
an international background. We 
are fully aware of Lord Davies’s 
recommendations about gender 
diversity and always take this 
into account when recruiting. We 
also need to consider diversity 
in its broadest sense and ensure 
that we have the right spread of 
skills for the business. This year’s 
evaluation found that the Directors 
have a complementary mix of skills 
and experience, which enable a 
knowledgeable dialogue about 
the Group and its markets.
Summary
In summary, the Board is committed 
to maintaining high standards 
of corporate governance. We 
will continue to develop our 
governance framework, so we can 
effectively support the successful 
implementation of our strategy.

Board membership and Roles
The Board is responsible for managing the Group. We 
currently have two Executive Directors, an independent 
Non-Executive Chairman and three other independent 
Non-Executive Directors. The Directors’ biographies 
appear on pages 50 and 51.
The Board has approved clearly defined roles and 
responsibilities for our Chairman and Chief Executive.  
Bob Lawson, our Chairman, is primarily responsible for 
running the Board. Karim Bitar, our Chief Executive, is 
responsible for achieving our operational and financial 
targets and for implementing our strategy.
Nigel Turner is our Senior Non-Executive Director. He  
is available to shareholders with concerns they cannot 
resolve through our Chairman, Chief Executive or  
Group Finance Director.
To ensure we properly manage our business and 
implement our strategy, the Board delegates day-to-day 
operating decisions to the Chief Executive, Group Finance 
Director, other members of the Genus Executive 
Leadership Team (‘GELT’) and their management teams. 
In turn, they recommend strategy and plans to the Board, 
make routine decisions on resources and ensure we have 
robust operational and financial controls. The Board 
regularly invites members of our business unit 
management teams to present to the Board and  
to take part in aspects of strategic reviews.
The Board believes the Directors have the right 
experience and calibre to make effective judgements 
about our strategy, performance, resourcing and conduct. 
We ensure the Directors receive the training they need, 
and all Directors have access to advice and services from 
the Group General Counsel & Company Secretary, as well 
as to independent professional advice. 
The chart below shows the length of time each of our 
Directors has served on the Board:

Karim Bitar September 2011
Stephen Wilson January 2013
Nigel Turner January 2008
Mike Buzzacott May 2009
Professor Barry Furr, OBE December 2006
To ensure the Board works effectively, the Directors 
receive Board packs well in advance of meetings. The 
Group General Counsel & Company Secretary makes sure 
that we follow Board procedures and that we comply with 
all of our statutory and regulatory obligations.

oversight of our R&D programme and gives our business 
units direct involvement in prioritising our R&D initiatives, 
to ensure we meet customer needs today and tomorrow. 
The R&D PMT meets twice a year. Key discussions this 
year included:
•	 implementing a Group-wide ideas submission process, 
to ensure we consider and progress new ideas that 
could lead to value-added products and services;
•	 reviewing and prioritising continuing and new research 
ideas with Genus PIC and Genus ABS, which confirmed 
our focus areas as genomic selection, disease resistance 
and gender skew;
•	 establishing a Scientific Computing division within R&D, 
to allow us to more efficiently accomplish scientific 
computing tasks, including the input, storage and 
processing of big data; and
•	 reviewing and updating the business about our growing 
intellectual property portfolio.
The Board’s Activities

The Review Process
This year, the Board underwent a formal, rigorous and 
independent external review. This was carried out by 
Dr Tracy Long of Boardroom Review, who has no other 
connection with the Group. The Chairman agreed the 
scope of the review, which included individual interviews 
with each Board member and attendance and 
observation at the April 2013 Board meeting.  
Boardroom Review gave feedback individually  
and at the May Board meeting.
The review explored three key aspects:
•	 the work of the Board (strategy, risk and control,  
and performance management);
•	 the Board environment (culture and composition); and
•	 the use of Board time (planning and allocation).
The Review’s Conclusion
During the review, the Board demonstrated particular 
strengths in the following areas:
•	 Board culture and contribution, and the style of 
chairmanship;
•	 clear strategy, including knowledge of the consumer 
landscape and shareholders’ views;
•	 internal and external financial reporting, the Audit 
Committee and the oversight of risk;
•	 the executive culture and approach to remuneration; 
and
•	 prioritisation of issues and quality of information.

The evaluation also found that the Board’s size 
encourages close dialogue between Directors and a 
flexible approach. The balance of formal and informal time 
throughout the year enhances the Board’s dynamics.
Progress Against the 2012 Evaluation
The Board made progress against the areas for 
development identified in the 2012 review. In particular:
•	 the Board increased the number of meetings at the 
Group’s global operations by meeting at DeForest, USA, 
and Cremona, Italy. This enabled the Board to gain a 
greater understanding of the geographic and 
operational opportunities in these areas. Site and 
customer visits ensure the Non-Executive Directors  
are better informed and send a positive message  
to employees;
•	 the Board continued to increase the strategic element 
of its meetings by scheduling annual strategic update 
away-days with GELT, with the first taking place in 
January 2013; and
•	 the Board increased its focus on succession planning 
and people development by being regularly updated.
Areas of f ocus for 2013/14
The evaluation identified areas for the Board to 
consider this year, including:
•	 the evolution of the Board’s composition, including 
international experience and gender diversity;
•	 the quality of discussion and information regarding 
the competitive landscape;
•	 a deeper review of Executive succession planning; 
and
•	 improving reporting cycles and communication  
and the use of Board time.
In addition, the Board has set itself the following 
priorities for the coming financial year:
•	 continuing its global site visits, in line with the  
2012 Board review outcome;
•	 developing the Board in the area of corporate 
responsibility (‘CR’), aligning CR with the Group’s 
strategic objectives and establishing the new CR 
Committee, as described on page 48; 
•	 continuing to ensure its development in governance; and
•	 increased focus on the talent review.
Shareholder Relations
We have a continuing dialogue with institutional investors 
through our investor relations programme. The Chief 
Executive and Group Finance Director meet frequently 
with institutional shareholders and private client brokers, 
with the Chairman also attending some meetings. 
The Board discusses feedback from these meetings, 
including feedback obtained for us by independent 
brokers and our advisors. This allows all Directors to 
understand major shareholders’ views. The Chairman  
and Senior Non-Executive Director also maintain  
contact with major shareholders.
The Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’) gives the Board  
an opportunity to communicate with both private and 
institutional investors, and we welcome their involvement. 
Bob Lawson, Mike Buzzacott, Nigel Turner and Barry Furr 
will be available to answer questions, as Chairmen  
of the Board and its Committees, at the AGM on 
15 November 2013.
Risk management and internal Control
Risk management
The Board is ultimately responsible for identifying the 
major business risks we face. Genus has an established 
risk management system, which identifies, evaluates and 
prioritises the risks and uncertainties which could affect 
the Group, and reviews the controls and risk mitigations 
we have in place. The system applies to all of our 
worldwide businesses, our divisional business reviews, 
GELT, the Audit Committee and the Board.
We further enhanced our management of business risk  
in the year, through risk management workshops with 
divisional management teams, improved reporting of risks 
and Board presentations on certain specific risk areas. 
The key risks identified and our mitigating actions to 
control these risks are summarised on pages 40 and 41.
internal Control
The Board is responsible for our internal control system 
and for reviewing its effectiveness. The Board, with the 
Audit Committee’s assistance, has reviewed the 
effectiveness of our internal control system and our 
financial, operational and compliance controls and risk 
management. This assessment considered all significant 
internal control aspects which arose during the year. 
The assessment considered our internal audit work 
programme and management reports prepared at the 
time our interim and final reports and financial statements 
were approved. It assessed whether we had identified, 
evaluated, managed and controlled significant risks, 
whether any significant weaknesses had arisen and 
whether we had taken the necessary remedial action.  
The management reports were based on the output  
of detailed risk workshops conducted by the Group 
centrally and regionally in the year, and responses to 
comprehensive questionnaires issued to each of our 
business units and regional management. 
In addition, the assessment considered risk events and 
controls that we had recognised through other day-to-
day risk management activities, namely the divisional 
business reviews, GELT meetings, Main Board meetings 
and insurers’ reviews. 
While these assessments routinely identify areas for 
improvement, the Board has neither identified nor been 
advised of any failings or weaknesses which it has 
determined to be material or significant.
Our internal Control System
An internal control system is designed to manage, rather 
than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives, and can only provide reasonable and not 
absolute assurance against material misstatement or  
loss. The key elements of our internal control systems  
are as follows:
Management Structure
The Board delegates authority to operate the Group’s 
subsidiary companies to the Chief Executive, GELT and 
their management teams, within limits set by the Board. 58 | Genus plc Annual Report 2013
Appointments to our most senior management positions 
require the Board’s approval. We also have formal 
empowerment levels, which set out delegation of 
authority, authorisation levels and other control 
procedures. Operating standards set by GELT  
and their management teams supplement these  
procedures, as required for each subsidiary’s type  
of business and its location.
GELT meets regularly to review the Group’s performance 
against its budget, strategy and other key factors. In 
addition, the Chief Executive, Group Finance Director, 
Group General Counsel & Company Secretary and the 
Group Financial Controller hold monthly business review 
meetings with each business unit.
Quality and Integrity of Personnel
High-quality people are an essential part of the control 
environment, as is maintaining our ethical standards. We 
ensure the integrity and competence of our employees 
through high recruitment standards, post-recruitment 
training courses and a consistent global approach to 
performance management. 
Information and Financial Reporting Systems
Our planning and financial reporting procedures include 
detailed operational budgets for the year ahead, along 
with three-year strategic plans, which the Board reviews 
and approves. We monitor performance throughout  
the year, through monthly reporting of financial results, 
key performance indicators and variances, updated 
full-year forecasts and information on key business risks. 
This allows us to take action as necessary to address 
business issues.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEmENT 
CONTiNUED
The main internal control and risk management processes 
related to our preparation of consolidated accounts are 
Group-wide accounting policies and procedures, 
segregation of duties, a robust consolidation and 
reporting system, various levels of management review 
and centrally defined process control points and 
reconciliation processes.
Investment Appraisal
We regulate our capital expenditure through our budget 
process and predetermined authorisation levels. Detailed 
written proposals must be submitted to the Board for 
expenditure above certain levels.
We carry out due diligence work for business acquisitions 
and subject major projects and all acquisitions to timely 
post-implementation reviews. This allows us to investigate 
and correct any underperformance against expectations 
or any significant overspends.
Internal Audit 
Our Head of Internal Audit and Risk Management is 
responsible for our internal audit activities, which are 
provided by a mix of in-house and external resources. 
During the year, they completed a risk-based audit 
programme agreed by the Audit Committee. The results 
of these audits and the follow up of resulting actions are 
reviewed by the Audit Committee and communicated to 
the external auditors. 
The regions and businesses complete risk and control self 
assessments twice a year, which are reviewed by Internal 
Audit to identify internal control deficiencies and 
corrective actions required. The results of this exercise  
are communicated to senior management and the  
Audit Committee. Genus plc Annual Report 2013 | 59

Membership and Governance
The Audit Committee is composed of Non-Executive 
Directors and is appointed by the Board to provide a wide 
range of financial and commercial expertise, appropriate to 
fulfil the Committee’s duties. The Committee continues to 
meet the UK Corporate Governance Code’s requirement 
that at least one member should have recent and relevant 
financial experience.
The Committee has formal terms of reference, approved  
by the Board, which comply with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. The Committee reviews its terms of 
reference annually and refers any amendments to the 
Board for approval. The terms of reference are available  
on our website: www.genusplc.com.
The Committee met three times during the financial year and 
invited the Company’s Chairman, Chief Executive, Group 
Finance Director, Group Financial Controller, Head of Internal 
Audit and Risk Management and senior representatives of 
the external auditors to attend its meetings. The Committee 
also held separate private sessions with external audit, 
internal audit and the Group Finance Director.

The Committee’s main Activities During the Year
At its three meetings during the year, the Committee 
focused on:
f inancial Reporting
The Committee reviewed, with both management and  
the external auditors, the appropriateness of the half-year 
and annual financial statements. The reviews included 
critical accounting policies, key assumptions and 
judgements, the quality of disclosures and compliance 
with financial reporting standards, all material  
issues affecting the financial statements and any 
correspondence from the Financial Reporting  
Council in relation to financial reporting. 
The Committee also reviewed the Annual Report and 
Accounts as a whole, to ensure it is fair, balanced and 
understandable, and provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, 
business model and strategy.
monitoring Business Risks
The Committee reviewed the Group-wide risk 
management process, which is designed to identify, 
evaluate and mitigate risks. The Committee discussed 
with the Chief Executive and Group Finance Director, in 
the presence of the external auditor, the risks identified, 
management’s plans to mitigate them and any potential 
impact on the financial statements.
In addition, the Committee reviewed the Group’s tax 
strategy and pension arrangements.
internal Control System
The Committee conducted its annual review of the 
effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls and 
disclosures, and reviewed internal audit’s findings at each 
scheduled meeting. The Committee’s review of internal 
controls included the Group’s whistleblowing policy and 
bribery prevention procedures.
External Audit
The Committee reviewed and agreed the scope and fees 
for the external auditor’s audit work, and held detailed 
discussions of the results of their audits. The Committee 
continued its practice of meeting with the external 
auditor, without management being present. It also 
further reviewed the external auditor’s objectivity and 
independence and the Company’s policy on engaging the 
external auditor to supply non-audit services. 
The Committee assessed the external auditor’s 
performance, based on questionnaires completed by key 
financial staff and Committee members. This assessment 
covered the external auditor’s fulfilment of the agreed 
audit plan, the auditor’s robustness and perceptiveness in 
their handling of key accounting and audit judgements, 
the content of their reports and cost effectiveness.
internal Audit
The Committee reviewed and agreed the internal audit 
function’s scope, terms of reference, resource and 
activities. The Committee received regular reports from 
the Head of Internal Audit and Risk Management on 
internal audit’s work and management’s responses to 
proposals made in internal audit’s reports during the year. 
The Committee reviewed the internal audit function’s 
performance and continued to meet the Head of Internal 
Audit and Risk Management without management  
being present.
Committee Evaluation
The Committee reviews its performance and effectiveness 
annually. During the financial year, the Committee used a 
questionnaire to consider its effectiveness. The key areas 
assessed included understanding of roles and 
responsibilities, monitoring the integrity of financial 
reporting, reviewing the Company’s system of internal 
control and risk management, and monitoring the 
effectiveness of internal and external auditors.
External Auditor’s Appointment
Deloitte LLP were first appointed as the Group’s external 
auditor for the period ended 30 June 2006, following a 
formal tender process. The current audit partner’s first 
audit period was the financial year ended 30 June 2011.
The Committee reviewed the nature and fees for the 
external auditor’s non-audit services and compliance with 
the Company’s Non-Audit Services by Auditors Policy. 
The Committee is satisfied that using Deloitte for such 
services does not impair their independence as the 
Group’s external auditor. 
The Committee further reviewed the performance and 
effectiveness of the external auditors. As a consequence 
of its satisfaction with Deloitte’s independence and 
effectiveness, the Committee has recommended to the 
Board that the external auditor be reappointed for a 
further year.

Dear s hareholder
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report for 2012/13. This report 
covers the remuneration of Executive and Non-Executive 
Directors.
Consistent with the revised reporting framework 
published by the Department for Business, Innovation & 
Skills, we have split the report that follows this Annual 
Statement into two sections:
•	 a Directors’ Remuneration Policy Report, which sets 
out the Group’s remuneration policy for Executive and 
Non-Executive Directors; and 
•	 an Annual Report on Remuneration, which discloses 
how we applied our remuneration policy in the year 
ended 30 June 2013. 
As required by current legislation, we will be seeking 
your support for both parts of the report, through a 
single advisory vote at the AGM on 15 November 2013. 
From next year, when the new legislation becomes 
effective for Genus, we will hold separate votes on the 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy Report and the Annual 
Report on Remuneration.
Performance and r eward for 2012/13
As highlighted in the Strategic Review, the year ended 
30 June 2013 was a year of change for the Group, as 
well as another year of growth. Genus has made 
encouraging progress with implementing its new 
strategy to capture the very significant growth 
opportunities in animal genetics markets from 2014 
onwards, while delivering solid operational performance 
in challenging markets. 
The Group implemented its new organisational 
structure, including establishing global business units, 
along with a number of successful initiatives to improve 
product differentiation, such as our single-step genomic 
evaluation process. At the same time, the Group 
delivered year on year profit growth of 2% and a 
reduction in net debt of 6%. From an operational 
perspective, in light of the substantial investments in 
creating the platform for future growth and the high 
feed costs and challenging markets relative to the 
previous year, the Remuneration Committee considers 
this to be a robust result. 
In light of their performance during the year against 
very challenging targets, the proportions of maximum 
annual bonuses earned by the Executive Directors were 
in the range of 26% to 31%.
Looking at our long-term performance, the 2009/2010 
financial year Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’) awards, 
which measure performance over the three years ending 
30 June 2013, will vest at 100%. Our annualised growth 
in adjusted EPS over the period was 11% above the 
movement in the Retail Price Index, which means that 
the Group achieved the maximum performance 
requirement, resulting in full vesting. Given the 
challenging economic conditions and high input costs 
during this period, the executive management team 
delivered an exceptional result over this period. 
r emuneration Policy for 2013/14
As reported in last year’s Directors’ Remuneration 
Report, we undertook a full review of remuneration 
policy in early 2012, to ensure our policy supports the 
Group’s new strategy. As a result of this review, we 
introduced a number of modifications to policy for the 
year under review, which included seeking and receiving 
shareholder approval for an amendment to our long-
term incentive plan at the 2012 AGM. 
Given last year’s review, we will not be making 
substantive changes to our remuneration policy for the 
current financial year. The Remuneration Committee 
did review the current policy’s ongoing suitability and 
concluded that weighting pay towards long-term 
performance remains appropriate for a growth-focused 
company. In addition, the current policy worked 
effectively during 2012/13, in attracting and retaining 
the high calibre of talent required to deliver our 
growth strategy.

DiRECTORS’ REmUNERATiON REPORT 
LETTER f ROm Th E ChAiRmAN CONTiNUED
The Remuneration Committee also remains comfortable 
that the current policy does not encourage undue risk 
taking, as the performance metrics are fully aligned with 
targeted improvements in the Group’s key performance 
indicators, incentive pay is subject to clawback 
provisions and part of the annual bonus must be 
deferred into the Company’s shares. These features, 
allied to our share ownership guidelines, ensure that  
our remuneration policy is aligned with long-term 
shareholders’ interests. 
Shareholders’ Views
The Remuneration Committee takes an active interest in 
shareholders’ views and developments in best practice. 
For example, we introduced part deferral of annual 
bonus into shares and share ownership guidelines in the 
year under review, to better align policy with current 
best practice.
The key issue raised around the time of last year’s AGM 
related to the amendment to our long-term incentive 
plan. As a result of the feedback we received during a 
consultation with shareholders, we amended the 
proposed performance target so that the financial 
target was subject to a non-financial underpin. This will 
enable the Remuneration Committee to reduce the 
vesting result, if progress against the Group’s strategic 
business targets has been unsatisfactory. 
The Committee will undertake its next annual review of 
remuneration in advance of setting remuneration policy 
for 2014/15. We will continue to take shareholders’ views 
into account in this and subsequent reviews. 
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank 
shareholders for their continued support. If you wish  
to contact me in connection with the Group’s senior 
executive remuneration policy, please email me at 
remunerationchair@genusplc.com.
The Committee looks forward to your support of our 
remuneration policy at the 2013 AGM.
Nigel Turner
Senior independent Director and Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee 
This Directors’ Remuneration Report has been prepared 
so that it complies with the Companies Act 2006 and 
Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium Sized Companies 
and Group’s (Accounts and Reports) 2008 Regulations, 
which set out the disclosures required for directors’ 
remuneration as at the reporting date, as well as in 
accordance with the requirements of the Listing Rules  
and the Financial Conduct Authority. 
The current legislation requires the auditor to report to 
the Company’s members on the ‘auditable parts’ of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and to state whether,  
in their opinion, the parts of the report that have been 
subject to audit have been properly prepared in 
accordance with the legislation. We have highlighted  
the parts of this report which have been audited.
The Annual Report on Remuneration sets out what our 
Directors were paid in respect of the year under review. 
The Directors’ Remuneration Policy Report sets out the 
policy that will apply in 2013/14, which is the same broad 
policy that applied in the year under review and, subject 
to ongoing review, for subsequent years. The report has 
been approved by the Board and signed on its behalf by 
the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee. 
DiRECTORS’ REmUNERATiON POLiCY REPORT 
(UNAUDiTED iNf ORmATiON)
The key objectives of Genus’s Executive remuneration 
policy are that:
•	 pay should be competitive to ensure that we can 
recruit and retain the highest calibre individuals;
•	 fixed pay (base salary, pension and benefits) should 
take account of comparable external median 
benchmarks and internal pay relativities;
•	 incentive pay (short and long-term incentives) should 
provide the opportunity to earn upper quartile total 
remuneration, subject to delivery of our above-
market long-term growth aspirations;
•	 incentive pay should be directly linked to the Group’s 
strategy, with targets relating to our key performance 
indicators (using non-financial ‘input’ measures and/
or ‘output’ measures such as earnings per share) and 
should be stretching, in light of our strategic plan;
•	 incentive structures should be simple and easy to 
understand, with a clear focus on rewarding long-
term sustained growth, rather than volatile 
performance;
•	 remuneration policy should be clearly aligned with 
shareholders’ interests, take due account of current 
best practice guidance and not encourage undue risk 
taking; and
•	 policy principles for Executive Directors should apply 
to the members of the Genus Executive Leadership 
Team (‘GELT’), with appropriate tiering through the 
wider workforce.
In applying these principles, the Remuneration Committee 
is sensitive to institutional investors’ views on the use of 
benchmark pay data and undertakes benchmarking only 
periodically. In its use of benchmark pay data, the 
Committee considers multiple sources, as well as 
individual performance, calibre and experience, and the 
Group’s performance. The Committee also considers 
Group-wide salary budgets and the wider economic 
environment. Genus plc Annual Report 2013 | 63

of earnings per share targets 
currently apply to awards
Tier 1 Awards
• Chief Executive: 125% 
of salary
• Group Finance Director: 
100% of salary
30% of Tier 1 Awards vest at 
the threshold performance 
level, through to full vesting 
for growing earnings per 
share by at least 11% above RPI
Tier 2 Awards
• Additional 75% of salary 
above Tier 1 Awards
For vesting to take place in 
respect of Tier 2 Awards, the 
Company will need to achieve 
its stated long-term objective 
of capturing very significant 
growth opportunities 
identified in the animal 
genetics market. Full vesting 
of Tier 2 Awards requires 
earnings per share growth to 
be at least 20% above RPI 
The awards are also subject 
to an underpin that enables 
the Committee to scale back 
(but not scale up) vesting, 
if the Group’s financial 
performance over the period 
is not considered reflective 
of the progress made against 
its strategic business targets

performance targets for 
2013/14 is included on

Share Ownership Guidelines
To provide alignment between 
Executives and shareholders
A shareholding of 100% 
of salary is expected to be 
achieved, through retention of 
50% of the net of tax number 
of vested shares under the 
Company’s Deferred Share 
Bonus Plan and PSP. 
In addition, the Chief 
Executive will also retain the 
entire after tax number of 
Restricted Shares that were 
granted to him shortly after 
his appointment (see page 72)

Remuneration Scenarios for Executive Directors
The charts below show how the composition of 
the Executive Directors’ remuneration varies at 
different levels of performance under the Group’s 
remuneration policy, as a percentage of total 
remuneration opportunity and as a total value:
h ow Employees’ Pay is Taken into Account
When setting the Executive Directors’ remuneration,  
the Remuneration Committee takes due account of  
pay structures elsewhere in the Group. For example,  
the Committee considers the overall salary increase 
budget and the incentive structures that operate  
across the Group.
The Group HR Director facilitates this process, presenting 
to the Remuneration Committee on pay structures across 
the organisation, their effectiveness and how they fit the 
Group’s Remuneration Policy. Part of this process includes 
consulting employees on their views of the current policy, 
which forms part of the feedback provided to the 
Remuneration Committee and is used by the HR Director 
to continually assess the policy’s effectiveness.
h ow Executive Directors’ Remuneration Policy Relates 
to the w ider Group
The remuneration policy summarised above and 
described in detail below provides an overview of the 
structure that operates for the Executive Directors.
The same broad structure also operates for the members 
of GELT. 
Below GELT, the same remuneration principles continue 
to apply. However, the structure and quantum of 
remuneration vary by work level, with the structures 
informed by the specialist nature of many employees’ 
roles, as well as market practice and employee feedback.
h ow Shareholders’ Views Are Taken into Account
The Remuneration Committee considers shareholder 
feedback received in relation to the AGM each year and 
guidance from shareholder representative bodies more 
generally. This feedback, plus any additional feedback 
received during meetings with shareholders, is then 
considered as part of the Company’s ongoing review  
of remuneration policy. 
As noted earlier, the key issue raised around the time of 
last year’s AGM related to the amendment to our long-
term incentive plan. As a result of the feedback received 
during a consultation with shareholders, the 
Remuneration Committee amended the proposed 
performance target so that the financial target was 
subject to a non-financial underpin. This will enable the 
Committee to reduce the vesting result, if progress 
against the Group’s strategic business targets has  
been unsatisfactory. 
The Remuneration Committee will review remuneration 
policy for 2014/15 in light of feedback received in relation 
to the 2013 AGM. The Committee will consult shareholders 
if any significant policy changes are proposed in the future.  66 | Genus plc Annual Report 2013

Policy
Executive Directors
Genus can terminate Executive Directors’ service contracts on one year’s notice, while Executive Directors must give six 
months’ notice. The contracts do not contain any pre-determined amounts in the event that the Company terminates 
them. Any payments will reflect the circumstances at the time of termination, taking account of the Executive Directors’ 
duty to mitigate. There are no enhanced provisions in the event of a change of control. Executive Directors’ contracts of 
service, which include details of remuneration, will be available for inspection at the AGM on 15 November 2013.
Non-Executive Directors
All Non-Executive Directors have specific terms of engagement and their remuneration is determined by the Board, 
taking into account the time they devote to the Company’s affairs. The Non-Executive Directors do not participate in 
any of the Company’s incentive schemes or pension schemes. Their appointment is for a fixed term of three years and is 
subject to one month’s notice of termination by either the Company or the Non-Executive Director, and to annual 
re-election at the Company’s AGM, in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code.

Outside appointments
The Company recognises that Executive Directors may be invited to become Non-Executive Directors of other 
companies and that this can help broaden the Director’s skills and experience. Upon appointment as Group Finance 
Director in February 2009, John Worby was permitted to retain his existing Non-Executive Directorships of Cranswick 
plc and Smiths News plc. John Worby was permitted to retain the associated remuneration of £67,800 in the last 
financial year up to the date of his retirement. When Stephen Wilson was appointed in January 2013, he was permitted 
to retain his existing Non-Executive Directorship of Xchanging plc and was permitted to retain the associated 
remuneration of £23,000 in the period since his appointment.
ANNUAL REPORT ON REmUNERATiON (UNAUDiTED iNf ORmATiON)
The Role of the Remuneration Committee
The Company has established a Remuneration Committee (the ‘Committee’) which complies with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. The Committee makes recommendations to the Board, within agreed terms of reference, on an 
overall remuneration package for the Executive Directors and other members of GELT. The Committee’s full terms of 
reference are available on the Company’s website at www.genusplc.com.
The Committee comprises independent Non-Executive Directors Nigel Turner (Chairman), Mike Buzzacott and  
Barry Furr, and also the Company’s Non-Executive Chairman, Bob Lawson, who was considered by the Board  
to be independent at the time of his appointment to the Board. 
None of the Committee members has any personal financial interest (other than as shareholders), conflicts of interests 
arising from cross-directorships or day-to-day involvement in running the business. The Committee makes 
recommendations to the Board and no Director plays a part in any discussion about his own remuneration. Genus plc Annual Report 2013 | 67

During the year to 30 June 2013, the Committee met 
seven times and considered the following matters:
•	 the continuing appropriateness of the remuneration 
policy and the remuneration arrangements for the 
Executive Directors and GELT; 
•	 salary levels for the Executive Directors and 
GELT members;
•	 the terms of the 2012/13 Executive Annual Bonus 
Plan and of the individual bonuses payable in light of 
the Group’s and individual’s performances in respect 
of 2011/12; 
•	 the individual long-term share incentive awards 
under the Company’s 2004 Performance Share Plan 
and 2004 Executive Share Option Plan; 
•	 the performance measures and targets to apply to 
these awards; 
•	 testing of the performance conditions and approval 
of the associated vesting levels of long-term share 
incentive awards granted in the 2009/2010 financial 
year;
•	 approving the retirement terms of John Worby; 
•	 the remuneration terms of Stephen Wilson on 
appointment;
•	 the Directors’ Remuneration Report for the financial 
year ending 30 June 2012; and
•	 the current investor guidelines on executive 
remuneration.
In determining the Executive Directors’ remuneration for 
the year, the Committee consulted the Chief Executive 
and the Group Human Resources Director about its 
proposals, although neither is involved with determining 
their own remuneration. 
The Committee also appointed New Bridge Street (part  
of Aon plc) to provide benchmarking advice on the 
remuneration packages for the Executive Directors, 
members of GELT and the Non-Executive Directors.  
New Bridge Street is a member of the Remuneration 
Consultants Group and complies with its Code of 
Conduct. Aon plc acts as insurance broker to the Group.
The Committee considered New Bridge Street’s 
performance during the year, in terms of the quality and 
independence of its advice, the potential for conflicts of 
interest (which are actively managed within Aon plc) and 
its knowledge and understanding of market practice. 
Having reviewed these factors, the Committee decided  
to retain New Bridge Street as its advisers.

Base Salary
The Committee reviews the Executive Directors’ basic 
salaries prior to each financial year, taking into account 
individual and corporate performance, an assessment of 
comparator companies, wider economic conditions and 
levels of increases applicable to the Group’s other 
employees.
The Executive Directors’ current salary levels (with effect 
from 1 July 2013) are as follows:
•	 Karim Bitar: £516,500 (no change from prior year); and
•	 Stephen Wilson: £350,000 (as determined on 
appointment on 14 January 2013).
The Committee determined that no further salary 
increases would be made to the Chief Executive and 
Group Finance Director at the 1 July 2013 review. The 
average salary increase for UK based employees reflects 
a cost of living adjustment.
The salary set on appointment for the Group Finance 
Director reflected his calibre and experience, and the 
need to secure an individual with the necessary 
capabilities to work alongside the Chief Executive, to 
deliver the anticipated higher rates of growth being 
targeted from 2014 (as detailed in the Strategic Review). 
When setting pay, the Committee periodically considers 
external benchmark data for comparable roles in 
companies of broadly similar size, international scope of 
operations and complexity. Given there are few direct 
comparator listed companies, the Committee considers 
general market data. The Committee is careful in its use of 
benchmark pay data (for example, it does not target 
median market positioning for each Executive Director 
each year) and takes into account a broad range of 
factors when setting pay, such as the experience, calibre 
and performance of the individual and salary increases 
across the Group. 
Pension and Other Benefits 
The Executive Directors receive certain benefits-in-kind, 
principally a car or car allowance, life assurance and 
private medical insurance. In lieu of company pension 
contributions, the Company has agreed to pay Karim Bitar 
and Stephen Wilson a taxable pension allowance of 25% 
and 15% of basic salary per annum respectively.
Performance-Related Annual Bonus
The Company bonus scheme for the 2013/14 financial 
year for its Directors and senior Executives will incentivise 
and reward the delivery of challenging adjusted profit 
growth targets (60% of the bonus opportunity) and cash 
generation (20% of the bonus opportunity) and personal 
targets (20% of the bonus opportunity). 
These metrics capture performance against a range of 
key performance indicators. Profit works as an ‘output’ 
metric that captures our success against a range of other 
KPIs, which we assess on an ongoing basis, such as 
growing volumes and revenue while maintaining 
appropriate profit levels per transaction and royalty rates. 
Cash targets measure our success in generating funds to 
invest in growing the business. Progress with 
implementing our new strategy forms a central part of the 
personal performance targets for each position.  68 | Genus plc Annual Report 2013
DiRECTORS’ REmUNERATiON REPORT 
CONTiNUED
For the 2013/14 financial year, the bonus structure will 
continue to operate on a similar basis to that which 
operated in 2012/13. 
Straight line vesting takes place between performance 
points. Given last year was a record for the Group, and 
noting the growth premium in this year’s budget 
compared with last year, this year’s financial targets are 
considered appropriately demanding. 
Personal targets are structured to be similarly challenging 
to our financial targets. They are linked to the successful 
implementation of elements identified in the strategic 
review, with the targets being both quantifiable and 
stretching. Achievement of these targets is central to 
unlocking the growth potential we are proposing to target 
through the revisions to our PSP described below.
The Annual Report on Remuneration for 2013/14 will 
include retrospective disclosure of the targets set, subject 
to the information not being considered seriously 
prejudicial to the Group.
In relation to bonus earned against the targets described 
above, 25% will be deferred by way of shares for a period 
of three years and will vest subject to continued 
employment, other than in certain good leaver 
circumstances. Deferral ensures there is a continued link 
between achieving our short-term financial targets and 
the longer-term delivery of our growth strategy. Clawback 
provisions apply to the annual bonus, which will enable 
the Committee to claw back any element of bonuses that 
should not have been paid, in the event of a material 
misstatement of the Group’s annual results. 
The maximum bonus opportunity remains at 125% of 
salary for the Chief Executive. For the current year, the 
Group Finance Director will also be subject to a maximum 
bonus opportunity of 125% of salary. This mirrors the 
maximum opportunity available at his previous employer 
and operated from his date of appointment to the Board. 
The Remuneration Committee therefore considered it 
appropriate to equalise the bonus potential of the Group’s 
two lead executives.
Long-Term incentives
Long-term share awards are granted under the Genus plc 
2004 PSP which was amended, following shareholder 
approval at the 2012 AGM, to enable awards in normal 
circumstances to be granted at up to 200% of salary.  
This amendment was described in detail in last year’s 
Notice of AGM and was made to better align our 
remuneration structure with our overall remuneration 
policy and incentivise the delivery of our long-term 
growth strategy. The changes provided the potential  
for higher levels of long-term reward, for delivering the 
higher rates of growth targeted by the Group’s new 
strategy from 2014. In addition, the primary performance 
metric, adjusted earnings per share (‘EPS’) growth, was 
made more challenging through the introduction of a 
strategic underpin.
Under the PSP, incentives can take the form of conditional 
share awards or nil cost options, with vesting based on 
achievement against challenging growth in EPS 
performance, normally tested over a three-year period. 
Consistent with the awards granted during the year under 
review, it is anticipated that the awards in 2013/14 will be 
at 200% of salary for the Chief Executive and 175% of 
salary for the Group Finance Director.
The performance targets anticipated to apply to the 
awards to be granted this year are as follows:
Tier 1 Awards
The range of targets anticipated to apply to awards with a 
value of 125% of salary for the Chief Executive and 100% 
of salary to the Group Finance Director are:

* Growth in adjusted EPS over the three-year performance period 
will be computed based on a simple average annual growth rate. 
** A linear scale will be applied when performance falls between 
the bands.

the Tier 1 levels, with a value of 75% of salary for each 
Executive Director, are as follows:

* Growth in adjusted EPS over the three-year performance period 
will be computed based on a simple average annual growth rate. 
** A linear scale will be applied when performance falls between 
the bands. 
Tier 2 awards, which are subject to more demanding 
targets are, in part, aspirational and require the Group to 
continue to deliver faster progress in a number of areas, 
for example accelerating the pace of genetic 
improvements, operating a more tailored business model 
or further expansion in the large markets of Brazil, Russia, 
India and China. However, the Remuneration Committee 
considers it appropriate to provide a tangible incentive for 
the delivery of our high growth agenda. The potential 
vesting under the above awards would take place in 2016, 
following the required higher growth feeding through the 
Group’s financial results as per the conclusions of the 
strategy review detailed in the Strategic Review.  Genus plc Annual Report 2013 | 69

The Committee considers it appropriate to maintain the current range of targets for the Tier 1 awards, to continue to 
provide a clear incentive to deliver our established growth trajectory, so that we have a balanced approach to 
incentivising growth. 
In addition to the targets described above, the awards will also be subject to an underpin that requires the 
Remuneration Committee to be satisfied that the Group’s financial performance over the performance period fairly 
reflects our progress against our strategic business targets. If this is not considered to be the case, the Remuneration 
Committee has the power to scale back (but not scale up) the extent to which an award vests.
The above targets are considered to be appropriately demanding given the quantum of the awards proposed and are 
consistent with the Group’s long-term growth aspirations. 
EPS is being retained as the primary performance metric since it is well understood by our Executives and remains the 
key financial measure of the Group’s long-term growth. The strategic business underpin ensures that there is not an 
excessive focus on EPS and incentivises strong financial performance at the same time as maintaining clear focus on 
delivering our strategic milestones.

There have been no other contracts or arrangements during the financial year in which a Director of the Company was 
materially interested and/or which were significant in relation to the Group’s business.
Retirement of John w orby
John Worby ceased to be a Director on 31 March 2013. Consistent with the terms of the relevant incentive plans, he was 
treated as a ‘good leaver’ on his retirement. His outstanding long-term incentive awards granted on 10 September 2010, 
9 September 2011 and 7 December 2012 were subject to pro-rata reductions and will be tested for performance at the 
end of the relevant performance period (see page 73), with his bonus in respect of the 2012/13 financial year payable in 
cash, as opposed to being deferred into the Company’s shares. There was no compensation for loss of office relating to 
his retirement from the Board. 
Following his retirement from the Board on 31 March 2013, John Worby has continued to provide consultancy services 
relating to the establishment of a joint venture with one of the Group’s partner companies. Given his role in progressing 
the joint venture while a Group employee, specifically in relation to its terms and conditions, and the ongoing benefit of 
his specialist input in these areas, it was considered important to retain his input for a period of time. Between the date 
of his retirement and 30 June 2013, he has received fees of £17,000 for eight and a half days of consultancy work. In the 
period to 2 September 2013, he undertook no further consultancy work. He will remain available to provide further input 
to joint venture work until 31 December 2013, at the Group’s request, at a rate of £2,000 per day. 
Details of Variable Pay Earned in Respect of 2012/13 
As detailed in last year’s Directors’ Remuneration Report, the 2012/13 bonuses for Executive Directors were calculated 
by reference to a performance against a challenging sliding scale of profit, cash/debt and personal targets.
Bonuses earned against the targets set at the start of the year were equivalent to 38% of salary or 31% of maximum 
potential for Karim Bitar, 26% of salary and maximum potential for John Worby (based on salary earned to the date of 
his retirement on 31 March 2013) and 36% of salary or 29% of maximum potential for Stephen Wilson (based on his 
salary from date of appointment through to the end of the 2012/13 financial year). 
In 2012/13, the Executive Directors each achieved 7% of the Company’s target for growth in adjusted profit (60% of the 
bonus opportunity) and 57% of the Company’s target for cash generation (20% of the bonus opportunity). In relation to 
personal objectives, the Remuneration Committee determined that Karim Bitar, John Worby and Stephen Wilson 
achieved 75%, 50% and 70% respectively (in each case 20% of the bonus opportunity). 
In line with our policy, 25% of the bonuses earned, other than for John Worby, were deferred into the Company’s shares 
for a period of three years. John Worby’s bonus was paid in cash, given his retirement from the Board, and he received 
‘good leaver’ treatment under the terms of the bonus plan. Genus plc Annual Report 2013 | 71

* The closing share price from the day prior to the awards being granted has been used to determine the maximum face value of the awards. 
This was £13.67 for Karim Bitar and John Worby (award granted on 7 December 2012) and £14.22 for Stephen Wilson (award granted on 
28 February 2013). 
** The different vesting percentages at the threshold performance level relate to the fact that part of the award is granted subject to the Tier 1 
targets detailed below with the balance subject to the Tier 2 targets also detailed below.
The awards will vest subject to the achievement of a challenging sliding scale of earnings per share growth targets and 
a strategic underpin. The targets were set out in full in last year’s Directors’ Remuneration Report and the 2012 Notice 
of AGM, along with the rationale for the range of targets set and the choice of performance metric.
The award granted to Stephen Wilson was agreed at the time of his appointment and is consistent with the Company’s 
policy operated for Karim Bitar and John Worby in the year under review. There were no special recruitment awards 
granted to Stephen Wilson on joining the Company.
 
The performance targets are as follows in relation to the above awards:
Tier 1 Awards
The range of targets applicable to awards with a value of 125% of salary for the Chief Executive and 100% of salary to

The performance targets applying to (4) were as per the 
Tier 1 targets, set out on page 71, for the awards granted 
during the year under review. In respect of (5), the targets 
were as per Tiers 1 and 2, set out on page 71.
Under (1) above, the award vested on a 100% basis under 
the PSP on 5 March 2012 as to 86,523 conditional nil-cost 
share options. On 14 March 2012, John Worby exercised 
and sold 43,261 shares at a price of 1,318.41 pence per 
share. The remaining 43,262 share options that vested 
have been retained by John Worby and have not been 
exercised. Actual adjusted EPS growth over the relevant 
performance period was 10.4% above RPI on 
an annualised basis and thus fell above the maximum 
performance levels which resulted in a full vesting.
Under (2) above, the award vested at 100% on 17 
September 2012. This related to annualised growth in 
adjusted EPS over the performance period of 10% above 
RPI, which results in the maximum performance 
requirement having been achieved over the performance 
period and thus vesting in full. On 26 September 2012, 
21,008 ordinary shares of 10 pence each in the Company 
were sold at a price of 1,474.68 pence per Share. This sale 
represents the exercise by John Worby of one half of his 
vesting entitlement. The remaining 21,009 share options 
that vested have been retained by John Worby and have 
not been exercised.
Treatment of John w orby’s Outstanding Share Awards 
on Retirement
Since the Remuneration Committee considered John 
Worby to be a ‘good leaver’ by virtue of his retirement 
from the Board on 31 March 2013, he was permitted to 
retain his outstanding share awards, reduced pro-rata to 
reflect time served, rounded to the end of the financial 
year. All awards continue to be subject to the satisfaction 
of unchanged performance targets and there will be no 
acceleration of vesting. The details of how this applies to 
each outstanding award are as follows. 
The award granted on 10 September 2010 was not 
pro-rated. Performance was tested over each of the 
relevant performance periods to 30 June 2013, following 
the end of the current financial year and resulted in 
vesting at 100%.
The award granted on 9 September 2011 was reduced by 
one third. The remaining amount of the award will be 
subject to performance testing over each of the relevant 
performance periods to 30 June 2014.
The award granted on 7 December 2012 was reduced by 
two thirds. The remaining amount of the award will be 
subject to performance testing over each of the relevant 
performance periods to 30 June 2015. 
Dilution
The current dilution under all share plans is 7.1% in ten 
years, which compares with the Association of British 
Insurers’ limit of 10% in ten years. The Committee believes 
that the current proposals and the anticipated flow rate 
will continue to operate within the agreed dilution limits 
for all share plans. 
Employee Benefit Trust
The Company has established an Employee Benefit Trust 
to be the custodian of any shares purchased in respect of 
the 2004 PSP on behalf of the Executive Directors and 
certain senior management. As at 30 June 2013, 111,181 
ordinary shares in the Company were held by the trust.

Chairman’s o verview
The Committee is responsible for proposing candidates 
for appointment to the Board. Its duties include regularly 
reviewing the Board’s structure, size and composition, 
including the skills, knowledge and experience the Board 
needs. We then make recommendations to the Board if 
changes are needed, taking into account succession 
planning for Directors and other senior executives, and 
the Group’s challenges and opportunities.
membership and Governance
The Nomination Committee is chaired by Bob Lawson  
and includes Nigel Turner, Mike Buzzacott, Barry Furr  
and Karim Bitar. 
The Committee has written terms of reference, which 
cover the authority delegated to it by the Board. These 
are available from our website: www.genusplc.com.
a ctivities During the Year
The Committee met once during the year, to consider 
the appointment of our Group Finance Director.
a ppointment of Group Finance Director
In identifying a new Group Finance Director, we sought 
candidates with the following attributes:
•	 experience of operating in a listed company 
environment;
•	 a global perspective and intercultural sensitivity;
•	 experience of driving continual improvement in a 
successful organisation; and 
•	 highly developed business and commercial acumen, 
pragmatism and a strong detail orientation.
Candidates also needed to demonstrate strategic 
thinking, the ability to operate as a true business partner, 
a strong results orientation, team leadership, and 
collaboration and influencing skills.
Stephen Wilson was the outstanding candidate and we 
were pleased to appoint him to the role. The Board 
considered that Stephen’s financial and business 
development skills, his experience of working in large 
global enterprises and his record of building strong 
finance teams will greatly benefit the Group.
induction
Following his appointment, Stephen underwent a 
tailored induction programme to effectively introduce 
him to the business. The programme’s objectives were 
for Stephen to:
•	 learn about the organisation and build relationships 
with the finance team, the Genus Executive 
Leadership Team and the Board;
•	 understand the key drivers of our porcine and 
bovine businesses;
•	 understand key financial matters; and
•	 build relationships with key investors, analysts, banks 
and other advisors.
The programme included visits to our businesses around 
the world, Board and Audit Committee meetings, 
introductions to key teams and an investor roadshow.
Diversity
The Board understands the importance of gender 
diversity and we are committed to increasing the 
participation of women at all levels of our business.  
We recognise Lord Davies’s recommendations and  
the value that diversity brings to boards.
However, the Board must view diversity in its broadest 
sense, meaning that we want a broad range of relevant 
skills and experience. We therefore base appointments  
on an objective assessment of the Group’s needs, its 
strategy and the Board’s current skills and experience. 
This requires us to make appointments solely on  
merit, so we have the right Board composition to  
direct the Group effectively.

Directors
The Directors listed on pages 50 and 51 served 
throughout the year, with the exception of Stephen 
Wilson, who joined the Board on 14 January 2013 and 
succeeded John Worby as Group Finance Director on 
1 March 2013. John Worby retired from the Board on 
31 March 2013. 
In compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, 
all Directors will offer themselves for re-election at the 
next AGM, details of which can be found in the Notice  
of AGM at the end of this report.
Supplier Payment Policy
Our policy is to agree terms of payment with suppliers for 
each transaction, ensure that suppliers know these terms 
and ensure that we abide by them. The Group’s trade 
creditors at 30 June 2013 were equivalent to 31 days’ 
purchases (2012: 26 days), based on the average daily 
amount invoiced by suppliers during the year.
Charitable and Political Contributions
During the year, we made charitable donations of £2,000 
(2012: £nil). The Group does not make political contributions.
Capital Structure
Note 30 gives details of the Company’s authorised and 
issued share capital and any movements in the issued 
share capital during the year. 
The Company has one class of ordinary share. All issued 
shares are fully paid and each share has the right to one 
vote at the Company’s general meetings. There are no 
specific restrictions either on the size of a holding or on 
the transfer of shares, which are both governed by our 
Articles of Association and prevailing legislation. No 
person has any special rights of control over the 
Company’s share capital.
Details of the Company’s employee share schemes are set 
out in note 29. In connection with these schemes, the 
Genus plc Employee Benefit Trust holds shares in the 
Company from time to time and abstains from voting  
in respect of any such shares.
Substantial Shareholdings
As at 30 August 2013, we were aware of the following 
material interests in the Company’s ordinary shares:
Fund Manager Shareholding %
Lansdowne Partners 5,626,689 9.28

Authority to Acquire the Company’s Own Shares
At the end of the year, the Directors had authority, under 
the shareholders’ resolutions of 8 November 2012, until 
the earlier of 18 months after the passing of such 
resolutions or the conclusion of the Company’s next 
AGM, to buy back shares on the open market to a limit 
of £602,956 in nominal value, representing 10% of the 
Company’s issued share capital as at the date of the 
resolution at a price between 10 pence (exclusive of 
expenses) and 105% of the average of the middle market 
quotation for ordinary shares in the Company for the five 
business days prior to the date of purchase (exclusive of 
expenses). No shares were bought back by the Company 
in the period since 9 November 2012 and the date of 
this report.
Going Concern
As described more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement on page 76, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group has adequate resources to 
continue in operation for the foreseeable future. For this 
reason, the Board continues to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the Financial Statements.
Provision of information to the Company’s Auditors
Each of the Directors at the date of approval of this 
Annual Report confirms that:
•	 so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s auditors are 
unaware; and
•	 the Director has taken all the steps that he ought to 
have taken as a Director in order to make himself aware 
of any relevant audit information and to establish that 
the Company’s auditors are aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in 
accordance with the provisions of section 418 Companies 
Act 2006.
Appointment of Auditor
Deloitte LLP have expressed their willingness to continue 
in office as auditor and a resolution to reappoint them will 
be proposed at the forthcoming AGM.

OTh ER STATUTORY DiSCLOSURES 76 | Genus plc Annual Report 2013
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual 
Report and the Financial Statements in accordance with 
applicable laws and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare such 
Financial Statements for each financial year. Under that 
law, the Directors are required to prepare Group Financial 
Statements in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the 
European Union (‘EU’) and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation 
and have chosen to prepare the Parent Company 
Financial Statements in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). 
Under company law, the Directors must not approve the 
accounts unless they are satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of 
the profit or loss of the Company for that period. In 
preparing these Financial Statements, the Directors are 
required to:
•	 properly select and apply accounting policies properly; 
•	 present information, including accounting policies, in  
a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable 
and understandable information; 
•	 provide additional disclosures when compliance with 
the specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to 
enable users to understand the impact of particular 
transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s 
financial position and financial performance; and 
•	 make an assessment of the Company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain 
the Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position of the 
Company and enable them to ensure that the Financial 
Statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They 
are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the corporate and financial information 
included on the Company’s website. Legislation in  
the United Kingdom governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ  
from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Going Concern 
The Strategic Report on pages 2 to 49 sets out the 
Group’s position and prospects, in particular:
•	 The Group’s business activities, Business Model, 
strategy, their performance and position are set out  
on pages 2 to 39. 
•	 The financial position of the Group including cash flows, 
liquidity position, borrowing facilities and treasury risk 
management policies are set out in note 25. 
•	 The risk factors facing the Group and mitigating actions 
in place are described on pages 40 and 41. 
In addition, note 25 to the Financial Statements  
includes details of the Group’s bank facilities, borrowings 
under such facilities and details of the Group’s  
financial instruments.
After reviewing the available information including the 
Group’s business plans and after making enquiries, the 
Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group 
has adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they 
continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing 
the Financial Statements.
Directors’ Responsibilities Statement
The Directors confirm to the best of their knowledge:
1. the Financial Statements, prepared in accordance with 
IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair view of 
the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss 
of the Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and 
2. the management report, which is incorporated into the 
Directors’ Report, includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business and the 
position of the Company and the undertakings included 
in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties that 
they face.

independent auditor’s report to the members of 
Genus plc
We have audited the Group Financial Statements of 
Genus plc for the year ended 30 June 2013 which 
comprise the Group Income Statement, the Group 
Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Group 
Statement of Changes in Equity, the Group Balance Sheet, 
the Group Statement of Cash Flows and the related notes 
1 to 37. The financial reporting framework that has been 
applied in their preparation is applicable law and 
International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’)  
as adopted by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members,  
as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of  
the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been 
undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s 
members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the 
fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company 
and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit 
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
r espective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement, the Directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the Group Financial Statements and for 
being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our 
responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the 
Group Financial Statements in accordance with applicable 
law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the 
Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
s cope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts 
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to 
give reasonable assurance that the financial statements 
are free from material misstatement, whether caused by 
fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether 
the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the 
overall presentation of the financial statements. In 
addition, we read all the financial and non-financial 
information in the Annual Report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements.  
If we become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the Group Financial Statements:
•	 give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s 
affairs as at 30 June 2013 and of its profit for the year 
then ended;
•	 have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs 
as adopted by the European Union; and
•	 have been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 
of the IAS Regulation.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the c ompanies 
a ct 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ 
Report for the financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the Group 
Financial Statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report 
to you if, in our opinion:
•	 certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified 
by law are not made; or
•	 we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
•	 the Directors’ statement contained within the Directors’ 
Report in relation to going concern;
•	 the part of the Corporate Governance Statement 
relating to the Company’s compliance with the nine 
provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
specified for our review; and
•	 certain elements of the report to shareholders by 
Board on Directors’ remuneration.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Parent Company 
Financial Statements of Genus plc for the year ended 
30 June 2013 and on the information in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report that is described as having 
been audited.

1. r eporting entity
Genus plc (the ‘Company’) is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006. The 
address of the registered office is Belvedere House, Basing View, Basingstoke, Hampshire RG21 4HG. The nature of the 
Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in the Strategic Review. The Group Financial Statements for 
the year ended 30 June 2013 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the ‘Group’) and the 
equity method is used to account for the Group’s interests in joint ventures and associates.
2. Basis of preparation
The Group Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The significant accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods 
presented in these Group Financial Statements.
Certain comparative amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year’s presentation as described in the 
relevant notes.
r estatement in the 2012 and 2011 balance sheet
The balance sheet comparatives for the years ended 30 June 2012 and 30 June 2011 have been restated to recognise 
trade receivables due under royalty contract when they become receivable.
In order to rectify the position, the prior period balance sheet at 30 June 2012 has been restated in accordance with IAS 
8, and, in accordance with IAS 1 (revised), a balance sheet at 30 June 2011 is also presented together with related notes. 
The amounts involved are an increase in trade receivables at 30 June 2012 of £3.7m (2011: £3.7m), an increase in 
deferred tax liabilities at 30 June 2012 of £1.3m (2011: £1.3m) and an increase in shareholders’ equity at 30 June 2012 of 
£2.4m (2011: £2.4m).
There has been no effect on the income statement or cash flows recorded as a result of this restatement.
Functional and presentation currency
The Group Financial Statements are presented in Sterling, which is the Company’s functional and presentation currency. 
All financial information presented in Sterling has been rounded to the nearest million at one decimal point.
Basis of measurement
The Group Financial Statements are prepared under the historical cost convention, except for the following, in 
accordance with IFRS:
•	 biological assets are measured at fair value less point-of-sale costs, which represent the costs of distribution and 
selling expenses; and
•	 derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value.
u se of estimates
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that 
affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. 
Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing 
basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future 
periods affected.
Information about significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies 
that have the most significant effect on the amount recognised in the financial statements are described in note 4.
Going concern
As set out in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, after reviewing the available information including the Group’s 
business plans and after making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the 
going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
At 30 June 2013 the Group had net debt of £52.9m (2012: £56.4m) and undrawn committed borrowing facilities of 
£63.7m. In August 2013, the Group completed a bank refinancing exercise, which now includes an option to increase the 
existing credit facility by an additional US$50m. The new credit facilities are now due to expire on 30 September 2017. 
Whilst these facilities have certain financial covenants, they are not expected to prevent further utilisation of the 
facilities if required. This, together with the maturity profile of debt, provides confidence that the Group has sufficient 
financial resources for the foreseeable future. As a consequence, the Directors believe that the Company is well placed 
to manage its business despite the current uncertain economic environment.

2. Basis of preparation continued
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the 
financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing control, 
potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account. The results of subsidiaries 
acquired are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. The results of subsidiaries 
sold cease to be consolidated from the date on which control passes.
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and 
operating policies. The Group Financial Statements include the Group’s share of the total recognised income and 
expense of associates on an equity accounted basis, from the date that significant influence commences until the date 
that significant influence ceases. When the Group’s share of losses exceeds its interest in an associate, the Group’s 
carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group 
has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of an associate.
Joint ventures are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, established by contractual 
agreement. The Group Financial Statements include the Group’s share of profit or loss arising from joint ventures.
Intra-Group balances and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-Group transactions are eliminated in 
preparing the Group Financial Statements. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity accounted investees 
are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Group’s interest in the investee. Unrealised losses are 
eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
Non-Ga a P measures – adjusted operating profit, adjusted profit before tax and adjusted earnings per share
Adjusted operating profit, adjusted operating profit before tax from continuing operations and adjusted earnings  
per share are defined before the net IAS 41 valuation movement on biological assets, amortisation of acquired 
intangible assets, share-based payment expense, exceptional items and other gains and losses. These additional 
non-GAAP measures of operating performance are included as the Directors believe that they provide useful alternative 
measures for shareholders of the trading performance of the Group. The reconciliation between operating profit from 
continuing operations and adjusted operating profit from continuing operations is shown on the face of the Group 
Income Statement.
Foreign currency
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded in the functional currency of the relevant Group entity at the exchange 
rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in 
foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date and the related foreign 
exchange differences arising on retranslation are recognised in the Group Income Statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated 
using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies that are stated at fair value are translated at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value  
was determined.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill arising on consolidation, are translated into Sterling  
at the foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are 
translated at an average rate for the period.
Exchange differences arising from the translation into Sterling of foreign operations, and the fair value movement  
of related effective hedges, are taken to the foreign currency translation reserve. They are released into the income 
statement upon disposal of the foreign operation.
Exchange movements on intercompany loans designated as long-term funding are taken to the foreign currency 
translation reserve, together with any related taxation.
The principal exchange rates were as follows:

3. s ignificant accounting policies
Business combinations
All business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method. The cost of acquisition is measured at 
the aggregate of the fair value at the date of exchange of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity 
instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition related costs are recognised in the 
profit and loss as incurred.
The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities which meet the conditions for recognition under 
IFRS 3 are recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date, except for non-current assets (or disposal groups) that 
are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 ‘Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations’, 
which are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a subsidiary, associate or joint venture represents the excess of the cost of 
acquisition excluding transaction costs over the Group’s interests in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities 
and contingent liabilities of the acquiree. Identifiable assets include any intangible assets which could be sold separately 
or which arise from legal rights, regardless of whether those rights are separable.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and is 
not amortised but is tested annually for impairment. In respect of associates, the carrying amount of goodwill is 
included in the carrying amount of the investment in the associate.
As required by IAS 21, goodwill arising on acquisition of a foreign operation and any fair value adjustments made to the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the acquired operation on acquisition are treated as assets and liabilities 
of the acquired entity rather than assets or liabilities of the acquiring entity, and are therefore expressed in the 
functional currency of the foreign operation and retranslated at the balance sheet date.
r esearch and development
Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and 
understanding, is recognised in the income statement as incurred.
The Group constantly monitors its research activities and when research projects satisfy the condition for achieving 
technical feasibility and are commercially viable, the Group’s policy is to capitalise further development costs in 
accordance with IAS 38.
The Group’s development activities include the development and maintenance of the porcine genetic nucleus herd and 
the development and maintenance of bovine pre-stud herds.
The Group does not capitalise development expenditure separately for these herds as their fair value is included within 
the fair value of the Group’s biological assets in accordance with IAS 41.
Other development costs are capitalised within intangible assets when the criteria of IAS 38 are met.
The Group discloses the costs incurred in research and herd development activities as required by IAS 38.
exceptional items
The Group presents items which the Directors believe to be exceptional in nature by virtue of their size or incidence 
as exceptional.
intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired by the Group in a business combination subsequent to 1 April 2005 are identified and 
recognised separately from goodwill where they satisfy the definition of an intangible asset and their fair values can 
be measured reliably. The cost of such intangible assets is their fair value at the acquisition date.
Subsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets acquired in a business combination are reported at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, on the same basis as intangible assets acquired separately.
The estimated useful lives are as follows:
Software   2 to 10 years
Porcine genetics technology 20 years
Multiplier contracts  15 years 
Customer relationships  15 to 17 years
intangible assets acquired separately
Intangible assets acquired other than through a business combination are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation 
and any impairment loss. Amortisation is charged on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The 
estimated useful life and amortisation method are reviewed at the end of each annual reporting period, with the effect 
of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis. 86 | Genus plc Annual Report 2013
3. s ignificant accounting policies continued
impairment
The carrying amounts of the Group’s tangible and intangible assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date to 
determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount 
is estimated.
For goodwill, and tangible and intangible assets that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is estimated 
at each balance sheet date.
The recoverable amount is the greater of their net selling price and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated 
future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate of 11.4% (2012: 11.4%), the Group’s 
weighted average cost of capital. A premium is added to this rate to reflect the risk attributable to individual countries. 
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the 
cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-
generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of 
any goodwill allocated to cash-generating units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit 
on a pro rata basis. A cash-generating unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that 
are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.
r eversals of impairment
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
In respect of other assets, an impairment loss is reversed when there is an indication that the impairment loss may no 
longer exist and there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount 
that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
Biological assets and inventories
The principal activity of the Group during the period was the global application of quantitative genetics and 
biotechnology to animal breeding. The Group utilises these techniques to identify and select animals that possess the 
genetics/genes responsible for superior milk and meat quality, high health and performance traits. Genus sells breeding 
animals and semen to customers who produce offspring which yield greater production efficiency, milk and meat 
quality for the global dairy and meat supply chain.
In bovine, research and development is used to identify genetically superior bulls in a number of breeds, but primarily 
the Holstein dairy breed. Progeny testing of the performance of daughters for each bull selected measures their 
performance against those of their peers. Semen from the best bulls is collected and frozen to satisfy customer 
demand. Semen from dairy breeds is used by farmers to breed replacement milking stock. Semen sold from beef 
breeds is used in either specialist beef breeding herds for multiplication of breeding bulls for use in natural service or on 
dairy cows to produce a by-product to be reared for meat.
Bovine biological assets are held for long-term internal use and are classified as non-current assets. Bull semen is 
transferred to inventory at fair value at point of harvest, which becomes the deemed cost under IAS 2. Inventories are 
stated at the lower of this deemed cost and net realisable value.
Since the sorting of semen is not a biological process but a production process, semen inventory transferred into sexed 
semen production is transferred at fair value at point of harvest less cost to sell and becomes a component of the 
production process. Sexed semen is carried in finished goods at production cost.
In porcine, a central breeding stock (the ‘nucleus herd’) is maintained and developed to provide genetically superior 
animals. The animal genetics offer the potential to improve profitability for farmer and food processing customers by 
enabling them to increase output of consistently high quality products yielding higher value. To allow the Group to 
capitalise on its intellectual property the vast majority of production is outsourced to its global multiplier network. 
The offspring or semen obtained from animals in the nucleus herd is sold to customers for use in commercial farming. 
The sale of semen is far less common as porcine semen is sold fresh and has a short life when frozen.
Sales of porcine animals generally occur in one of two ways: ‘upfront’ and ‘royalty’. Under upfront sales, the full fair 
value of the animal is receivable at point of transfer to the customer. Under royalty sales, the pig is regarded as 
comprising two separately identifiable components, its carcass and its inherent genetic potential. The initial 
consideration, which approximates the carcass value of the animal, is receivable at the point that the pig is transferred 
to the customer. The Group retains its interest in the genetic potential of the pig and consideration for the use of this 
genetic potential is received in the form of royalties.
The breeding animal biological assets owned by Genus and the retained interest in the biological assets sold under 
royalty contracts are recognised and measured at fair value at each balance sheet date. Changes in fair value are 
recognised in the income statement within operating profit for the period.

Porcine biological assets which are in use as breeding animals are classified as non-current assets and are carried at fair 
value. Porcine biological assets held with an intention of resale, being the offspring of the breeding herd, are carried at 
fair value and classified as current assets. The retained interest in the genetics from royalty sales is split between 
current and non-current assets based on the remaining expected life of the related animals.
determination of fair values – biological assets
As required by IAS 41 ‘Agriculture’, the Group shows the carrying value of biological assets in the Group Balance Sheet 
determined according to the provisions of IAS 41 with the net valuation movement shown in the income statement. 
There are important differences in the manner in which the value of the Group’s bovine and porcine assets are arrived 
at, as explained below.
Bovine – the fair value of proven bulls, bulls with a genomic evaluation and bulls on test is based on expected future net 
cash flows from the sale of semen, the bull’s harvest, and is discounted at a current market-determined pre-tax rate. 
Proven bulls being those who have completed their evaluation and where the bull’s semen is actively marketed, 
Genomic bulls are those marketed on an estimated genetic value. The fair value of the bovine herd and semen inventory 
managed by the Group has been adjusted where a third party has a revenue share in the sale of semen from a particular 
bull. The significant assumptions determining the fair values are the expected future demand for semen, estimated 
production value, the expected marketable life of each bull and, in addition for bulls on test, the percentage whose 
production is expected to be actively marketed. In assessing the sales price, management uses statistical data for the 
bulls produced by independent authorities, in all its major markets, three times a year. In addition, estimates are also 
used to determine into which markets the semen will be sold, and domestic and export prices. The fair value of bulls 
that have not yet entered the Group testing programme is equivalent to their acquisition and rearing costs.
Porcine – the fair values of porcine biological assets encompasses both the animals owned entirely by Genus and the 
retained interest in the genetics of those animals sold under royalty arrangements. The fair value of animals owned by 
the Group is calculated using average live weights of the animals plus a premium where it is considered that they will be 
saleable for their favourable genetic characteristics. The value attributed to the live weight of the pigs and the premium 
for genetics is based on recent transaction prices achieved by the Group. The significant assumptions in determining 
fair values are the expected life of the breeding animals, the percentage of production animals which are expected to 
be saleable as breeding animals and the expected sales prices. The fair value of the retained interest in the genetics of 
those animals sold under royalty contracts is initially based on the fair values achieved by the Group in recent 
transactions from direct sales of similar animals, less the values received upfront for the sale of the carcass element. The 
fair value of the retained interest is remeasured at each reporting date. The significant assumption in determining the 
fair value of the retained interest is the expected life of the animal transferred under royalty contracts.
The porcine animals within the pure line herds, being the repository of Genus’s proprietary genetics, are valued as a 
single unit of account using a discounted cash flow model applied to the future outputs of the herds at current prices. 
The significant assumptions are the number of future generations from which output is attributable to the current 
herds, the fair value prices achieved on sales, the expected useful lifespan and productivity of the animals, and the 
discount rate applied.
Non recognition of porcine multiplier contracts where no contractual interest is retained by the Group
In order to manage commercial risk a very large part of the Group’s porcine business model involves the sale of pigs to 
farmers (‘multipliers’) who produce piglets on farms neither managed nor controlled by the Group. The Group has the 
option to purchase the offspring at slaughter market value plus a premium but no obligation to do so. The Group then 
has the ability to sell the offspring to other farmers at a premium because the offspring has superior genetics.
The right to purchase offspring is not recognised on the balance sheet as the contracts are entered into and continue to 
be held for the purpose of the receipt of non-financial items (the offspring) in accordance with the Group’s expected 
purchase requirements. As such the option is outside the scope of IAS 39. The offspring are not recognised as 
biological assets under IAS 41 as they are neither owned nor controlled by the Group.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, together with any directly attributable expenses of acquisition, or at 
their latest valuation, less depreciation and any impairment losses.
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate 
items of property, plant and equipment.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of 
an item of property, plant and equipment. Land and assets not available for use are not depreciated. The estimated 
useful lives are as follows:
Freehold land   nil
Freehold buildings  10 to 15 years
Leasehold buildings  over the term of the lease
Plant and equipment  3 to 20 years
Motor vehicles   3 to 5 years
t rade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are stated at their nominal amount (discounted if material) less impairment losses. 88 | Genus plc Annual Report 2013
3. s ignificant accounting policies continued
c ash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral 
part of the Group’s cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose only 
of the statement of cash flows.
interest-bearing loans and borrowings
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs. 
Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any 
difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the expected life of the 
borrowings on an effective interest rate basis.
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result 
of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the 
effect is material, provisions are discounted to present value.
r evenue
Revenue comprises the invoiced value of sales and royalties receivable from customers, net of trade discounts and 
value added tax.
The principal components of the Group’s revenue and their respective accounting treatments are:
•	 Revenue from the sale of bovine and porcine semen, porcine breeding animals and veterinary products is recognised 
upon transfer of risks and rewards, either upon shipment to customers or delivery depending on the terms of sale.
•	 Royalties are recognised when receivable. Royalty payments are received from certain porcine customers based on 
key performance variables such as the number of pigs born per litter, the number of litters born per sow and the 
average slaughter weight of animal born.
•	 Revenue from consulting services represents amounts charged for professional services provided during the year 
including recoverable expenses but excluding value added tax. Services provided but not yet billed are recognised as 
revenue based on a fair value assessment of the work delivered and a contractual right to receive payment. Where 
unbilled revenue is contingent on a future event, nothing is recognised until the contingent event crystallises.
Leases
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present 
value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability to the 
lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between finance 
charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of 
the liability. Finance charges are recognised directly in the income statement, unless they are directly attributable to 
qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalised in accordance with the Group’s general policy on borrowing costs 
(see below).
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of 
the relevant lease. Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a 
straight-line basis over the lease term.
Finance costs
Interest income and interest payable are recognised in the income statement as they accrue. Dividend income is 
recognised in the income statement on the date the entity’s right to receive payments is established.
Finance costs that are directly attributable to construction of a qualifying asset, which are assets that necessarily take a 
substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such 
time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. Other borrowing costs are recognised in the 
income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
t axation
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement 
except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity, or 
arises as a fair value adjustment in a business combination.
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or to be 
recovered) using the tax rates and the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, 
together with any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous years.

Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets 
and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and 
is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable 
temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will 
be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not 
recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition 
(other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable 
profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and 
associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary 
difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the 
asset is realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or 
credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
s hare-based payments
In accordance with IFRS 2, the fair value of share awards and options granted is recognised as an employee expense 
with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the vesting period of 
each option. The fair value of the options granted is measured using a Binomial valuation model. The fair value of the 
awards granted is measured using a Black-Scholes valuation model. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted 
to reflect the estimated performance against non-market related conditions and the number of share awards and 
options that actually vest at the end of the vesting period.
t reasury shares
Transactions, assets and liabilities of the Group-sponsored Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust (‘QUEST’) are 
included in the Group Financial Statements. In particular, the trust’s purchases of shares in the Company remain 
deducted from shareholders’ equity until they vest unconditionally with employees.
r etirement benefit obligations
Defined contribution pension schemes
A number of employees are members of defined contribution pension schemes. Contributions are charged to the 
income statement as they become payable in accordance with the rules of the scheme. Differences between 
contributions payable and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet. 
The assets of these schemes are held separately from those of the Group.
Defined benefit pension schemes
The Group operates defined benefit pension schemes for some of its employees, which are closed to new members. 
The Group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit schemes is calculated separately for each plan by estimating 
the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods. 
That benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets (at bid price) is deducted. 
The liability discount rate is the market yield at the balance sheet date on high quality corporate bonds that have terms 
to maturity approximating to the Group’s pension liabilities. The calculations are performed by qualified actuaries using 
the projected unit market method.
Actuarial gains and losses including the difference between the expected and actual return on scheme assets and 
experience gains and losses on scheme liabilities are recognised in the period in which they occur directly into equity 
through the Group Statement of Changes in Equity.
Pension costs are recognised on a systematic basis to match the costs of providing retirement benefits evenly over the 
service lives of the employees concerned. Any excess or deficiency of the actuarial value of assets over the actuarial 
value of liabilities is allocated over the average remaining service lives of current employees.
The retirement benefit obligations referred to in note 28 include obligations relating to the Milk Pension defined benefit 
scheme. Genus, together with other participating employers, is joint and severally liable for the scheme’s obligations. 
Genus accounts for its section and its share of any orphan assets and liabilities, together with a provision for any 
amounts it believes it will be required to pay under its joint and several liability. As a result of the joint and several 
liability, Genus has a contingent liability for those of the scheme’s obligations that Genus has not accounted for.
Under the joint and several liability, the Group will recognise initially any changes in its share of any orphan assets and 
liabilities in the income statement. Any actuarial gains and losses in the orphan assets and liabilities after the initial 
recognition will be recognised in the period in which they occur directly into equity through the Group Statement of 
Changes in Equity. 90 | Genus plc Annual Report 2013
3. s ignificant accounting policies continued
derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
The Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate risk, foreign 
exchange rate risk and commodity prices. The Group uses interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk, forward 
exchange contracts to manage foreign exchange risk and forward commodity contracts to manage commodity 
price risk.
The fair value interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap 
at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the current creditworthiness of the swap 
counterparties.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts and forward commodity contracts are their quoted market price at the 
balance sheet date, being the present value of the quoted forward price.
c ash flow hedges
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset 
or liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial 
instrument is recognised in equity in the hedging reserve. Any ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised 
immediately in the Group Income Statement.
Where a hedge of a forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a financial asset or a financial 
liability, the associated gains and losses that were recognised directly in equity are recycled in the Group Income 
Statement in the same period or periods during which the asset acquired or liability assumed affects the Group Income 
Statement, i.e. when interest income or expense is recognised.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the entity revokes designation of the hedge 
relationship but the hedged forecast transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point 
remains in equity and is recognised in accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs. If the hedged 
transaction is no longer expected to take place, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in equity is 
recognised immediately in the Group Income Statement.
Net investment hedges
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability of the net assets of an overseas 
subsidiary entity arising from the spot or forward exchange rate translation risk associated with the functional  
currency of overseas subsidiary entities, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument 
is recognised directly in the hedging reserve. Any ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised immediately in the 
Group Income Statement.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the entity revokes designation of the hedge 
relationship, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity until such point as the investment to which it 
relates is disposed.
Net investment hedge accounting is applied solely in the Group Financial Statements.

•	 Amendments to IAS 19, IAS 27, IAS 28 and IAS 32
•	 IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’
•	 IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments – Classification and Measurement’
•	 IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’

The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations in future periods will have no material 
impact on the financial statements of the Group, except as follows:
•	 IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’, which will introduce a number of changes in the presentation of financial  
instruments; and
•	 IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ will impact the measurement of the various components representing movements in the 
defined pension obligation and associated disclosures, but not the Group’s total obligation. Expected returns on plan 
assets will be replaced by a net finance cost in the income statement, consequently reducing the profit for the period 
by £3.7m and accordingly other comprehensive income increased by £3.7m. A prior period restatement will reflect 
these amendments in next year’s annual report.
4. s ignificant areas of judgement and determination of fair values
Management consider the critical accounting policies and significant areas of judgement to be the following:
determination of the fair value of biological assets
The determination of the fair values of bovine and porcine biological assets requires the use of significant judgement 
and assumptions.
Bovine: The key judgements are in respect of the forecast sales volumes, the expected unit prices, the useful lifespan of 
the animals and the discount rate applied.
Porcine: The key judgements and assumptions are in respect of the useful lifespan of the animals, the expected 
proportion to slaughter, the mix of boars and gilts and, in the case of the animals within the pure line herds, the number 
of future generations from which output is attributable to the current herds, the fair value prices achieved on sales, the 
expected useful lifespan and the productivity of the animals, and the discount rate applied. See note 15.
Fair value of assets and liabilities on business combinations
The Group’s accounting policy on the acquisition of subsidiaries is to determine the net fair value of identifiable assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired with the fair value of any consideration in excess of this amount 
representing goodwill. In determining the fair values of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired, the use of 
significant judgement and assumptions with respect to estimated future cash flows and unprovided liabilities and 
commitments, particularly to tax, are often involved.
The determination of the useful life of intangible assets, particularly on those arising on acquisition, involves the exercise 
of management judgement.
impairment of goodwill, intangible and tangible assets
Determining whether goodwill, intangible and tangible assets are impaired requires a consideration of any specific 
impairment indicators and an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which goodwill, intangible 
and tangible assets have been allocated. The value in use calculation requires the Directors to estimate the future cash 
flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and the appropriate discount rate in order to calculate present 
value. See note 14.
r ecognition of deferred tax assets
In recognising income tax assets and liabilities, the Directors make estimates of the likely outcome of decisions by tax 
authorities on transactions and events whose treatment for tax purposes is uncertain. In recognising deferred tax assets 
and liabilities management also makes judgements about likely future taxable profits. When the final outcome of such 
matters, including the recognition of deferred tax assets on tax losses, is different, or expected to be different, from 
previous assessments by management, a change to the carrying value of income tax assets and liabilities will be 
recorded in the period in which such a determination is made. See note 19.
defined benefit pension scheme
Amounts recorded in the financial statements in respect of defined benefit pension schemes are also based on 
significant estimates and judgement. Details of estimates and judgements made in calculating these transactions are 
contained in note 28. These include estimates and judgements as to the extent to which provisions should be made  
for any amounts that might become payable under the Group’s joint and several liability in respect of the Milk  
Pension Fund.
s hare-based payments
Amounts recorded in the financial statements in respect of share-based payments are also based on significant 
estimates and judgement. Details of estimates and judgements made in calculating these transactions are contained in 
note 29. 92 | Genus plc Annual Report 2013

During the year, the multi-employer Milk Pension Fund (‘MPF’) triennial valuation as at 31 March 2012 was completed 
and a new funding agreement between the employers was agreed. In addition, two participating employers exited the 
scheme and made cash payments of £31m. These changes gave rise to an exceptional credit of £7.0m. This credit 
reflects Genus’s share of deficit repair contributions agreed in the valuation and the effect of the two employers’ exits, 
compared with the pension provision of £20.1m made in the previous year to recognise the risk that some employers 
could be unable to meet their share of the deficit.
The integration and restructuring charge of £2.8m (2012: £2.0m) relates principally to a refocusing of the European 
porcine business as it continued to reduce direct farm operations, whilst widening its restructuring programme in line 
with the Group’s global strategy. The fundamental aims of the restructure were to increase the rate of genetic progress, 
and to tailor the business model to meet the current and emerging needs of our customers. Where the business was 
historically split by country, this was reorganised into four distinct regions based on customer behaviours and the 
physical cross-border flow of animals. At the same time support services such as supply chain, technical service and 
genetic services have been centralised, ensuring improved alignment to long-term goals.
In the prior year an exceptional credit of £23.0m arose as a result of a change in the basis of calculating the value of the 
Group’s porcine pure line breeding animals under IAS 41. This change has increased the carrying value of biological 
assets under IAS 41 but has no cash impact. The pure line assets were previously valued by applying fair values of the 
nearest similar assets. The new methodology employs a discounted cash flow calculation applied to the expected 
output of each herd of breeding animals as a whole. This is considered to be a more relevant basis of estimating the fair 
value of the pure line assets.

The tax rate for the year depends upon the mix of profits by country, particularly upon the high level of profits 
generated in North America, and the ability of the Group to recognise deferred tax assets in respect of losses in  
some of the Group’s smaller territories. The prior year deferred tax credit in the prior year principally arises from 
a reassessment of the underlying US tax rate applicable to the future taxation of the Group’s biological assets in  
that territory.
The tax expense attributable to exceptional items is £1.3m (2012: £2.6m).

impairment testing for cash-generating units containing goodwill
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the Group’s operating segments which represent the 
lowest level within the Group at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
The aggregate carrying amounts of goodwill allocated to each operating segment are as follows:
2013

2012 
£m
Genus PIC 44.5 43.7
Genus ABS 16.1 15.3
Genus Asia 7.2 7.4
67.8 66.4
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might 
be impaired. 100 | Genus plc Annual Report 2013
14. intangible assets continued
The recoverable amount of the cash-generating units is determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions 
for the value in use calculations of cash-generating units are those regarding discount rates, growth rates, expected 
changes to selling prices and direct costs. Management has estimated the discount rate using the Group’s weighted 
average cost of capital (‘WACC’), changes in selling prices and direct costs, which are based on past experience and 
expectations of future changes in the market.
The Group prepares cash flows derived from the most recent financial and strategic plans approved by management 
for the next five years, and extrapolates cash flows using estimated growth rates beyond this period.
Annual growth rates ranging from 1.2% to 27.5% have been applied to cash flows in the five-year financial and strategic 
planning period.
A growth rate of 2.5% (2012: 2.5%) has been used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the budget and strategic 
plan period.
The post-tax WACC of 8.0% (2012: 8.0%) has been applied to cash flow projections, which equates to a pre-tax rate of 
approximately 11.4% (2012: 11.4%). The discount rate has been risk adjusted for Latin America and Asia, with an 
additional premium of 1% to 3% added to the WACC, respectively.

Bovine biological assets include £3.2m (2012: £1.6m) representing the fair value of bulls owned by third parties but 
managed by the Group, net of expected future payments to such third parties and are therefore treated as assets held 
under finance leases.
There are no movements in the carrying value of the bovine biological assets in respect of sales or other changes 
during the year.
The current market determined post-tax rate used to discount expected future net cash flows from the sale of bull 
semen is the Group’s weighted average cost of capital. This has been assessed as 8.0% (2012: 8.0%).
Decreases due to harvest represent the semen extracted from the biological assets. Inventories of such semen are 
shown as biological asset harvest in note 20.

Porcine biological assets include £36.9m (2012: £41.4m) relating to the fair value of the retained interest in the genetics 
in respect of animals transferred to customers under royalty contracts. Total revenue in the period includes £73.0m 
(2012: £73.2m) in respect of these contracts comprising £10.6m (2012: £15.6m) on initial transfer of animals to 
customers and £62.4m (2012: £57.6m) in respect of royalties received. Decreases attributable to sales during the period 
of £131.2m (2012: £141.5m) include £28.9m (2012: £31.9m) in respect of the reduction in fair value of the retained interest 
in the genetics of animals sold under royalty contracts.
For pure line porcine herds, the net cash flows from the expected output of the herds are discounted at the Group’s 
required rate of return adjusted for the greater risk implicit in including output from future generations. This adjusted 
rate has been assessed as 11.0% (2012: 11.0%). The number of future generations which have been taken into account is 
seven (2012: seven) and their estimated useful lifespan is 1.4 years (2012: 1.4 years).
Included in increases due to purchases, the aggregate gain arising during the period on initial recognition of biological 
assets in respect of multiplier purchases was £28.9m (2012: £29.7m).

** An exceptional credit of £23.0m arose in 2012 as a result of a change in the basis of calculating the value of the Group’s porcine pure line 
breeding animals under IAS 41. This change has increased the carrying value of biological assets under IAS 41 but has no cash impact.

19. deferred tax assets and liabilities
u nrecognised deferred tax assets and liabilities
At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses with a potential tax benefit of £13.3m (2012: £11.6m) 
available for offset against future profits. A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of £0.5m (2012: £0.6m) 
of such losses. No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining £12.8m (2012: £11.0m) due to the 
uncertainty over the availability of future taxable profits in the relevant jurisdictions.
Deferred tax liabilities totalling £4.3m (2012: £3.0m) have not been recognised for the withholding tax and other taxes 
that would be payable on the unremitted earnings of certain overseas subsidiaries. No provision is required since the 
Group is in a position to control the timing and reversal of these differences and it is probable that such differences will 
not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset above to the extent that they arise in the same tax jurisdiction.
The Finance Act 2012, which provides for a reduction in the main rate of corporation tax from 24% to 23% effective from 
1 April 2013, was substantively enacted on 3 July 2012. This rate reduction has been reflected in the calculation of 
deferred tax at the balance sheet date.
The Government has enacted future reduction in the main tax rate down to 21% effective from 1 April 2014 and to 20% 
by 1 April 2015. As these tax rates were not substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, the rate reduction is not yet 
reflected in these financial statements in accordance with IAS 10, as it is a non-adjusting event occurring after the 
reporting period.
We estimate that the future rate change to 20% would further reduce our UK deferred tax asset recognised at 30 June 
2013 from £7.2m to £6.4m. The actual impact will be dependent on our deferred tax position at that time.

t rade receivables
The average credit period taken on the sales of goods is 67 days (2012: 65 days, 2011: 69 days). No interest is charged 
on receivables for the first 30 days from the date of the invoice. The Group provides for all receivables based upon 
knowledge of the customer and historical experience and estimates irrecoverable amounts by reference to past  
default experience.
There are no customers who represent more than 5% of the total balance of trade receivables (2012: nil, 2011: nil).
At 30 June 2013 £45.3m (2012: £44.4m, 2011: £44.4m) of trade receivables were not yet due for payment.
Included in the Group’s trade receivables balance are debtors with a carrying amount of £18.7m (2012: £16.5m, 
2011: £15.8m) which are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided as there has not been 
a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable. The Group does not hold 
any collateral over these balances. The average age of these receivables is 65 days (2012: 59 days, 2011: 60 days). 106 | Genus plc Annual Report 2013

In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade 
receivable from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date. The concentration of credit risk is limited 
due to the customer base being large and unrelated.
The impairment recognised represents the difference between the carrying amount of these trade receivables and the 
present value of expected proceeds. The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.
Receivables denominated in currencies other than Sterling comprise £18.3m of receivables denominated in US Dollars 
(2012: £16.6m, 2011: £11.9m), £10.4m of receivables denominated in Euros (2012: £9.3m, 2011: £11.0m) and £19.7m of 
receivables denominated in other currencies (2012: £21.2m, 2011: £29.1m).

25. Financial instruments continued
s ignificant accounting policies continued
For those financial instruments held at valuation, the Group has categorised them into a three level fair value hierarchy 
based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique in accordance with IFRS 7. The hierarchy gives the  
highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority  
to unobservable inputs (Level 3). If the inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy,  
the category level is based on the lowest priority level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the 
instrument in its entirety. The fair values of the Group’s outstanding interest rate swaps have been estimated by 
calculating the present value of future cash flows, using appropriate market discount rates, representing Level 2 fair 
value measurements as defined by IFRS 7. There are no financial instruments which have been categorised as Level 1  
or Level 3.

Financial risk management objectives
The Group’s Corporate Treasury function provides services to the business, coordinates access to domestic and 
international financial markets, monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the operations of the Group through 
internal risk reports which analyse exposures by degree and magnitude of risks. These risks include market risk (including 
currency risk, fair value interest rate risk and price risk), credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow interest rate risk.
The Group seeks to minimise the effects of these risks by using derivative financial instruments to hedge these risk 
exposures. The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the Board of Directors, 
which provide written principles on foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, the use of financial derivatives 
and non-derivative financial instruments, and the investment of excess liquidity. Compliance with policies and exposure 
limits is reviewed by the Board of Directors regularly. The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, 
including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.
Key financial risks and exposures are monitored through a monthly report to the Board of Directors, together with an 
annual Board review of corporate treasury matters.
Financial risk
The principal financial risks to which the Group is exposed through its activities are risks of changes in foreign currency 
exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. The Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments 
to manage its exposure to interest rate, foreign currency risk and commodity price risk, including:
•	 forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on the sale of goods in foreign currency 
and on the purchase of supplies in foreign currencies;
•	 interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates; and
•	 forward commodity contracts to hedge commodity price risk.
Foreign currency risk management
The Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Any exposures to exchange rate 
fluctuations which arise are managed within approved policy parameters utilising forward foreign exchange contracts.
The carrying amounts of the Group’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the 
reporting date are as follows:

Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
The Group is mainly exposed to movement in the US Dollar, Euro, Brazilian Real and the Mexico Peso exchange rates.
The following table details the Group’s sensitivity to a 10% increase and decrease in Sterling against the relevant foreign 
currencies. 10% is the sensitivity rate used when reporting foreign currency risk internally to key management personnel 
and represents management’s assessment of a significant change in foreign exchange rates. The sensitivity analysis 
includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end 
for a 10% change in foreign currency rates. The sensitivity analysis includes external loans as well as loans to foreign 
operations within the Group where the denomination of the loan is in a currency other than the currency of the lender 
or the borrower. A positive number below indicates an increase in profit where Sterling weakens against the relevant 
currency. For a strengthening of Sterling against the relevant currency, there would be an equal and opposite impact on 
the profit, and the balances below would be negative. The impact on other equity is minimal due to the net investment 
hedging in place.

interest rate risk management
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as entities in the Group borrow funds at both fixed and floating interest rates. 
The risk is managed centrally by the Group by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate 
borrowings, using interest rate swap agreements. Hedging activities are reviewed regularly to align with interest rate 
views and defined risk appetite, thereby ensuring optimal hedging strategies are applied, to minimise the adverse 
impact of fluctuations in interest expense through different interest rate cycles.
The Group’s exposures to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk 
management section of this note. 110 | Genus plc Annual Report 2013
25. Financial instruments continued
interest rate sensitivity analysis
The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivatives and 
non-derivative instruments at the balance sheet date. For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the 
amount of liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year. A 1.0% increase or 
decrease is used when reporting interest rate risk internally to key management personnel and represents 
management’s assessment of a significant change in interest rates.
If interest rates had been 1.0% higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s profit for the year 
ended 30 June 2013 would decrease/increase by £0.3m (2012: decrease/increase by £0.4m). This small impact is 
attributable to the Group’s decreasing borrowing liabilities and the effects of fixed rate hedging.
interest rate swap contracts
Under interest rate swap contracts, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating rate 
interest amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts. Such contracts enable the Group to mitigate the risk 
of changing interest rates on the cash flow exposures on the issued variable rate debt held. The fair value of interest 
rate swaps at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the yield curves at the 
reporting date and the credit risk inherent in the contract, and is disclosed below. The average interest rate is based on 
the outstanding balances at the end of the financial year.
The following tables detail the notional principal amounts and remaining terms of interest rate swap contracts 
outstanding as at the reporting date:

The interest rate swaps settle on a quarterly basis. The corresponding floating rate on the interest rate swaps is  
three-month LIBOR. The Group settles the difference between the fixed and floating interest rate on a net basis.
Interest rate swap contracts exchanging floating rate interest amounts for fixed rate interest amounts are designated as 
cash flow hedges in order to reduce the Group’s cash flow exposure resulting from variable interest rates on 
borrowings. The interest rate swaps and the interest payments on the loan occur simultaneously and the amount 
deferred in equity is recognised in profit or loss over the period that the floating rate interest payments on debt impact 
profit or loss.

c redit risk management
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the 
Group. The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties. The Group’s exposure and the 
credit ratings of its counterparties are regularly monitored and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread 
amongst approved counterparties. Credit exposure on financial instruments is controlled by counterparty limits that are 
reviewed and approved by the Board annually.
Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread across diverse industries and geographical areas. 
Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable.
Liquidity risk management
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors. The Group manages liquidity risk 
by maintaining adequate reserves and banking facilities and by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows 
and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
Liquidity and interest risk tables
The following tables detail the Group’s remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative financial liabilities 
(excluding trade payables and other creditors). The tables have been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows 
of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay. The table includes both 
interest and principal cash flows.

The Group has access to financing facilities, the total unused amount of which is £63.7m (2012: £59.5m) at the balance 
sheet date. The Group expects to meet its other obligations from operating cash flows and proceeds of maturing 
financial assets. The Group expects to reduce the current debt to equity ratio as the level of borrowings decreases 
through repayment from operating cash flows.
The following table details the Group’s liquidity analysis for its derivative financial instruments. The table has been 
drawn up based on the undiscounted net cash outflows on the derivative instruments that settle on a net basis and the 
undiscounted gross outflows on those derivatives that require gross settlement. When the amount payable or 
receivable is not fixed, the amount disclosed has been determined by reference to the projected interest and foreign 
currency rates as illustrated by the yield curves existing at the reporting date.

28. r etirement benefit obligations
The Group has a number of defined contribution and defined benefit pension schemes covering many of its employees. 
The principal funds are those in the United Kingdom, the Milk Pension Fund and the Dalgety Pension Fund, which are 
defined benefit schemes. The assets of these funds are held separately from the assets of the Group and administered 
by trustees and managed professionally. These schemes are closed to new members.
The financial position of the defined benefit schemes as recorded in accordance with IAS 19 are aggregated for 
disclosure purposes. The liability split by principal scheme is set out below.

55.7 57.2
The Dalgety Pension Fund – 1.4
Other retirement benefit obligations 9.3 8.7
Overall pension liability 65.0 67.3
Overall, the Group expects to pay £6.0m in contributions to defined benefit plans in the 2013–14 financial year.
t he Milk Pension Fund (‘MPF’)
The MPF is that previously operated by the Milk Marketing Board, and was also open to membership of staff working for 
Milk Marque Ltd (the principal employer now known as Community Foods Group Limited), National Milk Records plc, 
First Milk Ltd, hauliers associated to First Milk Ltd, Dairy Farmers of Britain Ltd (which went into receivership in June 
2009) and Milk Link Ltd.
Genus has accounted for its section and its share of any orphan assets and liabilities, collectively representing 
approximately 75% of the MPF (2012: 37% of the MPF and £20.1m provision). Although managed on a sectionalised 
basis, the MPF is a ‘last man standing scheme’, which means that all participating employers are joint and severally liable 
for all of the fund’s liabilities.
During the year, the multi-employer MPF triennial valuation as at 31 March 2012 was completed and a new funding 
agreement between the employers was agreed. In addition, two participating employers exited the scheme and made 
cash payments of £31m. These changes gave rise to an exceptional credit of £7m. This credit reflects Genus’s share of 
deficit repair contributions agreed in the valuation and the effect of the two employers’ exits, compared with the 
pension provision of £20.1m made in the previous year to recognise the risk that some employers could be unable to 
meet their share of the deficit.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the MPF was at 31 March 2012. The valuation of the fund used the projected 
unit method (for future service, a control period of three years was used) and was carried out by professionally 
qualified actuaries.
The principal actuarial assumptions adopted in the 2012 valuation were that investment returns on existing assets would 
be 6.4% per annum before retirement and 4.0% per annum after retirement and that the annual increase in pensions in 
payment would be 3.4% per annum. 114 | Genus plc Annual Report 2013
28. r etirement benefit obligations continued
t he Milk Pension Fund (‘MPF’) continued
At 31 March 2012, the market value of the fund’s assets amounted to £312m. The value of those assets represented 
approximately 69% of the value of the uninsured liabilities which were £453m at 31 March 2012, after allowing for 
expected future increases in earnings.
The deficit in the fund as a whole, by reference to the 31 March 2012 valuation, was £141m (of which Genus’s notional 
share was £106m) and this shortfall is being addressed by additional contributions from the participating employers 
and the exit payment of £31m made in September 2012 by two employers. Under the new funding agreement, the 
Company has agreed to make deficit repair contributions between £4.5m–£6.4m per annum between 31 March 2013 
and 31 March 2016, and rising thereafter by 3.4% for a further nine years until 31 March 2026.
With effect from 30 June 2013, Genus’s active members ceased accruing benefits in the fund and became 
deferred pensioners.
The Group’s pension cost for the scheme in 2013 is £nil (2012: £0.1m).
dalgety Pension Fund (‘dPF’)
The most recent actuarial valuation of the DPF was at 31 March 2012. The valuation of the scheme used the projected 
unit method and was carried out by professionally qualified actuaries.
The principal actuarial assumptions adopted in the 2012 valuation were that investment returns on existing assets would 
be 5.2% per annum before retirement and 3.3% per annum after retirement and that the annual increase in pensions in 
payment would be 3.5% per annum.
The market value of the available assets at 31 March 2012 was £21.3m. The value of those assets represents 
approximately 99% of the value of the uninsured liabilities which were £21.6m at 31 March 2012.
Under the new funding agreement, the Company has agreed to make deficit repair contributions of £0.3m per annum 
until 30 June 2013.
The disclosures required under IAS 19 have been calculated by an independent actuary based on accurate calculations 
carried out as at 31 March 2012 updated to 30 June 2013. Under the projected unit method the current service cost will 
increase as the members approach retirement.
There is a £11.1m reserve held by Trustees of DPF against future unknown liabilities materialising. As the economic 
benefit to the Company of this amount is not certain, it is treated as a contingent asset.
The Group’s pension cost for the scheme in 2013 is £nil (2012: £nil).
Other defined benefit scheme in deficit
The Group also operates a closed defined benefit scheme for a small number of former employees of the National Pig 
Development Company Limited. The total market value of scheme assets and liabilities at 30 June 2013 under the 
provisions of IAS 19 were £4.3m (2012: £3.9m) and £5.6m (2012: £5.2m), respectively.
Other unfunded schemes
On the acquisition of Sygen International plc, the Group acquired three unfunded defined benefit schemes and an 
unfunded retirement health benefit plan, which it now operates for the benefit of the previous group’s senior employees 
and executives.
For the three unfunded defined benefit schemes, based on the methods and assumptions of IAS 19 the scheme 
liabilities amount to £6.6m (2012: £6.2m) and this amount is included within pension liabilities in the Group’s balance 
sheet. The current cost charged to operating profit in the year to 30 June 2013 amounted to £nil (2012: £nil) and the 
interest on pension scheme liabilities amounted to £0.3m (2012: £0.3m).
The principal assumptions used to calculate the scheme liabilities were that the discount rate would be 4.6% (2012: 4.5%) 
and that inflation and pension payments would be 3.4% per annum (2012: 2.8%).
For the unfunded retirement health benefit plan, based on the methods and assumptions of IAS 19, scheme liabilities 
amount to £1.3m (2012: £1.2m) and this amount is included within retirement benefit obligations in the Group’s balance 
sheet. The current cost charged to operating profit in the year to 30 June 2013 amounted to £nil (2012: £nil) and the 
interest on plan liabilities amounted to £0.1m (2012: £0.1m).
The principal assumptions used to calculate the plan liabilities were that the discount rate would be 4.6% (2012: 4.5%) 
and that the long-term rate of medical expense inflation would be 7.4% (2012: 6.8%).

Expected return on plan assets 7.1% 6.3%
Medical cost trend rate 7.4% 6.8%
Future pension increases and inflation 3.4% 2.8%
The mortality assumptions used are consistent with those recommended by the schemes’ actuaries and reflect the 
latest available tables, adjusted for the experience of the scheme where appropriate. In 2013 the mortality tables used 
are 90% of the SN1A tables, with birth year and 2011 CMI projections, with mortality rates increased by 25% at all ages 
(2012: the mortality tables used are the SN1A tables, with birth year and medium cohort projections, with mortality rates 
increased by 25% at all ages).
The following table shows the assumptions used for all schemes and illustrates the expectation of life of an average 
member retiring at age 65 at the balance sheet date and a member reaching age 65 in 20 years’ time.

Female 25.7 24.0
Retiring at age 65 in 20 years’ time:
Male 25.0 24.7
Female 27.6 27.0
The overall expected long-term rate of return on assets is 7.1% (2012: 6.3%). The expected long-term rate of return is 
based on the portfolio as a whole and not on the sum of the returns on individual asset categories. The return is based 
exclusively on historical returns, without adjustments.
The amount the deficit varies if the main financial assumption changes, particularly the discount rate. If the discount 
rate increased/decreased by 0.1% the IAS 19 deficit would decrease/increase by £5.0m.

On 12 August 2004 the Group established a share option programme that entitles key management personnel and 
other senior employees to purchase shares in the Company. Further grants on similar terms were offered to these 
employee groups as set out below. The terms and conditions of the grants are as set out below. All options are to be 
settled by physical delivery of shares and meet the criteria for being treated as equity-settled as defined by IFRS 2.

the year to 30 June 2013, options were granted on 7 September 2012. The aggregate of the fair values of those options 
granted was £611,000. 118 | Genus plc Annual Report 2013
29. s hare-based payments continued
The fair value of services received in return for share options granted is based on the fair value of share options 
granted, measured using a binomial model, with the following inputs:
a ssumptions applied in valuation models at grant date
2013 2012
Exercise price of options granted in the year (nil for awards) 1,344p 978p
Expected volatility (weighted average volatility) 31% 30%
Option life (expected weighted average life) 6.5 years 6.5 years
Expected dividends 1.34% 1.46%
Risk-free interest rate (based on government bonds) 0.95% 1.7%
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the estimated fair value of the Company’s 
share price over the previous three years. The option life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s 
best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
s hare awards
In addition to the outstanding share options above, there are a total of 622,529 conditional share awards which are 
outstanding at 30 June 2013. These conditional shares were awarded to Executive Directors and senior management on 
3 March 2009, 15 September 2009, 10 September 2010, 9 September 2011, 7 December 2012 and 28 February 2013 under 
the 2004 Performance Share Plan. In accordance with the terms of the plan, participants in the plan have received a 
conditional annual award of shares or nil cost option awards which will vest mainly after three years, with the proportion 
of the award vesting being based on growth in Group adjusted earnings per share. Further details of the performance 
conditions attributing to the 2004 Performance Share Plan are given in the Directors’ Remuneration Report.

independent auditor’s report to the members of 
Genus plc
We have audited the Parent Company Financial 
Statements of Genus plc for the year ended 30 June 2013 
which comprise the Parent Company Balance Sheet and 
the related notes 38 to 51. The financial reporting 
framework that has been applied in their preparation 
is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice).
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, 
as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of 
the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been 
undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s 
members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the 
fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company 
and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit 
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
r espective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement, the Directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the Parent Company Financial Statements 
and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. 
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on 
the Parent Company Financial Statements in accordance 
with applicable law and International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require  
us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical 
Standards for Auditors.
s cope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts 
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to 
give reasonable assurance that the financial statements 
are free from material misstatement, whether caused by 
fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether 
the accounting policies are appropriate to the Parent 
Company’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of 
significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; 
and the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial 
information in the Annual Report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. 
If we become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the Parent Company Financial Statements:
•	 give a true and fair view of the state of the Parent 
Company’s affairs as at 30 June 2013;
•	 have been properly prepared in accordance with 
United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice; and
•	 have been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the c ompanies 
a ct 2006
In our opinion:
•	 the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be 
audited has been properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 2006; and
•	 the information given in the Directors’ Report for the 
financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the Parent Company 
Financial Statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following 
matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to 
report to you if, in our opinion:
•	 adequate accounting records have not been kept by 
the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit 
have not been received from branches not visited by 
us; or
•	 the Parent Company Financial Statements and the part 
of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited 
are not in agreement with the accounting records and 
returns; or
•	 certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified 
by law are not made; or
•	 we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Group Financial 
Statements of Genus plc for the year ended 30 June 2013.

38. s ignificant accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The Financial Statements are prepared under the historical cost convention, in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006 and applicable United Kingdom accounting standards. The accounting policies have been applied consistently 
throughout the current and prior year.
The principal accounting policies are summarised below.
The Company’s financial statements are included in the Genus plc consolidated financial statements for the year ended 
30 June 2013. As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has not presented its own profit 
and loss account. The Company has also taken advantage of the exemption from preparing a cash flow statement 
under the terms of FRS 1 (revised 1996) ‘Cash Flow Statements’. The Company is also exempt under the terms of FRS 8 
‘Related Party Disclosures’ from disclosing transactions with other members of the Genus Group.
Fixed assets and depreciation
Fixed assets are stated at cost, together with any incidental expenses of acquisition or at their latest valuation, less 
depreciation and any provision for impairment. Depreciation is calculated to write off the assets to their estimated 
residual values over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis. The rates of annual depreciation on tangible 
fixed assets are as follows:
Leasehold land and buildings period of lease
Equipment   3–20 years
The carrying value of fixed assets is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying 
value may not be recoverable.
investments
Fixed assets investments are stated at cost less provision for impairment.
Pensions
A number of employees are members of defined contribution pension schemes. Contributions are charged to profit and 
loss as they become payable in accordance with the rules of the scheme. Differences between contributions payable 
and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet. The assets of these 
schemes are held separately from those of the Company.
Certain current and former employees of the Company are members of one of the Group’s defined benefit pension 
schemes, further details of which are given in note 28 of the Group Financial Statements. The schemes are all multi-
employer defined benefit schemes, the assets and liabilities of which are held independently from the Group. The 
Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme and accordingly accounts 
for the scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme.
t axation
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) 
using the tax rates and the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance 
sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in future or a right to pay less tax in 
future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
This is subject to deferred taxation assets only being recognised if it is considered more likely than not that there will be 
suitable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted. Timing differences 
are differences arising between the Company’s taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements and 
which are capable of reversal in one or more subsequent periods.
Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of the future remittance of retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries and 
associates only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable.
Deferred taxation is measured on a non-discounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in 
which timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction or at the contracted rate 
if the transaction is covered by a forward foreign currency contract. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in 
foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date or if appropriate at the 
forward contract rate. All differences are taken to the profit and loss account.

38. s ignificant accounting policies continued
t reasury shares
The Company has adopted UITF Abstract 38, ‘Accounting for ESOP Trusts’, which requires the assets and liabilities 
associated with the Company’s investment in its own shares to be recognised in the Company’s financial statements 
where there is de facto control of the assets and liabilities.
The Company’s own shares held by a Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust (‘QUEST’) remain deducted from 
shareholders’ funds until they vest unconditionally with employees.
employee share schemes
Executive Directors and Chief Operating Officers of the Company receive part of their remuneration in the form of 
share awards which vest upon meeting performance criteria over a three-year period.
The cost of such awards is measured by reference to the fair value of the shares at the date of the award. At the end of 
each financial reporting period an estimate is made of the extent to which those performance criteria will be met at the 
end of three years and an appropriate charge recorded in the profit and loss account together with a corresponding 
credit to profit and loss reserves. Changes in estimates of the number of shares vesting may result in charges or credits 
to the profit and loss account in subsequent periods.
s hare-based payments
The Company has implemented the generally accepted accounting principle for accounting for share-based payments 
with its subsidiary undertaking under UITF 44, whereby the Company has granted the rights of its shares to the 
employees of its subsidiary undertaking under an equity-settled arrangement and the subsidiaries have not reimbursed 
to the Company for these rights. Under this arrangement, the Company treats the share-based payment recognised in 
the subsidiary’s accounts as a cost of investment in the subsidiary and credits equity with an amount equal to the 
share-based payment recognised by these subsidiaries in their accounts.
derivative financial instruments and hedging
The Company’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and 
interest rates.
The Company uses interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk. The Company also uses forward foreign currency 
contracts (implemented through a medium-term US Dollar cross currency borrowing and related interest rate swap) to 
hedge exposure to translation risk associated with US Dollar net assets of subsidiary entities. Forward foreign currency 
contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting in the Parent Company Financial Statements, as the hedged item is not 
in its balance sheet.
The use of financial derivative instruments is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the Board of Directors, 
which provides written principles on the use on financial derivatives. Information about the Group’s financial risks, the 
management thereof, and the use of financial instruments and their impact on the Group’s risk, profile, performance, 
and financial condition is included in the notes to the Group Financial Statements.
The fair value of the US Dollar and interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Company would receive or pay 
to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the current 
creditworthiness of the swap counterparties.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is their quoted market price at the balance sheet date, being the present 
value of the quoted forward price.
c ash flow hedges
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or 
liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial 
instrument is recognised directly in the hedging reserve. Any ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised immediately 
in the profit and loss account.
Where a hedge of a forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a financial asset or a financial 
liability, the associated gains and losses that were recognised directly in equity are reclassified into profit or loss in the 
same period or periods during which the asset acquired or liability assumed affects profit or loss, i.e. when interest 
income or expense is recognised.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the Company revokes designation of the 
hedge relationship but the hedged forecast transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that 
point remains in equity and is recognised in accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs. If the 
hedged transaction is no longer expected to take place, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in equity is 
recognised in the profit and loss account immediately.

When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the Company revokes designation of the 
hedge relationship, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity until such point as the investment to 
which it relates is disposed.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when 
their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at 
fair value with unrealised gains and losses reported in the profit and loss account.
debt
Debt is initially stated at the amount of the net proceeds after the deduction of issue costs. The carrying amount is 
increased by the finance cost in respect of the accounting period and reduced by payments made in the period.
Finance costs
Finance costs of debt are charged to the profit and loss account over the term of the debt at a constant rate on the 
carrying value of the debt to which they relate.

The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the period was 1,450p. In 
the year to 30 June 2013, options were granted on 7 September 2012. The aggregate of the fair values of those options 
granted was £611,000.
The fair value of services received in return for share options granted is based on the fair value of share options 
granted, measured using a binomial model, with the following inputs:
a ssumptions applied in valuation models at grant date
2013 2012
Exercise price of options granted in the year (nil for awards) 1,344p 978p
Expected volatility (weighted average volatility) 31% 30%
Option life (expected weighted average life) 6.5 years 6.5 years
Expected dividends 1.34% 1.46%
Risk-free interest rate (based on government bonds) 0.95% 1.7%
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the estimated fair value of the Company’s 
share price over the previous three years. The option life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s 
best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
s hare awards
In addition to the outstanding share options above, there are a total of 622,529 conditional share awards which are 
outstanding at 30 June 2013. These conditional shares were awarded to Executive Directors and senior management on 
3 March 2009, 15 September 2009, 10 September 2010, 9 September 2011, 7 December 2012 and 28 February 2013 under 
the 2004 Performance Share Plan. In accordance with the terms of the plan, participants in the plan have received a 
conditional annual award of shares or nil cost option award which will vest mainly after three years, with the proportion 
of the award vesting being based on growth in Group adjusted earnings per share. Further details of the performance 
conditions attributing to the 2004 Performance Share Plan are given in the Directors’ Remuneration Report.
In the year to 30 June 2013, awards were granted on 7 December 2012 and 28 February 2013. The aggregate of the fair 
values of those awards granted was £4,581,000. The fair value of services received in return for share awards granted is 
based on the fair value of share awards granted, measured using a Black-Scholes valuation model.

Notice of Annual General Meeting continued Genus plc Annual Report 2013 | 137
NOTES:
This notice is being sent to all members and to any person nominated by a member of the Company under section 146 of 
the Companies Act 2006 (the ‘Act’) to enjoy information rights. Information regarding the Annual General Meeting, including 
the information required by section 311A of the Act, is available from www.genusplc.com.
Members will find an attendance card and a form of proxy enclosed with this notice. If you are attending the Annual  
General Meeting, you should bring the attendance card with you. Only holders of Ordinary Shares, or their duly appointed 
representatives, are entitled to attend, vote and speak at the Annual General Meeting. Any member so entitled may appoint 
one or more proxies to attend, speak and to vote instead of him. A proxy need not be a member of the Company but must 
attend the Annual General Meeting to represent you. Details of how to appoint one or more proxies are set out in the notes to 
the proxy form. A member may appoint more than one proxy provided each proxy is appointed to exercise rights attached to 
different shares. You may not appoint more than one proxy to exercise rights attached to any one share. A vote withheld is 
not a vote in law, which means that the vote will not be counted in the calculation of votes for or against the resolution. If no 
voting indication is given, your proxy will vote or abstain from voting at his or her discretion. Your proxy will vote (or abstain 
from voting) as he or she thinks fit in relation to any other matter which is put before the Annual General Meeting.
To be valid, a duly executed form of proxy for use at the Annual General Meeting together, if appropriate, with the power of 
attorney or other authority (if any) under which it is signed or a duly certified copy of such power or authority must be 
deposited at the offices of Equiniti Registrars, Freepost SEA10846, Equiniti Limited, Aspect House, Spencer Road, Lancing, 
West Sussex BN99 6ZL at least 48 hours (excluding non-working days) before the time appointed for holding the Annual 
General Meeting or any adjournment thereof. Alternatively, proxies may be appointed by having an appropriate CREST 
message transmitted, if you are a user of the CREST system (further details are below). In the case of a member which is a 
company, the proxy form must be executed under its common seal or signed on its behalf by an officer of the company or 
an attorney for the company.
Completion and return of a form of proxy will not preclude shareholders from attending the Annual General Meeting and 
voting in person if they wish to do so.
The right to appoint a proxy does not apply to persons whose shares are held on their behalf by another person and who 
have been nominated to receive communications from the Company in accordance with section 146 of the Act (‘nominated 
persons’). Nominated persons may have a right under an agreement with the registered member who hold shares on their 
behalf to be appointed (or to have someone else appointed) as a proxy. Alternatively, if nominated persons do not have such 
a right, or do not wish to exercise it, they may have a right under such an agreement to give instructions to the person 
holding the shares as to the exercise of voting rights.
Pursuant to Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001, the time by which a person must be entered on 
the register of members of the Company in order to have the right to attend and vote at the Annual General Meeting is 
6.00pm on 13 November 2013 (or if the Annual General Meeting is adjourned, members on the register of members not 
later than 6.00pm on the day that is two working days prior to the reconvened Annual General Meeting). Changes to entries 
on the register of members after the relevant time will be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend or 
vote at the Annual General Meeting.
Copies of contracts of service and letters of appointment between the directors and the Company will be available for inspection 
at the Registered Office of the Company during normal business hours until the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting, and 
at the place of the Annual General Meeting for at least 15 minutes prior to the Annual General Meeting until its conclusion.
CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do 
so for this Annual General Meeting to be held on 15 November 2013 at 11.00am and any adjournment(s) thereof by using 
the procedures described in the CREST Manual found on the Euroclear website www.euroclear.com. CREST Personal 
Members or other CREST sponsored members, and those CREST members who have appointed a voting service 
provider(s), should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s), who will be able to take the appropriate action 
on their behalf. In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST service to be valid, the appropriate 
CREST message (a ‘CREST Proxy Instruction’) must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK and Ireland 
Limited’s specifications and must contain the information required for such instructions, as described in the CREST Manual. 
The message, regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or to an amendment to the instruction given 
to a previously appointed proxy must, in order to be valid, be transmitted so as to be received by the issuer’s agent (ID  138 | Genus plc Annual Report 2013
RA19) by the latest time(s) for receipt of proxy appointments specified in the notice of Annual General Meeting. For this 
purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the 
CREST Applications Host) from which the issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner 
prescribed by CREST. After this time any change of instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should be 
communicated to the appointee through other means.
CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers should note that Euroclear UK 
and Ireland Limited do not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system 
timings and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the 
CREST member concerned to take (or, if the CREST member is a CREST personal member or sponsored member or has 
appointed a voting service provider(s), to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action 
as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this 
connection, CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers are referred, in 
particular, to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings.
The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5) (a) of the 
Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001, as amended.
Any corporation which is a member can appoint one or more corporate representatives who may exercise on its behalf all of 
its powers as a member provided that they do not do so in relation to the same shares.
As at 30 June 2013 the Company’s issued share capital comprised 60,648,563 ordinary shares of 10 pence each. Each 
ordinary share carries the right to one vote at a general meeting of the Company and, therefore, the total number of voting 
rights in the Company as at 30 June 2013 is 60,648,563. The Company’s website, referred to above, will include information 
on the number of shares and voting rights.
Under section 319A of the Act, the Company must answer any question a member asks relating to the business being dealt 
with at the Annual General Meeting unless answering the question would interfere unduly with the preparation for the 
Annual General Meeting or involve the disclosure of confidential information; the answer has already been given on a 
website in the form of an answer to a question; or it is undesirable in the interests of the Company or the good order of the 
Annual General Meeting that the question be answered.
Under section 527 of the Act, members meeting the threshold requirements set out in that section have the right to require 
the Company to publish on a website a statement setting out any matter relating to: (i) the audit of the Company’s accounts 
(including the auditor’s report and the conduct of the audit) that are to be laid before the Annual General Meeting; or (ii) any 
circumstances connected with an auditor of the Company ceasing to hold office since the previous meeting at which annual 
accounts and reports were laid in accordance with section 437 of the Act. The Company may not require the members 
requesting any such website publication to pay its expenses in complying with sections 527 or 528 of the Act. Where the 
Company is required to place a statement on a website under section 527 of the Act, it must forward the statement to the 
Company’s auditor not later than the time when it makes the statement available on the website. The business which may 
be dealt with at the Annual General Meeting includes any statement that the Company has been required under section 527 
of the Act to publish on a website.
In order for the voting preferences of all shareholders including those who cannot attend the meeting but who validly 
appoint a proxy, to be taken into account, a poll will be conducted on all resolutions at the Annual General Meeting this year. 
Each shareholder and proxy present at the Meeting will be invited to complete a poll card indicating how they wish to cast 
their votes in respect of each resolution. The results of the voting will be posted on the Company’s website after the 
meeting. Except as provided above, members who have general queries about the Annual General Meeting should call 
Equiniti registrars on 0871 384 2290. Calls to this number cost 8p per minute plus network extras. Lines open 8.30am to 
5.30pm, Monday to Friday. If calling from overseas, please call the Equiniti overseas helpline number of +44 121 415 7047. 
No other methods of communication will be accepted. You may not use any electronic address provided either in this notice 
of Annual General Meeting, or any related documents (including the proxy form) to communicate with the Company for any 
purposes other than those expressly stated.

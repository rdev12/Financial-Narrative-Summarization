performance following the excellent profits generated in
2006. Underlying profit before tax* increased 64% and
earnings per share increased 56% to £53.2 million 
(2006: £32.5 million) and 112p (2006: 72p) respectively. Profit
before tax and earnings per share on continuing operations
increased by 57% and 50% respectively. The Board is
recommending a final dividend of 17 .8p, giving a total for the
year of 25.0p, an increase of 56% over last year .
Both our operating divisions, Countermeasures and
Energetics, performed strongly and achieved record years. 
The Group maintained its position as the world’s leading
manufacturer of countermeasure decoys, with over 50%
market share, including a commanding presence in the vital
US market. Our competitors, inevitably, challenge us at
every opportunity but our recognition of their activities, the
strength of our research and development and new
products, and our investment in the latest manufacturing
technologies continues to strengthen our order book for
future years.  
Our Energetics activities expanded rapidly through a
combination of organic and acquisitive growth. This division
now manufactures a broad portfolio of explosive and
pyrotechnic ordnance, with twelve factories in seven
countries. It has also become a vital supplier to the major
prime contractors in a widely fragmented industry, whilst
becoming a prime contractor in its own right. During the
year the Group completed the acquisitions of 
Simmel Difesa in Italy, Dyno Nobel’s High Energy Materials
business in Norway (now trading as Chemring Nobel), and
the remaining 49% shareholding in Pirotécnia Oroquieta in
Spain. The total value of these acquisitions was £57 million,
of which £50.2 million was satisfied in cash and 
£6.8 million by the issue of new shares in the Company.
Since the year end, the Group has acquired Richmond
Electronics & Engineering Limited in the UK for £11 million.
The acquisition was funded utilising existing bank facilities.  
BALANCE SHEET AND CASH FLOW
Our operating companies continued to deliver a very strong
cash flow of £60.6 million (2006: £45.6 million), which has
enabled us to fund the majority of acquisitions for debt,
whilst maintaining a debt/equity ratio of 80% (2006: 75%)
and interest cover on underlying operating profit* of 
8 times (2006: 6 times).
The Board has been cognisant for some time of the
continuing development of our activities in the US, and the
probability that the US would be a major source of both our
organic and acquisitive growth in the future. Accordingly, in
November 2007 the Company completed a $150 million
private placement in the US of ten year fixed interest loan
notes, with an interest rate of approximately 6.30%.
COUNTERMEASURES
During the year , Alloy Surfaces completed the
commissioning of its third plant in the US. In the UK,
Chemring Countermeasures, which has enjoyed
considerable success with its new spectral flares and is the
sole source supplier of countermeasure flares for the
Typhoon, has commissioned a major new production plant
at its base in Salisbury. 
Kilgore’s performance during the year was affected by
composition difficulties in two products - not an unknown
problem in our industry, and delays on product lot
acceptances due to external factors in the final month of
the year which affected revenue recognition. However ,
Kilgore has significantly increased its order book,
particularly as it is the supplier of flares for the new Raptor
and Joint Strike Fighter . This business is expected to have
the greatest growth in the Countermeasures division over
the next five years.
CHEMRING GROUP PLC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2007  3
Statement 
by the Chairman ENERGETICS
At the half year , I stated that the Energetics division faced
challenges in developing an effective organisational
structure, rationalising production plants and strengthening
its international sales capability. These objectives are
ongoing. With regards to the organisational structure, the
management has concentrated on finding appropriately
qualified personnel, both at divisional level and in the
individual subsidiaries, to promote our substantial product
offering. The benefits of these appointments will start to
come through in 2008. I am delighted to say that the
production rationalisation programme is also progressing
very well. 
Our strategy to grow this division is proving successful,
with revenue for the year now exceeding that of the
Countermeasures division. 
GROUP STRATEGY
Our Group strategy remains unchanged. We will continue to
concentrate on our two divisions - Countermeasures, where
we are the world leader , and Energetics, where, in a sector
with many fragmented businesses, we are becoming a
major force. It is possible that, as this latter division
expands, one of the individual product categories within it
might justify its establishment as a separate third division.
Our intentions are to continue to grow organically and,
where possible, by acquisition. We are committed to
expansion in both divisions, and are currently planning to
establish additional manufacturing facilities in certain chosen
countries, including India and the Far East. I expect this latter
development to take three to five years to achieve.
HEALTH AND SAFETY
As previously reported, an explosion occurred at our 
Simmel Difesa site in Italy on 9 October 2007 . Very
regrettably, this resulted in one fatality and injuries to several
other employees. The Board is committed to ensuring that
incidents such as this do not recur in the future, and the
provision of a safe working environment for all our employees
remains a critical feature of the Group’s development. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND
OTHER NON-EXECUTIVE
APPOINTMENTS
There have been no changes to the composition of the
Board since I last reported. I believe its current membership
is appropriate for the size of the Group and the skills
required for proper corporate governance. As we continue
to grow, the directors will reflect on future requirements.
A number of our overseas subsidiaries are, of course,
supported by non-executive directors appointed specifically
for their contributions in individual countries. In the US, for
example, our Group has the support of five prominent US
citizens, three of whom are retired Generals or Admirals
who contribute fully to the success of the US operations.
The same philosophy is currently adopted in Australia, and
is planned for Italy.
PENSIONS
In previous reports I have stated my confidence that we
would address future funding requirements for the Group’s
UK defined benefit pension plans without any material
change to the financial contributions currently made by the
Group, as we believe that the existing funds are adequate to
meet their obligations. I am happy to report that the 2006
valuation for the Executive Pension Scheme has been
successfully completed and submitted to the Pension
Regulator . We hope to conclude our discussions with the
trustees of the Staff Pension Scheme in the next few weeks.
The Group introduced a new defined contribution scheme
for UK employees during the year , and take-up of
membership has been very encouraging to date. 
4 CHEMRING GROUP PLC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2007
Statement by the Chairman
(CONTINUED) DIVIDENDS
The Board is recommending a final dividend of 17 .8p per
ordinary share, a 59% increase on the final dividend for
2006. This, together with the interim dividend of 7 .2p paid
in July 2007 , gives a total dividend for the year of 25.0p, a
56% increase over 2006. The dividend is over four times
covered on net profits of the continuing operations. The
shares will be marked “ex dividend” on 26 March 2008 and
the dividend is payable on 18 April 2008 to shareholders on
the register at the close of business on 28 March 2008.  
PROSPECTS
The Board remains committed to delivering total
shareholder value, through the generation of strong after
tax profits and a progressive dividend policy. Our strategy
has already proved very successful, with over 50%
earnings and dividend growth in both of the last two years.
The Board believes it can continue with this strategy and
produce further above average growth. Next year we
expect to see continuing growth in our Countermeasures
business, and the ongoing development of Energetics, as
this division starts to realise its full potential. We believe
the Group is ideally placed to participate in the
consolidation of this fragmented energetics industry.
Inevitably, questions are often raised concerning the
longevity of both the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts.
Adjustments in procurement will eventually take place but
our healthy order book and knowledge of military
requirements gives us confidence in our long term future.
We look forward to the 2008 financial year and are
confident that it will be another year of strong
performance.

CHEMRING GROUP PLC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2007  5 GROUP RESULTS
The Group performed strongly throughout the year and
revenue from continuing operations increased 36% to
£254.7 million. 16% of this growth was achieved from our
existing businesses, 9% from the full year trading of
acquisitions made in 2006 and 11% from the two
acquisitions completed in 2007 . The Countermeasures
division increased its sales to record levels, in spite of a
frustrating performance from Kilgore and the adverse
impact of the continuing weakness of the dollar . The
Energetics division had another excellent year , achieving an
85% increase in revenue, and for the first time generating
revenue in excess of the Countermeasures division.  
Underlying operating margins* for the Group continued to
improve and by the year end reached 24%. Enhanced
automation, process improvements and the rationalisation
of both products and manufacturing locations, particularly
within the Energetics division, continued to improve our
performance. Consequently, underlying operating profit*
rose strongly by 59% to £61.2 million. 
The operating cash inflow during the year was excellent at
£60.6 million, equivalent to a cash conversion rate from
underlying operating profit* of 99%. Capital expenditure
increased 43% to £14.6 million as the Group continued to
invest significantly in improved automation and additional
manufacturing facilities. Investment in company funded
research and development (R&D) also increased 69% to
£5.4 million but still represented only 2.1% of Group
revenue. This will be augmented in 2008 by a new five year
research partnership with the Defence Academy and
Cranfield University, which will focus on our longer term
technology and product requirements.
At the year end, the Group had an excellent order book of
£297 million, some 39% higher than the previous year . This
record level of order cover continues to underpin the
prospects for 2008. I am also delighted to report that the
order book for the Energetics division was £177 .8 million,
111% higher than the previous year , creating a solid
foundation for continued strong growth in the future.
HEALTH AND SAFETY
On 9 October 2007 , an explosion occurred when a white
light composition ignited whilst being mixed in a remote
operation in a manufacturing building at the Simmel Difesa
site in Colleferro, Italy. The product which was being made
is used for the illumination of battlefields, and had been
manufactured in the facility for more than ten years
without incident. Tragically, there was one fatality, two 
non-life threatening injuries and nine people were taken to
hospital suffering from shock and distress. A detailed
investigation into the incident has been undertaken in full
co-operation with the authorities, and we await the final
conclusions from the authorities before access to the
affected building is granted.

Revenue by destination (2007) As referred to last year , the Group is committed to
achieving the highest levels of safety in both its products
and its manufacturing facilities. Significant investment in
automated manufacturing with remote operation continues,
in line with our commitment to reduce operator risk, and all
levels of management have been tasked with continuously
improving our levels of safety.  The Board remains focused
on reducing the risks to as low a level as reasonably
practicable, and will continue to invest in improved
processes and the new capital facilities that can achieve
this.  
COUNTERMEASURES
■ Orders: £123.0 million
■ Revenue: £126.5 million
■ Operating profit: £38.6 million
■ Operating margin: 30%
The global expendable countermeasures market continued
to grow in 2007 and is now estimated at £237 million, an
increase over the previous year of just over 10%, in spite of
the adverse impact of the dollar depreciation against sterling
of approximately 10%. Revenue from our Countermeasures
division, however , grew by only 7% year-on-year , reflecting
the slightly lower than expected sales volumes achieved by
Kilgore in the second half of the year . The record demand for
our decoys continues to be driven principally by the threat
from shoulder-launched missiles to the helicopters and
transport aircraft used by the US, UK and other coalition
forces in Iraq and Afghanistan.  
Chemring Countermeasures, our UK business, had another
excellent year , generating £31.1 million of revenue, which
was 40% higher than the previous year . This growth was
driven by the successful qualification and production of our
new spectral flare for use by the UK and coalition partners.
Construction and qualification of a new special purpose
facility was achieved over a five month period, and full
production output of in excess of 20,000 spectral flares per
month was consistently delivered throughout the second
half of the year - a tremendous achievement. During the
year , further spectral flare variants were developed and
flight-tested for combat and transport aircraft applications.
We expect production of a number of these new flares to
begin shortly.
Production of conventional flare types also reached record
levels. The first batches of flares for Typhoon were
delivered to all of the participating nations and a number of
significant export contracts are expected shortly. We also
continued to deliver chaff and flares to India as part of a
multi-year contract for protecting the Indian Air Force
Mirage 2000 aircraft. This contract follows on from our
previous programme to supply the Indian Air Force with
flares for its Mig-29 combat aircraft.
During the year , there was increased interest shown in
naval countermeasures, particularly from NATO countries
looking to operate in littoral waters. Chaff rounds were
delivered to Spain and Australia, and advanced CHIMERA
rounds were supplied to Norway.  Furthermore, four new
contracts for Spain, Norway, Romania and Chile were won
against fierce competition. These successes have
broadened our customer base and reflect our increasing
market position for 130mm naval munitions.
Alloy Surfaces also had an excellent year , generating record
levels of production and $132.1 million of revenue, which
was over 14% higher than in the previous year . Production
of the M211 decoy for the US Army continued at a high rate
and over 800,000 units were delivered to schedule
throughout the year . Alloy Surfaces also secured a 
CHEMRING GROUP PLC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2007  7 $20 million contract from the UK Ministry of Defence for
the supply of BOL/IR special material decoys for use on
Harrier and Tornado aircraft, with a further $20 million
option to cover any surge requirement. Negotiations with
the US Air Force, US Navy and US Army on multi-year
contracts, covering seven of the eight most important
special material decoys, have all started. The US Navy
awarded an initial two year contract for the supply of 
MJU-49 decoys and has continued discussions to create a
five year contract for all of its major products. The 
US Air Force and US Army negotiations for five year
contracts have progressed but have been delayed by the
protracted discussions on budgets that have taken place
between the Department of Defense and Congress. These
new contracts are all expected to be finalised during 2008.
Kilgore had a rather frustrating year , even though it
generated a record level of revenue at $67 .4 million. This
was 1% higher than last year but about $15 million lower
than expected.
Revenue growth was impacted as a result of two factors:
Kilgore’s high volume conventional flare programs
encountered several minor manufacturing problems that
took time to resolve, and the production of three new
products encountered a number of technical problems
associated with the start of volume manufacturing,
including the lack of timely availability of test aircraft to
complete the flight qualification.
In spite of these set backs Kilgore managed to capture a
record $98 million of orders, of which $72 million related to
its countermeasures business and $26 million to its
energetics business. This resulted in a year end order book
of $99 million, 44% higher than in 2006. This will provide a
solid foundation for improvement in 2008. Kilgore was also
hugely successful in securing, against fierce competition, a
contract from the US Navy, for the manufacture of 100% of
the advanced flares for the F-18 aircraft. A review of the
design and technical data has now been completed and first
article testing is scheduled during the first half of 2008.
Kilgore also successfully completed the first article test
activities on the flares for the F-22 aircraft, as a direct
contractor to the US Air Force. The first production
deliveries have commenced on schedule, and construction
of a high volume production facility is well underway, which
should be completed by the end of the first half of 2008. A
contract worth $12 million for the second year of
production was awarded in September 2007 .  
ENERGETICS
■ Orders: £172.0 million
■ Revenue: £128.2 million
■ Operating profit: £27 .9 million 
■ Operating margin: 22% 
During the year , the operational management of 
PW Defence in the UK, Comet in Germany and 
Pirotécnia Oroquieta in Spain was combined to create a
pan-European pyrotechnic business, Chemring Defence,
with a coherent sales network and new 
centres-of-excellence for manufacturing that are delivering
benefits of scale on distinct families of products.  
Chemring Defence UK had an excellent year , with record
levels of production and revenue of £23.9 million, almost
100% higher than in 2006. Strong export growth was
achieved in the Middle East with sales to Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar . The successful management of
our first prime contract was a notable milestone during the
year and has resulted in the placement of follow-on
contracts. A major success was also achieved in the US
towards the end of the year , when a five year IDIQ
(indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity) contract, worth up
to $78 million, was placed by the US Army for 66mm 
non-lethal Vehicle-launched Discharge Grenades.
Chemring Defence Germany (formerly Comet) secured
major contracts for both its ordnance-clearance and
battlefield training products. The UK, Australia and several
Eastern European countries all placed contracts for
substantial numbers of the PEMBS ordnance-clearance
system, which has now established itself as the leading
portable ordnance-clearance system in the world. Our
MECS (multiple effect cartridge system) battlefield
simulation ammunition is now in-service with the US, UK,
and a number of other countries. Our performance under
the US Army contract is delighting the customer and
deliveries are now running at about 700,000 units per year .
Furthermore, the US Army has ordered 1,400 more
launchers to increase training, and has recently qualified
black and yellow smoke variants to broaden their weapon
effects options. We have also recently completed
development of an IED-simulator kit and a number of
systems have been bought by the US Army for qualification
purposes. This simulator is intended to be used at squad,
platoon and company level for realistic training in urban
operations, such as check point and convoy training.
The operational management of Nobel Energetics and
Leafield Engineering were also combined during the year to
8 CHEMRING GROUP PLC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2007
Review by the Chief Executive 
(CONTINUED) form a new business, Chemring Energetics, which becomes
the UK centre-of-excellence for demolition stores, ceremonial
ammunition, detonators, actuators and pyro-mechanisms.
The new business generated record revenue of £22.7 million,
22% higher than in 2006. Sales of metron actuators
increased 36% and sales of demolition stores 35%, whilst
sales of NLAW flight and launch motors increased 65% as
full production was finally started. A rocket motor grain for
70mm air-launched rockets was also developed and is
expected to complete qualification by April 2008. 
Technical Ordnance also performed well in the first full year
of ownership, with record revenue of $45.6 million,
compared with the $34 million generated in the twelve
months prior to acquisition. Good progress was made in the
development of strategic partnering with the three US
ammunition prime contractors, ATK, General Dynamics and
L3. ATK, in particular , has significantly increased the
volume of explosive pellet and fuze components ordered
from Technical Ordnance. During the year , Technical
Ordnance was awarded production contracts, from two
prime contractors, for the supply of M55 detonators for use
in 40mm rifle-launched grenades used by the US Army.
Three new production stations are currently being qualified
and are expected to achieve 900,000 units per month by
the end of April 2008.
Kilgore increased its sales of pyrotechnics and munitions by
68% compared with 2006.  During the year , Kilgore
successfully completed factory acceptance test activities on
the MK4 practice bomb cartridge, and produced and
delivered over 450,000 units. Kilgore was also awarded a 
$30 million, five year IDIQ contract for both the MK58 and
the MK25 marine location markers directly from the US Navy.
BDL Systems also had a good year , completing its fourth
contract to supply a Far Eastern customer with equipment
and facilities for handling unexploded ordnance and
roadside bombs. BDL Systems also completed development
of its next generation initiation system (BREACH), which is
primarily designed for the “explosive means-of-entry”
market and makes use of the latest securely coded data
transmission techniques. The system has attracted great
interest in the US and NATO countries, and is expected to
generate significant sales over the next few years.
Chemring Marine completed the consolidation of the
manufacturing of marine distress signals in Germany during
2007 . The increased volumes and the use of automated
manufacturing has significantly improved efficiency and
substantially improved the profitability of the business.
During the year , two major worldwide agreements were
signed with the major liferaft suppliers, Viking and 
RFD Beaufort, for the supply of our commercial distress signals. 
In March, we announced the acquisition of Simmel Difesa,
based in Colleferro, Italy.  Simmel Difesa is a key supplier of
energetics sub-systems, such as fuzes, safety and arming
systems, warheads and modular charge systems, for major
ammunition prime contractors around the world. The
company is also a specialist manufacturer of medium and
large calibre ammunition, rockets and illumination mortar
rounds for a substantial number of NATO and non-NATO
armed forces. It also has a second site in Anagni, Italy,
where it has a specialist facility for the disposal of
ordnance at the end of its operational life.
In spite of the accident in October , Simmel Difesa achieved
all of its 2007 objectives and delivered all of the 81mm
white light and black light illuminating mortar rounds
CHEMRING GROUP PLC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2007  9 required for use in Afghanistan. Production of the
illumination canister will restart by the end of 
February 2008. A new multi-year contract for the continued
supply of both types of illuminating ammunition is currently
under negotiation. Simmel Difesa has also recently secured
a major contract, worth d26 million, to supply high
explosive anti-tank ammunition to a NATO country.
FUTURE PROSPECTS
Countermeasures
The market outlook for our expendable countermeasures
business continues to be positive.  Over the next three years,
we believe that the global market is likely to expand at just
over 20% per annum, driven by the continued demand from
the US Army and the US Air Force’s requirements for the
protection of helicopters, transport aircraft and advanced
flares for air-superiority combat aircraft. 
In Iraq, the US “surge” operation appears to have enhanced
security and allowed the Iraqi army to take over the
majority of peacekeeping activities. The US Department of
Defense has indicated that significant combat troop
withdrawals may take place towards the end of 2008.
However , the US still expects to support the Iraqi army with
helicopters and transport aircraft for the movement of
troops across the country, and to provide rapid reaction
combat troops to support the Iraqis when required.
In Afghanistan, the number of NATO troops increased to
43,000 during the last six months, and are reported to be
conducting extensive operations against the insurgents
across the south of the country at the border with Pakistan.
NATO commanders are also expected to bolster the force
with additional troops currently allocated to Iraq. Both the

Exports UK Ministry of Defence and the US Department of Defense
continue to stress the long term nature of these operations
in Afghanistan.  
Current UN operations, excluding Iraq and Afghanistan,
now involve more than 140,000 troops. The deployment of
helicopters and transport aircraft to support these
operations will be needed to provide greater operational
flexibility and effectiveness.  Demand for decoys is,
therefore, expected to continue.
A number of important aircraft will enter service over the
next ten years. In Europe, the introduction of Typhoon will
have a major impact on demand for decoys, particularly for
advanced technologies against sophisticated surface-to-air
or air-to-air threats. However , the biggest growth is
expected to be in the US market where procurement of
advanced flares for all its major combat aircraft, namely
the F-18, F-22 and the F-35, is planned. The Group is the
lead contractor for the manufacture of flares for all of
these platforms and is, therefore, extremely well placed to
exploit these opportunities as the requirements grow.
Energetics – Pyrotechnics and explosive
ordnance disposal (EOD)
The global market for pyrotechnics and EOD is estimated to
be approximately £3 billion per annum. In 2007 , the Group’s
revenue in this sector was £7 4.8 million, which represents a
2.5% market share. The market remains fragmented with a
large number of small players, many of whom are nationally
focused and with limited product ranges. There are,
therefore, many opportunities for growth.
In battlefield training, the Group is building on its strong
position with the MECS technology and is developing a low
weight, modular battlefield effects simulator which is
adaptable to combat vehicles for force-on-force training, as
well as for simulating hits in force-on-target live fire
training.  Saab Training Systems have adopted the
technology as standard and we are in discussion with the
US Army on qualification for the US market.
The development of new initiator technology will also help
BDL Systems to penetrate both the US and NATO EOD
markets. BDL Systems is currently completing development
of a new timer answer back system (TABS) that provides
long-range two-way radio-frequency initiation with remote
programmable time delay and reliable sterilisation
capabilities. TABS and BREACH are expected to have a
major impact on the global market over the next few years.
In November 2007 , we announced the acquisition of
Richmond Electronics & Engineering Limited. Richmond,
which is based in the UK, is a supplier of EOD equipment
which complements that provided by BDL Systems. It
produces disrupters which fire a water jet or projectile into
the firing circuit of an explosive device to neutralise it
without detonation. Its patented recoilless disrupters and
its proprietary laser-aimed weapons carriers are fitted to
most of the leading US and UK bomb disposal robots.
CHEMRING GROUP PLC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2007  11 Energetics – Munitions
The global market for munitions is approximately 
£10 billion per annum. In 2007 , the Group’s revenue in this
segment was £53.4 million, representing only 0.5%.
However , our acquisition of Simmel Difesa significantly
enhances our position in the market, and we believe that
there are major opportunities for growth at both the prime
contract and component supplier level.
Simmel Difesa is a world leader in naval ammunition and is
currently well placed to expand its position in the 76mm
market over the next few years. Qualification of the
76/62mm naval round for the Franco-Italian FREMM
programme is scheduled for early 2008 and production is
expected to quickly follow. The Group is also working with
Oto Melara and Alliant Techsystems to introduce an
Insensitive Munition (IM) variant into the US market.
Simmel Difesa expects to complete qualification of its
155mm modular charge system in the first half of 2008.
The Group expects there to be significant opportunities for
this technology and is exploring a number of strategic
partnerships to access key non-NATO markets.
Overall, the future outlook remains encouraging and many
opportunities exist for growth. The Group has a strong
order book, which today stands at a record level of 
£401 million, up 35% since the year end and up 63% since
January 2007 . The Board remains confident that the
prospects for the Group in 2008 continue to be excellent.

Group strategy
The Group strategy remains focused on our two core
sectors of operations - Countermeasures and Energetics.  
Countermeasures strategy
The core strategy for the Countermeasures business is to
maintain our market share and to exploit the continuing
market growth expected over the next five years. We intend
to increase our investment in new products and
technologies, and to build on our current leadership in
special material, spectral and kinematic flare technologies.
We will continue to invest in new fully automated
production facilities that will improve operator safety,
significantly enhance our operational efficiency, and
maintain our lead role in the development of new products
for the next generation of fixed wing and rotary aircraft.
Energetics strategy
We intend to expand our Energetics division, with new
acquisitions in both the US and Europe. We will become the
clear world leader in pyrotechnics by focused investment in
new products and by consolidation of the market through
carefully selected bolt-on acquisitions. We will build on our
expertise in explosive ordnance disposal and will become the
world leader in demolition stores, particularly targeting the
US market. We will also focus on becoming the preferred
supplier of energetic materials to the key prime contractors
in both the US and Europe for ammunition and missiles. This
will be achieved by investment in new products, by targeted
competition against single source suppliers and by further
acquisitions. We will also maintain our position as the world
leader in naval ammunition, and our focus as a prime
contractor in special niche markets that are complementary
to those of our principal customers. 
Our geographic strategy remains unchanged.  We intend to
manufacture in the US for the US market and in Europe for
the European market.  We will then use our excellent
worldwide sales network to export from both the US and
Europe. We will also develop our capabilities to bundle third
party products and offer a broader supply chain
management service to our export customers.

PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
As described on pages 43 and 44, the Board is responsible
for the Group’s systems of internal control and its risk
management systems. The Board has constituted a Risk
Management Committee, which meets quarterly, to review
the key risks associated with the achievement of the annual
budget and the five year plan for each business, and the
risk control procedures implemented. The Committee
reports biannually to the Board and, through this process,
the Board has identified the following principal risks
currently facing the Group. The Group mitigates its risk
exposure through an insurance programme that covers
property and liability risks, where it is appropriate and cost
effective to do so.

Energetics 172.0 95.1 177.8 84.2
Total 295.0 268.8 297.3 214.6 Health and safety risks 
The nature of the Group’s operations, involving energetic
materials, is such that the Board considers health and
safety to be a key area of focus in managing risk.
Accordingly, health and safety is included on the agenda at
every Board meeting and is also discussed at the monthly
Group Executive Committee meeting. The Board believes
that responsibility for the delivery of world class safety
standards is an integral part of the operational
management accountability, and managers are therefore
expected to embrace a positive safety culture and to
demonstrate leadership and commitment in the workplace.
All employees are encouraged to report potential hazards,
and to raise any health and safety concerns through the
appropriate channels.
Quarterly health and safety meetings are held in Europe
and the US, chaired by the Managing Director of the
Energetics division and the President of our US operations
respectively. These supplement the regular health and
safety meetings held at each operational site, which are
chaired by the President or Managing Director of the site. 
Our stated aim is to achieve zero injuries and to reduce
health and safety risks, where they cannot be eliminated
altogether , to a level which is “as low as reasonably
practicable”. All businesses are expected to proactively
manage their own risks but in addition, the top five site risks
at each business and their associated mitigation
programmes are reviewed on a monthly basis by the Group
Executive Committee. Technology and automation roadmaps
were developed during the year to support the Group’s
strategy for risk reduction through increased automation
and remote operations included within its five year plan.  
On 9 October 2007 , an explosion occurred at Simmel Difesa
in Colleferro, Italy, that tragically led to the death of one
employee and injuries to several others. Simmel Difesa has
worked very closely with the relevant authorities, its
workforce and the unions on the investigation into the
incident. Interim findings have been issued periodically, and
circulated to all other businesses in the Group who use
energetic materials to ensure a consistent approach to the
issues highlighted. A controlled, phased restart of production
in the undamaged areas of the Colleferro site is underway.    
Further details on the Group’s approach to health and
safety are set out below.
Introduction of new products
The Group’s innovative approach and continued research and
development activity ensure that we are continually adding
new products to the range. During the year , our position was
further strengthened in this area by the demand for our
countermeasures on a range of new platforms. 
In order to satisfy these requirements, we need to ensure
that new product development is completed in a timely
manner to a standard which allows us to undertake volume
manufacturing, and to produce products against high
reliability and safety criteria to meet our customers’
requirements. New manufacturing facilities have been
established in the year to accommodate the production of
these new products, and in other areas, there has been a
requirement to significantly increase capacity on our
existing production lines. This necessitates careful
management of contractors - where construction work is
being undertaken, suppliers - where new components have
to be qualified for use in our products, and employees -
where training in new skills is required. We continue to
introduce Six Sigma techniques as appropriate within the
organisation to improve our manufacturing capabilities.
This investment in new facilities is ongoing.
Competitors
The nature of the threat from missiles and other weapons
is continually changing, particularly as new platforms are
introduced in different countries, and countermeasures
solutions need to develop on an ongoing basis to meet the
enhanced requirements. The number of countermeasures
manufacturers is currently small but as technologies
change, existing manufacturers compete for new products
and new businesses can enter into the market. The Group is
currently the world leader in the supply and manufacture
of expendable countermeasures, with a number of
proprietary products, and we intend to maintain this
position through our continued investment in research and
development, and world class manufacturing facilities.           
Product design changes
Many of the Group’s products are required to be modified
and updated on a regular basis to meet our customers’
changing requirements. There is inevitably risk associated
with the implementation of product design changes, and
whilst a review of the design change and product
modification process in operation at each site was
undertaken last year , further process improvements
continue to be driven by the Group management.            
CHEMRING GROUP PLC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2007  21 Technology transfers 
The formation by the Group of centres-of-excellence for the
production of energetic materials has generated
considerable interest from major prime contractors in both
the US and Europe, who are looking for strategic partners.
Progressing the development of these relationships and
securing the transfer of technologies from these large
prime contractors is a key objective for the Group over the
next five years. Accordingly, the Group has been recruiting
new personnel to manage these activities, and reviewing
manufacturing capabilities and investing capital where
necessary, to ensure that we mitigate the risk associated
with the technology transfers and maximise the
opportunities that are presented.
Management of prime contracts
The Energetics division now has substantial prime
contracts with a number of countries, and is planning to
secure more. The contracts provide for the supply of an
extensive range of our own and third party products over
the next three years, and require a particular type of
programme management expertise. Dedicated programme
managers have been appointed, with a reporting chain
through to the Group Executive Committee, which
undertakes a regular high level review of programme status
and supply chain issues. We are also in the process of
appointing additional personnel with specialist knowledge
of the management of offset requirements and complex
export compliance issues for this growing area of business.
Political risks
It is anticipated that the nature of the military activities in
Iraq and Afghanistan may change over the next three to
five years. We do not believe that the Group’s
countermeasures business will be significantly impacted by
this, as our products will still be required to provide
defensive protection. Growth in the countermeasures
business will be delivered as our proprietary products are
fitted to a range of new platforms in the US and Europe.
Our energetics activities are less dependent on the current
military activity in Iraq and Afghanistan, particularly as our
product portfolio continues to grow in areas such as
training and explosive ordnance disposal.

maintaining the Group’s policies in this area, and the 
Chief Executive is accountable to the Board for ensuring
that the Group’s businesses adhere to these policies.     
BUSINESS CONDUCT
The Group has adopted a Code of Business Conduct, which
requires our employees and our businesses to comply with
applicable laws and regulations in all of the countries in
which we operate. The managing directors of each business
are required to report to the Chief Executive on compliance
with the Code of Business Conduct on an annual basis. 
Our US businesses are currently in the process of
implementing an ethical compliance programme to satisfy
new US Government requirements for ethical training for
employees, compliance audits, an employees’ “hotline”, and
related investigation procedures.
Arrangements exist by which all employees may, in
confidence, raise concerns about possible improprieties. 
POLICY ON THE SALE OF GOODS AND
SERVICES  
The Group’s strategy is to become the world leader in the
manufacture of energetic material products for the global
defence market, and we are presently delivering significant
growth in this area though a combination of organic
development and acquisitions. The scope of the Group’s
activities has significantly widened over the last few years,
particularly with regards to the supply of components and
sub-systems for various types of munitions, and there is
increasing demand for the supply to our customers of third
party products. Consequently, the Board introduced a
Policy on the Sale of Goods and Services during the year ,
which provides guidance to all stakeholders on the
products and services that the Group will supply and to
which customers, and sets out a clear definition of what we
will not supply.         
HEALTH AND SAFETY 
The Board recognises that the highest levels of safety are
required in order to protect our employees, whilst achieving
growth and maintaining leadership in the Group’s chosen
markets. The Board believes that all injuries are
preventable, and management systems and a long term
strategy have been adopted to ensure that we continually
improve our performance and reduce risk within the
constraints of what is reasonably achievable. 
The Board requires that all businesses systematically
manage their health, safety and environment hazards, set
objectives, monitor progress by regular measurement, audit
and review, and take additional action where necessary.
Each Managing Director is responsible for the management
of health, safety and environmental issues within their
business and for providing adequate resources to satisfy
the Board’s requirements. The Group management and
business heads have regular meetings to ensure that all
these objectives are being met. We also ensure that all sites
handling energetic materials are subjected to annual
audits. The audits of the US businesses were strengthened
in the year by the addition of OSHA “type” inspections and
process safety management audits.
We recognise that a key element in the continual
improvement of health, safety, and environmental
management is sharing best practice and lessons learnt
from incidents across all of the Group companies. A
common incident reporting and investigation procedure is
in place, as well as an alert system that formally ensures
key findings from incidents are quickly communicated to all
operational sites and actions taken as appropriate. All
accidents and near misses are investigated. An annual
Group HS&E Conference is attended by representatives
from all businesses.
In addition to the introduction of ISO14001, the
development of automated production and other plans to
address principal risk areas during the year , all operational
sites reported a number of improvements to health, safety
and environmental management and performance. In
particular:
■ Kilgore achieved more than 2.7 million hours worked
without a lost time accident
■ Technical Ordnance were given the “South Dakota
Governor’s Safety Meritorious Award”
■ Chemring Defence UK, Derby, and Chemring
Countermeasures, Salisbury, both halved their number
of lost time accidents compared to the previous year
The Board monitors health and safety performance
through the quarterly reporting of Key Performance
Indicators, which include lost time accidents, “near misses”
and action management. These were reviewed during the
CHEMRING GROUP PLC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2007  23
Corporate Responsibility Report year and have been expanded this year to include data on
employees placed on restricted duties due to work-related
injuries. In addition, the Chief Executive reports monthly to
the Board on all key health and safety issues.
During the year under review, the overall Group lost time
accident rate remained unchanged from last year at 0.76
per 100,000 hours. However , this figure includes the eleven
lost time accidents which occurred as a result of the
explosion at Simmel Difesa in October 2007 . The lost time
accident rate excluding this incident was 0.54 per 100,000
hours, a reduction of 29% compared to last year across the
rest of the Group, and a 44% reduction from 2005.
In October 2007 , in order to drive further improvements in
the management of health and safety within the Group, the
Board set the goal of generating an overarching corporate
framework and implementing a common safety culture
across the Group. A project team has been established with
the initial remit to review effectiveness and efficiency of
Group and divisional health and safety management
arrangements, and to review the current health and safety
culture. These reviews will result in a series of actions
aimed at the development of a common culture initially in
the UK, then Europe, and then in the US. 
We are aiming for all operational sites to achieve
certification to the OHSAS 18001 safety and health
management system by the end of 2008.
ENVIRONMENT 
The Board believes that environmental protection will help
to secure the long term future of our businesses. The
Group’s Health, Safety and Environment Policy states that
we will control pollution, minimise the quantity of material
burnt at each site, consume resources efficiently, and use
materials that minimise the environmental impact of our
operations where practicable. 
We are continually improving our waste management and
percentage of waste recycled. During the year , the Group
recycled approximately 83% of its general waste and 78%
of hazardous waste, compared to 76% of a combination of
both last year . All businesses are tasked with achieving
further improvements to their recycling proportion. 
The Board monitors environmental performance through
the quarterly reporting of Key Performance Indicators,
which include energy use, waste management and
recycling. For the current year , the Group will put in place
formal mechanisms for calculating CO
2
contributions from
direct and key indirect sources, such as international travel.
The table below provides an estimate of our direct CO
2
contributions from the usage of electricity and gas and the
burning of oil at our sites during the year under review.

Electricity 21,556

system ISO14001 by the end of 2007 . Seven of the ten
operational sites achieved this goal, and we are planning

EMPLOYEES
The Board recognises the valuable contribution that the
Group’s employees make to its success, and aims to provide
a working environment that reflects and rewards this.
During the year under review, the Group employed an
average of 2,592 employees in seven countries.     
The Group pursues a policy of employee communication
through meetings (including team briefings and works
councils) and in-house magazines by which employees are
made aware of the progress of the Group and the
companies in which they work. We plan to introduce a
Group magazine over the forthcoming year . 
We continue to address training and development
requirements for employees at all levels within the
organisation. We are in the process of implementing a
tailored management development programme for senior
managers in the Group. Succession planning and the future
organisational structure of the Group as it continues to
grow are reviewed on a regular basis by the Board.     
The Board is seeking shareholder approval for the
establishment of an SAYE share option scheme at the
forthcoming Annual General Meeting. Employees across the
Group will be encouraged to join this scheme, in order that
they can share in the future success of the Group.  
The Group employs disabled persons wherever
circumstances permit, and full and fair consideration is
given to applications for employment by disabled persons
having regard to their particular aptitudes and disabilities.
Disabled persons in employment receive equal treatment to
that afforded to other employees, in line with the Group’s
philosophy of equal opportunities for all employees,
irrespective of race, nationality, gender , disability or age.
The Group is committed to meeting, at a minimum, the
labour rights and legislation requirements in each country
in which it operates, and in practice, often exceeds these.
COMMUNITY
The Board recognises that each of the Group’s businesses
has an important role to play in its local community. 
The Board adopted a charitable policy during the year ,
which confirmed its commitment to support selected
charitable causes with a focus on the military and armed
services, and those linked to the local communities in which
the Group’s businesses operate. At a Group level, charitable
donations are considered on a monthly basis by the Group
Executive Committee, and each business has its own locally
held charity budget. Examples of support provided during
the year include:
■ Donations to charities including the Queen Alexandra
Hospital Home and other local hospitals, the Mary Rose
Appeal, and funds assisting the families of those serving
in current military activities
■ Sponsorship of Irvine Rugby Football Club in Scotland
■ Sponsorship and promotion of marine safety initiatives
in the UK and Australia
In addition to making cash donations, the Group also
encourages and supports employees who undertake
voluntary work in the local community, where appropriate.
During the year , our employees donated their time and
services on a wide range of projects, several of which had
an educational bias. At Chemring Countermeasures in the
UK, a work experience programme was established for local
students, and HR personnel assisted with training in
interview techniques at nearby schools. Employees from
Chemring Australia provided assistance to the Lions Club
for special needs children and were involved with a Victoria
Police “Streetsmart” handbook initiative for local teenagers.      
The Group is involved with a number of educational
initiatives, notably including the sponsorship of a Schools
Science Prize for secondary schools in North Ayrshire, and
the provision of scholarship donations to Duel County
School in South Dakota for graduating students. In addition,
the Group has recently entered into a partnership
agreement with Cranfield University, under which the
Group will provide significant funding for research activities
over the next five years.    
With regards to the impact of our manufacturing activities
on the local community, at locations where our operations
may inconvenience neighbours through product proofing,
we liaise with local residents to minimise any impact. In the
UK, Chemring Marine is working with government
authorities and voluntary organisations to develop a flare
disposal policy for out-of-date flares, which might otherwise
find their way into the wider community outside of the
marine industry.

THE CHEMRING GROUP PLC SHARE
BASED INCENTIVE SCHEME (THE
“ESOP")
No options were granted during the year and there were no
options outstanding under the ESOP at 31 October 2007 .
SHARE CAPITAL
Under the provisions of section 80 of the Companies Act
1985 (the “Act”) the Board is prevented from exercising its
powers under the Articles of Association (the “Articles”) to
allot shares without an authority in terms of the Act
contained either in the Articles or in a resolution of the
shareholders in general meeting. The authority, when
given, can last for a maximum period of five years, but your
Board proposes that renewal should be sought at each
Annual General Meeting.  Such proposal is set out as
resolution 9 in the Notice of the Annual General Meeting.
Section 89 of the Act requires that an allotment of shares
for cash may not be made unless the shares are first
offered to existing shareholders on a pre-emptive basis in
accordance with the terms of the Act.  In accordance with
general practice, to ensure that small issues of shares can
be made without the necessity of convening a general
meeting, your Board proposes that advantage be taken of
the provisions of section 95 of the Act to not apply the
Act's pre-emptive requirements.  Accordingly, a special
resolution (set out as resolution 10 in the Notice of Annual
General Meeting) will be proposed which, if passed, will
have the effect of granting the directors the power to allot
not more than 5% of the present issued ordinary share
capital free of the requirements of section 89 of the Act.
No issue of these shares will be made which would
effectively alter the control of the Company without prior
approval of the shareholders in general meeting.
STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS'
RESPONSIBILITIES
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual
report and the financial statements.  The directors have
chosen to prepare accounts for the Group in accordance
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs).
Company law requires the directors to prepare such
financial statements in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards, the Companies Act 1985 and
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.  International Accounting
Standard 1 requires that financial statements present fairly
for each financial year the Company’s financial position,
financial performance and cash flows.  This requires the
faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other
events and conditions in accordance with the definitions
and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and
expenses set out in the International Accounting Standards
Board’s “Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of
Financial Statements”.  In virtually all circumstances, a fair
presentation will be achieved by compliance with all
applicable International Financial Reporting Standards.
Directors are also required to:
■ properly select and apply accounting policies;
■ present information, including accounting policies, in a
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and
understandable information;
■ provide additional disclosures when compliance with the
specific requirements in International Financial
Reporting Standards is insufficient to enable users to
understand the impact of particular transactions, other
events and conditions on the entity's financial position
and financial performance;
■ for the Company financial statements, state whether
applicable UK accounting standards have been followed;
and
■ prepare the accounts on a going concern basis unless,
having assessed the ability of the Company to continue
as a going concern, management either intends to
liquidate the entity or to cease trading, or have no
realistic alternative but to do so.
30 CHEMRING GROUP PLC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2007
Directors' Report
(CONTINUED) The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting
records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time
the financial position of the Company, for safeguarding the
assets, for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and
detection of fraud and other irregularities and for the
preparation of a Directors’ Report, which comply with the
requirements of the Companies Act 1985.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and
integrity of the Company website.  Legislation in the United
Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of
financial statements differs from legislation in other
jurisdictions.
The directors confirm that suitable accounting policies,
consistently applied and supported by reasonable and
prudent judgments and estimates, have been used in the
preparation of the financial statements, and that applicable
accounting standards have been followed.
PROVISION OF INFORMATION TO
AUDITORS
Each of the directors at the date of approval of this report
confirms that:
■ so far as the director is aware, there is no relevant audit
information of which the Company’s auditors are
unaware; and
■ the director has taken all the steps that he ought to have
taken as a director to make himself aware of any
relevant audit information and to establish that the
Company’s auditors are aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in
accordance with the provisions of s234ZA of the Companies
Act 1985.
CLOSE COMPANY PROVISIONS
As far as the directors are aware, the close company
provisions of the Taxes Acts do not apply to the Group nor
has there been any change in that respect since 
31 October 2007 .
AUDITORS
A resolution to re-appoint Deloitte & Touche LLP as auditors
will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
The resolutions to be proposed at the Annual General
Meeting to be held on 20 March 2008, together with
explanatory notes, appear in the separate Notice of Annual
General Meeting sent to all shareholders.

22 January 2008

CHEMRING GROUP PLC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2007  31 This report sets out the information required by the
Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 
(the “Regulations”).  As required by the Regulations, 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report will be submitted to
shareholders for approval at the Annual General Meeting
on 20 March 2008.
UNAUDITED INFORMATION
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
During the year under review the Remuneration Committee
comprised:
Mr I F R Much (Committee Chairman)
Air Marshal Sir Peter Norriss
The Rt Hon Lord Freeman
Mr K C Scobie
The Committee’s principal responsibilities are:
■ determining, agreeing with the Board and reviewing
from time to time the overall policy for the
remuneration of the Chairman, the executive directors,
the Company Secretary and certain other senior
executives in the Group, and their individual
remuneration packages and any changes thereto;
■ approving the terms and conditions of employment, and
any changes thereto, of the executive directors; 
■ approving any compensation payments for executive
directors;
■ approving the design of, and determining targets for , any
performance-related pay schemes operated by the
Group;
■ reviewing the design of all share incentive plans for
approval by the Board and the Company’s shareholders;
and
■ overseeing any major changes in employee benefits
structures across the Group.
None of the Committee members has any personal
financial interest in the matters reserved for the Committee
(other than the Chairman in respect of his own
remuneration; accordingly, he is not present during any
discussions relating to this matter), nor do they have any
conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships, and
they are not involved in the day to day running of the
Group’s business.  Therefore, they are regarded by the
Board as independent.
The Committee met seven times during the year .  
The Chief Executive attends meetings by invitation but 
is not present during any discussions relating to his 
own remuneration. 
The terms of reference of the Committee are available on
the Company’s website or on request from the Company
Secretary.
ADVISERS
During the year the Committee received advice on
remuneration matters from New Bridge Street 
Consultants LLP and Mercer Limited. Mercer Limited also
provided administration and actuarial services for the
Group’s UK pension schemes during the year .
The Committee also consults internally with the 
Chief Executive and the Company Secretary.
REMUNERATION POLICY FOR
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The Committee’s policy is to provide executive remuneration
packages which are competitive, but not excessive, by
reference to market rates across comparator companies,
reflect the performance of the business against financial
objectives, and which take into account the individual
contribution and performance of each executive director .
Remuneration packages comprise the following elements:
(i) basic salary and benefits, including pensions;
(ii) annual bonuses linked to the Group’s financial
performance; and 
(iii)awards of share-based incentives linked to the long term
growth of the Group.
The Committee aims to align the interests of executive
directors with those of shareholders, by ensuring that a
significant proportion of remuneration is 
performance-related.  This is achieved through the
performance-related elements of annual bonuses and
share-based incentives.
BASIC SALARIES AND BENEFITS
The executive directors’ basic salaries are reviewed
annually by the Committee, and adjustments made, if
appropriate, taking into account individual performance
and comparable salary levels in manufacturing companies
of a similar size and in other companies within the
aerospace and defence sector .  The Committee refers to
published salary surveys and data provided by its
remuneration advisers, New Bridge Street Consultants, and
also reviews the remuneration information presented in the
32 CHEMRING GROUP PLC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2007
Directors’ Renumeration Report annual reports of companies in the reference group. 
Following its review this year , the Committee increased
salaries for Dr Price and Mr Rayner to £350,000 per
annum and £220,000 per annum respectively. The
Committee considered that these increases were necessary
to retain a competitive remuneration package for key
executives as the Group continues to grow, although salary
levels remain below mid-market levels compared to
companies of a similar size following these adjustments. 
The main taxable benefits for executive directors are
company cars, fuel for private motoring and private
medical insurance.
ANNUAL BONUSES
The Company operates an annual performance-related
bonus plan for the executive directors, with key
characteristics as follows:
■ the maximum bonus potential for the executive
directors is 60% of basic salary, with an on-target
bonus of 30% of basic salary;
■ three quarters of the bonus potential is linked to two
separate financial conditions, namely earnings per share
and cash flow (with equal weighting). The conditions,
which are set by the Committee, take into account a
number of factors including budget, market
expectations, long term growth prospects and the
previous year’s out-turn. No bonus is payable for
achievement of less than 90% of target, with bonuses
being earned thereafter on a straight-line basis up to
the maximum for 110% or better achievement of target;
■ one quarter of the bonus potential may be achieved in
connection with the satisfaction of personal objective
criteria set at the beginning of the financial year . No
part of this element of bonus is payable unless
threshold performance of both the financial conditions
described above is achieved; 
■ one quarter of any bonus payable is deferred as a
conditional award of the Company’s shares, with vesting
subject to continued employment (save in good leaver
scenarios) three years from the award of bonus; and 
■ the payment of any bonus remains ultimately at the
discretion of the Committee.
Bonuses are non-pensionable.
The table below summarises the bonuses earned by the
executive directors, as a percentage of basic salary, in
respect of the current and last years:
LONG TERM INCENTIVE SCHEMES
PERFORMANCE SHARE PLAN
The Company operates the Chemring Group Performance
Share Plan for the executive directors and other key
members of the senior management team who influence
the performance and prospects of the Group. The key
features of the plan are as follows:
■ conditional awards can be made of the Company’s shares
worth no more than 100% of basic salary each year;
■ awards will vest three years after grant subject to the
extent to which a demanding performance condition has
been achieved over a single three year performance
period (with no ability to re-test the performance
condition). The performance condition is based on the
growth of the Company’s earnings per share in excess
of RPI over three consecutive financial years.  The
Committee considers an earnings per share condition to
most closely align the interests of participants with
those of the Company’s shareholders;

■ earnings per share is calculated on a fully diluted and
normalised basis, as specified by the Committee prior to
grant; and
■ market purchase shares or new issue shares (including
treasury shares) may be used to satisfy awards. To the
extent that new issue shares or treasury shares are
used, these will count towards the usual share usage
dilution limits (10% in ten years for all schemes and 5%
in ten years for discretionary (executive) schemes).
Participation in the plan is extended at the discretion of the
Committee to the executive directors and senior management
of the Group, both in the UK and overseas. The following
awards were made under the plan during the year:
Details of the awards made to executive directors during
the year are set out on page 38. 
The executive directors are expected to maintain a
shareholding in the Company equivalent to one year’s basic
salary. Other participants in the plan are expected to retain
a shareholding equivalent to 25% of their basic salary
following vesting of the awards.   
During the year , the Company purchased 150,000 
(2006: nil) treasury shares at a cost of £2.8 million for use
in the plan.

Between 1998 and 2005 the Company operated the
Chemring 1998 Executive Share Option Scheme.  Following
the introduction of the Chemring Group Performance Share
Plan, no further grants will be made under the option
scheme, save in exceptional circumstances such as on
recruitment, and the conditions applying to any such grants
will accord with current corporate governance best
practice. It will no longer be permissible to grant options
under this scheme after 4 March 2008.
The Company previously operated a long term incentive
scheme known as the Chemring Group PLC Share Based
Incentive Scheme.  This scheme is not being utilised at
present.  
PERFORMANCE GRAPH
The following graph shows a comparison of the Company’s
total shareholder return (TSR) over the last five financial
years against a “broad equity market index”, as required by
the Regulations.  The FTSE 250 Index has been selected by
the Committee for this comparison because it provides the
most appropriate measure of performance of listed
companies of a similar size to the Company. 
PENSIONS
Dr Price is a member of the Chemring Group Staff Pension
Scheme (the “Staff Scheme”).  This is an approved final
salary scheme, which is contracted out of the State Second
Pension, and which provides, at retirement, a pension of up
to two-thirds of salary, subject to Inland Revenue limits.
The Staff Scheme also provides life assurance cover ,
dependants’ pensions and lump sum payments on 
death-in-service.  Members of the Staff Scheme are
required to make monthly contributions to the scheme at
the rate of 8% of pensionable salary.
Dr Price’s pension under the Staff Scheme accrues at
1/80th of final pensionable salary for each year of
membership, and he also accrues a cash lump sum at
3/80ths of final pensionable salary for each year of
membership.  A two-thirds spouses’ pension is payable in
respect of service accrued to 31 January 2004, reducing to
50% for service accrued thereafter , and on 
death-in-service, Dr Price’s dependants would receive a
lump sum payment of two times basic salary and, in
addition a spouses’ pension would be payable, as calculated
above.  Dr Price is subject to an earnings cap (equivalent to
the cap applied by HM Revenue and Customs prior to April
2006) in respect of his membership of the Staff Scheme.
Mr Rayner is a member of the Chemring Group Executive
Pension Scheme (the “Executive Scheme”).  The Executive
Scheme is also an approved final salary scheme but is not

This graph shows the value, by 31 October 2007 , of £100 invested
in Chemring Group PLC on 31 October 2002 compared with the
value of £100 invested in the FTSE 250 Index. The other points
plotted are the values at intervening financial year ends. contracted out of the State Second Pension. Members of
the Executive Scheme are required to make monthly
contributions to the scheme at the rate of 8% of
pensionable salary.  Mr Rayner’s benefits under the
Executive Scheme accrue in an identical manner to that in
which Dr Price accrues benefits under the Staff Scheme, as
set out above.  Mr Rayner is also subject to an earnings cap.
Both Dr Price and Mr Rayner have a normal retirement age
of 65.
SERVICE CONTRACTS
Dr Price has a rolling service contract dated 4 April 2005.
This provides for termination by either party on twelve
months’ notice.  The Company may however terminate
without notice, and make a payment in lieu of notice equal
to the sum of the salary due for the unexpired notice
period plus the fair value of any contractual benefits.  Any
such sum may be paid in instalments, and in these
circumstances there is a requirement to mitigate loss.
Mr Rayner has a rolling service contract dated 
27 August 1999.  This provides for termination by either
party on twelve months’ notice.  The Company may however
terminate without notice and make a payment in lieu of
notice equal to the sum of twelve months’ salary plus the
value of any contractual benefits.  There are no other
provisions relating to compensation on early termination.
It is the Committee’s general policy that all new executive
directors appointed in the future will have service contracts
with the Company which are terminable on a maximum of
twelve months’ notice. The service contracts will contain
provisions permitting the Company to make any
termination payments by instalments, and will require
directors to mitigate their loss in such circumstances.
POLICY ON OUTSIDE APPOINTMENTS
With the specific approval of the Board in each case,
executive directors may accept external appointments as
non-executive directors of other companies, provided that
they do not detract from their responsibilities to the Group,
and may retain any related fees paid to them.  None of the
executive directors currently holds any such external
appointments.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
Mr Scobie has a rolling service contract with the Company
terminable on twelve months’ notice by either party.  His
remuneration under the contract, part of which is paid to his
company for consultancy services, is £100,000 per annum.
His time commitment under the contract is two to four days
per month, not to exceed a total of fifty days per year .
Additional services are paid for at the rate of £1,000 per day. 
Mr Evans, The Rt Hon Lord Freeman, Mr Much and 
Air Marshal Sir Peter Norriss have letters of appointment
covering, amongst other items, their terms of appointment
and expected time commitment. These letters of
appointment provide for a three year appointment, unless
terminated earlier by and at the discretion of either party
upon three months’ written notice. In the case of 
The Rt Hon Lord Freeman, Mr Much and 
Air Marshal Sir Peter Norriss, it is anticipated that, subject to
satisfactory performance and re-election by the
shareholders, two three-year terms will be served by these
non-executive directors.  The basic fee payable to each of the
four non-executive directors is £35,000 per annum. 
The Rt Hon Lord Freeman and Mr Much each receive an
additional fee of £4,500 per annum, in respect of their
Chairmanship of the Audit Committee and Remuneration
Committee respectively.
Fees for the non-executive directors are determined
annually by the Board, having regard to the practice of
other companies and the particular demands of the Group.
The Company provides private medical insurance for 
Mr Scobie, Mr Evans and Air Marshal Sir Peter Norriss, 
and their respective spouses.
The non-executive directors do not participate in the
Company’s pension, bonus or share-based incentive
schemes. However , Mr Evans does receive a pension from
the Chemring Group Executive Pension Scheme, which he
accrued during his former employment with the Company.
In addition, a long term incentive scheme, known as The
Chemring Group Phantom Share Option Scheme, was
established in 1997 to secure the appointment of Mr Scobie
as Chairman at a difficult time when the Group was
undergoing a fundamental reorganisation.  Mr Scobie, who
was the only participant in the scheme, acquired a
contractual entitlement on his appointment in 1997 to the
grant of phantom options over 141,025 ordinary shares in
the Company at a notional exercise price of 78p per share.
Mr Scobie exercised his rights under this scheme on 
31 October 2007 and received a cash payment from the
Company in November 2007 of £3,008,063 (gross), being
equivalent to the difference between the market value of
the ordinary shares on the exercise date (2,211p) less the
total exercise price. No further awards will be made under
this scheme.

in Section 1 of the revised Combined Code on Corporate
Governance, and whether or not the Company has
complied throughout its accounting period with the
provisions of Section 1 of the revised Combined Code.
THE BOARD
The Board currently comprises the Chairman, the 
Chief Executive, the Finance Director and four 
non-executive directors.  The Board considers that 
three of the current non-executive directors, 
The Rt Hon Lord Freeman, Mr Much and 
Air Marshal Sir Peter Norriss, are independent in character
and judgment, and meet the criteria for independence set
out in the revised Combined Code.  The directors’
biographical details are set out on pages 26 and 27 . 
The Board, which meets at least ten times a year , approves
the Group's long-term goals and strategies and provides
overall financial and organisational control. The Board has a
formal schedule of matters specifically reserved to it for
consideration and approval, including: approval of the
Group’s corporate plan; approval of the annual operating
budgets; acquisitions, disposals and major capital
expenditure; financing and treasury; pensions; reviewing the
Group’s systems of financial control and risk management;
approving appointments to the Board and approving
policies relating to directors’ remuneration; and maintaining
an effective dialogue with shareholders. All directors take
decisions objectively in the interests of the Company.
The Board delegates certain responsibilities to the
Executive Committee, including: implementation of the
Group’s strategies and policies as determined by the Board;
monitoring of operational and financial results against
budget; allocation of resources across the Group within the
overall plan approved by the Board; capital expenditure
within limits imposed by the Board; and developing and
implementing risk management systems. Further details of
the Executive Committee are set out in the section of this
report covering Board Committees.
Procedures are in place covering the content, presentation
and timely delivery of papers to the Board for each Board
meeting, to ensure that directors have sufficient
information to make expedient and considered decisions in
fulfilment of their fiduciary duties. Where directors have
concerns which cannot be resolved about the running of
the Company or a proposed action, such concerns are
recorded in the Board minutes.
Each director has full access to the advice and services of
the Company Secretary who, under the direction of the
Chairman, is responsible for maintaining good information
flows within the Board and its committees, assisting with
induction and keeping the directors informed about
changes to their duties and responsibilities, and advising
the Board on all governance matters. The appointment and
removal of the Company Secretary is a matter for the
Board as a whole.
All directors are entitled to take independent professional
advice in furtherance of their duties at the Company’s
expense, if the need should arise.
An internal induction programme on the Group’s operations
and its strategic and business plans is provided for 
newly-appointed directors. The Company Secretary also
provides detailed information on directors’ legal duties and
responsibilities on appointment, and updates the Board on
a regular basis with regards to regulatory changes
affecting the directors and the Group’s operations
generally.  Directors are continually updated on the Group’s
businesses and the matters affecting the market in which
they operate.  The Company meets the cost of appropriate
external training for directors, the requirement for which is
kept under review by the Chairman. During the year , the
Board received specific training on the revised directors’
duties introduced by the Companies Act 2006.  
The Company separates the roles of Chairman and Chief
Executive in accordance with the recommendations of the
revised Combined Code.  The division of responsibilities
between the Chairman and the Chief Executive, and their
respective job descriptions, are set out in writing and
agreed by the Board.
In addition to chairing the Board, the Chairman is
responsible for: ensuring that the Board is kept properly
informed and is consulted on all decisions reserved to it;
promoting constructive relations between the executive
and non-executive directors; ensuring that the
development needs of directors are identified and the
performance of the Board evaluated on a regular basis; and
ensuring effective communication with shareholders and
acting as a conduit to ensure that the views of
shareholders are communicated to the Board. The
Chairman has no significant business commitments other
than his chairmanship of the Company.
The non-executive directors perform an essential role in
safeguarding shareholders’ interests.  They actively
participate in the development of strategic objectives and
40 CHEMRING GROUP PLC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2007
Statement on Corporate Governance monitor the performance of executive management in
achieving these objectives.  The non-executive directors
also review financial performance, and consider the
integrity of the financial information produced by the
Group and whether the financial controls and risk
management systems are robust and defensible.  They
meet periodically with the management of the Group’s
operating companies.  In addition to participating in Board
meetings, the three independent non-executive directors
are the members of the standing committees set up to deal
with audit and the remuneration of executive directors and
senior management.  The Board considers that the current
balance of executive and non-executive influence which
exists is appropriate for the Company, taking into account
its size and status.
The Board has not appointed a senior independent director ,
as it does not consider this to be appropriate at the present
time in view of the size of the Board.
During the financial year , the Chairman met regularly with
the non-executive directors without the executives present.
Mr Evans, The Rt Hon Lord Freeman, Mr Much and 
Air Marshal Sir Peter Norriss all have letters of appointment
covering, amongst other items, their terms of appointment
and expected time commitment.  These letters of
appointment provide for a three year appointment, unless
terminated earlier by and at the discretion of either party
upon three months’ written notice.  The non-executive
directors’ letters of appointment are available for inspection
on request to the Company Secretary.
In accordance with the revised Combined Code and the
Company’s Articles of Association, all directors submit
themselves for re-election every three years. The papers
accompanying the Notice of Annual General Meeting
include a statement from the Chairman confirming that the
performance of each non-executive director seeking 
re-election at the meeting continues to be effective and
that each such director continues to demonstrate
commitment to their role.
A full formal evaluation of the performance of the Board
and its committees was undertaken towards the end of last
year .  This was updated by way of an informal review by the
Chairman this year . In addition, the Chairman and the 
non-executive directors considered the individual
performance of the Chief Executive and the Finance Director
as part of the annual remuneration review. Similarly, the
performance of the Chairman was considered by the 
non-executive directors during the annual review of his
remuneration, and the Chairman and the Chief Executive
reviewed the performance of the non-executive directors.
During the year the Board continued to address the
improvements to succession planning that were identified
by last year’s formal Board evaluation. 
The Company maintains directors and officers liability
insurance in respect of legal action against its directors.

AUDIT COMMITTEE
The Rt Hon Lord Freeman, Mr Much and 
Air Marshal Sir Peter Norriss all served as 
members of the Audit Committee during the year .  
The Rt Hon Lord Freeman is Chairman of the Committee.
The Committee meets three times a year and operates
within formal written terms of reference.  As referred to
above, the terms of reference are available on the
Company’s website.  Meetings of the Committee are
attended, at the invitation of the Committee, by the
external auditors, the Chairman, the Finance Director and
representatives from the Group finance and internal audit
function.  The Committee meets with the auditors on a
regular basis without executive directors present.  The
Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Committee and
minutes of meetings are circulated to all Board members.
The Committee is authorised to seek any information it
requires from any employee of the Company in order to
perform its duties, and to obtain any outside legal or other
professional advice it requires at the Company’s expense.
The Committee monitors the integrity of the Group’s
financial statements and the effectiveness of the external
audit process.  It is responsible for ensuring that an
appropriate relationship between the Group and the
external auditors is maintained, including reviewing non-
audit services and fees.  The Committee keeps under
review the effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls
and financial risk management systems, and on an annual
basis, considers the need for a dedicated internal audit
function.  The Committee reviews annually its terms of
reference and its effectiveness, and recommends to the
Board any changes required as the result of such review.
During the year , the Committee, operating under its terms
of reference, discharged its responsibilities by:
■ reviewing the Group’s draft 2006 financial statements
and 2007 interim results statement prior to Board
approval and reviewing the external auditors’ detailed
reports thereon;
■ reviewing the appropriateness of the Group’s accounting
policies, and reviewing various accounting matters
raised by management and the external auditors in the
context of financial disclosures;
■ reviewing the potential impact in the Group’s financial
statements of certain matters such as impairments of
fixed asset values and International Financial Reporting
Standards;
■ reviewing the external auditors’ plan for the 2006 and
2007 financial statements and 2007 interim results,
including key risks on the accounts, confirmation of
auditor independence and the proposed audit fee, and
approving the terms of engagement for the audit; and
■ reviewing the work undertaken by the Group’s internal
audit function.
During the year under review, the Company appointed an
Internal Auditor . The initial internal audit programme
focussed on a review of financial controls across the Group.
It is intended to widen these activities to include an audit of
certain non-financial controls and procedures over the
course of this year .     
The Board has accepted the Committee’s recommendation
that Deloitte & Touche LLP be proposed for re-appointment
as auditors at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
The Committee keeps under review the level of non-audit
services which are provided by the external auditors, to
ensure that this does not impair their independence and
objectivity. The Committee, in conjunction with the Finance
Director , also ensures that the Group maintains a sufficient
choice of appropriately qualified audit firms. During the
year , work on corporate finance matters was sourced from
the external auditors only where there was no direct
conflict with their role as external auditors and where there
were clear efficiencies and value added benefits for the
Company. Details of the amounts paid to the external
auditors during the year for audit and other services are
set out in the notes to the financial statements on page 60.
NOMINATION COMMITTEE
Mr Scobie, Mr Much and Air Marshal Sir Peter Norriss all
served on the Nomination Committee during the year .  
Mr Scobie is Chairman of the Committee but, in accordance
with the Committee’s terms of reference, is not permitted
to chair meetings when the Committee is dealing with the
appointment of his successor .  As referred to above, the
Committee’s terms of reference are available on the
Company’s website.
With regards to the recruitment and appointment of new
directors to the Board, the Committee considers the
specific knowledge and expertise which would be of benefit
to the Group’s current operations and future strategy, and
provides a brief to external search agents based upon its
42 CHEMRING GROUP PLC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2007
Statement on Corporate Governance
(CONTINUED) CHEMRING GROUP PLC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2007  43
conclusions.  The search agents put forward a short list of
candidates for the Committee to interview before making
its recommendations to the Board.  The Board interviews
preferred candidates prior to making any formal offers of
appointment.  
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Rt Hon Lord Freeman, Mr Much, 
Air Marshal Sir Peter Norriss and Mr Scobie all served on
the Remuneration Committee during the year .  Mr Much is
Chairman of the Committee.  The Committee met seven
times during the year .  Further details on the Committee
and the Company’s policy on directors’ remuneration are
included within the Directors’ Remuneration Report.
EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
The Chief Executive, Dr Price, chairs the Executive
Committee, which meets monthly.  The other members are
the Finance Director , the Company Secretary, the Business
Development Director , the Managing Director of the
European Energetics Division and the President of the
Group’s US operations.  The Executive Committee is
responsible for the executive day-to-day running of the
Company, submission to the Board of strategic plans and
budgets for the Group’s operations, and monitoring the
day-to-day performance of the Group as a whole.
RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
The Company maintains an active dialogue with institutional
shareholders through regular briefing meetings and formal
presentations following the release of interim and annual
results.  Meetings are usually attended by the Chairman, the
Chief Executive and the Finance Director .  However , the 
non-executive directors are offered the opportunity to meet
with major shareholders and attend meetings if so
requested by major shareholders.  No such requests were
received during the year . Communication with private
investors is achieved largely through the medium of the
interim report and the financial statements.
The Company’s website (www.chemring.co.uk) provides
financial and business information on the Group.
The directors are provided with reports and other written
briefings from the Company’s principal shareholders and
analysts, and are regularly informed by the Company
Secretary about changes to significant shareholdings.
It is the Company’s policy that all directors should attend
and make themselves available to take questions from
shareholders or address any concerns at the Annual
General Meeting.  At other times of the year , the directors
can be contacted via the Company’s head office.
All substantial issues, including the adoption of the annual
report and financial statements, are proposed on separate
resolutions at the Annual General Meeting. The number of
proxy votes received for and against each resolution,
together with the number of abstentions, are indicated after
votes have been dealt with on a show of hands. The Notice
of the Annual General Meeting is sent to shareholders at
least twenty working days before the meeting.
FINANCIAL REPORTING
The Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities in respect of
the financial statements and accounting records
maintained by the Company is set out on page 30.
INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK
MANAGEMENT
The Board has continued to review the effectiveness of the
Group’s systems of internal control, including financial,
operational and compliance controls, and risk management
systems.
The Board acknowledges its responsibility for the Group’s
systems of internal control and attaches considerable
importance to these systems, which are designed to meet
the Group’s particular needs and identify those risks to which
it is exposed.  However , the systems can only provide
reasonable, not absolute, assurance against material
misstatement, loss or mismanagement of the Group’s assets.
In carrying out its review of the effectiveness of the Group’s
systems of internal control, the Board has taken into
consideration the following key features of the Group’s risk
management systems and control procedures which
operated during the year:
■ The Board assesses the key risks associated with
achievement of the Group’s business objectives as part
of the annual strategic planning process.  Out of this
process, each business establishes a five year plan and
annual budget, which are subject to approval by the
Board.  The performance of each business against
budget and prior years is reviewed on a monthly basis at
both operational level and by the Board.  Achievement of
strategic business objectives and the associated risks are
monitored by the Board on an ongoing basis.
■ All businesses hold monthly operating meetings, which
are attended by at least one main Board director , either in person or , in the case of the overseas companies, by
video conference.  In the case of the US businesses,
formal Board meetings are held quarterly and these are
attended by main Board directors and external 
non-executive directors appointed in the US.  The US
non-executive directors are available to provide
guidance and monitor governance in the US businesses
throughout the year .
■ Each business is required to comply with the Group’s
accounting policy manual, which sets out formal
procedures for incurring certain types of expenditure
and making contractual commitments.  Compliance with
the accounting policy manual is reviewed by both the
Audit Committee and the full Board.
■ The Board retains primary responsibility for acquisitions
and disposals, and financing arrangements for the Group.
Treasury management, IT strategy, insurance and
significant legal matters are dealt with centrally from the
Group head office, and the Board receives regular reports
on each of these items.  Reviews of the Group’s pensions,
insurance and risk management arrangements are
carried out by external advisors on a regular basis.
■ A dedicated Group Health, Safety and Environment
Manager , supported by two divisional Health and Safety
Management Committees, co-ordinates and controls the
activities of each business in relation to health and safety
and environmental matters, which are a key focus for the
Board in view of the nature of the Group’s operations.
The Chief Executive is the Board member nominated with
specific responsibility for health and safety. The Chief
Executive meets formally with health and safety
professionals from each business on an annual basis.  
The Group’s Risk Management Committee meets on a
quarterly basis.  The Chief Executive, the Finance Director ,
the Company Secretary, the Business Development
Director , the Managing Director of the Energetics Division
and the President of the Group’s US operations serve on
the Committee.  The Committee reviews the key risks
associated with the achievement of the annual budget and
the five year plan for each business, and the risk control
procedures implemented.  It reports biannually to the
Board on the top ten risks from a Group perspective, and
monitors the actions being taken to mitigate these.
The Board confirms that it has reviewed the effectiveness
of the Group’s systems of internal control and risk
management which were in place during the financial year
ended 31 October 2007 , and it confirms that systems of
internal control and risk management compliant with the
revised Combined Code and the Turnbull Guidance were in
place throughout the year and have remained in place up
to the date of approval of these financial statements.
Notwithstanding this, the Board will continue to take steps
to embed internal control and risk management further
into the operations of the Group and to deal with any areas
of improvement which come to the attention of
management and the Board.
COMPLIANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS
OF THE REVISED COMBINED CODE
Throughout the year ended 31 October 2007 , the Company
has been in compliance with the code provisions set out in
Section 1 of the revised Combined Code on Corporate
Governance issued by the Financial Reporting Council in
June 2006, with the following exceptions (references to the
relevant sections of the revised Combined Code are given
in brackets):
■ The Board has not nominated a non-executive director
as the senior independent director as it does not
consider this to be appropriate at the present time in
view of the size of the Board.  This requirement will be
kept under review (A.3.3).
■ Mr Scobie’s appointment as Non-Executive Chairman is
not for a specified term; however , he is subject to
retirement by rotation (A.7 .2).
GOING CONCERN
The directors have acknowledged the latest guidance on
going concern and, after making appropriate enquiries,
have formed a judgment at the time of approving the
financial statements that there is a reasonable expectation
that the Company has adequate resources to continue in
operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern
basis in preparing the financial statements.
Approved by the Board of Directors on 22 January 2008

which comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, the
Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income and
Expense, the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Consolidated
Cash Flow Statement, the Notes to the Cash Flow
Statement and the related Notes 1 to 38.  These Group
financial statements have been prepared under the
accounting policies set out therein.  We have also audited
the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that
is described as having been audited.
We have reported separately on the individual company
financial statements of Chemring Group PLC for the year
ended 31 October 2007 .
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a
body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act
1985.  Our audit work has been undertaken so that we
might state to the Company’s members those matters we
are required to state to them in an Auditors’ Report and for
no other purpose.  To the fullest extent permitted by law,
we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other
than the Company and the Company’s members as a body,
for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we
have formed.
RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF
DIRECTORS AND AUDITORS
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual
report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the Group
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as
adopted by the European Union are set out in the Statement
of Directors’ Responsibilities in the Directors’ Report.
Our responsibility is to audit the Group financial statements
and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report
described as having been audited in accordance with
relevant legal and regulatory requirements and
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).  
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Group
financial statements give a true and fair view, whether the
Group financial statements have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of
the IAS Regulation and whether the part of the Directors’
Remuneration Report described as having been audited have
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies
Act 1985.  We also report to you whether in our opinion the
information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with
the Group financial statements.  The information given in the
Directors’ Report includes that specific information
presented in the Statement by the Chairman, the Review by
the Chief Executive and the Review by the Finance Director
that is cross referred from the review of the year and results
section of the Directors’ Report.  
In addition, we report to you if, in our opinion, we have not
received all the information and explanations we require for
our audit, or if information specified by law regarding
directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not
disclosed. 
We review whether the Statement on Corporate
Governance reflects the Company’s compliance with the
nine provisions of the 2006 Combined Code specified for
our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services
Authority, and we report if it does not.  We are not required
to consider whether the Board’s statement on internal
control covers all risks and controls, or form an opinion on
the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate governance
procedures or its risk and control procedures. 
We read the other information contained in the annual
report as described in the contents section including the
unaudited part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report and
consider whether it is consistent with the audited Group
financial statements.  We consider the implications for our
report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements
or material inconsistencies with the Group financial
statements.  Our responsibilities do not extend to any
further information outside the annual report. 
BASIS OF AUDIT OPINION
We conducted our audit in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the
Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on
a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and
disclosures in the Group financial statements and the part
of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited.  It also
includes an assessment of the significant estimates and
judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the
Group financial statements, and of whether the accounting
policies are appropriate to the Company’s circumstances,
consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered
necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to
give reasonable assurance that the group financial
statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration

Notes to the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 OCTOBER 2007 1. GENERAL INFORMATION
Chemring Group PLC is a company incorporated in England
and Wales under registration number 86662.  The address of
the registered office is Chemring House, 1500 Parkway,
Whiteley, Fareham, Hampshire PO15 7AF .  The nature of the
Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in
Note 4 and in the Directors’ Report on pages 29 to 31.  These
financial statements are the consolidated financial statements
of Chemring Group PLC and its subsidiaries (the “Group”).
These financial statements are presented in pounds
sterling.  Foreign operations are included in accordance
with the policy set out in Note 2 “Accounting Policies”.
At the date of presentation of these financial statements
the following Standards and Interpretations, which have not
been applied in these financial statements, were in issue
but not yet effective:
■ IFRS7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures and the related
amendment to IAS1 on capital disclosures (effective
from 1 January 2007).
IFRS7 and this amendment to IAS1 introduce new
disclosures of information about financial instruments and
capital management.  The impact of these changes to the
Group is that additional disclosures will be required
concerning the sensitivity analysis to market risk and the
management of capital.  These will be applied for the year
ending 31 October 2008.
■ IFRS8 Operating Segments (effective from 
1 January 2009).
Management considers that current segmental reporting
under IAS 14 is substantially the same as IFRS8. IFRS8 will
be applied for the year ending 31 October 2010.
■ IAS1 Revised – Presentation of Financial Statements
(effective 1 January 2009). 
■ IAS23  – Borrowing Costs (effective 1 January 2009).
IAS23 prescribes the accounting treatment for borrowing
costs that may be capitalised during the period and is a
revised version of the Standard.  This revised Standard will
be applied for the year ending 31 October 2009. 
■ IFRIC11 IFRS2 – Group and Treasury Share Transactions.
IFRIC11 provides guidance on whether share-based payment
arrangements, in which suppliers of goods or services of an
entity are provided with equity instruments of the entity’s parent
should be accounted for as cash settled or equity settled in the
entity’s financial statements.  These interpretations will be
applied for the year ending 31 October 2008.
■ IFRIC14/IAS19 – The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset,
Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction
(effective 1 January 2008).
IFRIC14 addresses the interaction between a minimum
funding requirement and the limit placed by paragraph 58
IAS19 on the measurement of the defined benefit asset or
liability.  These interpretations will be applied for the year
ending 31 October 2009.
■ IFRIC12 – Service Concession Arrangements and 
IFRIC13 – Customer Loyalty Programmes.
Management anticipate that the adoption of these two
Standards and Interpretations will have no impact on the
financial statements of the Group.
2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of preparation
These financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with IFRS adopted for use in the European
Union.  These will be those IAS, IFRS and related
Interpretations (Standing Interpretations Committee
(SIC)/International Financial Reporting Interpretations
Committee (IFRIC) interpretations), subsequent
amendments to those standards and related
interpretations, future standards and related
interpretations issued or adopted by the International
Accounting Standards Board (IASB) that have been
endorsed by the European Commission (collectively
referred to as IFRS).  These are subject to ongoing review
and endorsement by the European Commission or possible
amendment by interpretive guidance from the IASB and
the IFRIC and are therefore still subject to change.
Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance
with IFRS.  The particular accounting policies adopted have
been applied consistently throughout the current and
previous year and are described below.
Accounting convention
The financial statements are prepared under the historical
cost convention, except for the revaluation of certain
properties and financial instruments.
Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements consolidate those of the
Company and all of its subsidiaries.  A subsidiary
52 CHEMRING GROUP PLC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2007
Notes to the Group Financial Statements undertaking is an entity over which the Group has the
power to govern the financial and operating policies of an
entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.  The
results of subsidiaries acquired are consolidated from the
date on which control passes to the Group and the results
of disposed subsidiaries are consolidated up to the date on
which control passes from the Group.
All companies within the Group make up their financial
statements to the same date.  All intra-group transactions,
balances, income and expenses are eliminated on
consolidation.
Operating profit
Operating profit is stated before the share of results of
associates and before finance expense.  Operating profit
excludes the results of discontinued operations.
Revenue recognition
Sales comprise the fair value of the consideration received or
receivable for deliveries made, work completed or services
rendered during the year , net of discounts, VAT and other
sales related taxes.  Sales are recognised when title passes,
or when the right to consideration, in exchange for
performance, has been completed.  For bill and hold
arrangements revenue is recognised when the risks and
rewards are transferred to the customer , typically on formal
acceptance.  An appropriate proportion of total long term
contract value, based on the fair value of work performed, is
included in revenue and an appropriate level of profit is
taken based on the percentage completion method when the
final outcome can be reliably assessed.  Provision is made in
full for foreseeable losses as soon as they are identified.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the
shareholders’ rights to receive payment have been
established.
Acquisitions
On acquisition of a subsidiary, the cost is measured as the
fair value of the consideration given plus any directly
attributable costs.  The assets, liabilities and contingent
liabilities of a subsidiary that meet the IFRS3 Business
Combinations recognition criteria are measured at the fair
value at the date of acquisition.  Where cost exceeds fair
value of the net assets acquired the difference is recorded
as goodwill.
Where the fair value of the net assets exceeds the cost, the
difference is recorded directly in the Income Statement.
The accounting policies of subsidiaries are changed where
necessary to be consistent with those of the Group.
Intangible assets
Goodwill
The purchased goodwill of the Group is regarded as having
an indefinite useful economic life and, in accordance with
IAS36 Impairment of Assets, is not amortised but is subject
to annual tests for impairment.  In reviewing the carrying
value of goodwill of the various businesses the Board has
considered the separate plans and cash flows of these
businesses consistent with the requirements of IAS36 and
is satisfied that these demonstrate that no impairment has
occurred in respect of continuing operations.  Goodwill
arising on acquisition before the date of transition to IFRS
has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts
subject to being tested for impairment at that date.  On
disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled
entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the
determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
For acquisitions after 1 November 2004 the Group
recognises separately from goodwill intangible assets that
are separable or arise from contractual or other legal rights
and whose fair value can be measured reliably.  These
intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over
their useful economic lives, averaging ten years.
Research and development expenditure
Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an
expense in the period in which it is incurred.  Development
expenditure, where it meets certain criteria given below, is
capitalised on a straight line basis over typically three years
from the date commercial production commences.
Development costs not meeting the criteria for
capitalisation are expensed as incurred.
An intangible development asset is recognised only if all of
the following conditions are met:
■ the development costs are separately identifiable;
■ the development costs can be measured reliably;
■ management are satisfied as to the ultimate technical
and commercial viability of the project; and
■ it is probable that the asset will generate future
economic benefits.
Patents and trademarks
Patents and trademarks are measured initially at purchase
cost and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their
estimated useful lives.
CHEMRING GROUP PLC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2007  53 2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES - CONTINUED
Property, plant and equipment
Other than revalued land and buildings, property, plant and
equipment are held at cost less accumulated depreciation
and any recognised impairment loss.  No depreciation is
provided on freehold land.  On other assets depreciation is
provided at rates calculated to write down their cost or
valuation to their estimated residual values by equal
instalments over their estimated useful economic lives,
which are considered to be:
Freehold buildings - up to 50 years
Leasehold buildings - the period of the lease
Plant and equipment - 10 years
Impairment of non-current assets
Assets that have indefinite lives are tested for impairment
annually.  Assets that are subject to depreciation or
amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value
may not be recoverable.  To the extent that the carrying
value exceeds the recoverable amount an impairment loss
is recorded for the difference as an expense in the income
statement.  The recoverable amount used for impairment
testing is the higher of the value in use and its fair value
less costs of disposal.  For the purpose of impairment
testing assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which
there are separately identifiable cash flows.
Non-current assets held for sale
Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held
for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and
fair value less costs to sell.  These items are so classified if
their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale
transaction rather than through continuing use.
Inventories
Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost and net
realisable value.  Cost represents materials, direct labour ,
other direct costs and related production overheads and is
determined using the first-in first-out (FIFO) method.  Net
realisable value is based on estimated selling price, less
further costs expected to be incurred to completion and
disposal.
Provision is made for slow moving, obsolete and defective
items where appropriate.
Tax
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently
payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the
year .  Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in
the Income Statement because it excludes items of income
or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years
and it further excludes items of income that are never
taxable or deductible.  The Group’s liability for current tax is
calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or
substantively enacted at the Balance Sheet date.
Deferred tax is expected to be payable or recoverable on
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding
tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is
accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all
taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are
recognised to the extent that it is probable taxable profits
will be available against which deductible temporary
differences can be utilised.  Such assets and liabilities are
not recognised if the temporary difference arises from
goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a
business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a
transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the
accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary
differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and
associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the
Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary
difference and it is probable that the temporary difference
will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at
each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is
no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be
available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected
to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the
asset is realised.  Deferred tax is charged or credited in the
Income Statement, except where it relates to items charged
or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax
is also dealt with in equity.

reduction scheme involving the cancellation of the share

Notes to the Group Financial Statements
(CONTINUED)  premium account which was approved by the Court in 1986
and is in accordance with the requirements of the
Companies Act 1985.
Foreign currencies
The individual financial statements of each Group company
are presented in the currency of the primary economic
environment in which it operates (its functional currency).
For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements,
the results and financial position of each Group company
are expressed in pounds sterling, which is the functional
currency of the Company, and the presentation currency
for the consolidated financial statements.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual
companies, transactions in currencies other than the
entity’s functional currency (foreign currencies) are
recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates
of the transactions.  At each balance sheet date, monetary
assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign
currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the
balance sheet date.  Non-monetary items carried at fair
value that are denominated in foreign currencies are
translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair
value was determined.  Non-monetary items that are
measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency
are not retranslated.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of
monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary
items, are included in the profit or loss for the period.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange
risks, the Group enters into forward contracts and options
which are accounted for as derivative financial instruments
(see below for details of the Group’s accounting policies in
respect of such derivative financial instruments).
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial
statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign
operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on
the Balance Sheet date.  Income and expense items are
translated at the average exchange rates for the period. 
Financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the
Group’s Balance Sheet when the Group becomes a party to
the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated
at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate
allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified
according to the substance of the contractual
arrangements entered into.  An equity instrument is any
contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of
the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Bank borrowings
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at
the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.  Finance
charges including premiums payable on settlement or
redemption, and direct issue costs are accounted for on an
accruals basis to the Income Statement using the effective
interest method and are added to the carrying amount of
the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the
period in which they arise.
Trade payables
Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at
their nominal value. 
Derivative financial instruments
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial
risks of interest rate and foreign currency transactions, and
it uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its
exposure to these transactional risks.  The Group uses
interest rate swap contracts and foreign exchange forward
contracts to reduce these exposures and does not use
derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.  
Derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value
at the date the derivative contract is entered into and are
revalued at fair value at each Balance Sheet date.  The
method by which any gain or loss is recognised depends on
whether the instrument is designated a hedging instrument
or not.  To be designated as a hedging instrument the
instrument must be documented as such at inception and
must be assessed at inception and on an ongoing basis to
be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or
cash flows of hedged items.
Hedge accounting principles are used for interest rate
swaps and net investment hedges where movements in fair
value are held in equity until such time as the underlying
amounts of the contract mature.  At maturity the amounts
held in equity will be recycled to the Income Statement.
Changes in fair value of any ineffective portion of net
investment hedges and interest rate swaps are recognised
in the Income Statement immediately.
Where derivatives do not meet the criteria for hedge
accounting the changes in fair value are immediately 
CHEMRING GROUP PLC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2007  55 2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES - CONTINUED
recognised in the Income Statement.  The Group does not
apply hedge accounting to the foreign currency forward
contracts to mitigate against currency fluctuations.
Accordingly, gains and losses arising from measuring the
contracts at fair value are recognised immediately in the
Income Statement.
Embedded derivatives that are not closely related to the
host contract are treated as separate derivatives, with
unrealised gains and losses reported in the Income
Statement.
Retirement benefit costs
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit
schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.  For
defined benefit schemes, the cost of providing benefits is
determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with
actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance
sheet date. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full
in the period in which they occur .  They are recognised
outside of the profit or loss and presented in the Statement
of Recognised Income and Expense (SORIE).
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent
that the benefits are already vested, and otherwise is
amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period
until the benefits become vested.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the Balance
Sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit
obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost,
and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.  Any
asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past
service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and
reductions in future contributions to the scheme.
Leased assets
Where the Group enters into a lease which entails taking
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an
asset, the lease is treated as a finance lease.  The asset is
recorded in the Balance Sheet as property, plant and
equipment and is depreciated over the shorter of the
estimated useful economic life and the lease term.  Future
instalments under such leases, net of finance charges, are
included in creditors.  The finance element of the instalments
is charged to the Income Statement at a constant rate of
charge on the remaining balance of the obligation.
All other leases are operating leases and the rental charges
are taken to the Income Statement on a straight-line basis
over the life of the lease.
Share-based compensation
The Group operates equity settled and cash settled share-
based compensation schemes.
For grants made under the Group’s share-based
compensation schemes, the fair value is remeasured at each
balance sheet date with changes in the fair value recognised
in the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the
vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of the shares
that will eventually vest.  The valuation of the options utilises
a methodology based on the Black-Scholes model.
For equity settled share-based grants, the total amount
recognised is based on the fair value of the equity
instrument measured at the date the award is made.  At
each balance sheet date the impact of any revision to
vesting estimates is recognised in the income statement
over the vesting period.  Proceeds received, net of any
directly attributable transaction costs, are credited to share
capital and share premium.
For cash settled share-based grants, the total amount
recognised is based on the fair value of the liability
incurred.  The fair value of the liability is remeasured at
each balance sheet date with changes in the fair value
recognised in the Income Statement for the period.
Post balance sheet events
Following IAS10 Events after the Balance Sheet Date, the
Group continues to disclose events that it considers
material and non-disclosure of which can influence the
economic decisions of users of the financial statements.
Critical accounting judgements and key
sources of estimation uncertainty
When applying the Group’s accounting policies,
management must make assumptions and estimates
concerning the future that affect the carrying amounts of
assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the
amounts of revenue and expenses recognised during the
accounting period.  Such assumptions and estimates are
based upon factors such as historical experience, the
observance of trends in the industries in which the Group
operates, and information available from the Group’s
customers and other outside sources.
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key
sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date
that have a significant risk of causing a material
adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities
within the next financial year include:
56 CHEMRING GROUP PLC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2007
Notes to the Group Financial Statements
(CONTINUED)  CHEMRING GROUP PLC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2007  57
Goodwill
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an
estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units
to which goodwill has been allocated.  The value in use
calculation requires the entity to determine such assets, to
estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the
cash-generating unit and to determine a suitable discount
rate in order to calculate present value.  
Intangible assets acquired in business combinations
Under IFRS3 Business Combinations, it is necessary to
separately identify and value any acquired intangible
assets.  In order to ascertain the values of the separate
assets it is necessary for management to estimate the
future cash flows attributable to the asset and estimate
their useful economic lives.
Pensions
The liability recognised in relation to retirement benefit
obligations is dependent on a number of assumptions,
including discount rate, mortality rate, salary increases and
inflation.  Any change in these assumptions would change
the amount recognised (see Note 34).
Insurance claim
The Group is pursuing a claim against its former insurance
broker , concerning the insurance cover for 
Kilgore Flares Company LLC and the broker’s subsequent
handling of a claim following a manufacturing incident at
Kilgore Flares Company LLC on 18 April 2001.  During the
year the Group incurred costs of £0.4 million 
(2006: £0.1 million) in relation to the claim, which 
were written-off.
The balance of the claim that had not been recovered from
the Group’s former insurance broker at the year end was
£2.4 million ($4.9 million) (2006: £2.6 million 
($4.9 million)), which has been included within other
debtors.  Foreign exchange movements of £0.2 million 
(2006: £0.2 million) have been recognised through the
Statement of Recognised Income and Expense. 58 CHEMRING GROUP PLC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2007

10. EARNINGS PER SHARE
Earnings per share are based on the average number of shares in issue of 32,470,410 (2006: 31,118,719) and profit on ordinary
activities after tax and minority interests of £34.0 million (2006: £21.9 million).  Diluted earnings per share has been calculated
using a diluted average number of shares in issue of 32,678,486 (2006: 31,323,121) and profit on ordinary activities after tax and
minority interests of £34.0 million (2006: £21.9 million).

At 31 October 2007 35.6
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGU are determined from value in use calculations.  The key assumptions for the value in use
calculations are those regarding the discount rates, the growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs
during the period for which management have detailed plans.  Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that
reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGU being measured (the weighted
average cost of capital “WACC”).  The discount rate used is 10.0% (2006: 10.0%). The growth rates are based on a prudent view
of industry growth forecasts adjusted for a premium associated with the high technological nature of the businesses.  A growth
assumption of 2.5% (2006: 2.5%) has been used.  Changes in selling price and direct costs are based on past practices and
expectations of future changes in the market.  The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial
budgets approved by management for the next five years and extrapolates cash flows after that period based on growth as
described above.
Following a detailed review, no impairment losses for continuing operations have been recognised in the year and no prior
impairment losses reversed.
* See Note 32
** In accordance with IFRS3 fair value adjustments have been made within twelve months of the acquisition dates which has resulted in additional goodwill being
recognised in the year (B.D.L. Systems Limited - £1.2 million and Leafield Engineering Limited - £0.1 million). 64 CHEMRING GROUP PLC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2007

All amounts shown above are due within one year .
The average credit period taken on sales of goods, adjusted for Group revenue had the acquisitions taken place on the first day
of the financial year , is 69 days (2006: 60 days).  No interest is charged on the receivables from the date of invoice to payment.
There is no provision for irrecoverable amounts from the sale of goods (2006: nil).
The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair values.
18. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Bank balances and cash comprise cash held by the Group and short term deposits with an original maturity of three months or
less.  The carrying amount of these assets approximates to their fair value.
19. CREDIT AND PRICE RISK
The Group’s principal financial assets are bank balances and cash, and trade and other receivables, which represent the Group’s
maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets.
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.  The amounts presented in the Balance Sheet are net of
allowances for doubtful receivables, based on prior experience and an assessment of the current economic environment.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high
credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.  The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk with
exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
The Group’s price risk is principally in relation to the cost of raw materials and is not considered significant.  Price risk is
managed through negotiations with suppliers and where appropriate the agreement of fixed price supply contracts. 68 CHEMRING GROUP PLC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2007

23. DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Group uses financial instruments to manage financial and commercial risk wherever it is appropriate to do so. 
The main risks addressed by the financial instruments of the Group are interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and liquidity risk.
The Group’s policies in respect of the management of these risks, which remained unchanged throughout the year , were as follows:
Interest rate risk: The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits, bank borrowings and leasing
lines of credit.  The UK borrowings are denominated in sterling, Euro, US dollar and Norwegian Kroner
and are subject to floating rates of interest linked to the Bank of Scotland base rate. In order to protect
against the risk of higher interest rates, the Group has entered into amortising interest rate swaps for at
least 50% of its UK borrowings.  The overseas borrowings are denominated in local currency and are
predominantly subject to fixed rates of interest.
Foreign exchange risk: Foreign exchange risk can be subdivided into two components, transactional risk and translation risk:
Transactional risk – The Group policy is to hedge significant transactional currency exposures via the use
of forward foreign exchange contracts.  The measurement and control of this risk is closely monitored
on a Group-wide basis. 70 CHEMRING GROUP PLC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2007
Notes to the Group Financial Statements
(CONTINUED) 
23. DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS - CONTINUED
Translation risk: The Group translates overseas results and net assets in accordance with the accounting policy in Note 2.
The translation risk on net assets is mitigated by the transfer of currencies between Group companies
and the appropriate use of foreign currency borrowings.
Liquidity risk: Details of the maturity profiles of the Group’s funding can be found in Note 20.
The profile of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities is as follows:

A right of offset exists for currency amounts held within the UK by Bank of Scotland.  These are used to offset the interest
charged on the UK overdraft which bears interest at 1.25% above LIBOR.  Cash at bank and in hand consists primarily of overseas
funds which are used as short term intra-group financing as well as an internal exchange rate hedge.
The weighted average interest rate of fixed rate financial liabilities at 31 October 2007 was 5.7% (2006: 5.8%) and the weighted
average period of funding was five years (2006: five years).
The Group has three amortising interest rate swaps, from floating to fixed rate; one that expires in 2012 at a rate of 4.97%
(sterling), one that expires in 2011 at a rate of 4.88% (US dollars) and one that expires in 2011 at a rate of 4.22% (Euro).  The fair
value of interest rate swaps recognised on the Balance Sheet at 31 October 2007 was £0.6 million (2006: £0.3 million).  The
Group also has four forward exchange contracts with a fair value of £0.3 million asset (2006: £0.1 million liability).  The total of
these financial instruments is £0.9 million (2006: £0.2 million). CHEMRING GROUP PLC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2007  71

outstanding at the end of the year have exercise prices ranging from 436.5p to 1,059.0p.
The compensation expense recognised in respect of share options is based on their fair value at the grant date calculated using
the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
No options were granted during the year .  Assumptions made in calculating the fair values of options granted during the
comparative period were as follows:
2006
Options granted 50,000
Weighted average fair value (pence) 222.0
Weighted average share price (pence) 1,059.0
Weighted average exercise price (pence) 1,059.0
Expected volatility 31%
Expected life 3 years
Risk free interest rate 4.58%
Expected dividend yield 1.96%
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over the previous years.  The
expected life has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions,
and behavioural considerations.
The Group recognised total expenses of £1.4 million (2006: £0.9 million) in respect of share-based payment transactions during
the year .  
Expenses of £1.0 million (2006: £1.3 million) were recognised during the year relating to The Chemring Group Phantom Share
Option Scheme.

The trade and assets of Chemring Nobel AS had a net book value of NOK42.3 million and were acquired for a consideration of
NOK40.5 million (cash NOK37 .2 million and costs of NOK3.3 million).  Negative goodwill of NOK5.0 million (£0.4 million) arose
after fair value adjustments of NOK3.2 million. The negative goodwill has been recognised as exceptional income within the
Income Statement in the year .
Adjustments from book value to fair value arise principally from the application of Group accounting policies and the recognition
of intangible assets under IFRS3 Business Combinations and Fair Value Adjustments to Inventories, Receivables, Property, Plant
and Equipment. Intangible assets relate principally to customer relationships and trademarks (see Note 12).  Fair values relating
to the acquisition of Simmel Difesa S.p.A. and Chemring Nobel AS are provisional and will be finalised within one year of the
acquisition date.
Costs include those legal and accounting costs incurred in developing the acquisition contracts and performing due diligence
activities.
All intangible assets were recognised at their respective fair values.  The residual excess of total cost over the fair value of net
assets acquired is recognised as goodwill in the financial statements.  Goodwill represents the value of synergies and assembled
workforces acquired.
49% of the share capital of Pirotécnia Oroquieta S.L. was acquired on 20 July 2007 for a consideration of d0.5 million 
(£0.3 million) cash.  Chemring Group PLC now holds 100% of the share capital of Pirotécnia Oroquieta S.L.
The acquisitions during the year contributed £20.4 million of revenue and £1.2 million to the Group’s profit before tax for the
period between the date of acquisition and the Balance Sheet date.
If the acquisitions had been completed on the first day of the financial year , Group revenues and profits before tax for continuing
activities for the year would have been approximately £272.5 million and £60.6 million respectively.  This information is not
necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had the operations been acquired at the start of the
year , nor of the future results of the combined operations.  CHEMRING GROUP PLC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2007  77
Prior period Balance Sheet restatement
During the prior year the Group acquired Technical Ordnance, Inc..  The fair value of intangible assets acquired of £6.7 million was
recognised at 30 April 2006 based on provisional values.  The fair values have been finalised since April 2006 and in accordance
with IFRS3 an increase in the fair value of customer relationships of £13.0 million has been made retrospectively.  An adjustment
to goodwill has also been made retrospectively to reflect the adjustment in the fair value.  Goodwill has been decreased by 
£13.0 million.  Amortisation charges on acquired intangible assets for the period to 30 April 2007 are such that the cumulative
amortisation charged is appropriate for the revised fair value of intangible assets.  This is the only adjustment relating to 
prior periods.
33. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

Income Statement, were as follows:

On 30 June 2006, the Group sold its McMurdo Lights business to Daniamant Limited for the sum of £2.8 million.
On 21 December 2006, the Group sold the entire issued share capital of Leafield Marine Limited to the management team for
£0.4 million.
On 5 April 2007 , the Group sold its McMurdo Marine Electronics business to Signature Industries Limited for £2.8 million.  Further
deferred contingent consideration of £1.0 million was agreed in December 2007 , and is payable by the end of February 2008. 
On 18 May 2007 , the Group sold the entire issued share capital of I.C.S. Electronics Limited to the management team for £1.
The loss on disposal in the year ended 31 October 2007 includes £0.7 million in respect of closure provisions, predominantly
relating to leased premises which the Group no longer occupies.
The tax charge for the year of £0.2 million (2006: tax credit of £0.9 million) was higher (2006: lower) than the standard rate of
30% (2006:30%), primarily as a result of the impairment of goodwill which is not deductible for tax purposes.

34. PENSIONS
Within the UK the Group operates two defined benefit schemes, the Chemring Group Staff Pension Scheme (the “Staff Scheme”) and
the Chemring Group Executive Pension Scheme (the “Executive Scheme”), as detailed below.  In Germany, Chemring Defence Germany
GmbH operates a defined benefit scheme (the “CDG Scheme”) and in Norway, Chemring Nobel AS operates a defined benefit scheme
(the “Chemring Nobel Scheme”).  The other UK and overseas arrangements are all defined contribution schemes. 
The Staff Scheme and Executive Scheme are funded schemes and the assets of the schemes are held in separate trustee
administered funds.  Full actuarial valuations for the Staff Scheme and the Executive Scheme as at 6 April 2003 have been
prepared and updated to 31 October 2007 by a qualified actuary, using the projected unit credit method.
The Staff Scheme triennial valuation at 6 April 2006 is in the process of being finalised.  The Executive Scheme triennial
valuation at the same date was signed-off by the trustees and Company on 5 October 2007 .
The CDG Scheme is an unfunded scheme.  The actuarial liability has been calculated at 31 October 2007 by a qualified actuary using
the projected unit credit method.  The main assumptions used were a discount rate of 5.3%, inflation rate of 1.8% and rate of
increase in deferred pensions of 0%.  The net deficit of the CDG Scheme was £0.8 million at 31 October 2007 (2006: £0.9 million).
The Chemring Nobel Scheme is a new scheme established in the year and is an unfunded scheme.  The actuarial liability has
been calculated at 31 October 2007 by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.  The main assumptions used
were a discount rate of 4.5%, inflation rate of 3.1% and rate of increase in deferred pensions of 3.1%.  The net deficit of the
Chemring Nobel Scheme was £1.4 million at 31 October 2007 .

Rate of increase in salaries 4.1 – 4.6% 3.8 – 4.3%
Rate of increase in deferred pensions 3.1% 2.8%
Rate of increase in pensions in payment (where applicable) 2.3% 2.9%
Inflation assumption 3.1% 2.8%
Expected return on scheme assets 6.2% 5.7%
In determining the pension liabilities the Group uses mortality assumptions which are based on published mortality tables.  For
both the Staff and Executive Schemes the actuarial table currently used is PA92(YOB)MC+1.
The assumption considered to be the most significant is the discount rate adopted.  If the discount rate in the schemes were to
change by 0.1% then it is predicted that the deficit in the schemes would change by approximately £1.0 million.
The Group anticipates contributions to the schemes for the year ending 31 October 2008 will be £1.7 million.
35. SELF INSURANCE
The Group is self insured through its captive insurance company CHG Insurance Limited, based in Guernsey.  The Group has been
self insured for the first £2.5 million of material damage and business interruption cover , subject to a maximum liability of 
£3.5 million in any one year , since 31 October 2001.  Insurance cover in respect of this risk at a level over that disclosed here is
placed with external insurers.
36. SIMMEL DIFESA S.P .A. INCIDENT
On 9 October 2007 , the Group announced that an incident had occurred at its Simmel Difesa S.p.A.  factory in Colleferro, Italy.  
The Group launched a full and immediate investigation into the nature of the incident.  Further information on the implications of
this will be provided when the investigation has been completed.
Simmel Difesa S.p.A. expects to recover its material damage and business interruption losses through insurance policies in place
in Italy.  Consequently, the Group does not anticipate that a claim will be made on its captive insurance company. CHEMRING GROUP PLC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2007  81

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT TO
THE MEMBERS OF CHEMRING GROUP PLC
We have audited the parent company financial statements of
Chemring Group PLC for the year ended 31 October 2007
which comprise the Balance Sheet, the Statement of Total
Recognised Gains and Losses, the Reconciliation of
Movements in Shareholders’ Funds and the related Notes 1 to
12.  These parent company financial statements have been
prepared under the accounting policies set out therein.
We have reported separately on the Group financial
statements of Chemring Group PLC for the year ended 
31 October 2007 and on the information in the Directors’
Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.  
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a
body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act
1985.  Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might
state to the Company’s members those matters we are
required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no
other purpose.  To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do
not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the
Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and
auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual
report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the parent
company financial statements in accordance with applicable
law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are set
out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities in the
Directors’ Report.
Our responsibility is to audit the parent company financial
statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration
Report to be audited in accordance with relevant legal and
regulatory requirements and International Standards on
Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the parent
company financial statements give a true and fair view and
whether the parent company financial statements have
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies
Act 1985. We also report to you whether in our opinion the
Directors’ Report is consistent with the parent company
financial statements.  The information given in the
Directors’ Report includes that specific information
presented in the Statement by the Chairman, the Review by
the Chief Executive and the Review by the Finance Director
that is cross referred from the Review of the year and
results section of the Directors’ Report. 
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has
not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all
the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if
information specified by law regarding directors' remuneration
and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the annual
report as described in the contents section and consider
whether it is consistent with the audited parent company
financial statements. We consider the implications for our
report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements
or material inconsistencies with the parent company
financial statements.  Our responsibilities do not extend to
any further information outside the annual report. 
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the
Auditing Practices Board.  An audit includes examination, on
a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and
disclosures in the individual company financial statements.  It
also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and
judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the
individual company financial statements, and of whether the
accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered
necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to
give reasonable assurance that the parent company
financial statements are free from material misstatement,
whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error .  In
forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy
of the presentation of information in the parent company
financial statements.

The financial statements are prepared under the historical
cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of property,
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and applicable
accounting standards (UK GAAP).
Revenue recognition
Interest income is accrued on a time basis by reference to
the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate
applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts
estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of
the financial asset to its net carrying amount.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the
shareholder’s rights to receive payment have been
established.
Tangible fixed assets
Other than revalued land and buildings, property, plant and
equipment are held at cost less accumulated depreciation
and any recognised impairment loss.  No depreciation is
provided on freehold land.  On other assets depreciation is
provided at rates calculated to write down their cost or
valuation to their estimated residual values by equal
instalments over their estimated economic useful lives,
which are considered to be:
Freehold buildings - up to 50 years
Leasehold buildings - the period of the lease
Plant and equipment - 10 years
Investment in Group undertakings
Investments are stated at cost less any provision for
impairment in value.
Operating leases
Operating lease rental charges are taken to the profit and
loss account on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
Provisions
A provision is recognised when the Company has a present
legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event 
and it is probable that settlement will be required of an
amount that can be reliably estimated.  Long term liabilities
and provisions are discounted when the impact is material.
Current tax
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is
provided for at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered)
using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted, or
substantially enacted, by the Balance Sheet date.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is provided in full at the anticipated tax rates
on differences arising from the inclusion of items of income
and expenditure in tax computations in periods different
from those in which they are included in the financial
statements.  Deferred tax is not provided on timing
differences arising from the revaluation of fixed assets
where there is no commitment to sell the asset.  Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Special capital reserve
The special capital reserve was created as part of a capital
reduction scheme involving the cancellation of the share
premium account which was approved by the Court in 1986
and is in accordance with the requirements of the
Companies Act 1985.
Foreign currencies
The functional currency of the Company is sterling.
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into
sterling at the rates ruling at the date of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies at the Balance Sheet date are translated at the
rates ruling at that date.  These translation differences are
dealt with in the profit and loss account.
Pensions
The Company operates defined benefit pension schemes.
The defined benefit schemes are multi-employer schemes
including employees of other Group companies. It is not
considered possible to allocate scheme assets and liabilities
between the various companies and accordingly schemes
are accounted for as though they were defined contribution
schemes.  The amount charged to the profit and loss
account is the contribution payable in the year .  Differences
between amounts payable and actually paid are shown as
accruals or prepayments in the Balance Sheet.
Notes to the Parent Company Financial Statements CHEMRING GROUP PLC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2007  87
Share-based compensation
For grants made under the Company’s share-based remuneration schemes, amounts which reflect the fair value of options
awarded at the time of grant are charged to the profit and loss account.  The valuation of the options utilises a methodology
based on the Black-Scholes model.

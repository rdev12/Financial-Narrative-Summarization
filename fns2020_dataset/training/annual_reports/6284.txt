† Chairman of the remuneration and nominations committee and member 
of the audit committee. In the continuing difficult market conditions of low demand and severe price pressure prevailing in
commercial print, the group’s performance, achieving an increase in pre-tax profit before exceptionals for
the year ended 31 December 2002, is particularly creditable.
The figures in this paragraph disregard the exceptional items referred to below. Turnover for the year
increased by 4.6% to £41.58m from £39.74m. Operating profit increased by 2.9% to £3.85m (2001:
£3.74m), representing an operating margin of 9.3% (2001: 9.4%). Pre-tax profit was up 4.6% at £3.01m
(2001: £2.88m), representing a pre-tax margin of 7.2% (2001: 7.2%). Earnings per share increased to 
7.3p from 6.6p (restated for the implementation of FRS19 relating to deferred taxation). 
The £1.07m exceptional charge relates to the relocation and rationalisation during May 2002 of W E Baxter
and to the closure in June 2002 of Lasercraft. The £2.98m exceptional charge in 2001 related to the
disposal of The Box Room business and comprised a £0.73m provision for loss on disposal and £2.25m
goodwill previously written off to reserves.
After exceptionals, the pre-tax result was a profit of £1.95m (2001: loss of £0.10m) and earnings per 
share were 4.6p (2001: loss per share of 3.0p).
Year end equity shareholders’ funds were £23.75m (2001: £23.90m, as restated), giving net assets per
share of 85.7p (2001: 86.3p). Year end net indebtedness increased to £16.7m (2001: £13.3m), with
resultant gearing of 70% (2001: 56%), reflecting capital expenditure of £4.1m (2001: £1.2m), and 
financing of the Quadracolor acquisition. Net interest payable of £0.84m (2001: £0.86m) was covered 
4.6 times (2001: 4.4 times) by operating profit before exceptionals.
Our commercial printing businesses overall increased sales by 6% in the year. However, this increase
results solely from the acquisition of Quadracolor on 31 January 2002, without which sales of commercial 
print would have declined by 15%, reflecting the intense price pressures and weak demand in the industry.
The excellent quality of the work produced by our group has once again been recognised in the 
PrintWeek magazine awards with Fulmar Colour winning the Fine Art category.
The group’s book printing businesses have continued to prosper, increasing turnover by 29%.
Prolonged periods of intense competition only serve to increase the pressures on our staff. I am pleased to
take this opportunity to thank them for their commitment and congratulate them on their awards success.
The directors are recommending an unchanged final dividend of 3.4p per share, giving unchanged total
dividends for the year of 5.2p per share, which, if approved at the AGM on 12 May 2003, will be paid on
19 May 2003 to those shareholders on the register at the close of business on 11 April 2003.
While our commercial operations continue to suffer the effects of weak demand, our book-related
businesses are performing well. We anticipate that these circumstances will continue for the year ahead
and, given the group’s ability to perform in difficult markets, we remain cautiously optimistic, with the
company well positioned to benefit from any upturn in demand for commercial print.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
FULMAR plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2002 3 COMMERCIAL PRINTING
Following the acquisition of Quadracolor our commercial printing operations now account for 67% of
group turnover. This sector of our industry, which incorporates marketing literature, corporate brochures
and annual reports, has suffered from continuing weakness in demand and over capacity, resulting in
severe price pressure.
In May 2002, W E Baxter was reorganised and relocated from Lewes in East Sussex to Mitcham, 
near to the group’s operations in Croydon, into previously empty premises already leased by the group.
This move has allowed W E Baxter to source its pre-press and finishing requirements from other group
companies, rather than performing these services in-house, thereby improving group operational
efficiency. Whilst we have retained the paper-over-board ring binder production, Baxter’s PVC ring 
binder operation was closed and the company’s operating costs significantly reduced. The Lewes
freehold premises vacated by W E Baxter are being offered for sale.
On 31 January 2002, the group acquired Quadracolor, a commercial printing operation similar to the
group’s existing businesses but with little client overlap, and Quadracolor Graphics, its pre-press
operation. These businesses were well equipped, using solely Heidelberg printing presses and benefiting
from electronic pre-press and direct-to-plate technology. The companies operate from freehold premises
of 27,000 sq ft situated in Sydenham, South London. The initial consideration was £2.0m and, in
addition, contingent consideration of up to £1.0m may be payable, subject to performance.  
Fulmar Colour took delivery in June 2002 of the first of two 12 colour Heidelberg presses, capable of
printing high quality work in up to 6 colours both sides of a sheet in one pass. The company has derived
significant productivity advantages since completion of the installation late in August. The second press
was installed successfully after the year end. Both presses, installed at a total cost of £4.0m, are now
operating on a 24 hour shift system. Fulmar has introduced a solvent recycling system in conjunction
with these presses to significantly reduce consumption. This is part of the company’s environmental
programme leading to ISO 14001 accreditation.  
BOOK PRINTING
The group’s book cover, jacket and paperback book printing operations, which accounted for 28% 
of group turnover, continued to trade well, increasing turnover by 29%.
The group’s book cover and jacket printer, White Quill, increased turnover by 10% as it continued to
benefit from increasing demand from Bookmarque, the group’s mass market paperback book printing
business. In addition, at the beginning of 2002, a five year supply agreement was signed with the
company’s largest customer. In the first half of the year, permanent 24 hour working was introduced in
pre-press, printing and finishing, thereby significantly reducing the time required to produce covers and
jackets to meet customers’ just-in-time requirements.

with the productivity benefits of printing 6 colours

BOOK PRINTING CONTINUED
Bookmarque, whose state-of-the-art operations were commissioned in July 2000, achieved an increase
in turnover of 97% and in December 2002 signed a supply contract with its largest customer for a four
year period providing a 50% increase in volume over their prior agreement. No significant further capital
investment is anticipated at present as the increasing volumes are being achieved using existing
equipment with 24 hour operation.
The growth in orders for paperback covers, deriving from the rapid expansion of Bookmarque, has
required some expenditure on additional equipment within Orion, the group’s specialist finishing
operation. A fourth Geitz foil blocking machine and a second Topspot UV varnishing machine were
installed during the year at a cost of £0.7m. This investment has been supplemented with additional
24 hour working.
The group has also installed equipment for the production of Cyrel UV varnishing plates and foiling 
and embossing dies. For an investment of £0.1m, and in furtherance of the group’s strategy of pursuing
added value, we have ensured that supplies necessary for the rapid production of jackets and covers
are secured.
SPECIALIST OPERATIONS
Specialist operations principally comprise Royle Financial Print. This category’s share of group turnover
reduced to 5%. 
The well publicised lack of activity in City financial markets resulted in a 17% reduction in turnover 
at Royle Financial Print. We do not anticipate any upturn in this market in the near future.
After the year end, the vacant premises in Tamworth, owned by the group and previously occupied 
by The Box Room, were sold for £2.1m, achieving a small profit on sale.
OUTLOOK
Our book-related businesses continue to perform well and we anticipate further growth this year. 
The market for commercial print remains subdued and the pre-existing overcapacity has resulted in
severe price weakness. We do not expect that either of these situations will alter during the year but 
the group’s well organised and efficient businesses remain well placed to compete in these difficult
trading conditions.

EMPLOYMENT POLICIES
The group is committed to the recruitment and employment of people on merit, irrespective of race or
gender. The group also makes every effort to ensure that disabled people receive equal opportunities
and are not discriminated against on the grounds of their disabilities.
HEALTH, SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES
Great importance is attached to health, safety and the environment and the group has a strong culture
of proactive management, reinforced by regular internal monitoring and support at executive level. 
This is supported by the group’s health and safety and environmental policies.
CHARITABLE DONATIONS
The group made charitable donations of £2,000 during the year (2001 – £2,000).
SUPPLIERS’ PAYMENT
The group’s payment policy is in accordance with terms that are agreed with individual suppliers.
Creditor days at 31 December 2002 amounted to 77 days (2001 – 70 days).
The company only incurs administrative expenses and the creditor days amounted to 60 days 
(2001 – 54 days).
GOING CONCERN STATEMENT
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the group has adequate
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, the directors
continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
Shareholders will find on pages 40 to 42 the notice of the forthcoming annual general meeting of the
company to be held on 12 May 2003. 
In addition to the ordinary business of the meeting, three resolutions (numbered 6 to 8) are proposed as
special business.
AUTHORITY OF DIRECTORS TO ALLOT SHARES
Resolutions 6 and 7 are similar to the authorities given to the directors at the last annual general meeting
of the company.
By law, directors are not permitted to allot new shares (or to grant rights over shares) unless authorised
to do so by shareholders. In addition, directors require specific authority from shareholders before
allotting new shares (or rights in respect of shares) for cash without first offering them to existing
shareholders in proportion to their holdings.
Resolution 6 gives the directors the necessary authority for the period of five years from the date of the
passing of such resolution to allot shares up to an aggregate nominal amount of £461,734 (being equal
to approximately one-third of the issued share capital of the company). 
Resolution 7 empowers the directors, for the period of five years from the date of the passing of such
resolution, to allot shares for cash otherwise than to existing shareholders on a pro-rata basis, up to an
aggregate nominal amount of £69,260, which is the equivalent of 5% of the issued share capital of the
company. It also enables the directors, in the case of an issue by way of rights, to deal with fractional
entitlements and to make such exclusions or other arrangements as may be appropriate to resolve legal,
regulatory or practical problems which might arise, particularly with regard to overseas shareholders.
It is intended that these authorities are renewed at successive annual general meetings. 10 FULMAR plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2002
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING CONTINUED
PURCHASE OF OWN SHARES 
Resolution 8 renews the authority for the company to make market purchases (within the meaning 
of section 163 of the Companies Act 1985) on the London Stock Exchange up to an aggregate of
2,770,405 ordinary shares (equivalent to 10% of the issued share capital of the company) at a minimum
price per ordinary share of 5p and a maximum of 105% of the average of the middle market quotations
of the ordinary shares as derived from the London Stock Exchange Daily Official List for the five business
days immediately preceding the day on which that ordinary share is contracted to be purchased.
This proposal should not be taken as an indication that the company will purchase shares at any
particular price or indeed at all, and the directors will only consider making purchases if they believe 
that such purchases would result in an increase in earnings per share and are in the best interests 
of the shareholders.
The authority will expire at the conclusion of the next annual general meeting of the company, or, 
if earlier, the expiry of 15 months from the date of the passing of such resolution.
AUDITORS
A resolution for the reappointment of Deloitte & Touche as auditors of the company is to be proposed 
at the forthcoming annual general meeting.
Approved by the board of directors and signed on behalf of the board.

27 MARCH 2003
DIRECTORS’ REPORT FULMAR plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2002 11
The directors fully support the Principles of Good Governance and the Code of Best Practice (the
“Combined Code”). The board sets out its report on how the group has applied the principles and
whether it has complied with the Combined Code during the year. 
APPLICATION OF THE PRINCIPLES
DIRECTORS
The board comprised three executive and two independent non-executive directors at the year end, 
and met on eight occasions in 2002 following a formal agenda. 
Directors’ biographies are given on page 2.
The separate roles of Chairman and Chief Executive are clearly defined. The Chairman conducts board
and shareholder meetings and ensures that all directors are properly briefed. The Chief Executive is
responsible for developing and co-ordinating the business and implementing group strategy.
There is an agreed procedure for the directors to take independent professional advice at the company’s
expense, to have access to the Company Secretary and receive appropriate training where necessary.
All directors are required to retire by rotation at least every three years when they can offer themselves
for re-election if eligible.
The remuneration and nominations committee monitors, reviews and makes recommendations to the
board on all elements of the remuneration of the directors of the company. It also considers the award 
of options under the company share option plan and makes recommendations to the board in respect 
of the appointment of directors of the company. It consists solely of non-executive directors. The report
on remuneration is set out on page 14.
RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS 
The company encourages meaningful dialogue with both its institutional and private investors. The
executive directors undertake presentations following the announcement of the interim and final results,
and the directors are available for comment throughout the year and at the annual general meeting.
ACCOUNTABILITY AND AUDIT 
The responsibilities of the directors and auditors are set out on pages 13 and 16.
The board has established the necessary procedures to implement the guidance for directors on the
Combined Code issued by the Turnbull committee in 1999. These have been in place throughout 2002
and up to the date of approval of the financial statements.
The board of directors has overall responsibility for the group’s systems of internal control and reviewed
them for their effectiveness during the year. Any system of internal control can only provide reasonable
but not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 12 FULMAR plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2002
APPLICATION OF THE PRINCIPLES CONTINUED
ACCOUNTABILITY AND AUDIT CONTINUED
The principal components of the systems for planning, executing, controlling and monitoring the group’s
activities in order to achieve its objectives and minimise major risks are:
• an organisational structure with defined lines of responsibility and delegation of authority;
• a comprehensive budgeting and financial reporting system which enables the board to evaluate the
performance of the group on a monthly basis and take action where necessary on a timely basis;
• continual review and development of the group’s internal control, risk management and management
information systems;
• clearly defined guidelines for capital investment.
Steps continue to be taken to further embed internal control and risk management procedures into the
operations of the business and to deal with areas of improvement which come to management’s and the
board’s attention.
The board has reviewed the need for an internal audit function but does not consider it necessary at the
current time.
The audit committee assists the board in discharging its duty to ensure that the financial statements
presented by the company to its shareholders conform with all legal requirements and that the group’s
systems of internal control are adequate. It considers the continuing appointment of auditors, their fees,
and the scope and findings of their audit. It consists solely of non-executive directors. 
An account of the group’s position and prospects is given in the Chairman’s Statement and Chief
Executive’s Review on pages 3 to 6.
COMPLIANCE STATEMENT
The directors confirm that the company has complied with the provisions of Section 1 of the Combined
Code with the following exception (the relevant provision is shown in brackets):
• throughout the year the audit committee only comprised two non-executive directors rather than
three (D.3.1). The directors believe that two such directors are sufficient given the relative size of 
the group.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE United Kingdom company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial
year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and the group as at the end 
of the financial year and of the profit or loss of the group for that period. In preparing those financial
statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable
accuracy at any time the financial position of the company and to enable them to ensure that the
financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for the system 
of internal control, for safeguarding the assets of the company and hence for taking reasonable steps 
for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
FULMAR plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2002 13 The Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 require the auditors to report to the company’s
members on the ‘auditable part’ of the directors’ remuneration report and to state whether in their
opinion that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985
(as amended by the Regulations). All information relating to the ‘auditable part’ of the report is shown in
note 5 to the accounts. In all other respects the report contains unaudited information.
Information about the emoluments and share options of the directors is given in note 5 to the accounts.
Their interests in the share capital of the company are shown on page 8.
The remuneration policy for executive directors is controlled by the remuneration and nominations
committee of the board comprising the independent non-executive directors, D H O’Shaughnessy and 
J D Dutton. Their aim is to ensure that the remuneration packages for executive directors are designed
to attract, motivate and retain high quality individuals. The packages reflect the executives’ own
responsibilities and the performance of the group as a whole.
The remuneration policy is as follows:
• competitive salaries are provided by reference to information on similar positions in the printing 
and related industries;
• each executive director will receive an annual bonus if the percentage increase in the group’s
earnings per share in that year exceeds a threshold of the percentage increase in the retail price
index in that period plus 3%, such bonus to be at a rate of 1.5% of the executive director’s basic
salary for each 1% that the earnings per share exceeds the threshold;
• where circumstances exist beyond the scope of the policy (such as negative earnings per share 
in the prior year), the remuneration and nominations committee will use its discretion to determine
whether any bonus is payable and, if so, the amount of such bonus. In forming its view, the
committee will take account of the bonus arrangements set out in the directors’ contracts;
• the company makes fixed payments into the group’s main defined contribution pension scheme
having taken account of the level of basic salary;
• directors may be granted options under the share option plan and hold options under the 
sharesave scheme;
• a benefits package is provided including an appropriate company car, or alternative, and medical
expense and permanent health insurances;
• service contracts are of two years duration and are terminable by not less than two years notice 
by either party. Whilst the committee acknowledges that there is a case for setting one year notice
and contract periods, the committee considers the current arrangements to be in the best interests
of the group in maintaining services of its key directors. Any compensation payments will be
determined having regard to the particular circumstances of the case.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined by the board as a whole in line with fees
paid to non-executive directors of similar companies. They are appointed under fixed term contracts of
two years duration and are terminable by not less than one years notice by either party.
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
14 FULMAR plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2002 D J Harris, who retires and offers himself for re-election, is engaged under a service contract which is
terminable by not less than two years notice by either party.

The committee also approves the terms, conditions and allocation of the company share option and
sharesave schemes. Options are granted under the schemes in phases to offer long term incentives 
to the group’s employees (including the company’s directors who participate with the other employees)
and to allow them to have a stake in its growth.

comprise the consolidated profit and loss account, the consolidated statement of total recognised gains
and losses, the balance sheets, the consolidated cash flow statement and the related notes 1 to 26.
These financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. We have
also audited the information in the part of the directors’ remuneration report that is described as having
been audited.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the
Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s
members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose.
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than
the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the
opinions we have formed.
RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS AND AUDITORS 
As described in the statement of directors’ responsibilities, the company’s directors are responsible for
the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and
accounting standards. They are also responsible for the preparation of the other information contained 
in the annual report including the directors’ remuneration report. Our responsibility is to audit the 
financial statements and that part of the directors’ remuneration report described as having been audited
in accordance with relevant United Kingdom legal and regulatory requirements and auditing standards. 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and
whether the financial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report described as having
been audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report
to you if, in our opinion, the directors’ report is not consistent with the financial statements, if the
company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and
explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration
and transactions with the company and other members of the group is not disclosed.
We review whether the corporate governance statement reflects the company’s compliance with the
seven provisions of the Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial
Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required to consider whether the board’s
statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of 
the group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the directors’ report and the other information contained in the annual report for the above year

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT 
TO THE MEMBERS OF FULMAR PLC
16 FULMAR plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2002 BASIS OF AUDIT OPINION 
We conducted our audit in accordance with United Kingdom auditing standards issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts 
and disclosures in the financial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report described
as having been audited. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements
made by the directors in the preparation of the financial statements and of whether the accounting
policies are appropriate to the circumstances of the company and the group, consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we
considered necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that
the financial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report described as having been
audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In
forming our opinion, we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the
financial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report described as having been audited.
OPINION
In our opinion the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and
the group as at 31 December 2002 and of the profit of the group for the year then ended and the
financial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report described as having been audited
have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

CONSOLIDATED CASH FLOW STATEMENT 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The financial statements are prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards. The particular accounting policies
adopted are described below.
ACCOUNTING CONVENTION
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention.
BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
The group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the company and its subsidiary undertakings for all 
financial periods ended 31 December, except that subsidiaries held exclusively with a view to subsequent resale are excluded from
consolidation. For acquisitions made in the year the acquisition method of accounting is used. The results of subsidiaries are 
included in the consolidated profit and loss account from the date of acquisition.
GOODWILL
Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the separable net assets acquired. 
For acquisitions made before 1998 goodwill has been eliminated against the consolidated profit and loss account reserve as a matter
of accounting policy. This goodwill would be charged in the consolidated profit and loss account on subsequent disposal of the
businesses to which it related. Goodwill arising on future acquisitions will be capitalised and written off over its estimated useful life.
TANGIBLE FIXED ASSETS
No depreciation is provided on freehold land or assets in the course of construction. On other assets depreciation is provided on 
cost or net book value in order to write off the cost less residual value over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The rates of
depreciation are as follows:
• Freehold buildings and long leasehold land and buildings – 2% per annum
• Short leasehold land and buildings – over the term of the lease
• Plant and machinery – 10 – 25% per annum
• Motor vehicles – 20% per annum
• Fixtures, fittings and equipment – 10 – 25% per annum.
The group capitalises directly attributable interest on all tangible fixed assets in the course of construction. Rates of capitalisation
depend on whether a specific loan has been taken out (when the actual interest rate and interest paid is used), or where the
construction is financed by general borrowings (when a weighted average rate is calculated on all non-specific borrowings).
INVESTMENTS
Shares in group companies are stated in the parent company balance sheet at cost less provision for any impairment in value.
STOCKS
Stocks and work-in-progress are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost includes materials, direct labour and
appropriate production overheads.
DEFERRED TAXATION
The group has adopted Financial Reporting Standard 19, ‘‘Deferred Tax”. Deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences which
result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to
apply when they crystallise based on current tax rates and law. Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and
expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from those in which they are included in financial statements. Deferred tax 
is not provided on timing differences arising from the revaluation of fixed assets where there is no commitment to sell the asset.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered. Deferred 
tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The group manages its financial risks using a limited number of financial instruments. These comprise cash and money market
deposits, bank loans and overdrafts, finance leases and other debtors and creditors arising directly from operations. The group 
does not undertake any trading in financial instruments.
NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2002
FULMAR plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2002 23 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
LEASES AND HIRE PURCHASE CONTRACTS
Assets obtained under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised at their fair value on acquisition and depreciated 
over their estimated useful lives. The finance charges are allocated over the period of the lease in proportion to the capital element
outstanding.
Operating lease rentals are charged to income in equal annual amounts over the lease term.
PENSION COSTS
For the defined benefit scheme the expected cost of providing pensions, as calculated periodically by professionally qualified
actuaries, is charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost over the service lives of the scheme members in 
such a way that the pension cost is a substantially level percentage of current and expected future pensionable payroll.
Payments to the defined contribution schemes are charged to the profit and loss account in the period to which they relate.
ASSETS AWAITING DISPOSAL
Assets awaiting disposal are reclassified from fixed assets to current assets and carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
2. TURNOVER
Turnover represents amounts derived from the provision of goods and services which fall within the group’s ordinary activities after
deduction of trade discounts and value added tax. The turnover and pre-tax profit/(loss), all of which arises in the United Kingdom, 
is attributable to the group’s principal activity.

Current tax charge for the year (354) (331)
Deferred tax has not been provided in respect of gains realised that have been rolled over into the acquisition cost of replacement
assets. This tax will become payable if the replacement assets are sold and further rollover relief is not obtained. The estimated
amount of tax that would become payable by the company and the group in these circumstances is £167,000 (2001 – £167,000).
Group deferred tax assets of £447,000 (2001 – £478,000) and £1,330,000 (2001 – £1,330,000) (company £ nil (2001 – £ nil) 
and £868,000 (2001 – £868,000)) have not been recognised in respect of timing differences relating to revenue losses and capital
losses respectively as there is insufficient evidence that the assets will be recovered due to the uncertainty of the availability of
future profits against which the losses can be recovered.

The group’s banking facilities are secured by legal charges over the assets of the group. The bank loans not wholly payable within
five years are repayable by monthly or quarterly installments, and bear interest at 1% or 1.1% over the banks’ base rate.
The parent company has guaranteed the bank loans, overdrafts and obligations under finance leases and hire purchase contracts
of the subsidiaries. The extent of this liability at the balance sheet date was £9,215,000 (2001 – £8,839,000). However, the
directors consider it to be highly improbable that any liability will crystallise.
17. PROVISIONS FOR LIABILITIES AND CHARGES
Deferred tax
The group’s policy for accounting for deferred tax has changed to take into account the new accounting standard FRS19 
“Deferred Tax” and the comparative figures for tax on profit on ordinary activities and the deferred tax provision have been restated.
As a result of the change in accounting policy and the prior period adjustment, profit after tax has decreased by £307,000 
(2001 - £446,000).
The provision for deferred tax is as follows:

20. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The group finances its operations with a combination of retained profits and borrowings. Short term flexibility is achieved by the use
of overdraft facilities.
The group has no financial assets other than an immaterial amount of cash at bank. All financial assets and liabilities are in sterling. 
The interest rate profile of the financial liabilities of the group is set out below:
2002 2001
£000 £000
At floating interest rates 16,671 12,850
At fixed interest rates 66 441
Total 16,737 13,291
Weighted average fixed rate 8.0% 8.0%
Weighted average time fixed 0 years 1 year
The benchmark rate for determining interest payments on the financial liabilities at floating interest rates is bank base rate.
The group has no undrawn committed borrowing facilities (2001 – undrawn loan facility of £1.3 million expiring in 2003).
There are no material differences between fair and book values of financial instruments on a discounted cash flow basis.
Short term debtors and creditors (other than borrowings) have been excluded from disclosure.

22. PENSION SCHEMES
The group operates a number of funded pension schemes which are administered independently of the group’s finances. 
The schemes covering the largest number of employees are of the defined contribution type. The group also operates a defined
benefit scheme.
The pension cost of the defined benefit scheme is assessed in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries using the attained
age method. The main actuarial assumptions used in the most recent formal valuation were:
• an investment return of 9% per annum
• salary increases of 8% per annum
• pension accrued before 1 April 1988: no increase per annum on non-GMP
• pension accrued between 1 April 1988 and 6 April 1997: 3% increase per annum on non-GMP
• pension accrued post 6 April 1997: 4.5% increase per annum.
The contribution levels are maintained in accordance with the advice of the pension scheme’s actuarial advisors at 9.6%.
The most recent formal valuation was at 1 April 1999. At that date the market value of the scheme’s assets was £5.66 million and
the actuarial valuation of the assets was sufficient to cover 113% of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for
expected future increases in earnings. The scheme also met the Minimum Funding Requirement set out in the Pensions Act 1995.
As required by SSAP 24, the figures included in the accounts in respect of the group’s defined benefit scheme are based on an
actuarial valuation carried out at 1 April 1999. This does not take into account any impact of the fall in the general stock market
values since that date. Any such impact will be reflected in the next SSAP 24 triennial valuation as at 1 April 2002 based upon
which subsequent pension costs will be determined until the adoption of FRS 17.
The disclosures required by Financial Reporting Standard 17, Retirement Benefits, are set out below; the scheme assets are valued
at market value and the liabilities are estimated by an actuary using the projected unit method. The financial assumptions used to
calculate the scheme liabilities by the actuary under FRS17 are:
2002 2001
% %
Discount rate 5.50 6.00
Inflation rate 2.50 2.75
Salary increases 2.50 4.50

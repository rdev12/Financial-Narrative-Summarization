Financial Highlights 2George Wimpey Plc Annual Report 2003
continuing the organic
growth of Morrison Homes 
achieving industry leading
standards of quality and
customer satisfaction
The Chief Executive’s Report
sets out on pages 4-6 how we
will develop these strategies
further this year to ensure we
continue to deliver the long
term growth that we aim for.
Group Results
Building on the outstanding
results in 2002, the Group’s
performance has yet again seen
substantial further progress in
2003. Group turnover rose by
11% to £2,879 million and, on
the back of sharply improved
margins, Group proﬁt before tax
and exceptionals rose by 30% to
£378 million. Earnings per share
rose by 31% to 68.5p per share.
As we announced at the 
time of our Interim results 
in July, the Board has adopted
a strategy of enhanced
dividend growth.This reﬂects
the conﬁdence we have that
the underlying performance 
of our Company has been
fundamentally transformed.
Over time, we will look to
reduce the currently high 
level of dividend cover, but 
at the same time ensure we
maintain a prudent balance
sheet.The Board is therefore
recommending an increase 
Three years ago I wrote 
“We are in the process of
creating a new Company 
with renewed emphasis 
on shareholder value” .
Since writing the 2000 Annual
Report we have transformed
the structure of our business,
our financial results have
improved to be amongst 
the best in our sector and we
have consistently delivered
industry leading growth 
in earnings and returns for 
our shareholders.
This year, we have achieved
that success and created 
a strong business through
implementing the four 
distinct strategies, set out in 
last year’s Annual Report:
increasing margins in our
core UK business
developing our premium
business, Laing Homes
in the ﬁnal dividend of 43% to
8.45 pence per share, bringing
the total for the year to 12.25
pence, a rise of 35% on 2002.
The dividend cover has been
reduced to 5.6 times, providing
the capacity for the Board 
to increase dividends at a
somewhat faster rate than
earnings in the coming years,
if that is appropriate.
The Board
During the year the Board 
has continued to play an 
active and supportive role in
our operational businesses.
We continue to place great
importance on ensuring we
have a balance of knowledge
and experience and that this
meets the requirements of 
our operating companies.
In October, we welcomed
Brenda Dean, Baroness Dean 
of Thornton-le-Fylde, as a 
Non Executive Director. Brenda
is an active member of the
House of Lords and brings
considerable knowledge 
of the public sector to 
the Board at a time when
Government has an 
increasing impact on our
business. Brenda retired 
as Chairman of the Housing
Corporation during 2003,
a position which has given 
her a wealth of knowledge
which will be of value to 
the Company.
Achieving real leadership 
in our sector
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
JOHN ROBINSON George Wimpey Plc Annual Report 2003 3
During 2003 we have 
further developed our
commitment to Corporate
Social Responsibility and
sustainability. We established 
a new CSR Board Committee,
chaired by Christine Cross.
The Committee met twice
during the second half of 
2003 and will establish,
monitor and review CSR
activities to ensure that our
businesses are constantly
working to improve their
performance in this area.
A separate CSR Report has
again been published to
accompany this Annual
Report. It sets out in detail 
our CSR activities and reports
on the targets identified 
last year for the key areas 
of impact of our business.
Government
During the year the
Government has introduced 
In October we also announced
that Keith Cushen would be
retiring from the Board at the
end of 2003. Keith has played
a major role in the trans-
formation of this business over
the past three years. On behalf
of the Board I would like 
to express our thanks and
appreciation for the enormous
contribution he has made to
George Wimpey in his almost
20 years of service at local,
national and Board level.
Corporate Governance and
Corporate Social Responsibility
We aim to achieve the highest
standards of corporate
governance and once again,
I am pleased to report that the
Board operated throughout
the year in full compliance
with the Combined Code 
on Corporate Governance.
The Board has reviewed the
new Combined Code which
applies to listed companies with
reporting years commencing
on or after 1 November 2003.
We feel that we already 
operate in substantial
compliance with the new 
Code but, following a review,
new procedures and changes
have been implemented.We
have included a number of
additional disclosures in this
Report that the new Code 
does not require to be made
until our 2004 Report.
several initiatives that aim 
to improve the supply of
housing and create a more
stable housing environment.
We welcome these initiatives 
and have taken part in the
consultation processes that 
are aimed at ensuring a
constructive debate on
housing.We are all too aware
that Government policy can
have consequences other 
than those intended, and will
respond directly to policy
statements, as well as through
the Housebuilders Federation
and the CBI.
Employees 
During this year I have been
fortunate to spend a greater
amount of time in our regional
businesses in both the UK and
the US, meeting employees
out on our sites and in our
ofﬁces. I am always impressed
by the pride they have in 
their businesses and their
continuing dedication 
and enthusiasm to ensure
George Wimpey is truly
successful. Once again, on
behalf of the Board I am
delighted to be able to thank
them for all their hard work.
Outlook
Across our businesses we
entered 2004 with strong
order books and our 
markets in the UK and the 
US remain healthy.
Our continuing focus on 
costs and emphasis on 
buying land on improved
terms is aimed at sustaining
the improvement we have
made in our operating
margins. We have a strong
business and have developed
our strategy seeking to 
deliver continuous proﬁt
growth based on our existing
strengths and not by relying 
on external conditions.
The Board is conﬁdent 
that George Wimpey will
continue to make further
progress in 2004.

* Before exceptional items 4George Wimpey Plc Annual Report 2003
With pre-exceptional proﬁt
before tax up 30%, 2003 was
another year of excellent
progress. Over three years,
pre-tax profits have grown
more than two and a half
times, whilst the operating
margin at George Wimpey 
has grown from 11.4% to
17.1% and at Morrison 
Homes from 8.6% to 11.9%.
Whilst we have been helped by
strong markets, the magnitude
of this improvement is the
result of strong and consistent
management action. In the 
UK, we have improved the 
way we buy land and the 
terms on which we buy it.
We have taken a lot of
overhead and construction
cost out of the business.
We have improved our product
and our customer service, and
thereby achieved increased
sales of customer speciﬁed 
upgrades.Whilst we have made
much progress in improving
our customer service, we know
we still have a long way to go
to meet the standards set by
the very best in retail industries.
We have established an
industry leading approach to
health and safety and our
environmental procedures have
been adopted as the standard
by the NHBC. We have made 
two acquisitions, McAlpine
Homes and Laing Homes,
on excellent terms and have
efﬁciently integrated both.
In Morrison Homes we have
refocused our strategy to
grow our volumes in our
established markets. Over
the past three years we have
grown by almost 40% which
together with improved land
purchase, procurement, and
growth in customer speciﬁed
upgrades has underpinned
our margin growth.
Delivering Success
The transformation in our
performance has been achieved
by delivering on the plan set
out in my ﬁrst Annual Report 
in 2000.That plan has also
established the potential for
ongoing success despite the
more challenging markets 
we may face.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT
PETER JOHNSON
2000 – Steps to success
Complete restructuring of the UK business
Turn scale to advantage
Gain value from strengths of US business
Identify and develop new sources of proﬁt George Wimpey Plc Annual Report 2003 5
We have restructured the
business from 6 to 5 business
units and refocused the
business on a narrower
product and price range.
These changes will strengthen
the business, creating an
engine for ongoing growth.
At the same time we will
reduce our overall risk by
limiting the business’s
exposure to the higher 
price points over £750,000.
Morrison Homes
Morrison Homes offers us 
the potential for rapid profit
growth with the need for 
only limited cash investment.
George Wimpey UK
The UK business has been
comprehensively restructured.
Wimpey Homes and McLean
Homes were merged,
McAlpine Homes and Laing
Homes acquired and integrated
and a total of some £72 million
of overhead and build costs
saved. Our landbank and our
product and geographic mix
have been strengthened.We
are well placed to sustain
operating margins against a
background of more subdued
house price inﬂation.
Through systematic
benchmarking, co-ordination
of procurement and sharing 
of experiences, we have 
turned our scale into an
important competitive
advantage. Through better
planning and decision making,
land is being acquired on 
terms consistent with current
margins. It is our objective that
with modest, but steady,
growth in volumes, the core
UK business will continue to
contribute to proﬁt growth.
We have been applying 
the same principles within
Laing Homes. We will exceed
our original target of £10
million of cost savings.This,
together with the acquisition
of land on improved terms,
will support growth in the 
next two years.
The outlook for the US housing
market over the next decade is
excellent. Good affordability
arising from low interest rates
and employment growth are
widely expected to combine
with strong underlying
demographic trends – arising
from immigration and higher
birth rates than in Europe – 
to create a sustained strong
market.The regions in which
we operate also beneﬁt from
inward migration and hence
above average population 
and employment growth.
With a high asset turn, growth
requires lower investment than
would be the case in the more
capital intensive UK.
Morrison Homes has shown
continuous profit growth
since the appointment of 
Stu Cline as President in 1994.
Over the past two years,
we have refocused and
accelerated growth in our
existing markets, leading to
higher volumes and better
margins achieved through
improved land purchase,
procurement and overhead
recovery. At the same time,
underperforming businesses
have been reviewed and 
plans put in place to improve
performance, as in Atlanta 
and Dallas, or exit the market,
as in San Antonio. Over the
past three years, volumes 
have grown almost 40% 
and operating profits over 
2.2 times.
Morrison Homes provides
considerable potential for
further growth and the
landbank and organisation 
are in place to secure this.
Customer Focus
Our performance in the 
United States has been 
greatly aided by the sale 
of customer options.
These have increased
margins and improved 
our asset turn, and hence 
our ﬁnancial efﬁciency.
We have applied those 
lessons within the UK.

Our People
We have strong management
teams in place in both the 
UK and the US to deliver our
objectives. In particular, I 
am delighted we have been
able to fill the most senior
positions in the organisation
from within and expect to be
able to continue to do so.
The greatest credit for 
the transformation that has
taken place in the UK over 
the past three years must 
go to Keith Cushen. Keith
retired, as planned, at the 
end of 2003 when the
restructuring was complete
and his successor had 
been established.
On behalf of us all, I thank
Keith for not only his
achievements but also his
friendship and comradeship
over the past three years.
has grown from £34 million 
in 2000 to over £60 million 
in 2003. These options enable
our customers to personalise
their home and have the
products and fittings they
desire installed before they
move in. Two major new
centralised options centres 
on the lines of those that have
succeeded in Morrison Homes
have now been opened in
Edinburgh and Cannock.
Further centres are planned
for 2004.
Sustaining Proﬁt Growth 
in the Future
As we look towards a period
of more subdued house price
inflation, we believe we are
well placed to sustain future
proﬁt growth through targeting:
sustained margins and
volume growth in our core

lower costs, better margins
and longer term volume

continued volume and proﬁt
growth in Morrison Homes.
continued growth of
customer options and
related income streams 
in both the UK and US
At the same time, lower land
price inﬂation would enable us
to improve cash generation.
I am delighted he has agreed 
to become a consultant 
to the Company during 
2004 to ensure a smooth
management transition.
Keith has been succeeded 
by Peter Redfern, who 
has been at Keith’s side
throughout these three 
years and who will ensure 
that the progress continues.
Peter has already established
himself as Managing Director
and is supported by a 
strong and experienced 
UK management team.
We have also embarked 
on the process of planning 
for the next generation in
Morrison Homes. Whilst Stu
Cline continues as President,
Steve Parker has been
appointed Executive Vice
President of Operations with 
full responsibility for the day
to day management of
Morrison’s operations. Steve
has built an outstanding
business in Florida and will 
in due course be a most able
successor to Stu.
Finally, a huge thank you goes
to all those who work in our
forty local housebuilding
companies in the UK and 
the US. It is through their
extraordinary dedication as
well as their local knowledge
and experience that the 
Group has transformed its
performance over the past
three years. It is also them 
who make my job so fulﬁlling.
PETER JOHNSON
Chief Executive’s Review (continued)
Our people – delivering success
The extraordinary dedication, as well as
local knowledge and experience of our
employees has transformed the
performance of our business over the 
past three years Building a strong business
for the future...
Over the past three years we have transformed the 
structure of our business, delivering on the promises 
we made and building strong foundations for future
earnings growth.
George Wimpey is well placed for the future 
through targeting:
sustained margins and volume growth in our core 
business, George Wimpey
lower costs, better margins and longer term volume
growth in Laing Homes
continued volume and proﬁt growth in our US
business, Morrison Homes
growth in the sale of customer options and related
income streams George Wimpey
Sustaining margins and growing volume  CONTROLLING COSTS
During 2003 George Wimpey experienced
minimal inﬂation in the cost of materials.
These costs are maintained at the lowest
possible levels by:
• 
detailed benchmarking of all products
across all businesses 
• 
maximising beneﬁts of scale through
national deals with major producers
Despite the well publicised shortages 
in skilled labour throughout the industry,
George Wimpey has kept labour costs 
under control by:
• 
thorough scheduling of activity,
providing a continuous flow of work 
for sub-contractors
• 
increasing the use of prefabricated
components reducing the requirements 
for skilled labour
• 
understanding the effects of PPG3
• 
sharing efﬁcient designs across all 
the businesses
• 
standardising product as far as possible to
reduce increased cost of ‘one-off’ designs
BUYING LAND ON BETTER TERMS
Over the past three years George Wimpey 
has totally changed the way land is bought.
Since the beginning of 2000 land purchase
margins have increased from under 8% 
to over 17%.
Land is now being bought earlier in 
the cycle to allow for increases in the 
time taken to acquire planning approval.
The transfer of land from the strategic 
landbank has continued to increase,
1,238 plots were transferred during 2003.

restructuring of George Wimpey,
Laing Homes provides the Group with

proﬁt growth.
COSTS AND MARGINS
Total cost savings following acquisition are
now anticipated to be at least £12 million.
Overhead savings have come from the
head ofﬁce closure and absorption of
centralised functions into George Wimpey.
In addition, restructuring to reduce the
number of business units from 6 to 5 will
ensure the business can go forward from 
a position of strength.
By introducing George Wimpey working
practices and procedures, Laing Homes
margins will be brought in line with those
of George Wimpey.
Material costs will be reduced and
controlled by:
• 
being included in national purchasing
deals for the total UK business
• 
benchmarking and sharing ideas 
both within Laing Homes and with
George Wimpey
• 
greater standardisation of product
Costs on site are being improved by
reducing work in progress, improving
scheduling, making greater use of
prefabricated components and
standardising designs.
LAND
Land is now being purchased at better
margins and hurdle rates have been
increased to come in line with those 
at George Wimpey. Since acquisition,
the programme of land investment 
has strengthened the short term
landbank, creating a platform for 
future volume growth.
OPTIONS

and George Wimpey, Laing has the
potential to develop an additional revenue

1. STRATEGY FOR GROWTH
Morrison Homes is well positioned in 
the Southeast, Southwest and Western
regions of the US, in markets with 
strong demographics and good
employment prospects.
The business has a clear strategy 
for growth, aiming to be a leading
housebuilder in each of its markets.
Satellite businesses in Jacksonville, Florida
and Central Valley, Northern California 
have achieved sufﬁcient scale to become
separate divisions in 2004.The satellite in
Sarasota is on track to become a division
in 2005.
Consistent with our growth strategy,
we aim to increase market share by
broadening our range of middle-market
products where the Morrison brand can
add value. New slightly smaller and more
efﬁcient products, as well as higher density
town houses, are being introduced to our
existing range of successful house types.
LANDBANK
During 2003 Morrison’s landbank grew by
over 25% and the business is in a strong
position for growth into 2004 and beyond.
Because Morrison achieves a high asset
turn, growth can be ﬁnanced with limited
investment. Where possible, we purchase
land as ‘ﬁnished lots’ , when required.
It is taken ready for us to start construction
on the home immediately, as all the
groundwork and infrastructure work has
been completed by the developer.
CUSTOMER SERVICE EXCELLENCE
The Morrison Homes brand is recognised
for excellence in customer service.
We measure customer satisfaction as
‘Willingness to Refer’ and as a company
achieved 84.7%. We aim to achieve a 
very demanding 90% goal and already 
a third of our divisions have achieved 
this outstanding score. According to
JDPower & Associates Morrison Homes
customer satisfaction rating is in the top
quartile of all builders, exceeding the
national average by 5%.
COST SAVING INITIATIVES
The operating margin rose to 11.9% in 
2003 as all divisions continued to focus 
on opportunities to reduce costs. Taking
advantage of scale, new procurement 
deals have reduced the number of
suppliers used by Morrison and improved
purchasing terms for products such as ﬁre
places, HVAC equipment and bath brass.

SERVICE EXCELLENCE 
In all our businesses we focus on integrity,
quality and excellence to provide
consistent standards of customer service.
All our homes come with a two year
guarantee which is twice the industry
average in both the UK and the US.
By July 2004, every employee in the UK,
from accountants to site managers, will
have taken part in a new training course
and workshops which have been
developed to highlight the importance 
of customer service in every area of 
the business.
The new ‘Respond’ customer care
management system provides customer
care staff with detailed records of every
home, including any extras that were
purchased with it, so queries can be 
dealt with speedily and efﬁciently.
WEBSITES 
All businesses have introduced new
customer focused websites. Customers 
in the UK, as well as searching for a new
home, can now search for a mortgage 
and shop on line. In future they will also 
be able to choose their options.
In the US, 75% of Morrison Homes’
prospective customers used the internet
and www.morrisonhomes.com attracts
70% more visitors than a year ago. A
number of new sales tools are used to
communicate with prospective customers,
helping to identify and attract those most
likely to purchase a Morrison home.
New customer magazines, Nest and 
Wall to Wall, will help the UK business
communicate with customers, keeping
them up to date with new developments,
initiatives and offers.
FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICES
Morrison Homes has led the way in
introducing additional services to make
buying a Morrison Home easier, 66% of 
all customers arranged their mortgages
through Morrison Financial, and in 
Florida and Texas 90% of customers 
used Morrison Title.
A new joint venture business, UK Home
Finance Limited, will provide even greater
ﬂexibility when purchasing a home from
George Wimpey or Laing Homes. Financial
products available to new and existing
customers, now include unique mortgage,
remortgage and insurance products at
preferential rates.

new homes and provides the business
with an additional source of proﬁt.
LEADING THE WA Y
In 2000 Morrison opened its ﬁrst prototype
centralised Signature Selection Centre in
Orlando. Since then new options centres
opened have been improved, increasing
the showroom space and the range of
products available.
Centralised centres are now available 
in all Morrison’s markets. By providing
customers with an extended range of
products, displayed in a retail environment
and with individual appointments the 
sale of options per customer has risen 
to $27,400, which represents 10% of the
business’s turnover.
TAKING THINGS FURTHER
Building on lessons learnt at Morrison
Homes, in June 2003 George Wimpey 
East Scotland opened the ﬁrst centralised
selection centre in the UK. Unique not 
only for George Wimpey but also for the
industry. More than 3,000 different items
are available for customers to choose from.
At the centre,average sales per customer
have almost doubled.
George Wimpey has opened a further
centralised centre in Cannock, in the
Midlands, in early 2004 with more centres
planned. Site based selection centres will
continue to develop. Over the past 3 years
sales per customer have risen from almost
£3,000 per customer to just over £5,000.
AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE FUTURE
The sale of optional extras to 
customers at Laing Homes is still being
developed. Using experience from
elsewhere in the Group, Laing Homes 
has the potential to signiﬁcantly
increase options revenue to the levels
achieved in George Wimpey regions.

Group Summary 
Once again, George Wimpey
has been able to report
excellent results for the year.
Turnover increased 11% to
£2,878.5 million whilst operating
proﬁts at £429.8 million
increased by 30% before
exceptional items of £5.9 million
in 2002.These outstanding
results build on the signiﬁcant
progress achieved in the
previous two years. Group
operating proﬁts have grown by
a total of £259.6 million over the
last three years since the
business was restructured.
This strong performance is 
the result of a number of 
key factors:
strong markets and housing
demand in both the UK and
the US
the successful restructuring
of the business and
integration of two major
acquisitions, McAlpine
Homes in 2001 and Laing
Homes in 2002
the acquisition of land,
particularly in the UK, at
signiﬁcantly improved
margins
tight control of costs
throughout the Group to
support enhanced margins
These factors provide a 
strong platform for the 
Group moving forward.
The Group’s rapid growth 
has been ﬁnanced without
resorting to raising new
shareholder equity through 
a combination of retained
earnings, deferred payment
structures for acquisitions 
and higher debt levels.
Consequently interest costs
grew to £51.6 million which
represents an increase of 
£13.7 million on 2002.
Pre-exceptional proﬁts 
before tax totalled £378.2
million, an increase of 30% 
on last year’s results before
exceptional items of £5.9
million in 2002.There were 
no exceptional costs incurred
in 2003.The effective tax 
rate was 31% compared 
with 33% in 2002.

UK Housing 
Financial Overview
During 2003, turnover for the

by 10% to £2,270.0 million,
with operating proﬁts rising

to increase dividends at a
faster rate than earnings in 
the coming years, thereby
achieving our objective 
to reduce dividend cover
whilst maintaining a strong
balance sheet.
Net debt at the end of 
2003 totalled £529.2 million
compared with £375.6 million
at the end of 2002. The £215
million owing to John Laing
PLC for the acquisition of
Laing Homes has now 
been fully paid. In spite of 
the significant increase in
recommended dividends,
Of this, the George Wimpey
brand accounted for £1,933.2
million of turnover and an
increase in operating proﬁts 
of 22% to £330.1 million 
from £270.2 million in 2002.
Improving the operating
margin remained a key focus
for the year and it rose to
17.1% from 14% in 2002.This
strong improvement resulted
from the benefits of land
acquired on better terms 
and selling price increases 
as well as continued tight
control of costs.
Laing Homes turnover was
£336.8 million, compared 
with a contribution of £131.8
million for the two months 
of ownership in 2002. Despite
more difﬁcult market
conditions in its higher priced
markets, especially in and
around London, operating
proﬁts in Laing Homes were
£41.7 million, similar to the 
pro forma 12 months results 
for 2002. The operating margin
rose to 12.4% from 10.7% 
for the whole of 2002. This
improvement resulted from the
ﬁrst beneﬁts of the programme
of cost reduction introduced
following acquisition.
Operating Overview 
After the integration and
acquisitions of the previous
two years, 2003 was a year 
of consolidation and further
progress for the UK business.
The main focus was to deliver
further improvement in
operating margins and ensure
this can be sustained going
forward.This was achieved by:
maintaining the efﬁciencies
in overheads and build costs
achieved over the previous
two years in George Wimpey
and introducing these to
Laing Homes
continuing to buy land 
on improved terms, and 
increasing our focus 
on customer service 
and satisfaction
During the year, Laing Homes
was fully integrated as a
division of the UK business.
George Wimpey working and
procurement practices along
with detailed benchmarking
were adopted across all Laing
Homes sites. Following a review
of the business’s structure and
future strategy, the North
London and Northern Home
Counties regions have been
merged and the overhead 
in the Thames Valley region
slimmed down in line with its
projected scale for 2004.The
anticipated cost savings are
now expected to be at least 
£12 million compared with 
£10 million projected at the
time of acquisition.

by an underlying shortage of
supply, low interest rates and
good affordability. After the
strong market conditions in
2002, 2003 started slowly across
the Midlands and the South,
although it remained strong 
for most of the year in Scotland,
Wales and the North.The
national market was especially
strong for a period in the late
summer and early autumn
before experiencing its 
normal seasonal slowdown
approaching Christmas.
However demand was more
limited in the higher priced
markets, especially in and
around London and,
exceptionally, prices softened
somewhat in Central London.
Our broad geographic and
product spread continues to
limit exposure to any speciﬁc
areas of weakness. Only about
18% of all UK completions were
in Southeast England, with only
15% of outlets located within
the M25. 93% of completions
were below £300,000.
Outlets and Completions 
The average number of 
George Wimpey outlets 
open during the year was 
272, a decrease on the previous
year, which beneﬁted from
additional McAlpine Homes
outlets which remained 
open in early 2002 following
acquisition but were not
replaced. In addition delays 
to new outlets have been
caused by the increasing time
taken to process land through
the planning system, including
time taken to process Section
106 Agreements.The average
time taken to obtain
implementable detailed
planning permission grew
from 37 weeks in 2002 to 
43 weeks in 2003.
Visitor levels remained good
through the year and average
sales rates per development
were in line with those achieved
in 2002.Total George Wimpey
completions for the year fell
11% to 11,813 from 13,274 
with private development
completions 8% lower at
11,228. With new outlets
opened as forecast during 
the year, private development
completions in the second half
were up 4% on 2002 at 7,103.
The average selling price of a
George Wimpey private home
rose 14% to £168,000 from
£148,000 in 2002.
The George Wimpey brand
remains geographically fairly
evenly split. By volume, about
35% of sales are in Scotland
and the North of England,
35% in the Midlands and 30%
in the South. Our investment
in Inner City developments
has been strictly controlled,
and we have redesigned
projects to meet the changed
market requirements for a
more affordable product.
At the end of 2003 we had
6 active sites in central
London and one active site
and one under construction 
in central Manchester.
During the year Laing Homes
had an average of 37 outlets
open and achieved a total of
1,096 completions, of which
975 were private development.
The sales rate was lower than
that achieved in previous years
reﬂecting the more difﬁcult
market conditions for more
expensive products.
The average selling price for
Laing Homes rose by 14% 
to £315,000 from £276,000
achieved throughout 2002,
reﬂecting the changes to the
regional and product mix of
the business.
Laing Homes had a narrower
geographic spread, with about
80% of completions in London
and the Home Counties, the
balance being in the Midlands.
Laing Homes is well positioned
for growth around London 
and the Home Counties and 
in other premium markets
across the country. We believe
this can be achieved without

operating margins of the UK
business over the past three
years. Hurdle rate disciplines
reﬂecting different levels of 
risk have been implemented
and provide an opportunity 
for future margin improvement
in the Laing Homes businesses.
At George Wimpey the implied
operating margin on additions
to the landbank at currently
prevailing costs and selling
prices rose to around 17.5% 
for 2003.
During the year the short term
owned and controlled landbank
for both our UK businesses
increased. At George Wimpey 
it rose from 40,932 plots at the
end of 2002 to 43,587 plots at
the year end. Average plot 
costs increased to £51,000 
from £45,000 in 2002, as land
acquisitions were somewhat
biased towards the South.
The average scope of sites
acquired during the year rose
from about 70 units to 80 units,
damaging the potential 
for volume growth in the
George Wimpey business.
Product Mix 
With the development of PPG3
across England, our product
mix continued to change.
For George Wimpey the
proportion of 4 and 5 bedroom
detached houses fell slightly
from 45% in 2002 to 43% in
2003 and the proportion of 
ﬂats increased from 18% to
24%.The average size of our
product has remained broadly
unchanged over recent years
and was 1,053 sq ft in 2003.
For Laing Homes, 49% of
completions were flats and
32% 4 and 5 bedroomed
properties. During the year 
the average size of our Laing
product rose from 1,138 sq ft 
to 1,232 sq ft.
Landbank
Improving the terms on which
land is bought has been a
major part of improving the 
creating a stronger land base
for 2005.The average coverage
rose from about 16,750 sq ft
per acre to about 17,250 sq ft
per acre, excluding high rise
inner city developments.
At Laing Homes the short 
term owned and controlled
landbank grew from 3,613
plots to 5,021.The average plot
cost for land acquired during
the year rose to £107,100 from
£97,400 in 2002.
For 2003, the average scope 
of sites acquired remained
broadly unchanged at about
60 units.The average coverage
per site rose from about 24,750
sq ft per acre to about 27,000
sq ft per acre.
The transfer of land from 
the strategic landbank has
provided 1,238 plots into the
short term landbank during
the year.The strategic portfolio
stood at 18,621 acres at the
year end, compared with
18,581 last year.
Quality and Customers 
Quality of build and achieving
industry leading customer
service remains a priority for
our businesses. Once again, we
were by far the largest winners
of the coveted NHBC Pride in
the Job Awards gaining 74
Quality Awards and 22 of the
Top 100 Seals of Excellence.
Our customer care
management system aims 
to ensure all customers receive
consistent service. All aspects
of customer satisfaction 
are being benchmarked 
and analysed so areas for
improvement can be assessed,
both at a regional and national
level. Although we recognise 
we still have much to achieve,
many of our regional
businesses are using these
processes to bring about
substantial improvements 
in their performance.
Extending the sale of optional
extras to customers to help
them customise their homes
has been a major focus during
2003. At George Wimpey,
extending the range at site
based options centres has
increased the value of options
sold per customer to £5,129,
representing 3% of the average
selling price of our homes.
At Laing Homes, the sale of
optional extras is still limited
but an average of £3,000 per
plot has been achieved.
A new approach to selling
options from a centralised
centre was introduced by
George Wimpey East Scotland
in Edinburgh in June 2003.
The average option revenue
per customer visiting the
centre was almost double 
that previously achieved 
by the region. Another

Going Forward 
Building on the substantial
progress made over the
previous two years, 2003 
was a year of consolidation,
completing the restructuring 
of our UK business. We 
have achieved a signiﬁcant
improvement in operating
margin in our core 
George Wimpey business and
are now well placed to sustain
this.We are also well placed to
deliver a similar improvement 
in operating margin at Laing
Homes, whilst at the same time
buying land to deliver a growth
in volumes.These, in addition to
the improved services we can
offer our customers, place us in
a strong position to achieve
further steady growth in 2004.
US Housing
Financial Overview
Building on a successful
business formula and a strategy
of steady growth in existing
markets, Morrison Homes has
achieved further signiﬁcant
organic growth during 2003.
Turnover grew by 24% from
$806.2 million to $997.8 million,
with improvements in both
completions and average
selling price. Operating proﬁts
rose strongly by 47% to $118.6
million from $80.7 million 
in 2002. Once again the
operating margin increased,
from 10% in 2002 to 11.9%.
Return on average capital
employed increased to 25.9% .
In sterling terms, turnover
totalled £608.4 million and
operating proﬁts £72.3 million.
The weakening of the dollar
adversely impacted the
comparison by £56.8 million
and £6.7 million respectively.
Market Overview 
During 2003 the general 
US economy continued 
to strengthen, consumer
confidence reached a high 
of 92.5 in November whilst
unemployment remained 
at low levels.
The housing market 
remained very strong
supported by continuing 
low 30 year mortgage rates.
Single family home starts 
were 1.5 million, one of the
strongest in the past 30 
years. It is anticipated that 
the housing market will 
remain strong in 2004.
Many of Morrison’s markets
have further beneﬁted from
continued inward migration
leading to above average
population growth. Morrison’s
markets in Northern California,
Phoenix and Central Florida
remained strong throughout
the year. However, some
markets, in particular Denver
and Dallas, stayed relatively
weak with Atlanta, Austin 
and Houston seeing some
improvements during the
second half. For 2004 the
Southern and Western regions
of the US are expected to
continue to benefit from 
increases in job growth 
and inward migration.
Completions and Outlets 
In line with our plans,
completions for the year rose
14.5% from 3,197 to 3,661.
The average number of outlets
during the year was slightly
lower than last year at 102 as 
a result of decisions to exit 
the San Antonio market and
reduce activity in Atlanta 
and Dallas until performance
improves. During the year 39
new outlets were opened and
32 completed. In line with our
strategy of growing volume in
2004 we expect a significant
increase in average outlets 
open by the end of the ﬁrst half.
Although the average 
number of outlets was lower,
the average weekly sales 
rate per outlet increased
significantly on 2002.
The average selling price of a
Morrison Home during 2003
was $270,000, a 7% increase
from $252,000.
Margin Improvement 
The operating margin rose to
11.9%. Building on last year’s
successful increase to 10% 
the business continued to
focus on opportunities to
reduce costs throughout 
the year. Procurement deals
have reduced the number of
suppliers and achieved better
purchasing terms for products

As we continue to improve 
the terms on which land is
acquired, the implied operating
margin on additions to the
landbank is consistent with
sustaining the margin
achieved during the year.
Consistent with our growth
strategy, we aim to increase
market share by broadening
our range of middle-market
products where the Morrison
brand can add value. New
slightly smaller and more
efficient products as well as
higher density town houses
have been designed. New
ranges were introduced in
Atlanta, Dallas, Houston,

markets. An average of $27,400
of options per sale was
achieved during the year 
such as HVAC equipment,
exterior doors and ﬁreplaces,
with further opportunities
being investigated. Standardised
construction schedules have
helped to reduce build times
and house plans have been
subject to value engineering
exercises to eliminate
unnecessary costs.
Landbank and Growth
Opportunities 
During the year the short term
owned and controlled landbank
grew by 26% from 13,439 plots
to 16,967 plots.This increase has
been achieved across all our
existing markets.
The satellite businesses in
Jacksonville and Sarasota, Florida
and the Central Valley, Northern
California have continued to
expand throughout the year, as
they move to become separate
operating divisions.The current
land position puts the business
in a good position to support
this planned growth into 2004
and beyond.
representing 10% of turnover
and an increase of 14% on last
year’s level of $24,100. As well 
as providing a valuable proﬁt
source, the sale of a wide range
of options allows us to keep the
base house price low remaining
competitive in our markets.
Customer Satisfaction measured
by our customers’‘Willingness 
to Refer’ was 84.7% with a third
of our divisions exceeding our
90% goal. According to JDPower
& Associates our customer
satisfaction rating put Morrison
Homes in the top quartile 
of all builders and our rating
exceeded the national average
by 5%.The proportion of our
customers referred by previous
homebuyers increased to 
22% in the fourth quarter of 
the year, more than twice the
industry average.
During the year 66% of our
home buyers arranged a
mortgage through Morrison
Financial Services.This service is
now available in all our divisions.
Morrison Title, available in
Florida and Texas, was able to
provide a title service to over
90% of customers in these
markets during 2003. As well 
as enabling us to provide 
a seamless service to our
customers, these businesses
continue to provide additional
opportunities for proﬁt growth.
Going Forward 
Forecasts are predicting
another healthy year for the 
US housing markets in 2004
and the markets in which
Morrison Homes operates are
well placed to beneﬁt from
economic, demographic and
employment growth. We have
signiﬁcantly strengthened our
landbank during 2003 and are
now well placed to deliver
further progress in 2004.
Financial Review
Interest 
The Group’s interest charge 
for the year totalled £51.6
million including £7.6 million
imputed interest on deferred
consideration, (2002 £10.2
million), payable to John Laing
PLC. Interest on borrowings 
at £44.0 million was higher
than the 2002 expense of
£27.7 million due to higher
borrowing levels. Average net
debt for the year was of the
order of £800 million an
increase of £264 million,
reflecting deferred payments 
of £215 million during the year
in respect of the acquisition 
of Laing Homes, together 
with further investment to
strengthen the landbank.
The effective interest rate was
5.4% similar to that in 2002
(the calculation of the effective
interest rate is deﬁned in note
18 to the accounts).
Interest cover, defined as
operating profits before
exceptionals divided by 
the net interest charge,
exceeded 8 times.

Taxation 
The tax charge for the 
year totalled £117 million,
representing an average tax
rate of 31%.This tax rate is
expected to be sustained for 
at least the coming year.
Second Half Results 
In the six months to 31
December 2003, Group
turnover was 15% higher 
than in the same period in
2002 at £1,819.5 million 
and pre-exceptional profit
before tax was 24% higher 
at £255.5 million before
exceptional items of £5.9
million in 2002.
In the UK the George Wimpey
brand turnover was 9% higher
than the same period in 2002 
at £1,242.1 million, with
completions 4% higher and
average selling price 11%
higher at £171,000.The
operating margin was 17.4%,
compared to 15.8% leading to
operating proﬁts 20% higher 
at £216.1 million. Operating
margins also showed further
progress on the level of 16.5%
achieved in the ﬁrst half of 2003,
reﬂecting lower gross margins
but better overhead absorption.
Turnover in Laing Homes was
£223.2 million a signiﬁcant
increase on the reported
results for the second half of
2002, when we only owned
the business for two months.
Laing Homes contributed 
an operating proﬁt of £29.7
million compared to £20.0
million in the last two months
of 2002 before exceptional
items of £5.9 million.This
represented a substantial
improvement in operating
proﬁts for the whole of the six
months to December 2002,
which we estimate to have
been £24.2 million.
In the same period, Morrison
Homes’ completions were 
14% higher than in the 
second half of 2002 at 2,140.
With average selling prices 
7% higher, dollar turnover was
22% higher at $588.3 million.
The operating margin was 
also improved up from 
11.0% in 2002 to 12.4% 
in 2003. Dollar operating 
proﬁts were therefore 39%
higher at $73.3 million.
After an adverse exchange
translation effect of £5 million,
Morrison Homes’ sterling
profits for the second half
totalled £44.2 million compared
with £34.7 million in 2003.
Interest costs were £7.6 million
higher at £26.3 million as a
result of higher borrowing
levels principally due to 
the acquisition of Laing 
Homes and investment 
in the land bank.
Balance Sheet 
The Board is recommending 
a ﬁnal dividend of 8.45 pence 
bringing the full year dividend
to 12.25 pence an increase of
35%. After providing for this
dividend, shareholders’ funds
have grown strongly to
£1,170.0 million (2002 £943.0
million). This represents a 
55 pence per share increase
bringing net worth per share
to £3.05. Group borrowings at
the year end stood at £529.2
million an increase of £153.6
million more than explained
by payments of £215 million 
to complete the acquisition of
Laing Homes. Gearing deﬁned
as borrowings as a percentage
of shareholders funds stands
at 45%. Assets employed
include £1,438.6 million of 
land net of creditors which
reflects a net investment of
£188.2 million during 2004.
The owned and controlled
land position in both the 
UK and US has been 
further strengthened. The 
value of work in progress
increased by £77.0 million 
to £577.8 million reflecting 
the growth in the scale of 
the business. As mentioned
earlier, debt increased in 
2003 by £153.6 million.

Liquidity Risk: George Wimpey
maintains adequate committed
borrowing facilities to ensure
that seasonal borrowings can
be accommodated whilst
maintaining prudent headroom
against projected actual
borrowings. As can be seen
from note 17 to the accounts
the Group has committed 
bank facilities of £925 million 
at the end of 2003. It also has
private placements totalling
£328.7 million.
We have raised money in 
the US private placement
market for a number of years.
Following a very successful
private placement in 2002,
the same investors were
approached again in the ﬁrst
half of 2003 and a new $150
million private placement was
arranged at very competitive
interest rates. During the 
year we also arranged over

Financial and Treasury Policies 
George Wimpey has ﬁnanced
its growth in recent years
through a combination of
retained profits, bank loans 
and long term loans in the
form of US$ private placements
with a group of US insurance
companies. All loans and
banking relationships are
managed centrally through the
Group Treasury Department.
We continue to use derivatives
to generate the appropriate
balance between ﬁxed, capped
and ﬂoating interest rate
proﬁles. It is not our policy to
trade actively in derivatives or to
use more complex derivatives.
The Group’s Treasury
Committee is responsible for
developing and recommending
policy to the Board and for
monitoring our ﬁnancing risks.
The main risks arising from 
our ﬁnancing instruments 
£250 million of committed
bank facilities and increased
the average maturity of
borrowing arrangements 
to in excess of 5 years.
Interest Rate Risk: We aim to
limit our exposure to interest
rate ﬂuctuations on our debt
by using ﬁxed interest rate
borrowings, interest rate swaps
and options.The most adverse
scenario for the Company is a
signiﬁcant increase in interest
rates which would weaken the
housing market at the same
time as increasing borrowing
costs.To mitigate this risk, the
Group has arranged that
approximately 90% of its year
end debt is at ﬁxed interest
rates. In addition, noting that
borrowings during the year
are generally substantially
higher than at the year end,
interest rate caps of £200
million have been purchased
giving the Group considerable
insurance in case sterling 
interbank rates of interest 
rise above 4.75% in 2004.
Currency Risk: Our principal
currency risk is the translation
exposure of our investment in
Morrison Homes. Our policy is
to match as far as practicable
our dollar denominated assets
with dollar denominated debt.
Consequently movement in
the sterling/dollar exchange
rate has had little effect on the
Group’s shareholder funds,
though it did affect the sterling
value of year end debt as well
as reported turnover and pre-
tax proﬁts.
Accounting Standards 
and Pensions 
The 2003 Annual Report has
been produced in accordance
with standards issued by the
Accounting Standards Board.
There have been no new
standards issued during 2003.
New pronouncements issued
by the Urgent Issues Task 
Force have had no signiﬁcant
impact on reported results.
We are now well advanced 
in preparing ourselves for 
the adoption of International
Accounting Standards in 2005.
Our core policies on turnover
and profit recognition and
value of land and work in
progress should be unaffected.
In particular, we anticipate
continuing our prudent policy 
£1 88m
Net investment in land  George Wimpey Plc Annual Report 2003 27
and only recognising revenue
and proﬁts once the sale of a 
house is legally completed.
The major new accounting
developments affecting
George Wimpey, as with many
companies, are on retirement
beneﬁts and measurement of
ﬁnancial instruments.There
remains some uncertainty
about how these standards
will develop and the timing 
of adoption.
It is likely that the new
pensions standard will be
similar to the UK’s Financial
Reporting Standard 17, with
which we are now well familiar.
The effect of FRS 17 this year is
limited, like last year, to certain
disclosures set out in note 9 
to the accounts.There is no
impact on this year’s ﬁnancial
statements. In summary, under
FRS 17, the UK pension scheme
has assets (at current market
value) of £545 million and
liabilities (discounted at the AA
rated bond yield required by
the standard) of £730 million.
The use of this valuation
method results in a deﬁcit of
£185 million, partially offset 
by a deferred tax asset of £55
million, giving a net deﬁcit of
£130 million.This compares to
a net deﬁcit a year ago of £115
million.The primary reasons 
for the increased deﬁcit are 
the reduction in the AA rated 
bond yield used to discount
the liabilities and a higher
inﬂation rate assumption.
Under the pension scheme
rules, an actuarial valuation 
of the Pension Scheme was
carried out in April 2002.This
showed a deﬁcit of £74 million
below that required to cover
the beneﬁts accrued to
members after allowing for
expected future increases 
in earnings.
The Company has taken
several major steps to address
the shortfall in the pension
scheme over the last few years.
The balance of the fund in 
UK and overseas equities 
has steadily been reduced 
and we had just 30% of 
funds in equities at the 
end of 2003. The defined
benefit scheme was closed 
to new members two years
ago on 1 January 2002.
The increased employee
contributions detailed in 
last year’s Report have now
been fully phased in at 8%.
The favourable arrangements
for early retirement have 
also been amended. Former
Laing employees have 
now transferred to the 
George Wimpey scheme on
similar terms, and there has
been the appropriate full
transfer from the John Laing
Pension Scheme to cover the
resulting beneﬁts.The normal
service cost to the company 
has now fallen to 13.2% of
pensionable payroll. We will
invest an additional £15 million
in cash each year from 2004
(compared with an additional
£10 million in 2003) to address
the deficit. This reflects just 
0.5% of Group turnover.
With all these measures 
now in place, we remain
confident that the pension
deficit is being properly 
and fully addressed.

Highlights of the 2003 
CSR Report
Governance
In June 2003, we set up a 
CSR Committee of the Board
which I am delighted to 
chair. Committee members 
included Keith Cushen, Chief
Executive of George Wimpey
UK, Stu Cline, President of
Morrison Homes and Non
Executive Director Baroness
Brenda Dean.This Committee
will strengthen and inform
the Group’s approach to
corporate responsibility
issues. The CSR Committee 
will meet at least twice per
year and is responsible for the
Group’s CSR strategy, policies,
reporting and performance
monitoring.The Committee’s
responsibilities include aligning
CSR strategy to the needs of
the business, developing
appropriate stakeholder
We remain committed to
transparent CSR reporting and
to monitoring, reviewing and
improving our performance.
We believe we have built on
last year’s achievements but
understand that sustainability
will not be achieved quickly
and we still have many 
steps to take.
Corporate Social Responsibility
(CSR) makes sound business
sense.The key to the George
Wimpey approach is an
integrated business plan
where environmental, social
and technical performance is
aligned with ﬁnancial security
and returns.
This year, we have produced
our second annual CSR report.
Entitled ‘Making Progress’ , the
report sets out in detail our
approach to environmental,
social and ethical issues in the
UK and the US. We take a
practical approach to CSR,
balancing stakeholder
perspectives with commercial
viability. CSR can and must
make business sense.
Like our ﬁrst report, Making
Progress describes our policies,
procedures and performance 
in terms of governance, health
and safety, environment,
employees, community and
customer care.
In our ﬁrst report, we identiﬁed
a series of Key Performance
Indicators (KPIs) to provide 
an annual snapshot of our
progress over time.This 
year’s report includes 20 KPI
measurements and highlights
several additional KPIs for
inclusion in our 2004 report.
We also integrated Laing
Homes into our CSR practices
and procedures, with particular
focus on health, safety and
dialogue and highlighting
signiﬁcant social, environmental
and ethical risks and
opportunities to the Board.
A key focus for 2004 is to
develop a framework for
deepening our understanding
of what it means to be 
‘a responsible housebuilder’ .
We will also investigate how
to strengthen assurance
around our CSR related
processes and review our
procedures in the light of 
third party criteria.
Health and Safety
In the UK, we engaged with
key stakeholders on health 
and safety risks, ran national
safety workshops for designers
and saw an 11% reduction in
reportable accidents since
2002. We trained 2,800
workers on a new fall arrest
system, 900 on the use of
safety nets and provided
health and safety induction 
for 100% of contractors.
George Wimpey UK also
received a prestigious UK
Construction Health and
Safety Group award for
‘Contribution to Health and
Safety Training and Improved
Standards’. In the US, we
improved weekly safety
reports, introduced a Scored
Safety Audit programme on
100% of sites and introduced
monthly safety reporting.

Environment
In 2003 in the UK, we trained
100% of site management and
support staff on environmental
management, as well as 389 of
our contractors.In addition, 67%
of our homes were built on
brownﬁeld sites, exceeding the
UK Government’s 2008 target of
60%. In the US, we continued
and extended our involvement
with environmental initiatives 
and engaged with suppliers 
to introduce environmentally-
preferable heating, ventilating
and air-conditioning 
(HVAC) systems.
In 2004, we will focus on
completing our sustainability
survey of suppliers and
undertake a full gap and cost
beneﬁt analysis of seeking
accreditation to ISO14001.
We will also explore CSR
related supply chain issues 
and focus on increasing waste
segregation and recycling.
time new recruits stay with 
the company.
Community 
In the UK and the US, we
supported a range of
community and charitable
initiatives either linked to 
our local businesses or
employees or with a particular 
focus on housebuilding 
and homelessness. Initiatives
included creating a temporary
winter shelter for homeless
people in the UK, as well as
redecorating a local women’s
shelter and refurbishing
children’s bathrooms on 
behalf of charities in the US.
In 2004, we will analyse the 
mix of our charitable activities
and investigate ways to improve
the effectiveness of our
charitable donations policy.
Customer Care
George Wimpey UK won more
than twice as many NHBC Pride 
in the Job Quality Awards as 
any other housebuilder in 2003
and 83% of our customers said 
they would recommend us 
to friends and family. Customer
satisfaction ratings placed
Morrison Homes in the top
quartile of all US builders and
84.7% of customers would
recommend the company.
Homeowner referrals accounted
for 22% of US business.
In 2004, we will introduce 
a new Customer Charter for 
the UK and re-evaluate our
customer service training.
Morrison Homes will implement
a customer communication
management system and focus
on further improving customer
communication channels and
points of contact.

Directors’ Report
The Directors submit to the members their Report and Accounts
of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2003. The
Corporate Governance and Remuneration Reports on pages 35
and 38 form part of this Directors’ Report.
Principal Activities and Business 
During 2003 the Group’s principal activities were in housing and
land development. A summary of the results of these activities 
is set out in note 1 on page 48. Further details of the Company’s
activities and future developments are described on pages 2 to 27.
Proﬁt and Dividends
The proﬁt for the ﬁnancial year of £260.9 million is reported 
in the proﬁt and loss account on page 44. An interim dividend 
of 3.8p per share, amounting to £14.5 million in aggregate, was
paid on 24 October 2003 and the Directors recommend a ﬁnal
dividend at the rate of 8.45p per share amounting to £32.2
million.This, when added to the interim dividend, will make 
a total of 12.25p per share or £46.7 million attributable to the 
year and leaves a surplus of £214.2 million which has been
transferred to reserves.
Directors
Biographical details of the Board of Directors are shown on page 29.
In accordance with the Articles of Association, one third of the
Directors are required to retire by rotation at the Annual General
Meeting. Accordingly John Robinson, Michael Blackburn and
David WIlliams being the longest serving members, will retire 
and offer themselves for re-election.
Also in accordance with the Articles of Association, Directors who
have been appointed to the Board since the last Annual General
Meeting must be re-appointed at the subsequent Annual
General Meeting. Accordingly, Brenda Dean, who was appointed 
a Director on 7 October 2003, will retire at the Annual General
Meeting and offer herself for re-appointment.
Christopher Bartram and Keith Cushen resigned as Directors on
10 April and 31 December 2003 respectively. Keith Cushen has
been engaged by the Company as a consultant until 31 December
2004 (see note 3 of the Remuneration table on page 41).
The beneﬁcial and non-beneﬁcial interests of the Directors in shares
of the Company, disclosed to the Company are set out below:
Included in the shares held by Keith Cushen are 6,445 shares 
held in the George Wimpey Plc Employee Beneﬁt Trust (“the Trust”)
on his behalf pursuant to the rules of the Executive Incentive
Scheme.These shares together with a matching amount of 4,833
(75%) will be released to Keith Cushen in 2004 in accordance
with the rules of the Scheme.
Interests of the Directors in options over the shares of the
Company are shown on page 42. As beneﬁciaries under the Trust
which holds shares to satisfy awards under the George Wimpey
Long Term Incentive Plan each of Peter Johnson, Andrew 
Carr-Locke, Stewart Cline and Keith Cushen had an interest as at
31 December 2003 in the 3,252,955 shares held by that Trust.
There has been no change in the interests of the Directors
between 31 December 2003 and the date of signing of the
accounts, 24 February 2004 except that the interest of Messrs
Johnson, Carr-Locke and Cline in the shares held by the Trust 
will reduce from 3,252,955 to 2,980,228 following the vesting 
of 272,727 shares to Keith Cushen under the George Wimpey
Long Term Incentive Plan in February 2004 – see page 43 of 
the Remuneration Report.
Share Capital
At the 2003 Annual General Meeting authority was given to the
Company to purchase up to a maximum of 10% of its own shares.
This authority expires at the conclusion of the forthcoming
Annual General Meeting at which a special resolution will be
proposed to renew the authority for a further year.
The Board has no immediate intention of exercising this 
authority but will keep the matter under review. Moreover,
purchases will only be made if they would result in increased
earnings per share and will take into account other available
investment opportunities and will be in the best interests of
shareholders generally. Any shares purchased in accordance 
with this authority will subsequently be cancelled.
Options were outstanding as at 12 February 2004 to subscribe 
for a total number of 9,925,876 ordinary shares, or 2.58% of the
issued share capital. If the authority to purchase shares is ever
used in full, the proportion of issued share capital represented 
by this ﬁgure would be 2.87%.
An ordinary resolution will be proposed at the Annual General
Meeting to authorise the Directors, in accordance with section 
80 of the Companies Act 1985, to allot shares in the Company 
up to an aggregate nominal amount of £32,017,837 for a further
period of ﬁve years.
Conditional upon the passing of the above resolution, a special
resolution will be proposed at that Meeting to enable the
Directors to allot shares for cash (by way of rights or scrip
dividend or in an amount equal to but not more than £4,802,675 
in aggregate of the nominal value of the Company’s issued 
share capital) without regard to the pre-emption rights of the
Companies Act.
Employee Share Schemes
The Company operates a Savings Related Share Option Scheme
for its UK employees and an Executive Share Option Scheme for
all UK regional board directors.The limit that may be issued under
each Scheme is the lower of 20,000,000 and 5% of the issued

1,187,259 shares under the Executive Share Option Scheme.
In addition 194,823 shares were allotted during the year to
George Wimpey Quest Trustees Limited to cover exercises of
savings related share options, the remaining 1,131,789 shares 
being allotted directly to the participants, in accordance with 
the Scheme rules.The last allotment via the Quest took place in
July 2003 and the Company now allots shares directly to the

over 1,047,242 shares at 304p under the Savings Related Share
Option Scheme.

The number of options outstanding at 31 December 2003 under
the Savings Related Share Scheme was 5,364,812 exercisable

of options outstanding under both schemes was 10,159,682 shares
of which 8.2% are for the account of the Executive Directors.
The George Wimpey Plc Executive Incentive Scheme up to 2000,
required participants to invest part of their annual cash bonus in
shares of the Company to be held in trust for 3 years and then
released to the executive with an additional 50% in matching
shares. For bonus payments after 1999 where the executive elected
to keep the shares in Trust for a further 2 years, the matching award
is increased to 75%. It is intended that the Scheme will now run its
course, and close when all current obligations have been fulﬁlled.
In February 2003, 196,493 shares were allotted to the Trust to fulﬁll
its obligations.
As at 31 December 2003, the Trust held 243,565 shares, with

is to agree in advance the terms and conditions for business
transactions with suppliers and sub-contractors. Payment is

being met by the suppliers and sub-contractors.The number of
creditor days as at 31 December 2003 was 30 days (27 days 2002).
The Company had no trade creditors at 31 December 2003.
Research and Development
The Company continues its commitment to maintain and
improve high standards of build quality, together with improving
efﬁciency and safety and environmental standards.To achieve
this, it both seeks to improve continuously its traditional
construction techniques and explore innovative solutions and
construction methods. During the course of 2004 the Company
intends to increase this commitment further by establishing 
a formal relationship with an external research body.
Employee Involvement and Communication 
The businesses continue to enjoy the more open culture that 
has been developed in recent years. Employee involvement and
internal communications continue to evolve as greater sharing 
of knowledge and experience takes place.The intranet has been
extended further to enable greater ease of communication
throughout the businesses. Information on key business issues 
is cascaded throughout the organisation and supported by
management presentations.
The Board has continued its tradition of spending time within
local business units in both the UK and US. Visits include
spending time on site and in local ofﬁces to meet staff at all
levels and to discuss with them relevant business issues.The
Directors carry out regular visits to all parts of the business,
holding informal discussions with staff, enabling them to
understand the Company’s objectives and generating feedback.

receive less favourable treatment due to their race, creed, colour,
nationality, ethnic origin, religion, political or other opinion,
affiliation, gender, sexual orientation, marital status, family
connections, membership or non membership of a trade union,

disabilities are supported and encouraged to apply for
employment with the Company and to achieve progress through

GEORGE WIMPEY PLC
24 FEBRUARY 2004 George Wimpey Plc Annual Report 2003 35
Introduction
The Board remains fully committed to high standards of
corporate governance throughout the Group. The Listing Rules
of the Financial Services Authority require UK listed companies
to report on the manner in which they apply the Principles of
Good Governance and the extent to which they comply with
the Provisions set out in the Combined Code on Corporate
Governance issued by the Hampel Committee on Corporate
Governance in 1998 (“the Combined Code”). This Report,
together with the information set out in the Remuneration
Report on pages 38 to 43, is published pursuant to the Combined
Code which deals with directors, directors’ remuneration,
relations with and accountability to shareholders and the 
audit of the Company.
Statement of Compliance
Following publication in January 2003 of the Higgs Review 
on Non Executive Directors and the Smith Report on Audit
Committees, the Combined Code was amended and a revised
Code introduced for ﬁnancial years beginning on or after 
1 November 2003 (the “New Code”). In light of Higgs, the 
Board reviewed its procedures and governance policies and
implemented a number of changes including Board Committee
membership and induction programmes for new directors.The
Board has also reviewed the New Code and will take whatever
steps it considers appropriate to comply with its requirements.
The Board believes that there is already substantial compliance
with the New Code and a number of disclosures have been
included in this Report and Accounts to reﬂect its new and
revised provisions.
The Board considers that it has fully complied with the provisions
set out in Section 1 of the Combined Code during the year.
The Board of Directors
The business and management of the Company is the collective
responsibility of the whole Board. During 2003 the Board met
formally, as a whole, 10 times.Twice yearly the Board spends time
with a business unit in both the UK and the US which includes
site visits, presentations from local management and meeting
employees.The Board reviews the performance of each of its
trading businesses in detail at each Board meeting and in July
undertook a Strategic review.There is a formal schedule of
matters reserved for consideration and approval by the Board
and these include the annual budget, major land purchases 
and investment proposals, the approval of annual and interim
results and a review of the overall system of internal control 
and risk management.
There are four standing Board Committees: Audit, Remuneration,
Nomination and the Corporate Social Responsibility Committee
(established in 2003). Each of these Committees operates within
clearly deﬁned terms of reference and reports back to the Board.
The terms of reference in operation for the Board and its four
standing Committees can be found on the Company’s investor
relations website (www.georgewimpeyplc.co.uk). Additional
information on each of these Committees is set out later in this
section and also in the Remuneration Report in respect of the
Remuneration Committee.
During the year, there were no absences from any Board meetings
by any Director except Michael Blackburn and David Williams who
were unable to attend the December Board meeting.
During 2003, the Board consisted of the Chairman (John
Robinson), the Group Chief Executive (Peter Johnson), three other
Executive Directors and four Non Executive Directors (during the
period 10 April to 7 October there were three Non Executive
Directors). During the year each of the Non Executive Directors
has at all times acted independently of management and has
had no relationships which would materially interfere with the
exercise of their independent judgement and decision making.
The Board is of the view that the Non Executive Directors play 
an important role in upholding corporate governance and also
ensure that no individual or group dominates the Board’s
decision making process.
The roles of the Chairman and the Group Chief Executive are
separately held and there is a clear division of responsibilities
between each position.
Michael Blackburn is the Senior Independent Non 
Executive Director and served throughout the year 
in this recognised position.
One third of the Directors submit themselves for re-election 
each year at the Annual General Meeting in accordance 
with the Articles of Association. In addition each Director 
seeks re-election every three years in accordance with the
Combined Code. New Directors appointed during any year 
seek re-appointment at the next Annual General Meeting.
Christopher Bartram, an independent Non Executive Director
resigned from the Board on 10 April 2003. Baroness Dean of
Thornton-le-Fylde was appointed a Non Executive Director 
on 7 October 2003 and Keith Cushen took early retirement 
on 31 December 2003 and resigned from the Board with effect
from that date.
An induction programme is provided for new Directors which
includes the provision of a comprehensive set of background
information on the Group and the corporate governance policies
and procedures in operation. New Non Executive Directors are
also provided with the opportunity of attending a training course
on the role and responsibilities of holding such a position.
Formal agenda and reports are provided to Directors one 
week prior to the meeting, thus allowing sufﬁcient time for
detailed review and consideration of the documents beforehand.
The Chairman and Group Chief Executive maintain regular contact
with all Directors.The Group Company Secretary attends all Board
and Board Committee meetings and in addition, all Directors have
direct access to the Group Company Secretary for advice and
services.The Secretary is responsible for ensuring that the correct
procedures are followed at all Board and Committee meetings and
reports directly to the Chairman and the Group Chief Executive.
The Board has adopted a procedure whereby Directors may 
seek independent professional advice relating to the carrying 
out of their duties.
During 2003 the Board carried out a comprehensive self 
appraisal which was led by the Senior Independent Non
Executive Director. All Directors and the Group Company
Secretary participated in the exercise. During 2004, the Board
intends to repeat this process and has also implemented
procedures for the appraisal of Board Committees and individual
Directors to reﬂect the requirements of the New Code.

established in 2003, with formal terms of reference.The
Committee will be responsible for setting the Company’s CSR
strategy and policies, and for performance monitoring and
reporting. It is intended to produce an annual CSR report

Current Members: Michael Blackburn (Committee Chairman),
David Williams and Christine Cross

active investor relations programme, encouraging constructive
two-way communication with investors, fund managers and
analysts. Presentations are given at the time of both preliminary
and interim results and at the Annual General Meeting when
investors are invited to attend. Webcasts of both results
presentations, along with the question and answer sessions,

an investment opportunity.
Peter Johnson and Andrew Carr-Locke carried out an extensive
programme of meetings with institutional shareholders and
investors throughout the year within guidance issued by the

meetings with management.
The Company is pleased to welcome private and institutional
shareholders to its Annual General Meeting.The Board will be
present at the meeting to answer questions and also available for
discussions with shareholders both prior to and after the Meeting. George Wimpey Plc Annual Report 2003 37
Accountability and Audit
The Board believes that the ﬁnancial statements and reviews
contained within this document present a balanced and
understandable assessment of the Company’s performance 
and prospects.The sound system of internal control within the
Company enables the Board to make this statement.
The Audit Committee has a policy of not using the Company’s
Auditors for non-audit work if this could jeopardise the ability 
of the auditor to provide an independent and objective audit
opinion. PwC currently carry out routine tax compliance work
following a competitive tender process.The Committee takes 
the view that the carrying out of this work does not affect PwC’s
objectivity or independence due to its routine nature.
Internal Control
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system 
of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness.The
implementation and maintenance of the risk management and
internal control systems is the responsibility of the Executive
Directors and senior management. It is recognised that the
system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk 
of failure to achieve business objectives. Consequently it can only
provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material
mis-statement or loss.The system has been in place throughout
the period and is regularly reviewed within the Turnbull guidance 
on Internal Control.
Following the acquisition of Laing Homes in November 2002,
the business is now fully embedded in the risk management and
internal control processes of the Group.
The Board has reviewed in detail the areas of major risk that the
Group faces in its operations as documented in the Group Risk
Schedule.This Schedule is comprised of the key risks and is
regularly monitored for ongoing relevance. Speciﬁc key operational
risks include land purchase, health and safety, the environment and
product quality.The Board, following its review, is satisﬁed with the
process in place for risk identiﬁcation and management and it is
satisﬁed with current control mechanisms and reporting lines that
have been in place throughout the year and the programme of
continuous improvement initiatives that has been implemented.
The Group seeks to maintain high standards of business conduct
and operates under an established internal control framework,
which can be described as follows:
Organisational Structure
The Group operates through a number of operating businesses,
each with its own management board. Clear reporting lines and
delegated authorities are in place.The management and
monitoring of risk and performance occur at multiple levels
throughout the Group and the use of interactive review
processes provide successive assurance through the levels of 
the management up to the Board.
Land Purchase and Investment Appraisal 
There are clearly deﬁned policies and procedures for the
purchase of land and for capital expenditure.These include
detailed appraisal and review requirements and due diligence 
procedures which include a detailed environmental appraisal of
land prior to acquisition.These procedures are subject to rigorous
review and authorisation.
Development Activity 
There is a comprehensive framework for managing and
controlling all site related activity.This includes comprehensive
Health and Safety procedures, regular performance monitoring
and clear accountability on customer satisfaction.
Financial and Operating Reporting 
There is a comprehensive budgeting system with an annual
budget approved by the Board. Proﬁt and cash forecasts are
prepared and reviewed on a monthly basis.The performance 
of each business is reviewed monthly by Divisional and Group
management and subsequently reported to the Board against
both budget and forecast. Particular emphasis is placed on the
cash ﬂow as well as proﬁt and loss and balance sheet reporting,
and on key operating issues including health, safety and
environmental matters.
Control Self Assessment
During 2004, improved procedures will be in place which will
require each business to represent on a regular basis, through 
a formal Control Self Assessment process, its compliance with 
the core policies and key controls governing the Group.
Treasury
The principal Treasury related risks, decisions and control
processes are documented.The Treasury Committee consisting of
Andrew Carr-Locke (Chairman), Peter Johnson, Michael Blackburn,
the Group Treasurer and Group Tax and Insurance Manager
meets quarterly to consider Treasury related issues, decisions and
control processes.
All of the above are subject to ongoing Internal Audit review.
Internal Audit supports the Audit Committee and senior
management by independently and objectively reviewing the
effectiveness of risk management and the control environment.
The Internal Audit methodology is aligned to the key elements
of the Group’s internal control framework. The results of all
Internal Audit reviews are presented and discussed in detail at
the Audit Committee. In addition to Audit Committee reporting,
Internal Audit ﬁndings and conclusions are discussed at both
the Group Executive Committee (which meets at least monthly
and consisted during the year of Peter Johnson (Chairman),
Andrew Carr-Locke, Stewart Cline, Keith Cushen and James
Jordan (Group Company Secretary) and at Divisional executive
meetings of George Wimpey UK and Morrison Homes. Peter
Redfern, the Managing Director of George Wimpey UK became 
a member of the Group Executive Committee with effect from 
1 January 2004.
Going Concern
The Directors are required under the Combined Code to have
satisﬁed themselves as to the Group’s ability to continue in
existence for the foreseeable future. A review has been carried
out and the Directors have concluded that the Group has
adequate resources and is justiﬁed in using the going concern
basis in preparing the ﬁnancial statements. 38 George Wimpey Plc Annual Report 2003
Remuneration Report
Introduction
In preparing this Remuneration Report to shareholders,
the Board has followed the provisions in Schedule B of the
Combined Code on Corporate Governance issued by the
Hampel Committee on Corporate Governance in 1998 (the
“Combined Code”) and the Directors’ Remuneration Report
Regulations 2002 (the “Regulations”) contained in schedule 7A 
of the Companies Act 1985. Pursuant to the Regulations, this
Report is being put to shareholders for approval at the Annual
General Meeting to be held on 22 April 2004. The vote will 
have advisory status in respect of the remuneration policy 
and overall remuneration packages and will not therefore,
be speciﬁc to individual levels of remuneration.
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee was composed throughout 
the year of independent Non Executive Directors.The current
members are Michael Blackburn (Chairman), David Williams 
and Christine Cross who each served throughout the year.
Christopher Bartram was a member of the Committee until 
he resigned as a Director in April 2003.The Committee met six
times during the year.There were no absences except that
Christopher Bartram did not attend a meeting in March but this
meeting was attended by the three other independent Non
Executive Directors including the Chairman of the Committee.
Consultants
The Remuneration Committee has appointed the consulting 
ﬁrm, Towers Perrin as its advisor and to provide it with market
data and assistance on executive compensation including the
Company’s share schemes.Towers Perrin do not provide any
other services to the Company outside these remuneration
matters. External legal advice is also sought where appropriate
from Slaughter and May.
The following people provided material advice, services or
assistance to the Committee, except in relation to their own
speciﬁc remuneration:
John Robinson – Chairman
Peter Johnson – Group Chief Executive
Anna Edgeworth – Group HR Director
James Jordan – Group Company Secretary
Policy
The Company is committed to fostering a performance culture 
to increase shareholder value and to establishing George Wimpey
as a leading housebuilder in its competitive markets. In line with
these aims, the Committee sets the remuneration packages of
the Executive Directors at a level designed to attract, motivate
and retain high calibre executives, and to deliver high rewards
only on attainment of demonstrably sustained superior corporate
performance.This is achieved through a combination of salary,
an annual performance bonus, share-based long term incentives
and pension provision.
It is the policy of the Remuneration Committee that a signiﬁcant
proportion of each Executive Director’s total compensation is
delivered through performance related pay. In ﬁxing base salary 
it is also the policy of the Remuneration Committee to reward its
Executive Directors at a level equivalent to the median having
regard to levels of remuneration within the housebuilding and
other sectors.
The following chart shows the proportion of ﬁxed to performance
based remuneration. Fixed remuneration comprises annual salary.
The Company encourages and facilitates its Executive Directors
to take on Non Executive positions with other listed public limited
companies in accordance with the New Code on Corporate
Governance. Executive Directors are permitted by the Company
to retain their earnings from such positions. Peter Johnson is an
independent Non Executive Director of D S Smith Plc where 
he chairs the Audit Committee and receives an annual fee of
£43,000. Andrew Carr-Locke is an independent Non Executive
Director of AWG Plc and receives an annual fee of £30,000.
Base Salary
The salaries of Executive Directors and the Group Company
Secretary are reviewed annually by the Remuneration 
Committee which takes into account the responsibilities,
experience, market competitiveness and performance in each
position.To ascertain market competitive levels, Towers Perrin
advises the Committee on market salary levels in respect 
of each position on an annual basis. In addition the Committee’s
recommendations are sought in relation to remuneration
proposals for designated senior management.
Bonus Schemes
The Company has complied with Schedule A of the Combined
Code covering performance related remuneration.
The current UK based Executive Directors participate in an 
annual cash based short-term incentive scheme which rewards
current performance on the achievement of stretching ﬁnancial
performance targets for the Group based on proﬁt before tax.
The targets are set by the Remuneration Committee. Following
the review of peer group practices carried out by the Committee
in conjunction with Towers Perrin in 2002, the Directors’ target
annual bonus for 2004 will, as it was for 2003, be 40% of salary
with a maximum bonus payable of 100%.
Stewart Cline is a member of an annual cash bonus scheme which
is speciﬁcally tailored to the performance of Morrison Homes.
In line with with the outcome of the independent review
conducted by the Remuneration Committee in 2002, the maximum
bonus that can be paid under the scheme to Mr Cline for 2004 is
the same as it was for 2003, namely, 200% of his base salary.The
Scheme is based on targets relating to return on capital, operating
margin, growth in operating proﬁt and customer satisfaction.
Bonus payments are not pensionable for any of the 
Executive Directors.
Long Term Incentives 
The George Wimpey Long Term Incentive Plan
The Company believes that the George Wimpey Long Term

Company’s business strategy and the delivery of performance 
by key executives.The George Wimpey LTIP is designed 
to lock-in key executives and motivate them through the
opportunity to earn signiﬁcant ﬁnancial rewards on the
achievement of demanding performance targets. Awards 
under the George Wimpey LTIP are made to a limited number 
of key executives, including Executive Directors.
The maximum value of any award under the George Wimpey
LTIP is two times basic salary (for 2002 only, awards equivalent to
three times basic salary were made but were set against more
challenging performance targets as set out below). Awards will
not vest unless the pre-determined performance conditions are
satisﬁed over a three year period (the performance period).
The performance condition measures the Company’s total
shareholder return (‘TSR’) over the three year performance period
against a speciﬁc comparator group of public limited companies
made up of 23 housebuilding and building materials related
companies.The Remuneration Committee believes that TSR is the
most appropriate performance measure because it ensures that
executives do not receive rewards under the George Wimpey
LTIP unless the Company has outperformed relative to the
comparator group companies.
The comparator group
1
for the George Wimpey LTIP is:
1
Prowting Plc and Wilson Connolly Plc were taken over in 2002 and 2003
respectively and are no longer included.
For awards to vest in full, the Company’s TSR performance over 
the relevant performance period must equal or exceed the 75th
percentile performance as against the comparator group (for
awards made in 2002 the TSR performance must be equal to 
or exceed the 85th percentile). No portion of the award will 
vest if the Company’s TSR performance is less than the 50th
percentile.There will be partial vesting if the Company’s TSR
performance is at least equal to the 50th percentile. At that level
of performance, awards made in 2002 will vest as to 20% and
awards made subsequently will vest as to 25% and there will be
straight line vesting for levels of performance between the 50th
and 75th percentiles (or the 85th percentile in the case of awards
made in 2002). In addition to this performance condition, there 
is a requirement that the Company’s underlying performance,
as determined by the Remuneration Committee, should be
satisfactory. Awards under the George Wimpey LTIP are not
pensionable. Details of awards to Executive Directors are set 
out in the table on page 43.
Following the introduction of the George Wimpey LTIP in 2002,
it is Company policy that Executive Directors should not
participate in the Executive Share Option Scheme. Details of past
awards to Executive Directors under this Scheme are disclosed in
the table on page 42.

executives in Morrison Homes, including Stewart Cline, participate
in the Morrison Homes LTIP which is a cash based scheme
pursuant to which “units” are awarded to each participant
following the end of a financial year. The value of each unit,
and therefore the amount of cash that an individual receives,
will depend on growth in pre-tax and pre-interest earnings
(“PBIT”) of Morrison Homes over that financial year. The 
maximum value is achieved if PBIT grows by more than 30%.
The amount payable is, however, reduced progressively if
Morrison Homes’ Return on Assets (“RoA”) is less than 20%,
so that no amount is payable if RoA is less than 15%.
The value of the cash award is paid out over a 4 year period
commencing one year after the end of the relevant ﬁnancial 
year, with 20% of the cash award being paid in each of the 
ﬁrst 3 years of that period and the remaining 40% in the ﬁnal 
year of that period. Interest is paid out on the unpaid part 
of the award at a current rate of 6%. Certain executives of
Morrison Homes, including Stewart Cline, also participate 
in the George Wimpey LTIP and have received conditional 
awards of shares under that scheme. The Remuneration
Committee believes that participation in the George Wimpey 
LTIP and Morrison Homes LTIP will help to attract, motivate 
and retain high calibre executives to Morrison Homes, as 
well as ensure that a proportion of US senior executive 
pay is related to overall Group performance. Awards under 
the new Morrison Homes LTIP are scaled back for those
executives participating in both plans.
Sharesave Scheme
The Company operates a Savings Related Share Option Scheme
which all UK staff (including Executive Directors) with over 6
months’ service are eligible to join.
Performance Graph
Set out below is a graph which shows the total shareholder
return of the Company between the period December 1998 to
December 2003 as against the FTSE 250 (excluding investment
companies), based on 30 trading day average values.The Group
believes that the FTSE 250 is the appropriate comparator index
against which to plot its total shareholder return performance 
as the Company is a member of the index together with its key
competitors and a broad cross section of leading companies.The
graph also shows the performance of the Company as against
the George Wimpey LTIP comparator group (see opposite).
The graph shows the theoretical growth in the value of a £100
shareholding over the speciﬁed period, assuming that dividends
are re-invested to purchase additional units of equity.

Pensions 
The UK-based Executive Directors and other designated managers
are eligible to join the Executive section of the George Wimpey
Staff Pension Scheme (‘the Scheme’).The Scheme is a funded,
Inland Revenue approved, ﬁnal salary occupational pension
scheme and all members contribute 10% of salary. Executive
members cease to contribute once they have achieved 30 years’
pensionable service. Pensions in payment are guaranteed to
increase in line with the Retail Price Index to a maximum of 
5% per annum.
The Scheme provides Executive members with a pension of 
up to two-thirds of pensionable salary on retirement at age 62,
subject to the member having completed 30 years’ pensionable
service.The Company provides Peter Johnson with a pension
allowance by additional payments to him, amounting to 40%
(£204,000) of his basic salary. Andrew Carr-Locke similarly 
receives a pension allowance amounting to 35% (£99,750) 
of his basic salary. A payment of £23,302 was paid into a US 
cash plan for Mr Cline.
In addition, life assurance of four times basic salary and a pension
of two-thirds of the member’s entitlement for spouses on their
death in service, or in retirement, are provided, together with a
children’s allowance of up to 100% of the dependant’s pension 
for three or more children.
Pensionable salary excludes all bonuses, beneﬁts in kind and
incentive related remuneration. For early retirement, prior to age
62 and after age 50, pensions will be reduced by an appropriate
actuarial factor.
The Directors’ accrued pensions in 2003 are shown on page 41.
Service Contracts – Executive Directors 
It is the Company’s policy that all Executive Directors should 
have rolling service contracts with a one year notice period in
accordance with best practice.The Company’s normal retirement
age for Executive Directors is 60 and the service contracts
terminate automatically when this age is attained unless
extended by mutual consent.
Peter Johnson, Andrew Carr-Locke and Stewart Cline each have
service contracts dated 26 March 2002, 27 March 2002 and 10
April 2003 respectively. Each contract can be terminated by not
less than 12 months notice either way.The Company may, at its
discretion, make a payment in lieu of notice equal to basic salary
and the cost of providing other beneﬁts under the contract for
the period the contract would have continued. In the event of 
a change of control of the Company, the Director may, within 
6 months of such change, elect to terminate the service contract
on 3 months’ notice and be paid a termination payment of the
value of his annual remuneration and beneﬁts package (not
including any option grants).The purpose of this change of control
provision is to ensure that the Director is not disincentivised
should such a situation so arise. During 2003 Peter Johnson,
Andrew Carr-Locke and Stewart Cline agreed to vary their
contract (without compensation) so as to reduce the amount 
of compensation that may be payable on a change of control
from twice the value of their respective annual remuneration
down to an amount equivalent to one year’s remuneration.
The Chairman/Non Executive Directors
The Remuneration Committee has the responsibility of setting
the remuneration of the Chairman, which is then submitted 
to the Board for approval in the absence of the Chairman.
The Remuneration of the Non Executive Directors is determined 
by the Board.Towers Perrin provide independent advice on
appropriate levels of remuneration. Remuneration is paid in the
form of ﬁxed fees, which are reviewed annually. Non Executive
Directors are invited, but not obliged, to use any increase in their
remuneration to purchase shares in the Company. Neither the
Chairman nor the Non Executive Directors participate in any
incentive or share schemes.
Neither the Chairman nor the Non Executive Directors have
service contracts.The services of John Robinson, Michael
Blackburn and Christine Cross are contracted to the Company
under consultancy agreements dated 5 April 2001, 1 April 2000
and 11 January 2004 respectively.The agreements provide that
each Director will continue to serve the Company unless
terminated by not less than 6 months’ notice is given by either
party. However, in the event that a Director is not re-elected as 
a Director by the Company’s shareholders or is removed from
ofﬁce by them in accordance with the Company’s Articles of
Association, then the relevant agreement will terminate with 
no provision for compensation.
David Williams and Brenda Dean have letters of appointment 
which appoint them with effect from 1 May 2001 and 7 October
2003 respectively.These engagements continue until terminated
by not less than 6 months’ notice given by either party or otherwise
in accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association. George Wimpey Plc Annual Report 2003 41

The deferred bonus was paid under the Morrison Homes Long Term Compensation Plan, which was replaced during 2003 by the Morrison Homes Long Term Incentive 
Plan (as approved by shareholders at the 2003 Annual General Meeting) and through the participation by Stewart Cline and certain other senior Morrison Homes
executives in the George Wimpey LTIP (subject to the scaling back of awards as explained on page 39). Under the Morrison Homes Long Term Compensation Plan, units
were granted annually at the beginning of the year and then valued at the end of that ﬁrst year. Payments to participants commence one year after the valuation of 
the units and conclude four years after the ﬁrst year payment. Stewart Cline’s current interest in the scheme amounts to $2,561,572. No equity is involved in the Plan.
As reported last year, upon winding up of this plan, units previously awarded under the Plan have vested but will not become payable any earlier as a result of such
vesting except in accordance with the rules of the Plan.

Keith Cushen resigned as a Director on 31 December 2003. He will be engaged as a consultant to the Company providing 100 days of services per annum. Keith Cushen
will be paid £140,000 for his services calculated by reference to his outgoing salary and pro rated accordingly. In addition, Keith Cushen’s 2002 LTIP award will partially
vest as explained on page 43.

NOTES:
The above awards will not vest in whole or in part unless pre-determined performance conditions are satisfied over a three year period. The awards are therefore
conditional awards and the table above sets out the maximum number of shares that can be awarded.The performance conditions are explained in detail on pages 38 
and 39. Conditional awards were made on 1 May 2003 with a performance period of 1 January 2003 to 31 December 2005.The number of awards was calculated by
reference to a formula based on two times salary as at 1 January 2003 and using a price of 251.21p being the value calculated in accordance with the scheme rules.
For the 2002 award, for Peter Johnson and Andrew Carr-Locke, the formula was based on three times salary as at 1 January 2002 and using a share price of 220p being 
the value calculated in accordance with the scheme rules. For Stewart Cline, the 2003 award was calculated by reference to a formula based on one and half times his
salary as at 1 January 2003 and a share price of 220p.

Keith Cushen retired as a Director on 31 December 2003, two thirds through the three year performance period applicable to the the 2002 conditional award to him 
of 409,091 shares.Taking into account Keith Cushen’s outstanding contribution to the Company, the Remuneration Committee resolved in 2003 that he should be awarded 
at the time of retirement an amount of shares equal to two thirds of his 2002 conditional award subject to the Company’s TSR performance over that two year period as
against its comparator group. Based on independent veriﬁcation, the Company’s TSR performance over that period made it the highest ranking company within the comparator
group (see page 39) which thus entitled Keith Cushen to receive an amount equal to the full two thirds (272,727 shares) which will be distributed to him by the employee trust
in February 2004, outside the Company’s close period.The market value will be calculated by reference to the mid market closing price at that time.The Remuneration
Committee also resolved that, due to his outstanding contribution, subject to the Company’s TSR performance during the period 1 January 2002 to 31 December 2004 
(i.e. the complete performance period) a further distribution of the balance of Keith Cushen’s 2002 award (a maximum of 136,364 shares) may be made to Keith Cushen 
in 2005. Any award made in this respect will be disclosed in the 2004 ﬁnancial statements.

Keith Cushen’s 2003 conditional award of 262,736 shares lapsed in full upon his retirement on 31 December 2003, in accordance with the rules of the George Wimpey LTIP .

Basis of preparation
The Group Accounts are prepared on the historical cost basis 
of accounting.They have been drawn up in accordance with
applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom.
Basis of consolidation
The Group Accounts consolidate the accounts of George Wimpey
PLC and all its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 31 December
each year. Undertakings, other than subsidiary undertakings,
over which the Group exerts signiﬁcant inﬂuence, are treated 
as associated undertakings.The Group Accounts include the
appropriate share of these undertakings’ results and reserves
based on audited accounts to 31 December 2003.
Turnover
Housing turnover comprises the value of new houses and land
sales legally completed during the year. Other turnover is based
on the invoiced value of goods and services supplied during the
year.Turnover excludes value added tax and intra-group turnover.
Proﬁt
Operating proﬁt comprises new houses and land sales. Housing
proﬁt is taken only when legal completion has taken place.
Depreciation
Depreciation is provided on all tangible ﬁxed assets at rates
calculated to write off the cost or valuation of each asset evenly
over its expected useful life as follows:
Ofﬁces occupied by the Group:
Freehold buildings and long leaseholds in excess of 50 years
– over 50 years
Short leaseholds
– over the period of the lease.
Plant and equipment:
– over the expected useful life of the assets ranging mainly 
from 3 to 5 years.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the
fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of the
identiﬁable net assets acquired. Historical goodwill has been
written off to reserves in the year in which it arose. Goodwill now
arising on acquisitions is capitalised, and amortised through the
proﬁt and loss account over its useful economic life.
Taxation
Provision is made for deferred tax assets and liabilities arising
from timing differences between the recognition of gains and
losses in the ﬁnancial statements and their recognition for tax
purposes. Deferred tax assets are only recognised where it is
more likely than not that they will be recovered. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Stock
Land held for development and construction work in progress
are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Other stock
comprises materials, equipment and goods for resale valued at
the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost includes
appropriate overheads.
Retirement beneﬁts
Pension costs are charged to the proﬁt and loss account so as 
to spread the cost of pensions at a substantially level percentage
of payroll costs over the expected lives of members.
Operating leases
Operating lease rentals are charged to the proﬁt and loss account
in equal amounts over the lease term.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate 
ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at
closing rates of exchange or the relevant forward rate where
applicable. All differences are taken to the proﬁt and loss account.
On consolidation, the trading results of overseas subsidiary and
associated undertakings are translated at the average rate for the
year and the balance sheets at the closing rate. Exchange
differences arising on the retranslation of opening balance
sheets, together with the difference between proﬁt and loss
accounts translated at average rates and closing rates, are dealt
with through reserves.
Translation differences on intra-group currency loans and foreign
currency borrowings, to the extent that they are used to ﬁnance
or provide a hedge against Group equity investments in foreign
enterprises, are taken directly to reserves together with the
exchange difference on the carrying amount of the related
investments. All other translation differences are taken to the
proﬁt and loss account.
Financial instruments
Derivative foreign exchange instruments that are deemed
hedges of speciﬁc foreign currency assets/liabilities are matched
against the underlying asset or liability. Derivative interest rate
instruments are matched within interest payable or receivable
over the life of the instrument or relevant interest period. Interest
rate instruments are not recognised in the balance sheet.
Changes in fair value of ﬁnancial instruments are not recognised
in the proﬁt and loss account or balance sheet.

The assets employed by Laing Homes in 2002 are net of the deferred consideration then due of £207.6 million (note 15). Laing Homes Limited was acquired on
1November 2002. In 2002 Laing Homes contributed an operating proﬁt of £20 million, less exceptional restructuring costs of £5.9 million, resulting in an
operating proﬁt after exceptional restructuring costs of £14.1 million.

7 Earnings per Ordinary Share
The calculation of the basic earnings per ordinary share is based on the proﬁt attributable to ordinary shareholders divided by the average number of shares 
in issue during the year of 380.6 million (2002 375.3 million).
Diluted earnings per ordinary share is 67.06p (2002 50.04p).The calculation is based on the proﬁt attributable to ordinary shareholders divided by the average
number of shares in issue plus the dilutive potential ordinary shares amounting to 8.4 million (2002 7.6 million) shares.The dilutive potential ordinary shares
relate to shares allotted under employee share schemes where the fair value price exceeds the option price.
The 2002 basic earnings per share before exceptional items is calculated on the proﬁt attributable to ordinary shareholders excluding an adjustment for
operating exceptional items of £5.9 million, net of taxation, divided by the average number of shares in issue during the year of 375.3 million.The 2002 diluted
earnings per ordinary share before exceptional items is similarly adjusted.The adjusted earnings per share excludes exceptional items as they do not relate to
the proﬁtability of the Group on an ongoing basis.There were no exceptional items in 2003.
The calculation of shareholders’ funds per ordinary share is based on shareholders’ funds for the Group at the end of the year divided by the number of shares
in issue at the end of the year of 384.1 million (2002 377.2 million).

9 Pension Arrangements
The Group operates one deﬁned beneﬁt UK pension scheme and two overseas schemes.The assets of the schemes are held in separate Trustee administered
funds.The largest, which is in the UK, is the George Wimpey Staff Pension Scheme (the George Wimpey Scheme), and is of the funded, deﬁned beneﬁt type 
and is closed to new entrants (for new employees in the UK, George Wimpey pays contributions into stakeholder pension arrangements). The Trustees are
George Wimpey Pension Trustees Limited and the Law Debenture Trust Corporation plc.The George Wimpey Scheme is subject to triennial valuation by
independent actuaries, the last such valuation being carried out as at 5 April 2002, using the projected unit method. Details of this valuation are described below.
The actuarial assumptions which have the most signiﬁcant effect are those relating to return on investment, the rate of increase in salaries and the assumed
rate of pension increases. In the 5 April 2002 valuation it was assumed that the investment return prior to retirement would exceed price inﬂation by 4.5% per
annum, and post retirement by 3.5% per annum. Salary increases were assumed to exceed price inﬂation by 2.0% per annum. Pension increases were assumed
to be in line with price inﬂation.The market value of assets was £523 million, and this ﬁgure was 8% below the amount required to cover the beneﬁts that had
accrued to the members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.The shortfall under the SSAP 24 assumption is allocated to operating proﬁt
over the average remaining service life of current employees. Details of the funding valuation are referred to in the Operating and Financial Review on page 27.
The group has paid contributions of £17.3 million to the George Wimpey Scheme in 2003.This ﬁgure includes contributions made by the Group in respect 
of former employees of Laing Homes, who joined the George Wimpey scheme with effect from 1 November 2003. Employee contributions for Laing Homes
George Wimpey scheme members are being phased in up to 1 January 2006. As part of the terms of their transfer these members paid reduced employee
contributions equal to 1% of scheme salary for the period 1 November 2003 to 31 December 2003.
The total pension costs for the Group were £13.5 million (2002 £12.4 million) of which £0.8 million (2002 £0.8 million) related to overseas schemes.The prepayment 
in the balance sheet resulting from the difference in the amounts charged to the proﬁt and loss account and the amounts paid to the Scheme was £15.4 million
(2002 £9.1 million).
No signiﬁcant improvements in beneﬁts were made in 2003. Contributions in respect of non-Laing Homes employees were paid at a rate of 31.8% of scheme
salary over 2003 (21.2% of scheme salary from 1 November 2003 for former Laing Homes employees). It has been agreed with the Trustees that contributions of
40% of scheme salary will be paid throughout 2004 in respect of non-Laing Homes employees (subject to a minimum rate of 13.2% of scheme salary plus £15
million per annum). In respect of former Laing Homes employees, contributions will be paid at a rate of 20.2% of scheme salary throughout 2004.
On a Financial Reporting Standard (FRS) 17 basis, the valuation position of the George Wimpey Scheme was updated from the most recent actuarial valuation
to 31 December 2003 by a qualiﬁed independent actuary. The valuation at 31 December 2003 showed an increase in the deﬁcit from £115 million to £130
million after the related deferred tax asset. Financial Reporting Standard (FRS) 17 on Retirement Beneﬁts requires the following disclosures in 2003.

Interest rates – US$33 million of the US$63.8 million private placement has effectively been swapped into ﬂoating US$ interest rates based on a margin over 
6 months US$ LIBOR.The remaining US$30.8 million is at a ﬁxed coupon averaging 7.8%.The US$320 million private placement is at a ﬁxed averaged interest
rate of 6.13%. US$100 million of this private placement has been swapped into rates which are ﬁxed for approximately 3 years at a rate of 4.83% with the
remaining period ﬂoating. US$10 million has been swapped into ﬂoating rates.The £30 million tranche of the private placement is at a ﬁxed rate of 6.8%.
The US$150 million private placement arranged this year is swapped into ﬂoating rates with US$70 million ﬁxed for one year at an average rate of 2.0% and
US$80 million ﬁxed for 2 years at an average rate of 2.74%.

at ﬂoating rates of interest based on margins over Base Rate or the equivalent short term measure in the currencies concerned. Bank borrowings in excess 
of 1 year (£210.7 million) are on ﬂoating rate borrowing based on a margin over LIBOR in the currencies concerned. £190 million of ﬂoating rate bank borrowings

21 Interest Rate and Currency Hedges
As explained in the Operating and Financial Review on page 26, the Group’s policy is to hedge part of the interest rate risk and transactional currency exposure.
Gains and losses on interest rate and currency hedges are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is itself recorded. Unrecognised and deferred
gains and losses on interest and currency instruments used for hedging, and the movements therein, are as follows:

22 Currency Exposure and Analysis of Net Assets
The Group’s principal subsidiaries have little transactional currency exposure as they neither export goods nor import any material amount of products nor
have any signiﬁcant level of intra-group trading or provision of services. Consequently, none of the principal subsidiaries has any material net foreign currency
monetary assets/liabilities by reference to their local currencies and hence the amount of foreign exchange differences included in the Group proﬁt and loss
account for 2002 and 2003 was not material.
The table below provides a currency analysis of the net assets of the Group:

Total Net Assets 1,699.2 (529.2) 1,170.0 1,318.6 (375.6) 943.0
23 Fair Values
The fair value is deﬁned as the amount at which a ﬁnancial instrument could be exchanged in an arm’s length transaction between informed and willing
parties, excluding accrued interest, and is calculated by reference to market rates discounted to current value. Where market values are not available, fair values
have been calculated by discounting cash ﬂows at prevailing interest and exchange rates. All debt and ﬁnancial instruments used to manage the interest rate
and currency of borrowings with a maturity of less than three months after the balance sheet date are assumed to have a fair value equal to the book value.
The book values are the amounts recorded in the balance sheet. Financial liability provisions relate to rental guarantees as set out in note 25. Under the Group’s
accounting policy, foreign currency assets and liabilities that are hedged using currency swaps are translated at the forward rate inherent in the contracts.
Consequently, the book value of the relevant asset or liability effectively includes the fair value of the hedging instrument. For the purpose of the table below,
the book value of the relevant asset or liability is shown gross of the effect of the hedging instrument.

Auditors’ Report
Independent Auditors’ Report to the members 
of George Wimpey Plc
We have audited the ﬁnancial statements which comprise the
Group proﬁt and loss account, the balance sheets, the Group cash
ﬂow statement, the statement of Group total recognised gains
and losses, the reconciliation of movement in Group shareholders’
funds, accounting policies and the related notes. We have also
audited the disclosures required by Part 3 of Schedule 7A to the
Companies Act 1985 contained in the Directors’ Remuneration
Report (‘the auditable part’).
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report,
the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the ﬁnancial statements
in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and accounting
standards are set out in the statement of Directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the ﬁnancial statements and the
auditable part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report in accordance
with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and United
Kingdom Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices
Board.This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for
and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance
with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other
purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to
whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come
save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the ﬁnancial
statements give a true and fair view and whether the ﬁnancial
statements and the auditable part of the Directors’ Remuneration
Report have been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985.We also report to you if, in our opinion, the
directors’ report is not consistent with the ﬁnancial statements,
if the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we
have not received all the information and explanations we
require for our audit, or if information speciﬁed by law regarding
Directors’ remuneration and transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the annual report
and consider the implications for our report if we become aware
of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with
the ﬁnancial statements.The other information comprises only
the Chairman’s Statement, Chief Executive’s Review, Operating
and Financial Review, Board of Directors, Corporate Social
Responsibility, Director’s Report, Corporate Governance and the
Remuneration Report.
We review whether the Corporate Governance statement reﬂects 
the Company’s compliance with the seven provisions of the
Combined Code speciﬁed for our review by the Listing Rules 
of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not.
We are not required to consider whether the board’s statements
on internal control cover all risks and controls, or to form an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company’s or Group’s corporate
governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
Basis of Audit Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing 
standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant 
to the amounts and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements 
and the auditable part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report.
It also includes an assessment of the signiﬁcant estimates and
judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the
ﬁnancial statements, and of whether the accounting policies 
are appropriate to the company’s circumstances, consistently
applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary 
in order to provide us with sufﬁcient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the ﬁnancial statements and the auditable part 
of the Directors’ Remuneration Report are free from material
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or
error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy
of the presentation of information in the ﬁnancial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view of the 
state of affairs of the Company and the Group at 31 December
2003 and of the proﬁt and cash ﬂows of the Group for the year
then ended;
the ﬁnancial statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
those parts of the Directors’ Remuneration Report required by

Under section 80 of the Companies Act 1985, the Directors

Resolution 8 will authorise the Directors to issue new shares 
up to the lower of one third of the amount of the nominal value
of the issued share capital of the Company as at the date of this
Notice – i.e. up to a value of £32,017,837 or the amount of the
nominal value of the authorised but unissued share capital of 
the Company.The authority will expire 5 years after the date of

Building a strong business 
for the future... George Wim pey Plc 2003 Corporate
Social Responsibility Report
Making Progress... Chairman & Chief Executive’s Introduction
We are pleased to introduce the second 
George Wimpey Corporate Social Responsibility
Report. During 2003 we have continued to take
our duty to behave responsibly towards all our
stakeholders very seriously.
Central to the way we do business are our 
core values of integrity and respect. All our
businesses operate within policies which are
designed to ensure fair and ethical treatment 
of our customers, employees, subcontractors
and other business partners. We believe 
we should act responsibly towards all our
stakeholders, including the communities 
in which we build homes, not because we
have to, but because we believe it is right.

their corporate social responsibility (CSR)
activities separately. During 2003 Laing Homes
has been fully integrated as a division of our 
UK business and George Wimpey practices and
procedures, particularly in health and safety and
environmental management and training, have
been adopted.
Strengthening our commitment to CSR, during
2003 we set up a new Board Committee, chaired
by Christine Cross, which is responsible for
reinforcing and informing the Group’s approach
to CSR.
Last year we highlighted speciﬁc targets to be
measured and reported on as key performance
indicators. We have restated last year’s promises
and clearly measured the progress that has been
made.Where appropriate new targets for action
in 2004 have been added.
Going Forward
During 2004 we will continue to strengthen 
our approach towards CSR across the Group.
Led by the CSR Committee we will develop a
framework within the Group for deepening 
our understanding of what it means to be ‘a
responsible housebuilder’ . At the same time the
Committee will ensure that all CSR activities
make good business sense for our shareholders.
We remain committed to transparent CSR
reporting and to monitoring, reviewing and
improving our performance.We believe we have
built on last year’s achievements but understand
that sustainability will not be achieved quickly
and we still have many steps to take.

take our responsibilities in 
this area extremely seriously.

Our Focus
In 2002, a thorough
investigation of accident trends
identiﬁed that our workers were
at greatest risk from:
•
Falls from height – the most
common cause of fatal and
major injury to construction
workers, according to the 
UK’s Health and Safety
Executive (HSE).
•
On-site trafﬁc incidents.
•
Being struck by falling objects.
We developed an extensive
action programme to target
these priority areas.This resulted
in a signiﬁcant reduction of 
the number of accidents in
these areas during 2003.We
focused on improved training,
awareness campaigns and
signiﬁcant investment in
suitable safety equipment.
New Developments
In 2003, we fully integrated
Laing Homes with the existing
George Wimpey health and
safety approaches, we updated
procedures and provided 
intensive training to 100 percent
of our site management teams.
Many of the safety issues
encountered during
construction can be reduced or
eliminated during the design
process.We continually review
our house designs to identify
where we can improve safety.
In 2003, we ran a series of
bespoke national health and
safety training courses for our
internal design teams and
external design companies.
We also trained 2,800
employees and contractors 
in the use of a new fall arrest
system and 900 in the use of
safety nets.
Award Winning Safety
In 2003, we received a
prestigious UK Construction
Health and Safety Group award
for ‘Contribution to Health and
Safety Training and Improved
Standards’ . In addition, one of
our employees won the HSE’s
highly coveted Working Well
Together Campaign’s Number
One Worker award in 2003.
We run annual regional and
national safety competitions 
to promote and reward best
practice and to recognise 
sub-contractors for notable
safety practices.
Stakeholder Engagement
In 2003, we engaged with 
site managers, contractors,
suppliers and other
organisations to identify 
and assess potential health 
and safety risks.We will use 
this information to further
improve our systems and also
the efforts of our contractors.
George Wimpey UK works
closely with the HSE and
housebuilding industry
organisations. We have
representation on the
Construction Industry Training
Board (CITB) and House
Building Federation (HBF)
health, safety and environment
committees.We are working
with the HBF and other
housebuilders to introduce an

2003 CASE STUDIES
1. NEW UK FALL PROTECTION
SYSTEMS INTRODUCED
Previous UK accident ﬁgures
highlighted the fact that falls
from height pose the greatest
danger to workers. Over the
past few years, we have
introduced a range of new
safety features.These include a
new scaffolding speciﬁcation
that exceeds current British
safety standards, mobile
working platforms and soft
landing systems.
We introduced improved
stairwell protection in 2003 to
prevent workers from falling
down open staircases, having
identiﬁed this as one of the
remaining areas of potential
risk. As of January 2004, all UK
sites will use a proprietary
system to provide increased
safety and complete protection
against falls into stairwell voids.
2.TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT
PLANS REMAIN KEY FOCUS
Vehicle-related injuries are
some of the housebuilding
industry’s most serious
accidents. We have detailed
clear policies and procedures
on trafﬁc management. Our 
key focus is developing site
trafﬁc management plans,
segregating vehicles from
pedestrians and installing 
safe crossing points.We design
each of our compounds and
sites to achieve effective 
on-site trafﬁc management.
We also work closely 
with UK and European
manufacturers to enhance 
the safety of current machines
and next generation telescopic
handlers.We undertook a 
series of telehandler operator
competency audits in 2003 
and will ensure that, by the end
of January 2004, all operators
will have been audited.

Morrison Homes
“In comparison to 90 percent 
of other homebuilders,
Morrison Homes is way ahead
of its competition in making
advancements to its health 
and safety programme.”
Mike McCarroll, CSP , President and
CEO, PROSAFE Solutions Inc.
The comprehensive Morrison
Homes Safety Program Manual
forms the basis of our proactive
safety programme.Written and
regularly updated for us by
external consultants PROSAFE,
the manual covers Morrison
Homes procedures and US
safety regulation as laid down
by the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration (OSHA).
Our HAZCOM programme
provides detailed guidance on
the ingredients of potentially
hazardous materials. HAZCOM
helps us to use materials safely
and take immediate action if 
an accident occurs.
Our Focus
In 2003, our primary areas of
focus were:
•
Training for employees and
sub-contractors.
•
Compliance and monitoring
(including weekly and
quarterly safety inspections).
•
Adopt policies and
procedures for a positive 
fall protection system to
reduce the danger of falls in
homes under construction.
In 2003 we re-designed our
weekly safety reports to
include more speciﬁc items 
for inspection. We also
designed a Scored Safety 
Audit programme for every
site which was implemented 
at the beginning of 2004. Local
senior managers inspect and
score every site on a quarterly
basis for safety compliance.
Accident Reporting
We use accident statistics to
measure and improve safety.
All accidents must be reported
and dealt with according to
company procedures.We
analyse incident reports and,
where relevant, identify
preventative measures and
procedural improvements.
In 2003, we changed from a
quarterly to a monthly safety
reporting system in order to

We continue to run our
Contractor Awareness
Program, which was started 
in 2002.This programme
teaches sub-contractors 
about our safety procedures
and objectives.
In addition, relevant employees
in each division attend at least
one day of health and safety
training per year. Customers
often visit their new home
during construction, so it is
vital that our managers and
sales staff can identify and
avoid potential dangers.
Future Targets
In 2004, we will seek British
Safety Council health and
safety accreditation in the UK.
In 2004, as well as continuing
the focus on the priority areas
highlighted in 2003, we will
turn our attention to slips, trips
and falls. Incidents in this area
accounted for 45 percent of 
all our reportable accidents
during 2003.
Morrison Homes will continue
to focus on reducing the risk 
of falls from height. As of 
2004, we aim to provide 
100 percent of our new
builders with a 10-hour OSHA
certiﬁcation course within 
90 days of employment 
and will report annually 
on our performance.

FALL PROTECTION SYSTEMS
At Morrison Homes, we have
identiﬁed falls from height as
the area of greatest risk for
employees, sub-contractors,
customers, estate agents and
the general public. To minimise
the danger to workers and
visitors, we use a system of
steel guardrails in all houses 
of two or more storeys.
We believe that our interior fall
protection system is one of the
best safety systems used by
the US housebuilding industry.
Other fall protection measures
for workers include roof and
truss anchors, body harnesses,
bracket and stacked scaffolds,
and safety straps.
develop and enhance our
mandatory site safety training
programmes. Morrison Homes
Building Excellence, our
orientation course for new
builders, includes health and
safety considerations. All ﬁeld
construction personnel and
senior management also
undertake a 10-hour OSHA
certiﬁcation programme.
Every month, we produce
monthly ‘toolbox’ safety topics
for our builders to present to
all site workers.The toolbox
talks, an OSHA requirement,
cover aspects of site safety.

1. TRANSFORMING THE METRO
George Wimpey West London’s
Metro development in Slough
is on the site of a former 
Local Authority depot.
We demolished old buildings,
remediated the contaminated
site and benchmarked the
development against the
Government’s Movement for
Innovation environmental
performance indicators.
Our house and apartment
designs exceed building
regulations, use a range of
energy and water efﬁciency
measures, and include
photovoltaic roof tiles to
capture solar energy. The site
includes a wetland feature,
Home Zone areas, live-work
units, bicycle storage, bottle
bank facilities and communal
outdoor spaces.
•
Provide employees and sub-
contractors with awareness
and environmental
management training.
•
Use the results of inspection,
audit and incident reports to
improve UK performance.
•
Engage with the Environment
Agency, industry and other
stakeholders to ﬁnd
environmentally preferable
solutions that are practical
and affordable.
•
Strive to minimise waste and
maximise energy efﬁciency.
•
Keep our regional
management teams informed
about environmental
innovations and encourage
them to try out and learn
from new initiatives.
•
Maximise our companies’
positive environmental
impacts, particularly in the
area of land regeneration.
Environmental Management
Our EMS focuses on practical
control and management of
environmental risks. It is
externally veriﬁed by
environmental auditors RSK
ENSR Environment Ltd.The EMS
includes our pioneering Guide
to the Assessment, Remediation
and Validation of Land, which 
has been adopted as a National
House Building Council (NHBC)
industry standard.
Land Remediation
Re-using previously derelict or
contaminated land for modern,
energy efﬁcient housing has
positive environmental and
social impacts. In 2003, 67
percent of our developments
were built on brownﬁeld land,
exceeding the UK Government
target of 60 percent by 2008.
Furthermore, 48 percent of 
our developments transformed
land that was previously
contaminated with industrial 
or hazardous waste.
Enhancing Biodiversity
By the end of 2003, we achieved
a target of 100 percent of 
our sites operating with a 
Site Specific Environmental
Action Plan. Drawn up before
construction begins, these 
plans identify site-specific
ecological issues and ensure the
protection and enhancement 
of protected species.
A signiﬁcant number of our
developments have involved
biodiversity measures. Recent
projects include working with
stakeholders to:
•
Protect bats, badgers, birds,
newts, grass snakes and 
water voles.
•
Retain trees and 
protected plants.
•
Create ponds, reed beds,
parks, woodlands and 
wildlife areas.
•
Protect watercourses and
enhance river corridors and
ﬂood plains.
Staff and Contractor Training
George Wimpey UK trains 
all relevant personnel in
environmental issues, from
production teams and site 
staff to architects, buyers and
regional managing directors.
In 2002, we identiﬁed the
importance of training sub-
contractors and, in particular,
our groundworks, roads, sewers
and demolition contractors.
During 2003, 389 contractors
attended national seminars
developed by George Wimpey
UK in conjunction with the
Environment Agency.
Also in 2003, we integrated 
the George Wimpey UK and
Laing Homes approaches to
environmental management
and provided training for 
100 percent of relevant 
Laing Homes employees.
In 2003 a total of 1,074 
people received environmental
training from GWUK, building
on the 1,027 people trained 
in 2002.

Waste Management
Working in partnership with
specialists Wasteﬁle, we strive 
to ﬁnd sustainable waste
management solutions. Our key
aims are to encourage waste
reduction, re-use and recycling
in preference to waste disposal.
We make signiﬁcant efforts to
measure our construction
waste in collaboration with
Wasteﬁle.We measure the
tonnage of waste produced 
per unit completed per month
and use the data to identify
excessive or unnecessary 
waste streams and ﬁnd ways 
of further reducing waste.
We tackle our waste streams on
several fronts. First, we work with
our major suppliers to reduce
waste at source. For example,
we ask our plasterboard
suppliers to investigate whether 
waste can be reduced further
through design and better
working practices.We also ask
our timber manufacturers to
pre-size materials, in order to
decrease on-site waste.
Secondly, we operate a waste
segregation system on our sites
and separate out materials for
re-use or recycling. Our timber
segregation increased by 
130 percent during 2003 and
the resulting wood waste was
delivered to processors for 
re-use in a variety of products.
We increased plasterboard
waste segregation by 
21 percent during 2003 and
are working with suppliers 
to increase the amount of
plasterboard recycled by 
their industry. We also
increased compactable 
waste segregation by 
5.4 percent and sent paper
and cardboard waste to 
paper processors for re-use.
Eco-friendly Homes
George Wimpey UK seeks 
to maximise the Standard
Assessment Procedure ratings 
of new houses as far as is
practical and affordable. We 
use energy efﬁcient appliances,
dual ﬂush toilets and comply
with all building regulations. In
addition, many of our sites have
integrated features such as:
•
Home Zone areas giving
pedestrians priority over cars.
•
Reduced car parking 
spaces and increased 
access to public transport 
and cycle paths.
•
Secure bicycle storage.
•
Recycling, composting and
communal waste facilities.
•
Home ofﬁce space.
•
Renewable energy
technologies.
Incident Reduction
All environmental incidents
must be reported.We have
detailed incident response
procedures and provide 
access to a 24-hour hotline 
for emergency support 
and response. Our incident
reporting system helps us to
identify problem areas and
develop solutions.
Recent Environmental
Awareness Campaigns run 
by George Wimpey UK have
resulted in a signiﬁcant annual
reduction in incidents within
targeted areas, as follows:
•
Fuel spillage 29% 
•
Waste disposal 36% 
•
Silt run off 46% 
We have also seen a marked
increase in the use of our

2. BIODIVERSITY A T WORK IN
GLOUCESTERSHIRE
Stonehouse in Gloucestershire
is a key UK habitat for great
crested newts. We discovered
that a two-acre pond on 
Laing Homes’ Stonehouse
development had one of the
largest populations of these
newts in the country.
Working with Gloucestershire
Wildlife Trust, our engineers
designed a newt-friendly 
road drainage system with 
silt traps to stop newts from
being trapped and drowned 
in gullies.
We also undertook remedial
work on the pond and its
surrounding area, and put 
up protective barriers to
contain and protect the 
newt population.

We are working in partnership
with Wasteﬁle UK and other
industry stakeholders to further
our waste management 
aims. We support Ecobond
International by providing
segregated waste for use 
in composite construction
products which the company 
is developing.We are piloting
Wastefile’s Fold-a-Skip®
system to help us measure 
our waste more effectively
and increase segregation for
recycling. In addition, we are
the first housebuilder to use
Glacier ARM, which aims to
use selected waste to produce
alternative raw materials for
cement production. This will 
re-use waste materials and
subsequently reduce the
amount of waste sent to landﬁll.

environmental helpline, which
provides advice that helps us 
to prevent potential incidents.
The same series of campaigns 
is currently running within 
Laing Homes.
Morrison Homes
Land acquisitions almost
always involve greenfield 
sites and ‘selling to build’
rather than ‘building to sell’.
Consequently, we have
different environmental
constraints in the US.
Nevertheless, Morrison Homes
takes its environmental
responsibilities seriously.
Employees are expected to
comply with all federal, state
and local laws and are required
to report any actual or potential
legal violations to management.
A key part of our approach 
to the environment is 
the requirement that
environmental risks be 
properly assessed during the
due diligence stage of land
acquisition. Contamination,
presence of hazardous
substances, noise issues and the
proximity of restricted habitat
or endangered species are
among the issues considered
during risk assessment.
Biological assessments of local
plants, wildlife and habitats are 
also required under certain
circumstances.This helps us 
to identify and avoid potential
environmental problems.
In addition to complying 
with legislation, we will take
steps to exceed our legal
responsibilities when it makes
business sense to do so.
Environmental protection 
can, for example, enhance 
the aesthetic appeal or
desirability of properties.
One illustration of this is the
strict US federal government
regulations concerning erosion
control to prevent undue
amounts of silt from entering
local creeks and streams.
Morrison employees are
expected to follow these
regulations not only as a matter
of legal compliance, but also
because clean communities
help to sell homes.
Another example relates to the
site plan for a new community
in Round Rock, Texas, which
called for a road to be built
through a sizeable stand of
mature oaks. Rather than 
cut down the oak trees, our
Austin Division suggested an
alternative proposal to the City
of Round Rock.The City agreed
that we could transplant the
original oaks and thereby
preserve more than forty trees.
The community benefited 
from houses built among
mature, full-canopied oak 
trees and our solution was 
cost effective because the 
City of Round Rock would 
have required us to plant new
trees to replace any mature
trees that were cut down.
Morrison Homes has
responded to growing
concerns about ozone
depletion and US
Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) regulations 
over the production and 
use of certain refrigerants
such as R-22 (Freon). We 
have entered into national
partnerships with Lennox
International and Carrier
Corporation who have
developed environmentally
preferable Freon-free,
heating, ventilation and 
air-conditioning (HVAC)
systems.We are working to
introduce these systems into 
all new homes over the next
two to three years. We will
report on our progress in 
our 2004 CSR report.

CSR-related supply chain issues
as they affect the Group.

industry debate.There has been
an indication that the use of
sustainably grown natural
timber would be preferable 
to the use of manufactured
materials. We ﬁnd it more
practical and cost effective to
use MDF or chipboard in certain
circumstances. However, to
ensure that our materials are
environmentally sensitive, all our
MDF and chipboard is made
from timber residues or off-cuts.
Our MDF suppliers have Forest
Stewardship Council (FSC)
accreditation and our chipboard
supplier has ISO14001
environmental accreditation.
Future Targets
George Wimpey UK is currently
undertaking a survey of
suppliers’ environmental 
and sustainability policies 
with a view to seeing how
environmental concerns might
be better integrated into our
supply chain policies.
While we have traditionally 
taken a self-assessment
approach to environmental
management, in 2004 we will
undertake a full gap and cost
beneﬁt analysis of seeking
accreditation to ISO14001.
Morrison Homes will focus on
fully converting to Freon-free
HVAC systems within the next
three years.
6. COMMUNITY-BASED
INITIA TIVES FROM MORRISON
California is well known 
for environmentalism and
Morrison Homes’ Sacramento
Division has responded to
several community-based
initiatives to protect the
environment and reduce
energy usage.
In 2002, Morrison was one 
of the initial contributors 
to the ‘Adopt-a-Storm 
Drain’ programme, which
educates the general 
public about the adverse
effects of introducing
pollutants into storm drains.
In 2003, we added to 
this programme by 
taking responsibility for
maintaining two sections 
of roadside as part of a 
similar,‘Adopt-a-Highway’
initiative in California.
Along with the two 
miles of highway, our
Sacramento Division
adopted a one
mile segment of
the American
River Parkway,
which is a paved
trail for use by
walkers, cyclists
and horse
riders. Our

2003 CASE STUDY
Part of our vision is to be the
housebuilder of choice for the
communities in which we
operate, creating a better
environment in which to live
and work. We strive to be a
good neighbour and for us 
this means:
•
Carefully planning new sites.
•
Effectively managing the
redevelopment of
contaminated sites.
•
Regenerating run down areas.
•
Playing a fuller role in other
aspects of community life.
We provide a valuable
contribution to local
communities by building
homes. Much of our work in 
the UK involves transforming
disused or contaminated sites
into habitable living spaces.
UK planners increasingly 
want housebuilders to 
help develop sustainable
communities and we have a
wide range of experience in
doing so.We have introduced
green spaces, wildlife havens,
safe play areas, trafﬁc calming
initiatives and more. See the
Environment section of this
report for examples.
We also integrate affordable
housing into our developments
in co-operation with planners.
Across the UK, 35 percent of our
2003 developments included
some affordable housing.This
figure will increase to 48 percent
in 2004. George Wimpey 
Central London incorporated 
an element of affordable
housing into 80 percent 
of its developments in 
2003. We focus on sensitively
integrating affordable 
housing with private housing.
Charitable Donations
In addition to our community
initiatives, our charitable
donations policy is administered

KAREN ATTERBURY ASSISTANT COMPANY SECRETARY, GEORGE WIMPEY PLC 2. COMMUNITY EDUCA TION 
IN ACTION
George Wimpey UK engages
with schools and local
communities as part of our
health and safety management.
We contact local schools,
nurseries, playgroups and
community centres before
starting construction.
We make safety presentations
to school children and other
groups about the potential
dangers of construction sites.
In addition, we contact the local
education authority, police,
emergency services and others
who could be affected by our
work. We produce safety
leaﬂets and distribute them 
to residents and community
groups. Our sites are fenced off
and designed for community,
visitor and worker safety.
3. REBUILDING LIVES EACH 
AND EVERY YEAR
Each year, Morrison Homes
supports US branches of
international housing charity
Habitat for Humanity.
Our employees fundraise 
and participate in events to
help the charity to build
decent and affordable homes
for vulnerable families and
individuals. In 2003, we won 
an award for the highest
participation by a company 
in the North Fulton Habitat 
for Humanity ﬁve-kilometre
Walk on Home event.
We even participate in building
some of the houses. Volunteers
from our Atlanta Division and
trade partners built a three-
bedroom house for a mother
and her teenage sons just in
time for Christmas 2002.
The scheme helps individuals
to develop skills and build
conﬁdence so they have 
a better chance of ﬁnding 
and staying in employment.
In the same year, George Wimpey
UK paid for a substantial
refurbishment of the main
kitchen at Crewe YMCA.The new
kitchen will allow the YMCA to
run NVQ catering courses for
residents.Their aim is to help
young, vulnerable people to
develop practical job skills.
Morrison Homes
In March 2003, employees from
the Phoenix Division of Morrison
Homes worked with trade
partners to help refurbish a 
local women’s shelter as part of
the Rebuilding Together scheme
for vulnerable, low-income
homeowners and families.
Also in 2003, 100 percent of
Austin and Dallas Division
employees got involved with
the CASA scheme which pairs
caring adults with abused or
neglected children. Each year,
the employees use their skills 
to build, paint and decorate 
a children’s playhouse for a
charity auction, raising several
thousand dollars for CASA 
per playhouse.
Employee volunteers worked
together in Spring 2003 to
refurbish bathrooms in eight
villas in the Give Kids the 
World foundation village 
in Florida. The foundation 
pays for children with life-
threatening illnesses to visit 
the village and central Florida
tourist attractions for much
needed holidays.
During 2003, our Austin Division
made two deliveries each week
for its local Meals on Wheels
organisation. Staff volunteered
their time and their cars to pick
up food, prepare containers and
make a series of deliveries to
local residents.
Future Targets
In 2004, we will analyse the mix
of our charitable activities and
investigate ways to improve the
effectiveness of our charitable
donations policy.

We are a patron of CRASH.
In 2003, we supported the 
Fast Track Hardship Fund, a 
new pilot scheme from the
Foundations Trust which will
pay for urgent small home
improvements for vulnerable,
older and disabled people.
We also provided funding 
for CRISIS SmartMove, a 
new programme to help
solitary homeless people 
with advice and access to
rental accommodation.
Also in 2003, we supported
homelessness charity
Broadway’s Meaningful
Occupations Scheme.

83 percent of customers 
would recommend us to 
their friends and family.
Our overall customer care
score for all UK companies

The Housing Forum
commissioned MORI in 
2003 to conduct their 
National Customer 
Satisfaction Survey. We
achieved a maximum three
stars for all six categories
relating to quality and
customer service.
Our Approach
Our customer 
service begins 
the moment 
a prospective 
customer visits 
any of our 
showhomes.
Our sales executives 
and site managers guide
customers through the home  George Wimpey Plc Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2003 19
purchasing process and provide
advice on obtaining ﬁnance,
arranging legal representation
and customising a new home.
Once the house is ﬁnished, we
conduct a familiarisation visit 
to explain everything and
ensure that all is as it should be.
We then visit the customer in
their new home after seven
days and again after 28 days 
to check for any problems.
If something does go wrong
within our two-year guarantee
period, we will make contact
within 24 hours of the query
and arrange for work to be done
within seven days or within 28
days if materials are required.
Customers have access to our
site teams and, thereafter, to a
24-hour emergency helpline.
Our Respond customer care
management system allows 
us to compare data and
highlight areas of concern so
we can rectify problems and
improve our service.
Conducted by independent
consultants, customer
satisfaction surveys provide the
basis for monthly benchmarking
of our regional companies.
With around 55 percent of
questionnaires returned, the
data is an invaluable resource 
for identifying progress 
and problems.
In 2003, we launched a 
new website for improved 
communication with
prospective and existing
customers.We also published
‘Nest’ and ‘Wall T o Wall’ our
magazines for George Wimpey
and Laing Homes customers,
to be issued three times a year.
Awards
Build quality is a fundamental
part of the service we provide 
to customers. In the 2003
National House Building Council
(NHBC) Pride in the Job awards,
George Wimpey and Laing
Homes received 79 Quality
awards, more than twice as
many as any other housebuilder.
During 2003 we saw 
an unprecedented 48
developments achieve the
highest possible standards 
in our George Wimpey UK
customer service award
scheme. Four developments
received 100 percent scores 
in all sections.
Morrison Homes
Customer service and
satisfaction drive everything 
we do.We measure our success
not only by the satisfaction of
our homeowners, but by how
often those homeowners
recommend us to their friends
and family.
In 2003, JD Power & Associates
(JDP A) customer satisfaction
ratings placed us in the top
quartile of all US builders, with 
an improvement of six index
points since 2002.
Our overall customer
satisfaction rating was 84.7
percent – more than 10 percent
higher than the JDP A national
average of 74 percent among
all builders. According to 
1. LEARNING QUICKL Y FROM
OUR MISTAKES
Two years ago, customer
feedback put George Wimpey
West Scotland near the bottom
of our national customer
service rankings. Staff and
management sat down
together to understand 
what was going wrong 
and identify how to bring
about a cultural change.
All 190 staff got involved and
received training. In 2003, the
company became our second
highest UK achiever in terms 
of customer care. Plus, thanks
to customer feedback,
George Wimpey West Scotland
received a prestigious Gold
Award in the Daily Express
British Homebuyer Awards.
JDPA, Morrison Homes
outperformed the national
average on eight of nine drivers
of customer satisfaction.
In 2003, 84.7 percent of
customers said they would
recommend us and one third 
of our Divisions exceeded our
customer services target of 90
percent recommendation.
Our Approach
Our Signature Pledge 
sets out our approach to
housebuilding. We focus on
building a partnership with
customers, being different by
design, building a new spirit of
community and providing the
ultimate blanket warranty. Our
primary focus is to deliver a
great home at great value.
At Morrison Homes, we 
try to ensure that our high
standards of customer 
care and build quality turn
homebuyers into ‘raving fans’
of our company who are
‘passionately pleased’ with their
new home. Extensive employee

training programmes play an
important role in achieving this.
Customer satisfaction is
measured at pre-determined
intervals during construction
and over the next two years.
Independent consultants collate
and analyse our customer
satisfaction survey data.
We use the data to identify
ways to improve service and
build quality. We also have a
programme to identify and
eliminate the gaps that add
time and frustration to the
home buying process.
We work closely with our
customers to make their 
house buying experience 
as easy as possible. Our ‘little
purple book’ guides customers
through the housebuilding
process and helps them 
make the most of a new 
home. It includes information 
on personalising a home,
working with a builder,
completing the home purchase
and maintaining a new house.
In 2003, we also introduced 
a new customer lead
management system 
to further improve our
communication standards.
Future Targets
George Wimpey UK is
currently developing a new
Customer Charter. At the 
same time, we are ﬁnalising a
national procedural document
to raise awareness of best
practice and set minimum
standards of customer care
across the UK. We will also 
re-evaluate our customer
service training in 2004.
In 2004, Morrison Homes 
will implement a customer
communication management
system to monitor and

key meetings to make
house buying as smooth

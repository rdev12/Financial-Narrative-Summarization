* Umeco uses adjusted figures as key performance indicators. Adjusted figures are stated before the 
results of discontinued operations, amortisation and impairment charges relating to intangible assets, 
significant items, the revaluation of financial instruments based on their market values and associated 
tax effects. The differences between the total and adjusted measures of operating profit, profit before 
tax and profit attributable to owners of the Company are reconciled in note 8 to the consolidated 
financial statements. The narrative in the Business Review is based on the adjusted measures of 
operating profit, profit before tax and earnings per share. These provide a more consistent measure of 
operating performance. ACG South Africa, the business and assets of which are to be divested, has been 
classified as a discontinued operation in the consolidated financial statements.

Debt and financing
Net debt at 31 March 2010 was £79.6 million, a reduction of  
£40.6 million during the year. This significant reduction reflects  
an improvement in the Group’s working capital management and  
also the restrictions on capital expenditure imposed during the year. 
At 31 March 2010, the ratio of the Group’s net debt to earnings before 
interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (‘EBITDA’), as computed 
under our banking agreements, was 2.14 times (2009: 2.59 times);  
this compares favourably to the covenant of 3.25. Interest cover was 
4.97 times (2009: 5.63 times) and was comfortably over our banking 
covenant of 4.00 times.
The Group’s principal banking facilities comprise a US$150.0 million 
revolving credit facility due for repayment in June 2014 and a term 
loan of US$87.7 million due for repayment in August 2011. The Board 
is confident the Group has appropriate banking facilities in place to 
finance its continuing operations and dialogue with potential providers 
of funding is well advanced in respect of replacing the term loan.
Management and employees
Umeco’s results demonstrate the talent and resilience of our 
employees, who have adapted to the unpredictable and challenging 
market conditions we continue to face. I thank them for their support 
and ongoing commitment to Umeco.
Board changes
I am delighted that, on 30 April 2010, we announced the appointment 
of Adrian Auer as Senior Independent Director. Adrian’s breadth 
of international corporate experience, both in Executive and Non-
executive roles, is already proving invaluable to the Board.
Since joining Umeco in October 2009, I have been very impressed by 
the quality of the Group’s businesses and management. Much of the 
credit for this must go to my predecessor, Brian McGowan, who retired 
in August 2009 having served as Chairman for over 12 years. Brian 
presided over a transformation of Umeco and I take this opportunity to 
thank him sincerely for his service to the Group during that period.
On behalf of the Board, I would also like to give my thanks to  
David Porter, who retired from the Board on 31 December 2009  
having served as a Director for nine years. David made a significant 
contribution to Umeco and played a key role in the Group’s development.
Neil Johnson Chairman
Business Review
Chairman’ s Statement
We are weathering the effects of the 
economic downturn well, with actions taken 
to improve working capital management and 
reduce debt leaving us strongly positioned
Overview
Umeco has continued to perform creditably despite the difficult 
and uncertain conditions prevailing in its markets and in the macro 
economic environment. The impact of these factors on the Group’s 
trading has been partly mitigated by the actions we have taken to 
reduce costs and raise efficiency. We anticipate softness and volatility 
in near term demand, but our longer term outlook remains positive, as 
new aircraft programmes go into production and the other markets in 
which we operate begin to recover.
Results and dividend
Revenue from continuing operations in the year to 31 March 2010 
was £409.4 million (2009: £410.9 million) a decrease of 0.4 per cent. 
At constant exchange rates and adjusting for the effects of the 
acquisition of IPM in the prior year, the decrease in revenue was  
5.6 per cent (the ‘underlying’ decrease).
Operating profit from continuing operations fell by 8.9 per cent  
to £31.6 million (2009: £34.7 million) with margins reducing to  
7.7 per cent (2009: 8.4 per cent). The underlying decrease in operating 
profit was 11.9 per cent.
Net interest charges, excluding the revaluation of financial 
instruments, were £6.7 million (2009: £6.2 million). The increase 
reflects the full year funding effect of the acquisition of IPM and 
foreign exchange rate movements. 
Profit before tax from continuing operations was £24.9 million  
(2009: £28.5 million), a decrease of 12.6 per cent. Earnings per share 
were 36.6 pence compared to 39.7 pence, a reduction of 7.8 per cent.
The Board is proposing an unchanged final dividend of 11.0 pence 
making a total for the year of 17.5 pence per ordinary share  
(2009: 17.5 pence). The final dividend is payable on 8 October 2010  
to shareholders on the register on 10 September 2010. 2006

Strategy
In the period since joining the Board, I have visited the Group’s principal 
operations, met with each of their management teams and spent time 
with some of our major customers. It is clear to me that we have three 
fine businesses within the Group. They have strong positions in their 
respective markets with considerable potential for further growth. 
They are well invested, with good facilities and experienced operating 
management teams. They enjoy the support of, and are valued by, their 
customers. 
The Board’s task is to ensure that the strength of our businesses is 
reflected in optimal value for our shareholders and the Board continues 
to review its strategy to ensure this is achieved. We will be encouraging 
each business to grow organically, improve efficiencies, invest in new 
technologies and, if appropriate, acquire relevant skills. We will seek to 
develop deeper partnerships with our customers. Each business will 
flourish by being totally focused on its markets.
Prospects
The indicators for long term demand in the civil aerospace market 
continue to be positive. Airbus and Boeing at 31 March 2010 had a 
backlog of 6,776 orders and it is expected they will deliver 946 aircraft 
in 2010 compared with 979 deliveries in 2009. More importantly, 
Boeing expects that delivery of the first B787 will occur in the fourth 
quarter of 2010 and Airbus continues to commit considerable 
resources to the development of the A350XWB. Both of these new 
programmes are expected to provide the Group with growing long 
term revenue across all of our business streams.
We are weathering the effects of the economic downturn well. We 
have a good order book, underpinned by expanding relationships 
with our key customers, and there is a good pipeline of new business 
opportunities available to us across all our operating segments. 
Although trading conditions in our markets remain uncertain, the 
actions we have taken to reduce our cost base, improve working capital 
management and reduce debt leave us strongly positioned.

Our markets and 
growth drivers
Innovation
Environmental pressures, high oil prices and legislation 
are driving Umeco’s core markets of aerospace & defence, 
automotive, wind and marine towards using lighter weight 
structures. Umeco’s continuing investment in composite 
materials research & development leads to products that 
improve fuel efficiency and performance, thereby reducing 
the impact upon the environment. Umeco is also a leading 
innovator in distribution and supply chain management to the 
aerospace & defence industries, supplying components for use 
on more fuel efficient engines.
Efficiency
Our Supply Chain operation delivers improved efficiency 
for customers by providing exceptional service levels in our 
delivery of high quality, approved products so as to reduce 
inventories and procurement costs. Our wide range of light 
weight composite materials provide efficiency solutions and 
result in reduced fuel and maintenance costs. With facilities 
located around the world, we operate in close proximity to our 
customers to ensure fast, reliable delivery and service. 
Performance
Our advanced composite materials are used extensively in 
highly competitive, extreme environments where cutting edge 
performance is critical to success. We have supported winning 
performances across the sporting arena – from carbon and 
glass fibre material used in racing cycles competing at Olympic 
standard to material applications for ocean racing yachts and 
we supply a number of manufacturers of high performance 
supercars and Formula 1 teams. Our Supply Chain business 
enhances customer performance with its specialisation in the 
supply of small and medium value components and use of 
sophisticated IT systems. Its growing global customer base can 
enjoy significant operational, cost and working capital benefits 
as a consequence.

Operations
Revenue in the year from continuing operations was £409.4 million, a 
decrease of 0.4 per cent. Foreign exchange rate movements, principally 
the US dollar and the Euro against sterling, had the effect of increasing 
reported revenue by £12.0 million. Adjusting for these effects and 
the full year contribution of IPM, acquired in December 2008, the 
underlying decrease in revenue was 5.6 per cent. 
Operating profits from continuing operations were £31.6 million  
(2009: £34.7 million), a decrease of 8.9 per cent. Our operating margin 
fell to 7.7 per cent (2009: 8.4 per cent) reflecting lower revenues in our 
higher margin Composites businesses. The underlying decrease  
in operating profit was 11.9 per cent.
Changes in the Group’s internal reporting and management structure, 
combined with the implementation of new accounting requirements 
in relation to segmental information, have led to Umeco Composites’ 
results being analysed as two operating segments, Structural Materials 
and Process Materials. 
Our business streams have seen mixed fortunes during the year. 
Supply Chain has benefited from contracts won and extended in the 
previous year, which have compensated for lower underlying demand. 
Structural Materials’ key markets remained depressed. Demand from 
Process Materials’ customers in the wind energy sector was also 
subdued and consequently activity levels were below our expectations. 
Nevertheless, our Composites businesses remain well positioned in 
their markets due to continued investment in product development.

Structural Materials’ management was strengthened during the 
year, with Hisham Alameddine being appointed President of its US 
operations, comprising JD Lincoln in Costa Mesa, California and ACG  
in Tulsa. Hisham Alameddine joined Umeco in 2006 having previously 
held senior management positions with Esterline.
Revenue from continuing operations decreased by 12.4 per cent or  
by 14.8 per cent on an underlying basis. Operating profit fell by  
33.6 per cent or by 34.5 per cent on an underlying basis, resulting  
in a decline in margin from 10.2 per cent to 7.8 per cent due to 
operational gearing effects.
Many of ACG’s key markets, such as automotive, marine and ballistics, 
have been difficult during the year. Activity levels at ACG’s small South 
African operation, which supplied composite parts to the Mercedes 
McLaren SLR supercar programme, have reduced as the programme 
comes to an end. The business and assets of this entity are being 
divested. ACG South Africa’s results have therefore been reclassified as 
a discontinued operation.
JD Lincoln has seen some improvement in order levels as signs of a 
modest recovery in its markets appear. During the current financial 
year, JD Lincoln is relocating to new leasehold premises close to its 
existing operations in Costa Mesa, California. These new premises 
will improve efficiency levels and enable the business to develop its 
manufacturing operations, with the capacity to meet the expected 
growth in activity resulting from new aircraft programmes.
GRPMS also suffered from soft market conditions, but the business 
has successfully expanded its product range which is expected to drive 
revenue growth in the current financial year.
Copyright 666 Road Racing Ltd JD Lincoln – new facility
The Board has approved a project to relocate JD Lincoln from 
its current disparate collection of leased buildings into a 
single 116,000 sq.ft. facility.
Moving to the new premises, which have been secured 
under a 10 year lease with options to extend to 20 years, will 
provide the opportunity to install more efficient equipment 
and to expand capacity.
In addition to improving energy efficiency the new plant will 
reduce solvent emissions resulting in a substantially improved 
environmental performance. The project has a total capital 
cost of US$10.9 million and is expected to be completed  
by December 2011.

Tony Steels joined in May 2010 as Managing Director of our  
Process Materials business, replacing Tim Cooper who left the  
Group in December 2009. Tony Steels has extensive international 
business experience and has been based in China for the last  
four years.
Demand levels at Aerovac and Richmond have been significantly 
impacted by weakness of the wind energy sector. While the Chinese 
wind energy market has continued its progress, elsewhere demand 
levels have been lower than expected due to project funding 
constraints. This funding environment for wind energy projects has 
led to credit insurers taking a prudent stance on coverage. We have 
maintained tight credit control and sales to the wind energy sector 
have been withheld at times in order to ensure the Group’s credit risk 
remains at an appropriate level.
IPM moved to a seven day working week in December 2009, which 
has improved efficiency through the use of longer production runs. 
However, the benefits accruing from this and other actions taken to 
improve efficiency have been offset by raw material cost increases  
and lower than expected volumes. Recovery at IPM is dependant upon 
a return to growth in the wind energy market and the introduction of

Umeco Supply Chain is a leading international provider of distribution 
and supply chain outsourcing services primarily to OEM customers 
in the aerospace & defence markets. With its specialisation in the 
supply of small and medium value components and its sophisticated 
IT systems, it creates and delivers significant operational cost and 
working capital benefits and above all improves customer service 
levels for its growing customer base. The Supply Chain businesses 
trade globally as Pattonair. Revenue by end market was:

Revenue increased during the period by 3.6 per cent or by 1.2 per cent 
on an underlying basis. Operating profit increased by 33.9 per cent  
or by 33.0 per cent on an underlying basis. This growth in revenue  
and profits primarily reflects the full year effect of contract wins  
and expansions in the prior year, and a reduction in operating costs.
Pattonair Derby continues to achieve growth on its long term contract 
with Rolls-Royce, with the full year benefit being realised from the 
transfer to Pattonair of additional parts responsibility that occurred 
during the prior year. The Pattonair Derby facility is dedicated to  
Rolls-Royce and continues to operate very effectively with the 
customer receiving exceptionally high service levels. The value of 
inventory funded by Umeco fell during the year as a result of our 
continuing focus on improved working capital management. With 
Rolls-Royce growing their market share, the prospects for Pattonair 
Derby are strong.
Pattonair Woking suffered a fall in revenue primarily as a consequence 
of lower civil aftermarket demand. The business was highly cash 
generative in the year and started to see a recovery in its order intake 
towards the end of the year. In addition, it has a good pipeline of new 
business prospects.
Pattonair Italy also suffered from lower demand and has taken steps 
to broaden and strengthen its commercial and operating management 
during the year.
The performance of Pattonair France has significantly improved, with 
the business trading profitability during the year despite tough market 
conditions. The cost base of the company has continued to be reduced 
and management changes have been implemented to strengthen  
the business.
Pattonair’s North American operations have benefitted from a full  
year of the long term contract with ATK, with revenue increasing by 
27.7 per cent compared to the prior year. The ATK contract is operating 
well with high service levels being delivered to the customer. The 
business is poised for further growth. 
Summary
The global economic downturn has continued to affect the Group’s 
trading environment, with falling air travel causing reductions in 
airlines’ capacities, leading to a reduction in aftermarket demand and 
de-stocking. The resulting deferrals of aircraft orders are expected to 
lead to delivery levels reducing until 2011. Despite these shorter term 
factors, Airbus and Boeing continue to report a significant backlog of 
orders of 6,776 (2009: 7,293 aircraft). Importantly for Umeco, progress 
on the development of the B787 and A350XWB continues. The first 
deliveries of the B787 are now within sight and this programme will 
add to our future revenue and profits. We are expecting a higher 
shipset value from the A350XWB than the B787; the former is due to 
enter service in 2013.
In the face of difficult and unpredictable market conditions, we 
reduced headcount by 7.3 per cent during the year, contained capital 
expenditure and focused on reducing working capital. We are well 
placed to benefit from recovery in our markets and the entry into 
service of new aircraft, and continue to seek to grow our market  
share through the development and delivery of innovative products 
and services.

Company Information
For the current financial year, we expect modest growth in revenue 
due to the effects of new aircraft build programmes and a partial 
recovery in our markets, in particular we expect growth from the wind 
energy sector. We go into the new financial year with a good order 
book: at the end of March 2010 our order book was £227.4 million  
(2009: £218.9 million). Of this, £198.9 million (2009: £190.2 million) 
relates to Supply Chain, with order books in our Composites businesses 
reflecting the shorter term nature of orders placed by customers.  
Order book values reflect scheduled customer requirements for the 
next twelve months.
Although we continue to face a number of shorter term challenges,  
the markets we serve are expected to demonstrate significant growth 
over the medium and long term. Our experienced management team  
is committed to building on this recovery in order to deliver an 
enhanced performance for shareholders. We remain confident in  
our longer term prospects.

Revenue from continuing operations was 0.4 per cent lower than  
last year. The full year effect of the acquisition of IPM during the prior 
year led to additional revenue of £10.2 million. Operating profit was 
£31.6 million, £3.1 million lower than the previous year. IPM’s operating 
profit of £0.1 million compares to £0.5 million in the period from 
acquisition to 31 March 2009. 
The reduction in revenues reflects the generally difficult market 
conditions the Group has experienced, with these effects only being 
partially mitigated by additional revenues from the expansion of 
Supply Chain contracts.
Operating margin reduced to 7.7 per cent from 8.4 per cent due to the 
sales mix being more heavily weighted towards Supply Chain and the 
decline in margins within Structural Materials and Process Materials.

Net financial expense
Net financial expense, excluding revaluations of financial instruments, 
was £6.7 million (2009: £6.2 million). Average interest rate payable in 
the year was 5.0 per cent (2009: 5.4 per cent) and average net debt was 
£118.9 million (2009: £112.8 million). 
Intangible amortisation & goodwill impairment
The amortisation charge in the statement of comprehensive income 
was £6.3 million (2009: £4.2 million). This relates to the amortisation 
of intangible assets arising on acquisitions, principally the benefit of 
product approvals, order books and customer relationships on hand at 
the dates of acquisition. The increase in the charge compared to the 
prior year reflects a full year effect of amortisation on intangible assets 
relating to IPM. No impairment charges have been made in the year.
Significant items
Significant items of £1.3 million were incurred during the year  
(2009: £2.2 million), comprising costs relating to the restructuring  
of the Group’s operations, principally redundancy.
Profit before tax
The weaker trading performance in the year led to adjusted profit 
before tax from continuing operations reducing to £24.9 million  
(2009: £28.5 million), a fall of 12.6 per cent. Total profit before tax  
from continuing operations was £17.6 million (2009: £22.3 million).
Tax
The effective tax rate on adjusted profit before tax from continuing 
operations was 29.1 per cent (2009: 33.0 per cent). The lower rate 
reflects the benefit of an international corporate restructuring that 
was implemented in December 2009. 
Discontinued operation
In view of the intention to dispose of the business, ACG South Africa 
has been treated as a discontinued operation and its results have been 
reclassified accordingly. The loss from the discontinued operation 
before tax was £0.9 million (2009: £0.5 million profit). A contract 
for sale has now been signed and completion is expected to occur 
on or before 30 June 2010 subject to certain conditions precedent 
being satisfied. Consideration payable for the business and assets is 
ZAR5.4 million (£0.5 million), subject to adjustment for working capital 
balances at completion.

Operating profit conversion to cash of 188.9 per cent rose from

and retirement benefit obligations. This principally comprised a  
£19.5 million decrease in debtors and a net increase of £4.6 million  
in creditors, provisions and retirement benefit obligations. 
The small increase in inventories mainly supported the expansion of 
Supply Chain contracts. In aggregate, working capital, provisions and 
retirement benefit obligations reduced by £23.3 million in the year due 
to the management action taken to improve working capital efficiency. 
A tight credit control environment has been maintained during the 
year and shipments to certain participants in the wind energy sector 
in particular have been, and will continue to be, held back where 
appropriate in order to ensure the Group’s exposure to credit risk 
remains at an acceptable level.
The ratio of working capital to revenue for continuing operations 
decreased from 27.8 per cent to 21.2 per cent.
Capital expenditure
Gross capital expenditure of £4.1 million (2009: £6.3 million)  
was £1.7 million lower than depreciation and reflects the controls 
imposed to restrict capital expenditure to essential projects.

Free cash flow
Operating cash flow less interest, tax and capital expenditure from 
continuing operations generated £44.7 million (2009: £6.9 million).  
Tax paid was £0.6 million below the charge in the financial statements 
due to refunds in respect of prior years.

Gearing  44.6 67.3
The Group has continued to reduce its gearing, with the ratio of 
net debt to equity falling from 67.3 per cent last year to 44.6 per 
cent, principally due to the efforts made to improve working capital 
management and restrict capital expenditure. Foreign exchange 
effects caused the sterling value of debt to fall by £6.0 million. 
The Group’s principal committed banking facilities comprise a 
US$150.0 million revolving credit facility expiring in June 2014 and a 
US$87.7 million term loan expiring in August 2011, both provided by 
Lloyds Banking Group plc. In addition, the Group has a £10.0 million 
overdraft facility giving total facilities of £166.7 million. Debt levels 
therefore remain well within the Group’s facilities.
Dialogue with potential providers of funding is well advanced in 
respect of replacing the term loan.
Banking covenants
Covenants in place with Lloyds Banking Group plc are tested semi-
annually on 31 March and 30 September. The covenants require 
interest cover to be not less than 4.00 times profit before interest 
and tax (as defined in the facility agreement), and require the ratio of 
net debt to EBITDA to be not more than 3.25 times at 31 March 2010 
and 3.00 times thereafter. The calculation of the net debt to EBITDA 
covenant involves the translation of both net debt and EBITDA at the 
average exchange rates for the period. 
The results of the covenant calculations at 31 March 2010 were:
  A c tu a l Covenant
Interest cover  4.97	times 4.00 times
Net debt to EBITDA  2.14	times 3.25 times
Appropriate monitoring procedures are in place to ensure continuing 
compliance with banking covenants and, based on our current 
estimates, we expect to comply with the covenants for the  
foreseeable future.
Equity
Equity attributable to shareholders reduced from £178.7 million  
to £178.4 million. This results from the retained profit for the year  
of £11.4 million and a loss debited to the translation reserve of  
£2.8 million, less dividends paid of £8.4 million and actuarial losses 
arising in retirement benefit obligations of £0.7 million net of tax.  
An expense relating to share based payments of £0.2 million was 
credited directly to reserves.
Pensions
The Group operates a number of defined contribution pension 
schemes and two defined benefit plans. The defined benefit plans are 
closed to new entrants. The latest actuarial valuations of the defined 
benefit plans show a deficit of £3.7 million (2009: £4.0 million). The 
Board has agreed with the plans’ trustees that the deficits will be 
funded over a five year period and, accordingly, special payments were 
paid to the plans during the year of £1.3 million (2009: £1.3 million). 
The deficits of the defined benefit plans have been recognised  
on the balance sheet, with the IAS19 valuation of the plans at  
31 March 2010 showing a shortfall in assets to liabilities of  
£4.4 million (2009: £4.4 million). The effects of a lower discount  
rate used to value the plans’ liabilities has been offset by greater 
returns on assets.
Currency exchange risk
The Group seeks to hedge currency exchange risks by matching 
purchases and revenues that are denominated in foreign currencies. 
Where this is not possible, forward currency contracts may be taken 
out to protect exposures. Group policy prohibits speculation in 
currency management.  Umeco plc Annual Report 2010

Overview
Business Review
Directors
Financials
Governance
Company Information
The retranslation of the Group’s net investment in overseas 
businesses led to the net loss of £2.8 million being debited to the 
translation reserve.
Interest rate risk
Whilst the Group does not hedge the currency value of interest 
charges, it has partly protected the interest rate risk by the use of 
interest rate swaps. During the year to 31 March 2010, these financial 
instruments fixed the base rate on 58.4 per cent of the Group’s average 
debt at 2.6 per cent. For the current financial year swaps in place will 
provide cover on a proportion of the Group’s anticipated debt at an 
average LIBOR of 1.5 per cent.
Changes in the market value of interest rate swaps, together with the 
change in value of forward foreign exchange contracts, led to financial 
income of £0.3 million being recognised (2009: £0.2 million).

Principal Risks and Uncertainties
Business Review
    
Effect of the 
economic climate 
upon demand 
levels
The current weakness in the economic climate 
has caused certain of the Group’s business 
units to experience lower demand levels. This 
economic environment may continue to cause 
reduced levels of revenue and result in a greater 
risk of debtors defaulting on payment terms and 
a higher risk of inventory obsolescence
The Board regularly reviews strategy, which 
determines the markets in which the Group 
operates, and a comprehensive review of the 
Group’s strategy was conducted in March 2010. 
Umeco considers that its broad market base and the 
segments in which it operates will continue to prove 
resistant to the worst effects of the downturn. The 
strong order books of civil aircraft manufacturers 
support the long term prospects for the sector. 
Long term demand levels for advanced composite 
materials are considered to be robust, due to moves 
by aerospace and other manufacturers to improve 
fuel efficiency. Inventory and debtor policies are 
continually re-assessed in light of market conditions 
and are rigorously enforced 
Restrictions 
resulting from 
availability of debt 
facilities
If the Group is unable to obtain sufficient 
capital resources, it may be required to take 
decisions that adversely affect current or future 
trading, disadvantaging the Group relative to its 
competitors. The Group’s operating and financial 
flexibility is restricted by its level of indebtedness 
and financial covenants
The Group’s objectives when managing capital 
are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going 
concern in order to provide returns for stakeholders 
and to maintain an optimal capital structure. The 
Group maintains committed bank facilities, which 
are regularly reviewed in comparison to forecast 
capital requirements, and prepares monthly 
financial forecasts which are scrutinised by the 
Board. This information enables the Group to take 
appropriate action on a timely basis. The Board 
receives regular updates in respect of the dialogue 
with potential providers of capital 
Reduced demand 
from the civil 
aerospace sector
The Group’s largest marketplace, civil aerospace, 
is dependent on passenger demand for air travel. 
Demand is influenced by factors such as high 
crude oil prices, Governmental levies which 
increase airline ticket prices or security fears. 
A prolonged reduction in demand could cause 
airlines to cancel or defer orders for new aircraft. 
This would lead to reductions in demand among 
Umeco’s customers 
The Group continually monitors and assesses 
market trends and demand within the civil 
aerospace market using both external sources and 
internal key performance indicators such as order 
book levels. These sources enable the Group to 
respond on a timely basis to changes in demand, for 
example by reducing its cost base or re-assessing 
capital expenditure plans 
Interruption or 
failure of IT systems
Any interruptions to the operation of the  
Group’s IT systems could have an adverse  
effect on its performance
Each business unit has in place well established 
virus protection, back-up and recovery procedures. 
Changes to systems are implemented in a 
structured manner following the preparation of 
documented project plans 
There are numerous risks and uncertainties relevant to the Group’s business, financial condition and operations 
that may affect future performance. The principal risks that might affect the Group are set out below and these 
could cause the Group’s results to differ materially from expected and/or historical levels. The management and 
mitigation of risk is discussed in the Corporate Governance statement on pages 75 to 81

Product failure Many of the Group’s products are fitted to 
aircraft or used to manufacture aircraft parts. 
To the extent that any of the Group’s products 
fail, this could expose the Group to significant 
product liability claims and adversely affect the 
Group’s reputation and financial position
Stringent quality control procedures ensure 
thorough checking of products received

have a material impact on the Group’s trading 
and financial position
The Group monitors its competitive position closely, 
to ensure it provides customers with the optimal 
product offering. The Group devotes significant 
resources to ensure that strong relationships 
are developed and maintained with customers. 
Developing new and innovative products is a key 
aspect of ensuring customer retention  
Failure of suppliers Interruptions in the supply of materials  
could affect the Group’s ability to fulfil  
customer orders
Forward demand and purchase order levels 
are closely monitored to ensure the continued 
availability of products from suppliers. The 
Group continues to focus on cementing strong 
relationships with suppliers and maintains safety 
stocks where appropriate 
Acquisitions Acquisitions can involve risks that unless 
adequately considered and addressed, may 
have a material impact on the Group’s financial 
position
Comprehensive due diligence is carried out prior to 
the completion of all acquisitions and appropriate 
representations, warranties and indemnities are 
obtained from vendors. Post-acquisition, action 
plans are promptly implemented to ensure systems 
of management and control meet the Group’s 
standards 
Financial risks The Group is exposed to a number of financial 
market risks including credit risk, interest rate 
risk and foreign exchange rate risk
Policies and procedures exist to ensure customers 
are given an appropriate level of credit according 
to their trading history and financial status, and 
a prudent approach is adopted towards credit 
control. Interest rate swap contracts are used to 
hedge the Group’s exposure to movements in rates. 
Forward foreign exchange contracts are used where 
necessary to manage the exposure to exchange rate 
movements

We recognise the impact the Group has on the environment and we have 
well developed environmental policies that seek to prevent pollution and 
reduce any adverse environmental impact of our activities. The Board 
reviews the Group’s environmental performance at least annually .
Our customers operate in industries that are at the forefront of 
environmental change as they seek to lower carbon emissions. They 
demand high performance, lightweight materials that will reduce fuel 
consumption and improve efficiency . 
ACG, working through Umeco Composites – Structural Materials  
T echnology Centre, is involved in a number of collaborative research 
programmes that are addressing those critical factors which are restraining 
more widespread application of advanced composites in the automotive 
industry . These projects target key industry drivers such as automated 
production techniques, reduced process times, integrated structures 
and fibre recycling, and have the ultimate goal of further reducing road 
vehicles’ weight and CO2 emissions. 
JD Lincoln continues to work closely with major civil aircraft OEMs  
and their Tier 1 suppliers in developing novel lightweight materials for 
aircraft interiors. These tailored products contribute to continuing weight 
reduction drives, and at the same time satisfy the ever more stringent 
safety requirements imposed by the FAA.
Richmond and Aerovac, strengthened by the addition of IPM 
manufactured products, continue to be leading suppliers to the global 
wind energy industry .
Umeco’s policy is to control and manage energy effectively in all  
its applications. The company aims to reduce electricity and gas 
consumption to the lowest practicable level and to maintain  
these standards. Umeco is in the process of registering as a participant 
in the Government’s Carbon Reduction Commitment initiative and has 
started to calculate the entirety of its UK eligible emissions “foot-print” . 
The emissions data also contains information about organisational energy 
use and sources. Umeco will submit in the annual compliance report the 
quantity of allowances we intend to surrender for 2011 and 2012.
The approved relocation of JD Lincoln into a single 116,000 sq.ft.  
facility will provide the opportunity to install more efficient equipment 
and in addition to improving energy efficiency the new plant will  
reduce solvent emissions resulting in a substantially improved

Review of Group’s business
Under Section 417 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company is 
required to produce a fair review of its business, including a description 
of the principal risks and uncertainties that face the Company. This is  
set out in the Business Review on pages 06 to 23, which includes the 
Chairman’s Statement, Chief Executive’s Review and Finance Director’s 
Review, together with descriptions of the principal activities. The 
Business Review is incorporated into this report by reference. The 
Business Review contains details of the key performance measures 
used to manage and control the Group’s operations, and sets out 
information on the future strategy and prospects of the Group.
The following specific issues are discussed in the sections shown  
in brackets:
key objectives and performance in the year to 31 March 2010 • 
(Chairman’s Statement, Chief Executive’s Review and Finance 
Director’s Review);
treasury policy and risk management (note 27 to the consolidated • 
financial statements and Corporate Governance); and
corporate social responsibility, environmental matters and • 
employee issues (Corporate Responsibility and Corporate 
Governance).
Details of the results for the year are shown in the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income. Analyses of revenue and 
adjusted operating profit by segment are shown in note 1 to the 
consolidated financial statements.
Group key performance indicators
The Board has adopted various financial and non-financial key 
performance indicators (‘KPIs’) to measure the strategic and 
operational progress of the Group, which are measured at Group and/
or subsidiary level as appropriate. Details are shown on page 16.
Corporate governance
Under Disclosure and Transparency Rule 7.2, the Company is required  
to include a Corporate Governance statement in its Directors’ Report.  
All relevant information on the corporate governance practices of the 
Company are set out in the Corporate Governance statement on pages 
75 to 81. The Corporate Governance statement is incorporated into 
this report by reference.
Profits and dividends
The Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income is shown on 
page 31. Profit before tax from continuing operations was £17.6 million 
(2009: £22.3 million). The results of Advanced Composites Group SA 
(Pty) Limited (‘ACG South Africa’) have been classified as a discontinued 
operation as a consequence of this business being held for resale.
The Directors propose a final dividend of 11.0 pence per share, payable  
on 8 October 2010 to shareholders registered on 10 September 2010, 
making a total declared for the year to 31 March 2010 of 17.5 pence per 
share (2009: 17.5 pence).
In the Interim Management Statement published by the Company  
on 17 February 2010, it was stated that “adjusted profit before tax for 
the year may be towards the lower end of market expectations”. The 
adjusted profit before tax for the year to 31 March 2010, including the 
results of ACG South Africa in order to achieve consistency with the 
basis on which the statement was made, was £24.0 million and is 
therefore in line with the aforementioned forecast.
Research & development
Expenditure on research & development in the year was £2.0 million 
(2009: £2.0 million). This expenditure relates to the research & 
development of advanced composite materials, including materials 
evaluation and prototype production. The accounting policy on 
research & development is disclosed under Group accounting policies.
Share capital
Details of share capital are given in note 18 to the consolidated 
financial statements. At the date of this report there were 48,137,234 
ordinary shares of 25 pence each in issue, all of which are fully paid up 
and quoted on the London Stock Exchange. 
Rights and obligations attaching to shares
The rights attaching to the Company’s ordinary shares, as well as the 
powers of the Company’s Directors, are set out in the Company’s  
Articles of Association, copies of which can be obtained from the 
Company Secretary.

Company Information
Directors
Directors’ Report Subject to applicable statutes (in this section the “Companies Acts”), 
any resolution passed by the Company under the Companies Acts and 
other shareholders’ rights, shares may be issued with such rights and 
restrictions as the Company may by ordinary resolution decide, or  
(if there is no such resolution or so far as it does not make specific 
provision) as the Board (as defined in the articles) may decide. Subject 
to the articles, the Companies Acts and other shareholders’ rights, 
unissued shares are at the disposal of the Board.
Voting
Every member and every duly appointed proxy present at a general 
meeting or class meeting has, upon a show of hands, one vote and 
every member present in person or by proxy has, upon a poll, one  
vote for every share held by him. In the case of joint holders of a share 
the vote of the senior who tenders a vote, whether in person or by 
proxy, shall be accepted to the exclusion of the votes of the other  
joint holders and, for this purpose, seniority shall be determined  
by the order in which the names stand in the register in respect  
of the joint holding.
Restrictions on voting
No member shall be entitled to vote at any general meeting or class 
meeting in respect of any share held by him if any call or other sum 
then payable by him in respect of that share remains unpaid or if a 
member has been served with a restriction notice (as defined in  
the articles) after failure to provide the Company with information 
concerning interests in those shares required to be provided under  
the Companies Acts. The Company is not aware of any agreements 
between holders of securities that may result in restrictions on  
voting rights.
Dividends and other distributions
The Company may by ordinary resolution from time to time declare 
dividends not exceeding the amount recommended by the Board. 
Subject to the Companies Acts, the Board may pay interim dividends, 
and also any fixed rate dividend, whenever the financial position of  
the Company, in the opinion of the Board, justifies its payment. If  
the Board acts in good faith, it is not liable to holders of shares with 
preferred or pari passu rights for losses arising from the payment of 
interim or fixed dividends on other shares. The Board may withhold 
payment of all or any part of any dividends or other moneys payable  
in respect of the Company’s shares from a person with a 0.25 per cent 
interest (as defined in the articles) if such a person has been served 
with a restriction notice (as defined in the articles) after failure to 
provide the Company with information concerning interests in those 
shares required to be provided under the Companies Acts.
Variation of rights
Subject to the Companies Acts, rights attached to any class of shares 
may be varied with the written consent of the holders of not less  
than three-fourths in nominal value of the issued shares of that class 
(calculated excluding any shares held as treasury shares), or with the 
sanction of a special resolution passed at a separate general meeting 
of the holders of those shares. At every such separate general meeting 
(except an adjourned meeting) the quorum shall be two persons 
holding or representing by proxy not less than one-third in nominal 
value of the issued shares of the class (calculated excluding any shares 
held as treasury shares). The rights conferred upon the holders of any 
shares shall not, unless otherwise expressly provided in the rights 
attaching to those shares, be deemed to be varied by the creation or 
issue of further shares ranking pari passu with them.
Restrictions on transfer of securities in the Company
There are no restrictions on the transfer of securities in the Company, 
except:
that certain restrictions may from time to time be imposed by laws • 
and regulations (for example, insider trading laws); and
pursuant to the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority • 
whereby certain employees of the Company require the approval of 
the Company to deal in the Company’s ordinary shares.
The Company is not aware of any agreements between shareholders 
that may result in restrictions on the transfers of securities and/or 
voting rights. No person holds securities in the Company carrying  
special rights with regard to control of the Company. The Company’s 
Articles of Association may be amended by special resolution of the 
Company’s shareholders. 
Share allotment
A general allotment power and a limited power to allot in specific 
circumstances for cash otherwise than pro-rata to existing 
shareholders were given to the Directors by resolutions approved at 
the Annual General Meeting of the Company held on 29 July 2009. 
These powers will expire at the conclusion of the 2010 Annual General 
Meeting and resolutions to renew the Directors’ powers are therefore 
included within the notice of the 2010 Annual General Meeting.
Appointment and replacement of Directors
The Directors shall be not less than two and not more than 15 in 
number. The Company may by ordinary resolution vary the minimum 
and/or maximum number of Directors. A Director shall not be required 
to hold any shares in the Company. Directors may be appointed by the 
Company by ordinary resolution or by the Board. A Director appointed 
by the Board holds office only until the next following Annual General 
Meeting of the Company and is then eligible for re-election. The Board 
or any committee authorised by the Board may from time to time 
appoint one or more Directors to hold any employment or executive 
office for such period and on such terms as they may determine and 
may also revoke or terminate any such appointment.
At every Annual General Meeting of the Company any Director who 
has been appointed by the Board since the last Annual General 
Meeting, or who held office at the time of the two preceding Annual 
General Meetings and who did not retire at either of them, or who has 
held office with the Company, other than employment or executive 
office, for a continuous period of nine years or more at the date of the 
meeting, shall retire from office and may offer himself for re-election 
by the members. The Company may by special resolution remove any

Going concern
A review of Group business activities and future outlook are set out  
on pages 06 to 23 which includes the Chairman’s Statement, Chief 
Executive’s Review and Finance Director’s Review. The financial 
position of the Group, its cash flows and liquidity position are shown in 
the Consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Statement of Cash 
Flows and accompanying notes to the financial statements. The 
principal business risks associated with the business are shown on 
pages 20 and 21. In addition, note 27 to the consolidated financial 
statements includes the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for 
managing its capital, its financial risk management objectives, details 
of its financial instruments and hedging activities and its exposures to 
credit and liquidity risk.
The Group’s bank facilities amount to £166.7 million. This comprises a 
US$150.0 million committed revolving credit facility which extends to 
June 2014, a US$87.7 million term loan facility expiring in August 2011 
and an overdraft facility of £10.0 million. After considering the nature 
and duration of these facilities and making appropriate enquiries, 
based on the strength of the Group’s balance sheet, current expectations 
of future trading (based on future cash flow forecasts and revenue 
projections which the Directors believe are based on a realistic 
assessment of future business performance) and on the facilities 
available to the Group, the Directors believe they have reasonable 
grounds for stating that the Company and the Group have adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis 
in preparing the financial statements.
Authority to make market purchases of own shares
An authority to make market purchases of shares was given to the Directors 
by a special resolution at the Annual General Meeting of the Company held 
on 29 July 2009. In the year to 31 March 2010, the Company has not 
acquired any of its own shares. The existing authority will expire at the 
conclusion of the 2010 Annual General Meeting and a resolution to renew 
the authority is therefore included within the notice of the 2010 Annual 
General Meeting.
Accordingly, it is intended to propose a Special Resolution to give the 
Company authority to make market purchases on the London Stock 
Exchange of up to 10.0 per cent of the ordinary shares in issue at the date 
of the Annual General Meeting. Any purchase therefore will be subject to 
the terms of the Listing Rules, which provide that the maximum price 
(exclusive of expenses) which may be paid for an ordinary share is the 
highest of (i) an amount equal to 5.0 per cent above the average market 
value for an ordinary share for the five business days immediately 
preceding the date of the purchase and (ii) the higher of the price of the last 
independent bid on the trading venues where the purchase is carried out.
The minimum price (exclusive of expenses) which may be paid for an 
ordinary share is 25 pence, its nominal value. Such market purchases  
of ordinary shares would be made from the Company’s distributable 
reserves. Ordinary shares purchased pursuant to the authority will either 
be cancelled or held as treasury shares. Shares held by the Company as 
treasury shares may be sold, transferred for the purpose of employee 
share schemes, or cancelled.
Related party transactions 
Related party transactions are set out in note 16 on page 74.
Essential contracts and significant agreements
The Company and Group have a number of significant agreements 
relating to funding and customer relationships. 
The Group’s facility agreements with Lloyds TSB Bank plc in respect of the 
US$150.0 million five year revolving credit facility expiring in June 2014 and 
the US$87 .7 million credit facility expiring in August 2011 are essential to 
the Group as a whole. These agreements include change of control 
provisions and, in the event of a change in ownership of the Company, the 
provisions could result in renegotiation or withdrawal of the facilities.
The Group has essential relationships with its key customers, with many 
of these relationships being the subject of long term supply agreements. 
The Group’s largest customer, Rolls-Royce plc, has entered into a supply 
agreement with the Group extending until December 2015.
Other than as noted above, the Directors are not aware of any 
significant agreements to which the Company and/or any of its 
subsidiaries is a party that take effect, alter or terminate upon a  
change of control of the Company following a takeover bid. 
Donations
The Group made charitable donations amounting to £4,000  
(2009: £4,000) during the year. The Group made no political  
donations during the year (2009: £nil).

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, and

applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and parent

law, they are required to prepare the Group financial statements in 
accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and applicable law, and 
have elected to prepare the parent Company financial statements  
in accordance with UK Accounting Standards and applicable law  
(UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Under company law, the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair  
view of the state of affairs of the Group and parent Company and  
their profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the Group and 
parent Company financial statements, the Directors are required to:

*Note on adjusted figures
Umeco uses adjusted figures as key performance indicators. Adjusted figures are stated before the results of discontinued operations, 
amortisation and impairment charges relating to intangible assets, significant items, the revaluation of financial instruments based on their 
market values and associated tax effects. The differences between the total and unadjusted measures of operating profit, profit before tax and 
profit attributable to owners of the Company are reconciled in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. The narrative contained in the 
Business Review is based on the adjusted measures of operating profit, profit before tax and earnings per share. These provide a more consistent 
measure of operating performance.
The comparative figures for the year to 31 March 2009 have been re-presented to reflect fair value adjustments to the assets of Industria Plastica
Monregalese – I.P.M. S.r.l. (‘IPM’) acquired during the year to 31 March 2009 (leading to a reduction in goodwill arising on the acquisition of 
£0.3 million) and the divestment of ACG South Africa. Segmental information has also been restated following the adoption of IFRS8.

Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity
For the year to 31 March 2010 Umeco plc is a company incorporated and domiciled in the UK.  
The address of the Company’s registered office is Concorde House, 
Warwick New Road, Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, CV32 5JG, United 
Kingdom. The Company is listed on the London Stock Exchange.
The consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year to  
31 March 2010 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together 
referred to as the ‘Group’). 
The consolidated financial statements were approved for release by 
the Board of Directors on 8 June 2010.
Statement of compliance
The Group’s financial statements as approved by the Directors have 
been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (‘IFRS’) as adopted by the EU. The Company has elected to 
prepare its parent company financial statements in accordance with 
UK GAAP and these are shown on pages 67 to 74.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to 
affect its future development, performance and position, the financial 
position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing 
facilities are described in the Business Review. In addition, note 27 to 
the consolidated financial statements includes the Group’s objectives, 
policies and processes for managing its capital, its financial risk 
management objectives, details of its financial instruments and 
hedging activities and its exposures to credit and liquidity risk.
The Group’s bank facilities amount to £166.7 million. This comprises a 
US$150.0 million five year committed revolving credit facility which 
extends to June 2014, a US$87.7 million term loan facility expiring in 
August 2011 and an overdraft facility of £10.0 million. After 
considering the nature and duration of these facilities and making 
appropriate enquiries, based on the strength of the Group’s balance 
sheet, current expectations of future trading and on the facilities 
available to the Group, the Directors believe they have reasonable 
grounds for stating that the Company and the Group have adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis 
in preparing the financial statements.
Basis of preparation
Comparative figures for the year to 31 March 2009 have been  
re-presented to reflect fair value adjustments to the assets of IPM 
acquired during the year to 31 March 2009 (leading to a reduction in 
goodwill arising on the acquisition of £0.3 million) and the divestment 
of ACG South Africa. Segmental information has also been restated 
following the adoption of IFRS8. The consolidated financial statements 
are presented in pounds sterling, the functional currency of the 
Company. They are prepared on the historic cost basis except that  
the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair values – 
derivative financial instruments (IAS39), retirement benefit obligations 
(IAS19) and share based payments (IFRS2).
The accounting policies set out on pages 35 to 39 have been applied 
consistently in dealing with items which are considered material  
in relation to the Group’s financial statements.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared by applying 
the accounting policies, presentation and basis of consolidation which 
were applied in the preparation of the Company’s consolidated 
financial statements for the year to 31 March 2009, which were 
prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the EU, except for the following accounting 
standards and interpretations which are effective for the Group from  
1 April 2009:
IAS1 (revised) ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’; • 
IAS23 (revised) ‘Borrowing Costs’; • 
IFRS2 (revised) ‘Share Based Payment’; • 
IFRS8 ‘Operating Segments’; • 
IFRIC 14 ‘The limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding • 
Requirements and their Interaction’; and
IFRIC 16 ‘Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation’. • 
IAS1 (revised) ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ requires the 
presentation of a Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity as  
a primary statement rather than as a note. Since this change is 
presentational only, there is no impact on profit or net assets.
IAS23 ‘Borrowing Costs’ requires the Group to capitalise borrowing  
costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or 
production of a qualifying asset as part of the cost of the asset. This 
standard has no impact upon profit or net assets for the year to  
31 March 2010.
IFRS2 (revised) ‘Share Based Payment’ makes changes to the definitions 
and accounting treatment of vesting conditions and cancellations. 
These have no impact upon the share based payment arrangements 
operated by the Group and the revised standard has no impact upon 
profit or net assets.
IFRS8 ‘Operating Segments’ requires operating segments to be 
identified on the basis of information that internally is provided to  
the Chief Executive and Chief Operating Officer, who act jointly as  
the Group’s chief operating decision maker. Following the adoption  
of IFRS8, the Group is now reporting Umeco Composites’ activities as 
two separate operating segments, Structural Materials and Process 
Materials since these now form the basis of internal reporting.
IFRIC11 ‘Group and Treasury Share Transactions’. This interpretation 
has no impact on the Group’s financial statements.
IFRIC14 ‘The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding 
Requirements and their Interaction’ limits the amount of defined 
benefit pension assets which can be recognised on certain schemes 
where the Group does not have an unconditional right to the refund of 
any surplus which may exist. This standard has no impact upon profit 
or net assets.

Group Accounting Policies
For the year to 31 March 2010 IFRIC 16 ‘Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation’ clarifies 
certain issues relating to hedge accounting. These have no impact 
upon the hedge accounting operated by the Group and there is no 
impact upon profit or net assets.
The following standards and interpretations had been endorsed by the 
EU by the year end but are not effective for the year to 31 March 2010:
IAS27 (revised) ‘Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements’; • 
IFRS3 (revised) ‘Business Combinations’; and • 
the Annual Improvements Project to IFRSs. • 
The Group has considered the impact of these new standards and 
interpretations in future periods and, subject to the comments below, 
no significant impact is expected on reported profit or net assets. 
IFRS3 (revised) ‘Business Combinations’ will apply to business 
combinations arising from 1 April 2010. Amongst other changes, the 
revisions effected by the new standard require subsequent changes  
in the fair value of contingent consideration payable in respect of  
an acquisition to be recognised in the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income rather than against goodwill, and require 
transaction costs attributable to an acquisition to be recognised 
immediately in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. 
IFRS3 (revised) will be applied prospectively to transactions occurring 
from 1 April 2010. It is therefore not possible to assess in advance the 
impact on the Group’s financial statements.
The Annual Improvements Project to IFRSs provides a vehicle for 
making non-urgent but necessary amendments to IFRSs. Amendments 
to a number of standards, which are mandatory for the year to  
31 March 2010, have been adopted. None of these amendments  
have had a material impact on the Group’s financial statements.
The Group has chosen not to early adopt any of these new standards 
and interpretations.
Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial 
statements of the Company and all of its subsidiaries. Acquisitions  
are accounted for using the purchase method, when control over the 
operating and financial policies of a company has been acquired. 
Control exists when the Company has direct or indirect power to 
govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain 
economic benefit from its activities. The existence and effect of 
potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are 
considered in assessing control. Consolidation of subsidiaries continues 
until that control ceases. The financial statements of subsidiaries used 
in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are 
prepared for the same reporting period as the Company.
Transactions and balances between Group companies are eliminated  
on consolidation, and no profit before tax is recognised on sales made 
between Group companies until the products are sold to customers 
outside the Group.
Divestments and assets held for sale
The results and cash flows of major lines of business that are held  
for resale as at 31 March 2010 have been classified as discontinued 
operations. Businesses that are divested are de-consolidated from  
the date on which control ceases.
When the carrying value of an asset will be recovered principally 
through a sale transaction expected to take place within twelve 
months of the balance sheet date rather than through continuing use, 
it is classified as held for sale and stated at the lower of carrying value 
and fair value less costs to sell.
Goodwill and intangible assets
Goodwill represents amounts arising on acquisition of subsidiaries. In 
respect of acquisitions that have been announced since 1 April 2004, 
goodwill represents the difference between the fair value of the cost  
of the acquisition (including the attributable costs of the acquisition) 
and the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired, and is 
allocated to cash generating units. Positive goodwill is recognised as an 
asset on the balance sheet. Negative goodwill, representing the excess 
of the fair value of assets acquired above the fair value of consideration 
paid, arising on acquisitions is recognised immediately in the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
In respect of acquisitions announced prior to 1 April 2004, goodwill is 
included on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the amount 
recorded under UK GAAP on transition to IFRS.
Goodwill is stated at cost or deemed cost less any impairment losses. 
The carrying value of goodwill is reviewed for impairment at each 
balance sheet date.
Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment at least 
annually. On disposal of a subsidiary undertaking, the attributable 
amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit  
or loss on disposal. 
Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated  
at cost less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is charged  
to administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income over the estimated useful life of the asset.  
The useful life of each asset is assessed based on discussions with 
management and takes account of the differing natures of each of the 
intangible assets assessed. The useful lives of order books, customer 
relationships and contracts are between one and nine years.
Expenditure on internally generated goodwill is recognised as an 
expense in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income  
as incurred.

Group Accounting Policies continued
For the year to 31 March 2010 Impairment
The carrying values of all non-current assets subject to amortisation 
and depreciation are reviewed for impairment when there is an 
indication that the assets might be impaired. In addition, non-current 
assets which have an indefinite useful life, including goodwill, are 
tested for impairment annually to determine whether there is any 
indication of impairment. If any indication of impairment exists, the 
asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. An impairment loss is 
recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash 
generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable 
amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and the value in  
use. In determining the value in use, estimated future cash flows  
are discounted to their present value using a discount rate that  
reflects the time value of money and risks specific to the asset being 
assessed. Impairment losses are recognised immediately in the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and, in the case  
of goodwill, are not subsequently reversed.
Revenue
Revenue is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income at the fair value of consideration received or receivable. 
Recognition is made when goods or services are supplied or made 
available to customers against orders received and the significant risks 
and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer and 
the amount of revenue can be measured reliably. Assessments are 
made in respect of Supply Chain contracts to determine whether the 
Group is acting as principal or agent. Where it is determined that the 
Group is acting as principal, revenue is recognised on a gross basis and 
includes the value of goods supplied. Where the Group acts as agent 
the agency fee is recognised as revenue. Revenue excludes value added 
tax and other similar sales taxes.
No revenue is recognised where the recovery of the consideration is  
not probable. Revenue is stated after the deduction of discounts and 
allowances for estimated future rebates and returns. The methodology 
and assumptions used to estimate rebates and returns are monitored 
and adjusted in the light of contractual and legal obligations, historical 
trends, past experience and projected market conditions.
Significant items
Significant items are non-recurring items which are separately 
identified by virtue of their size or incidence so as to allow a better 
understanding of the underlying trading performance of the Group.
Employee benefits
(a) retirement benefit obligations
The Group operates pension schemes providing benefits based on final 
pensionable salaries and on contributions made by members. The assets 
of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group. For defined 
contribution pension schemes, amounts payable are charged to the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as they fall due.
For defined benefit pension schemes, the IAS19 cost of providing 
benefits is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the 
projected unit method. The charge to the Consolidated Statement  
of Comprehensive Income reflects the current service cost of such 
obligations, and where applicable, past service cost. The expected 
return on plan assets and the interest cost on scheme liabilities are 
included within financial income and expense in the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the Consolidated 
Balance Sheet represents the present value of the liabilities of the 
defined benefit schemes as reduced by the fair value of the assets of 
those schemes. Differences between the actual and expected returns 
on assets and experience gains and losses arising on scheme liabilities, 
together with differences arising from changes in assumptions, are 
recognised as other comprehensive income.
The Group’s contributions to the schemes are paid in accordance with 
the schemes’ rules and the recommendations of the schemes’ 
actuaries.
(b) share based payments
The fair value of options granted under share based payment schemes  
is recognised as an expense with a corresponding increase in equity.  
Fair values of options are estimated using the Black-Scholes model, 
taking into account the terms and conditions under which the options 
were granted. The fair value determined at grant date is expensed on a 
straight line basis over the vesting period, with the amount recognised 
as an expense being adjusted to reflect the actual number of options 
that vest except where forfeiture is solely due to market conditions,  
for example the Company’s share price not achieving the threshold  
for vesting.
Any proceeds received, net of directly attributable transaction costs, 
are credited to share capital and share premium when options are 
exercised.
Property, plant & equipment
Items of property, plant & equipment are stated at cost or deemed 
cost less accumulated depreciation. Cost includes expenditure that  
is directly attributable to the item of property, plant & equipment 
acquired. Assets held under lease finance arrangements are 
depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and the expected useful 
life of the asset. Depreciation is provided so as to write off the cost of 
property, plant & equipment over their estimated useful economic lives 
on a straight line basis as follows:
Freehold buildings and long leasehold 
 property improvements   50 years
Short leasehold property improvements   period of lease
Plant, machinery, fixtures & IT equipment  3-10 years
Motor vehicles   3-4 years
No depreciation is charged on freehold land.

Company Information
  The residual values and useful lives of assets are reviewed annually for 
continued appropriateness and indications of impairment, and are 
adjusted if required.
On disposal of an item of property, plant & equipment, the cost and 
related accumulated depreciation are removed from fixed assets and 
the net amount, less any proceeds, is taken to the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (including, where applicable, 
raw materials, direct labour, other direct costs and related production 
overheads) and net realisable value. Cost is generally determined on 
either a first in, first out basis or on a specific batch costed basis. The 
net realisable value of inventory is assessed by reference to historic  
and expected future usage patterns, with provision being made for 
obsolete or slow moving items.
Research & development
Expenditure on research is charged to the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income as incurred. Where development expenditure 
meets the criteria of IAS38, such expenditure will be capitalised and 
amortised over its useful life. 
Interest
Interest receivable or payable is credited or charged to the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income using the effective 
interest method. 
Income tax
Income tax comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is 
recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income 
except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in  
other comprehensive income, in which case it is recognised in other 
comprehensive income.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on taxable income for the year, 
using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet 
date, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided for in full, using the balance sheet liability 
method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and 
the amounts used for tax purposes. No deferred tax is provided for  
in relation to temporary differences relating to goodwill that is not 
deductible for tax purposes and differences relating to investments  
in subsidiaries, except to the extent that they are expected to reverse  
in the foreseeable future, and the parent Company is not able to 
control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner 
of realisation or settlement of the assets and liabilities, using tax rates 
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. A deferred 
tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future 
taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised. 
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Leases
Where the Group enters into a lease which entails taking substantially 
all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset, the lease is treated 
as a finance lease. The asset is capitalised and recorded within 
property, plant & equipment at the lower of the fair value at the date 
of acquisition or the present value of the minimum lease payments, 
and is depreciated over the shorter of its estimated useful life and the 
lease term. Future instalments under such leases, net of finance 
charges, are included within creditors. Rentals payable are apportioned 
between the finance element, which is charged to the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income as interest, and the capital 
element, which reduces the outstanding obligation for future 
instalments. All other leases are operating leases and the rental 
charges are charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income on a straight line basis over the life of each lease.
Provisions
A provision is recognised on the Consolidated Balance Sheet when the 
Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a 
past event, and where it is probable that a reliably estimated outflow 
will be required to settle the obligation. 
Share capital
The share capital of the Company is recorded at the proceeds received, 
net of directly attributable issue costs. Consideration paid for shares  
in the Company in respect of share based payments are deducted  
from retained earnings. Where such shares subsequently vest in the 
employees under the terms of the Group’s share option schemes or  
are sold, any consideration received up to the value that has been 
recognised for such shares is included in retained earnings. Any excess 
consideration is credited to share premium.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of 
exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet  
date are translated using the rate of exchange ruling at the balance 
sheet date and the gains or losses on translation are included in the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. Goodwill and 
intangible assets relating to overseas operations are denominated in 
the currency of the foreign operations’ primary economic environment 
and are translated using the rate of exchange ruling at the balance 
sheet date with gains or losses on translation taken to the translation 
reserve and other comprehensive income.

Group Accounting Policies continued
For the year to 31 March 2010 Subsidiaries account in the currency of their primary economic 
environment of operation, determined having regard to the currency 
that mainly influences revenue and expenses. Statements of 
comprehensive income and cash flows of overseas subsidiaries are 
translated into sterling at the average rate of exchange for the year. On 
consolidation, the balance sheets of overseas entities are translated 
into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. 
Foreign exchange differences arising from the translation into sterling 
of equity interests in overseas subsidiary undertakings are treated as  
movements in the translation reserve.
The currencies which most influence the Group’s financial statements 
are the US dollar and Euro. The relevant exchange rates for these 
currencies were:
   2010  2009
Average rate
Sterling:US dollar  1.596 1.718

Sterling:Euro  1.121 1.080
Financial instruments
Financial instruments are recognised when the Group becomes a party 
to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial assets are 
de-recognised when the rights to receive benefits have expired or have 
been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all the 
risks and rewards of ownership. Financial liabilities are de-recognised 
when the obligation is extinguished. The principal financial assets and 
liabilities of the Group are as follows:
(a) trade receivables
Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and are then  
stated at amortised cost, net of any provision. A provision is made 
where there is evidence of a risk of non-payment, taking into account 
ageing, previous experience and general economic conditions. When a 
trade receivable is determined to be uncollectable it is written off, 
either against a provision or to the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income.
(b) cash
Cash is carried in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value. For the 
purposes of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, cash comprises 
cash at bank and in hand together with bank overdrafts, as these items 
are an integral part of the Group’s cash management. The Group does 
not have any short term deposit instruments.
(c) trade payables
Trade payables are initially recognised at fair value and are then stated 
at amortised cost.
(d) bank loans & other borrowings
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are initially recognised  
at fair value less attributable transaction costs. All borrowings are 
subsequently stated at amortised cost with the difference between  
the initial proceeds and the repayment value being recognised in the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income over the period to 
repayment.
(e) derivative financial instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to manage  
financial risks associated with the Group’s business activities and the 
financing of those activities. Derivatives are initially recognised at fair 
value on the date that the contract is entered into and subsequently 
re-measured in future periods at their fair value, with any change  
in value being recognised in the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income. The Group does not apply hedge accounting  
in respect of these financial instruments.
The Group enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to provide a 
hedge against foreign currency exposures. Interest rate swap contracts 
are used to hedge the Group’s exposure to changes in interest rates.
Fair values are based on quoted market prices at the balance  
sheet date.
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments  
for speculative purposes.
(f) hedge of net investment in foreign operation
Where a foreign currency liability is a formally designated hedge of a  
net investment in a foreign operation, foreign exchange differences 
arising on translation of the foreign currency liability are recognised 
directly in equity to the extent the hedge is effective. The Group  
assesses the effectiveness of its net investment hedge based on fair  
value changes of its net assets, including relevant goodwill designated  
as a foreign currency asset and the fair value changes of the debt 
designated as a hedge.
At the inception of a hedging transaction the Group documents the 
relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument 
together with its risk management objective and the strategy 
underlying the proposed transaction. The Group also documents its 
assessment, both at the inception of the hedging relationship and 
subsequently on an ongoing basis, of the effectiveness of the hedge.

Company Information 1 Segmental reporting
The Group has three reportable segments, as described below, which are the Group’s strategic business units. The strategic business units offer 
different products and services, and are managed separately as they require different technology and marketing strategies. For each of the 
strategic business units, the Chief Executive and Chief Operating Officer (who act jointly as the chief operating decision maker) review internal 
management reports on a monthly basis. The following summary describes the operations of each of the Group’s reportable segments.
Details of business segments can be found on pages 91 and 92 and details of the calculation of adjusted operating profit are set out in note 8.  
A reconciliation of reportable segment adjusted operating profit to total operating profit is set out in note 8. There are no material transactions 
between the Group’s three reportable segments.
The Group’s most significant customer, an aerospace manufacturing company, accounted for 29.1 per cent of the Group’s revenue for the year to 
31 March 2010 (2009: 27.1 per cent) and is reported within the Supply Chain reportable segment.

The effective tax rate on profit before tax from continuing operations is 27.8 per cent (2009: 36.3 per cent). The effective rate of tax on adjusted 
profit before tax from continuing operations is 29.1 per cent (2009: 33.0 per cent), based on a tax expense on adjusted profit before tax of 
£7.2 million (2009: £9.4 million).
The deferred tax effects of actuarial gains and losses on retirement benefit obligations have been recognised directly in equity, and comprised a 
deferred tax credit of £0.3 million (2009: £1.1 million).
The aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries of the Company for which deferred tax liabilities 
have not been recognised is £80.2 million (2009: £77.6 million). The unprovided deferred tax liability in relation to these temporary differences  
is minimal as the majority of these earnings are either from UK subsidiaries or they are overseas earnings which would qualify for the UK  
dividend exemption.

at 31 March 2010 as it is subject to approval by shareholders. The amount expected to be paid in respect of this dividend is £5.3 million.  
The dividend is payable on 8 October 2010 to shareholders registered on 10 September 2010.
The terms of the Umeco Bonus Plan, details of which are set out in the Remuneration Report, require that dividends are waived by participants in 
respect of deferred shares. Consequently, the final dividend declared in respect of the year to 31 March 2009 and the interim dividend declared  
in respect of the year to 31 March 2010 were waived in relation to 255,305 shares and 237,905 shares respectively.

Umeco uses adjusted figures as key performance indicators, as these are considered to provide a more consistent measure of operating 
performance. Adjusted figures are stated before the results of discontinued operations, amortisation and impairment charges relating to 
intangible assets, significant items, the revaluation of financial instruments based on their market values and associated tax effects. The 
differences between the total and adjusted profit measures are reconciled below.

The acquisition of goodwill in the year to 31 March 2009 has been re-presented to reflect adjustments to the fair value of net assets acquired on 
the acquisition of IPM and an accrual for additional expenses relating to the acquisition.
Goodwill acquired in the year to 31 March 2009
In the year to 31 March 2009, goodwill and intangible assets associated with customer relationships & orders on hand arose on the acquisition  
of IPM as follows:

The goodwill of £12.1 million recognised on the acquisition of IPM is attributable to the skills and technical capabilities of IPM’s employees  
and synergies expected to be generated from establishing links between IPM and the Group’s existing composites activities. In the year to  
31 March 2009 the goodwill in relation to JD Lincoln was reduced by £0.7 million.

Goodwill has been allocated to cash generating units, identified within the Group’s business segments as those units that generate cash  
inflows largely independent of other units within the Group and which are subject to separate local management. As the cash flows of  
the Process Materials operations, Aerovac, IPM and Richmond, are not considered to be independent and these companies have common 
management, these three business units are therefore considered as a single cash generating unit. The carrying value of goodwill is made  
up of balances arising in respect of cash generating units as follows:
       2010 2009 
       £m £m
Umeco Composites – Structural Materials
ACG       39.7 39.7

Pattonair France       1.5 1.5
       124.4 126.3
Each year, or whenever events or a change in the economic environment indicates a risk of impairment, the Group reviews the value of  
goodwill balances allocated to its cash generating units. In the absence of any identified impairment risks, tests are performed based on  
internal valuations of each cash generating unit. The recoverable amount of goodwill attaching to cash generating units is based on value  
in use calculations using discounted cash flows. Those calculations are based on cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent forecast for the 
year to 31 March 2011 (2009: year to 31 March 2010) approved by management and strategic plans for the subsequent two years. These forecasts 
provide cash flow projections covering the three year period ending on 31 March 2013 (2009: 31 March 2012). In order to produce projections for 
a 25 year horizon period, the cash flow forecast for year to 31 March 2013 (2009: year to 31 March 2012) was then extrapolated for a further 22 
years, using growth rates appropriate to each cash generating unit. For the calculation of discounted cash flows made as at 31 March 2010, a 
terminal value was included in respect of forecast cash flows arising after the end of the 25 year horizon period. The following growth rates were 
used to derive the forecast for the year to 31 March 2014 and to derive the forecast for subsequent years:
       2010 2009 
       Per cent Per cent
Umeco Composites – Structural Materials
Years four to ten       2.0-7.0 2.0-7.0
Years 11 to 25       2.0 2.0
Umeco Composites – Process Materials
Years four to ten       2.0-7.0 2.0-7.0
Years 11 to 25       2.0 2.0
Umeco Supply Chain
Years four to ten       0.0-7.0 0.0-5.0
Years 11 to 25       2.0 2.0
These growth rates are considered to be consistent with the long term average growth rates for the industries which the cash generating  
units serve. Growth rates are considered separately for each cash generating unit and are benchmarked against externally prepared industry 
growth projections. Management believe that the forecast period is appropriate given the long term nature of the build programmes within  
the relevant industries.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates, achievement of future revenues and 
expected changes in direct costs during the period. These assumptions have been reviewed in light of the current economic environment which  
has resulted in a more conservative estimate about the future.
Discount rates have been estimated based on pre-tax rates that reflect the current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks 
specific to the cash generating units. Whilst the Group has a number of cash generating units, the risks and rewards associated with Umeco 
Composites’ operations are consistent and therefore the same market risk premium has been applied for these cash generating units. Similarly,  
the risks and rewards encountered in Umeco Supply Chain’s operations are consistent and the same market risk premium has been applied to  
each of these cash generating units.

In cash generating units within Umeco Composites – Structural Materials, a pre-tax discount rate of between 12.6 per cent and 16.6 per cent  
has been applied in determining the recoverable amounts of cash generating units (2009: between 9.4 per cent and 11.0 per cent). For cash 
generating units within Umeco Composites – Process Materials, a pre-tax discount rate of between 12.3 per cent and 13.8 per cent has been 
applied (2009: between 10.2 per cent and 11.3 per cent) and for cash generating units within Umeco Supply Chain, a pre-tax discount rate of 
between 8.1 per cent and 14.7 per cent has been applied (2009: between 9.7 per cent and 18.1 per cent). The discount rates are estimated based 
on the Group’s weighted average cost of capital, using the capital asset pricing model to determine the cost of equity and then weighting the  
overall cost of capital for the Group by equity and debt. In calculating the cost of equity a market risk premium was used with a Beta value of  
0.9 (2009: 0.6). A market premium of 5.0 per cent (2009: 5.0 per cent) was used to calculate a pre-tax discount rate reflecting market information  
and risk. 
Management believe that the calculations and assumptions on which the carrying value of goodwill is based are appropriate and any reasonable 
change in the assumptions would not lead to a materially different conclusion. The Group’s estimate of impairments is most sensitive to 
increases in the discount rate used and reductions in forecast cash flows. Sensitivity analysis has been carried out in relation to the discount rate 
assumption, which demonstrated that 2.5 per cent would need to be added to the pre-tax discount rate used for Umeco Composites – Structural 
Materials, 6.0 per cent added to the pre-tax discount rate used for Umeco Composites – Process Materials and 3.7 per cent added to the pre-tax 
discount rate used for Umeco Supply Chain before any impairment would exist. Management do not consider such an increase in discount rates 
to be likely.
Although cash forecasts into perpetuity have been considered, the impairment tests at 31 March 2010 show that for Umeco Composites – 
Structural Materials, the number of years required to recover the carrying value of goodwill ranged from two to 18 (2009: one to 11 years). The 
equivalent period for Umeco Composites – Process Materials was nine years (2009: one to 11 years) and for Umeco Supply Chain the equivalent 
range was from one to 13 years (2009: two to six years). Management consider that these payback periods are not excessive given the long term 
strategic benefits arising from the acquisitions that have given rise to goodwill.
There were no impairments recognised in the year to 31 March 2010. Cumulative impairment recognised in relation to goodwill is £0.8 million  
(2009: £0.8 million).

Off-balance sheet arrangements
In compliance with current reporting requirements, certain arrangements entered into by the Group in its normal course of business are not 
reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Of such arrangements, those considered material by the Directors are trade receivable balances that 
have been subject to non-recourse factoring arrangements. 
Under its non-recourse factoring arrangements, the Group sells trade receivable balances to a third-party factoring company in exchange  
for a cash payment from the factoring company, net of fees. All the risks and rewards of the trade receivables subject to these arrangements  
are transferred to the factoring company and, accordingly, the trade receivables are derecognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Such 
arrangements are used from time to time by the Group to manage the recovery of cash from its trade receivables. As at 31 March 2010, the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet included £17.3 million (2009: £nil) of cash that would otherwise have been reported as trade receivables if these 
arrangements were not in place. Factoring fees incurred during the year to 31 March 2010, which are written off to the Consolidated Statement 
of Comprehensive Income within ordinary finance costs, amounted to £0.1m (2009: £nil).

Company Information 21 Acquisition
The Group made no acquisitions in the year to 31 March 2010. During the year, fair value adjustments of £0.3 million were made to the net 
identifiable assets and liabilities relating to the acquisition of IPM. Payments of £0.2 million were made during the year in respect of expenses 
relating to the acquisition of IPM. Details of the acquisition made in the year to 31 March 2009 are set out below.
On 4 December 2008, the Group acquired the entire issued share capital of IPM for a cash consideration of €16.8 million. IPM is a manufacturer 
and supplier of vacuum bagging films for the composites industry and other markets. Consideration of €12.8 million was payable to the vendors 
on completion, with the remaining €4.0 million being paid by the Group into an escrow account pending any warranty claims.
In the period from acquisition to 31 March 2009, IPM achieved a profit before tax of £nil, after a charge of £0.5 million in respect of amortisation 
of acquired intangible assets. Had the acquisition completed on 1 April 2008, it is estimated that IPM would have contributed a further  
£10.0 million to revenue and £nil to profit before tax, after making certain non-recurring payments to the vendors and charges in respect of 
amortisation of acquired intangible assets. Other than the recognition of intangible assets of £6.4 million and a related deferred tax liability,  
the fair value adjustments made were the revaluation of property, plant & equipment, additional inventory and trade receivable  
provisions and the recognition of additional trade & other payables.
Details of the acquisition of IPM, including the fair value of net assets acquired, were as follows:

The goodwill recognised on the acquisition of IPM is attributable to the skills and technical capabilities of IPM’s employees and synergies 
expected to be generated from establishing links between IPM and the Group’s existing composites activities.
Amounts recognised for intangible assets and goodwill is provisional and subject to change for the period of one year from the date of 
acquisition. Intangible assets have been recognised in respect of customer relationships and order books on hand at acquisition.

Company Information 24 Retirement benefit obligation
As explained in the Group Accounting Policies, the Group operates several pension schemes, the details of which are disclosed in this note.
The Umeco Pension and Life Assurance Plan (‘the Umeco Scheme’) has two sections. The defined benefit section of the Umeco Scheme, which 
was closed to new entrants in 2000, provides benefits based on final pensionable pay with contributions being charged to the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income so as to spread the cost of pensions over employees’ working lives with the Group. The contributions are 
determined by a qualified independent actuary on the basis of valuations, conducted at least every three years, using the attained age method. 
Contribution rates are determined on the basis of advice from an independent professionally qualified actuary, with the objective of providing 
the funds required to meet pension obligations as they fall due. The most recent valuation was at 1 April 2007. The assumptions which have the 
most significant effects on the results of the valuation are those relating to the rate of return on investments before retirement (6.7 per cent per 
annum), the rate of return on investments after retirement (5.2 per cent per annum), the rate of increase in salaries (4.5 per cent per annum) and 
the rate of pensions increases (0.0 – 3.2 per cent per annum). The valuation adopted the PMA92 and PFA92 year of birth medium cohort tables as 
the basis for determining members’ mortality assumptions. The valuation showed that the actuarial value of the defined benefit section’s assets 
was £8.1 million which represented 77.5 per cent of the actuarial value of benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected 
future increases in earnings. 
Regular contributions of the Group during the year were 26.3 per cent of earnings. Regular contributions of employees ranged from 4.5 per cent  
to 6.5 per cent of earnings. Regular contributions payable in respect of the year were £0.3 million (2009: £0.3 million). As part of the deficit 
recovery plan agreed with the trustees of the Umeco Scheme, additional contributions of £0.9 million (2009: £1.4 million) were payable. Total 
contributions outstanding at the year end were £0.6 million (2009: £0.6 million). The next actuarial valuation is due as at 1 April 2010. In the year 
to 31 March 2011, the Group expects to pay regular contributions of approximately £0.2 million, representing 26.3 per cent of pensionable 
salaries, and additional contributions of approximately £1.4 million.
The Umeco Scheme also has a defined contribution section. Members of this section contribute between 2.0 per cent and 6.0 per cent of 
pensionable earnings with the Group making contributions of between 4.0 per cent and 10.0 per cent. Contributions amounting to £0.4 million 
(2009: £0.5 million) were payable to this section of the Umeco Scheme in the year, of which £21,000 (2009: £16,000) was outstanding at the  
year end.
The trustees of the Umeco Scheme are chaired by John Harper, formerly one of the Company’s Non-executive Directors, and an independent 
expert in pension matters attends meetings of the trustees. Responsibility for investment of the Umeco Scheme’s funds has been delegated  
by the trustees to professional investment managers.
The Advanced Composites Group of companies participate in the Advanced Composites Group Pension Scheme (‘the ACG Scheme’), which 
provides benefits on a defined benefit basis. The ACG Scheme was closed to new entrants in 2001. The assets of the ACG Scheme are held 
separately from those of the Group and responsibility for investment of the ACG Scheme’s funds has been delegated by the trustees to 
professional investment managers. Contribution rates are determined on the basis of advice from an independent professionally qualified 
actuary, with the objective of providing the funds required to meet pension obligations as they fall due. The trustees of the ACG Scheme are 
chaired by Jonathan Mabbitt, Group Managing Director of Umeco Composites – Structural Materials, and an independent expert in pension 
matters attends meetings of the trustees.
Contributions to the ACG Scheme are determined by a qualified independent actuary on the basis of valuations, conducted at least every three 
years, using the projected unit method. The most recent valuation was as at 1 June 2008. The assumptions which have the most significant 
effects on the results of the valuation are those relating to the rate of return on investments before retirement (7.2 per cent per annum), the rate 
of return after retirement (5.45 per cent per annum), the rate of increase in salaries (4.8 per cent per annum) and the rate of pension increases 
(3.8 per cent per annum). The valuation adopted the PMA92 and PFA92 year of birth medium cohort tables as the basis for determining members’ 
mortality assumptions. The valuation showed that the actuarial value of the ACG Scheme’s assets was £6.9 million which represented 83.6 per 
cent of the actuarial value of benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings. The contributions  
of the Group and employees are 15.7 per cent and 8.7 per cent of earnings respectively. Regular contributions payable in respect of the year were 
£0.3 million (2009: £0.3 million). As part of the deficit recovery plan agreed with the trustees of the ACG Scheme, additional contributions of  
£0.4 million (2009: £0.4 million) were made. Total contributions outstanding at the year end were £52,000 (2009: £23,000). The next actuarial 
valuation is due as at 1 June 2011. In the year to 31 March 2011, the Group expects to pay regular contributions of approximately £0.3 million, 
representing 15.7 per cent of pensionable salaries, and additional contributions of approximately £0.4 million.

Certain of the Group’s UK businesses operate separate defined contribution arrangements for qualifying employees. Employer contributions are  
a maximum of 10.0 per cent and employees are encouraged to contribute at similar rates. Total contributions of £0.4 million (2009: £0.4 million) 
were payable in respect of the year.
The Group participates in defined contribution arrangements in respect of certain of its businesses outside the UK. Contributions to these 
schemes during the year totalled £0.6 million (2009: £0.6 million).
As described in the Remuneration Report, the Company makes payments to defined contribution arrangements in respect of the Executive 
Directors. In respect of Clive Snowdon, contributions of £142,000 (2009: £142,000) were payable to these arrangements, £12,000 of which was 
outstanding at the year end (2009: £nil). In the year to 31 March 2009, Clive Snowdon elected to have a proportion of his pension contribution 
entitlement converted to additional salary. Details of this conversion are set out in the Remuneration Report. In respect of Doug Robertson, 
contributions of £38,000 (2009: £38,000) were payable to these arrangements, £3,000 of which was outstanding at the year end (2009: £nil). 
Andrew Moss’ total pension contribution entitlement was £60,000 (2009: £50,000). Of this entitlement, pension contributions of £33,000  
(2009: £26,000) were paid to the Umeco Scheme. The remaining entitlement of £27,000 was paid into an independent SIPP arrangement,  
£2,000 of which was outstanding at the year end (2009: £nil). In the year to 31 March 2009, the remaining entitlement of £24,000 was  
converted into additional salary at the Executive’s request. Details of this conversion are set out in the Remuneration Report.
IAS19
The information required for accounting in accordance with the requirements of IAS19 has been obtained by updating the actuarial valuations 
referred to above, which were carried out by independent qualified actuaries. Combined values are shown for the Umeco Scheme and the  
ACG Scheme.
The assumptions used to calculate scheme liabilities are as follows:
       2010 2009 
       Per cent Per cent
Rate of increase in pensionable salaries       4.6 3.9
Rate of increase of pensions in payment       3.6 2.9
Discount rate       5.5 6.3
Inflation       3.6 2.9
The mortality basis used for these disclosures is in line with the basis used by the respective trustees at the most recent valuations, adjusted to 
reflect members’ dates of birth.
The mortality assumptions imply the following expected future lifetimes from age 65:
         2010 2009 
       Years Years
Males currently aged 65        22.1 22.0
Females currently aged 65        25.0 24.9 
Males currently aged 45        23.1 23.1
Females currently aged 45        25.9 25.9
The assumptions have been chosen by the Directors from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescales covered, may 
not be borne out in practice.
The market values of the schemes’ assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term, may be subject to significant change before 
they are realised. The present values of the schemes’ liabilities are calculated by reference to the investment return on corporate bonds. The 
assumptions used do not necessarily represent the investment return that may be achieved.

27 Financial risk management and financial instruments
(a) financial risk management
Financial risk management is an integral part of the way the Group is managed. The Directors review and agree the broad policies for all 
significant areas of financial management. As the Group’s operations are centred on the aerospace industry, which is primarily US dollar based,  
a natural hedge is in place for most foreign currency transactions. In the course of its business, the Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk, 
interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. The aim of the Group’s financial risk management policies is to minimise potential adverse effects 
on financial performance and net assets. The Group does not enter into speculative transactions.
(b) capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns  
for shareholders and for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure. The Group considers capital to be £258.0 million  
(2009: £298.9 million), being the sum of equity attributable to owners of the Company and net debt.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of the ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (‘EBITDA’) and 
interest cover. These measures are the principal financial covenants under the terms of the Group’s committed facilities with Lloyds TSB Bank plc. 
The calculation of the net debt to EBITDA covenant involves the translation of both net debt and EBITDA at the average exchange rates for the 
period. For the purposes of these facilities, the value of these measures was as follows:

(c) market risk – foreign currency risk and exposure
The Group puts in place forward foreign exchange contracts where it is thought necessary to use such instruments to manage the exposure  
to foreign exchange movements. At 31 March 2010, the Group had 32 forward currency contracts outstanding (2009: 20 contracts) which had  
a total principal value of £4.6 million (2009: £3.7 million).
The principal foreign currencies in which the Group transacts and holds assets and liabilities are the US dollar and Euro. A change in value of  
the US dollar resulting in a 5.0 per cent rise in the sterling:US dollar exchange rate would result in an increase of £0.1 million (2009: £0.2 million 
reduction) in reported profit before tax and an increase of £4.7 million (2009: £1.7 million reduction) in net assets. A change in value of the Euro 
resulting in a 5.0 per cent rise in the sterling:Euro exchange rate would result in a reduction of £0.1 million (2009: £0.2 million reduction) in  
reported profit before tax and a reduction of £0.1 million (2009: £3.5 million reduction) in net assets.
The carrying amount of the Group’s borrowings denominated in foreign currencies is as follows:
       2010 2009 
       £m £m
US dollar       75.0 95.1
Euro       33.5 39.6
Other       – 0.5
       108.5 135.2
Of the total foreign currency borrowing of £108.5 million (2009: £135.2 million), the amount of borrowing used for hedging the currency risk on 
retranslating overseas operations amounted to £81.4 million (2009: £46.9 million). The foreign exchange loss of £5.5 million (2009: £12.6 million) 
on translation of these borrowings into sterling has been recognised in the translation reserve and in Other Comprehensive Income. 
(d) market risk – interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on both interest bearing assets and interest bearing liabilities. The effects of changes in interest rates 
could affect the Group’s future cash flows or the fair values of its financial instruments. It is the Group’s policy to maintain an appropriate balance 
between fixed and floating interest rates on borrowings in order to provide certainty as to the level of interest expense in the short term and to 
reduce the impact of interest rate fluctuations over the medium term. Interest rate risk arises on floating rate debt, which comprises bank loans, 
on which interest is based on LIBOR, and cash at bank and overdrafts, on which interest is related to bank base rates.
The Group uses interest rate swap contracts to hedge the Group’s exposure to movements in interest rates. At 31 March 2010, the Group had  
one such contract outstanding (2009: one contract). The notional amount of debt covered by the interest rate swap contract was £49.4 million 
(2009: £42.4 million). At 31 March 2010, the effective interest rate on the Group’s bank loans was 3.3 per cent (2009: 3.9 per cent) and the 
effective interest rate on lease finance obligations was 5.4 per cent (2009: 7.3 per cent).
A one percentage point rise in interest rates in respect of US dollar denominated borrowings would increase the annual financial expense charge 
by approximately £0.9 million (2009: £0.8 million), however the effect of the Group’s interest rate swap contracts would reduce this impact and 
would lead to a net increase of £0.2 million (2009: £0.4 million). A similar rise in respect of sterling denominated borrowings would increase the 
annual financial expense charge by approximately £0.5 million (2009: £0.4 million).

(e) liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s policy on liquidity risk is to 
ensure that sufficient cash and undrawn committed facilities are available to fund ongoing operations and to meet its medium term capital  
and funding obligations, and to meet any unforeseen obligations and opportunities.
Management monitor liquidity in terms of meeting the banking covenants described in note 27(b). The committed borrowing facilities available 
to the Group are reviewed regularly and are designed to exceed forecast peak gross debt levels. At 31 March 2010, the principal borrowing 
facilities available to the Group comprised a US$150.0 million revolving credit facility due for repayment in June 2014, a US$87.7 million term  
loan facility due for repayment in August 2011 and a £10.0 million overdraft facility that is renewable annually.
(f) credit risk
Credit risk arises on financial instruments such as trade receivables and derivative financial instruments. Policies and procedures exist to ensure 
that customers have an appropriate level of credit according to their trading history. Derivative financial instruments are executed only with 
highly credit-rated authorised counterparties based on ratings issued by the major rating agencies.
Trade & other receivables included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet are stated net of a provision for impairment which has been estimated by 
management following a review of individual receivable accounts and is based on prior experience and known factors at the balance sheet date. 
Receivables are written off against the provision when management consider that the debt is no longer recoverable. Details of changes in the 
provision are set out in note 13. For all financial instruments that are not impaired, a full recovery of their value is expected.
There are no indications as at 31 March 2010 that debtors will not meet their payment obligations in respect of the amount of trade receivables 
recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet that have not been provided for. There are £9.6 million (2009: £14.4 million) of trade receivables that  
are past due at 31 March 2010 that have not been provided against. While uncertainty surrounding counterparty risk has increased due to the current 
economic climate, the Group considers that debtors will meet their payment obligations in respect of trade receivables recognised in the Consolidated 
Balance Sheet that are past due and unprovided as at 31 March 2010. The Group considers that it has minimised its exposure to a significant amount of 
credit risk.
The Group’s most significant customer, an aerospace manufacturing company, accounted for 17.0 per cent of the maximum exposure to credit 
risk for trade receivables at 31 March 2010 (2009: 25.1 per cent). The ageing profile of the most significant customer was as follows:

The table below sets out the Group’s accounting classification of its financial assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date. Under IAS39,  
all derivative financial instruments are derivatives at fair value through the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. All transactions in 
derivative financial instruments are undertaken to manage risks arising from underlying business activities.
For cash, the fair values are the same as the carrying value. For derivative financial instruments, fair values are obtained from the counterparty 
providing the instrument. For floating rate borrowings, fair values have been calculated by discounting the cash flows at appropriate prevailing 
market rates. Other assets and liabilities reflect management’s estimate of value on an appropriate basis.

Company Information 28 Accounting estimates and judgements
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date that have a significant risk  
of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are as follows:
Defined benefit pension scheme valuations
In determining the valuation of defined benefit pension scheme assets and liabilities, a number of assumptions have been made, notably in 
relation to the expected return on plan assets, inflation and discount rates, mortality, salary increases and pension increases. These assumptions 
are largely dependent upon factors outside the Group’s control. Details of these assumptions are set out in note 24.
Impairment of goodwill
The determination of whether goodwill is impaired requires the conducting of an impairment test. Such tests involve an estimation of the future 
cash flows expected to be derived from the cash generating unit to which the goodwill is attached, discounted using appropriate interest rates. 
These cash flows are dependent upon future trading performance, which in turn are partially dependent upon prevailing market and economic 
conditions that are outside the Group’s control. The impairment tests are therefore inherently judgemental and future events could cause the 
assumptions used in the impairment tests to change, with a consequent adverse effect on the future results of the Group. Details of impairment 
testing are set out in note 10.
Valuation of inventories
The Group has a formal policy for making appropriate reserves to ensure inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. This 
policy requires assumptions to be made regarding future demand levels and these assumptions are partly dependent upon prevailing market and 
economic conditions, which are outside the Group’s control.
Valuation of intangible assets
A review is conducted in respect of each acquisition made by the Group to identify separable intangible assets. These may include customer 
relationships, contracts or orders on hand and product qualifications or approvals. The valuation of these assets is set out in note 10.
Provisions
The carrying value of the disposal provision is assessed at each balance sheet date based upon the latest available information in relation to 
expected future outflows regarding the environmental issues referred to in note 17. This information includes reports from the Group’s 
environmental consultants.
29 Related parties
Transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries, which are related parties, have been eliminated on consolidation and are not disclosed  
in this note. 
The interests of the Directors in the ordinary share capital of the Company, together with details of their remuneration and share related

Company Balance Sheet Registered number: 148635
As at 31 March 2010 Accounting policies
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in 
dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the 
Company’s financial statements.
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
applicable UK accounting standards and law and under historical cost 
accounting rules, except for derivative financial instruments which  
are stated at their fair values. A cash flow statement has not been 
presented as permitted by FRS1 (revised) ‘Cash Flow Statements’.  
The Company has taken advantage of the exemptions contained in 
FRS8 ‘Related Party Disclosures’ and has not disclosed transactions  
or balances with entities which form part of the Group. 
Investments
Fixed asset investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost, 
less provision for any impairment.
Depreciation
Depreciation is provided so as to write off the cost or valuation of 
tangible fixed assets over their estimated useful economic lives on a 
straight line basis as follows:
Freehold buildings   50 years
Plant, machinery, fixtures & IT equipment  3-10 years
Motor vehicles   3-4 years
No depreciation is charged on freehold land.
Tax
The charge for tax is based on the profit for the year and takes into 
account tax deferred because of timing differences between the 
treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes except as 
otherwise required by FRS19 ‘Deferred Tax’. Liabilities are calculated  
on a non-discounted full provision basis. Assets are recognised on  
the same basis, but only to the extent that it is probable they will  
be recovered.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of 
exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the 
rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and the gains or 
losses on translation are included in the profit and loss account.
Financial instruments
The Company has adopted the requirements of FRS29 ‘Financial 
Instruments: Disclosures’ and has taken the exemption under that 
standard from disclosure on the grounds that the Group’s financial 
statements contain disclosures in compliance with IFRS7 ‘Financial 
Instruments: Disclosures’. The Company does not hold or issue 
derivative financial instruments for trading purposes and the principal 
financial instruments utilised by the Company are interest rate swaps. 
These instruments are used for managing interest rate exposures in 
line with the Group’s risk management policy. 
(a) bank loans & other borrowings
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are initially recognised  
at fair value less attributable transaction costs. All borrowings are 
subsequently stated at amortised cost with the difference between 
the initial proceeds and the repayment value being recognised in the 
profit and loss account over the period to repayment.
(b) derivative financial instruments
The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage  
financial risks associated with the Company’s business activities  
and the financing of those activities. Derivatives are initially  
recognised at fair value on the date that the contract is entered into  
and subsequently re-measured in future periods at their fair value,  
with any change in value being recognised in the profit and loss 
account. The Company does not apply hedge accounting in respect  
of these financial instruments.
The Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to 
provide a hedge against foreign currency exposures. Interest rate swap 
contracts are used to hedge the Company’s exposure to changes in 
interest rates.
Fair values are based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.
(c) fair value hedge
Fair value hedges established in respect of overseas operations are 
achieved through borrowings denominated in the relevant foreign 
currency. The carrying amount of the hedged items is adjusted by the 
increase or decrease in its fair value attributable to the hedged risk and 
the resulting gain or loss is recognised in the profit and loss account 
where to the extent that the hedge is effective it is offset by the 
change in the fair value of the hedging instrument.
Provisions
A provision is recognised on the Company Balance Sheet when the 
Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a 
past event, and where it is probable that an outflow will be required to 
settle the obligation.
Impairment
The carrying values of investments are reviewed at each balance sheet 
date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any 
such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. An 
impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an 
asset or its cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. The 
recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and the 
value in use. In determining the value in use, estimated future cash 
flows are discounted to their present value using a discount rate that 
reflects the time value of money and risks specific to the asset being 
assessed. Impairment losses are recognised immediately in the profit 
and loss account and are not subsequently reversed.

For the year to 31 March 2010 Retirement benefit obligation
Pension costs are recognised in the financial statements in accordance 
with the requirements of FRS17 ‘Retirement Benefits’. The Company  
is a member of the defined benefit section of the Umeco Scheme. 
Since the Company is unable to identify its share of the scheme assets 
and liabilities on a consistent and reasonable basis, the scheme is 
accounted for by the Company as if it was a defined contribution 
scheme. Details of the Group’s pension schemes are set out in note 24 
to the consolidated financial statements.
For defined contribution schemes, amounts payable by the Company 
are charged to the profit and loss account as they fall due.
Share based payments
The fair value of options granted after 7 November 2002 and not yet 
vested by 31 March 2004 are not recognised as an employee expense. 
Those vested since 1 April 2004 are expensed with a corresponding 
increase in equity. The fair value is measured at grant date and spread 
over the period during which the employees become unconditionally 
entitled to the options. The fair value of the options granted is 
measured using the Black-Scholes model, taking into account the terms 
and conditions upon which the options were granted. The amount 
recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number  
of share options that vest except where forfeiture is only due to  
share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting. Details of the 
Company’s share option schemes are set out in note 26 to the 
consolidated financial statements.
Where the Company grants options over its own shares to the 
employees of its subsidiaries it recognises an increase in the cost of 
investment in its subsidiaries equivalent to the equity settled share 
based payment charge recognised in its subsidiary’s financial 
statements with the corresponding credit being recognised directly  
in equity. Amounts recharged to the subsidiaries are recognised as  
a reduction in the cost of investment in that subsidiary.

The additions and disposals in Group undertakings result from the corporate restructuring undertaken in December 2009.
All subsidiaries are wholly owned and as such are included in the consolidated financial statements. The principal Group undertakings are shown on 
pages 91 and 92. Their share capital consists entirely of ordinary shares other than Advanced Composites Group Limited, Pattonair Limited and GRPMS 
Limited, whose share capital consists of ordinary and preference shares. The Directors have considered the presentation of certain debtors due after 
more than one year and have decided that the most appropriate presentation is to include these items as investments in Group undertakings. This 
better reflects the intention of the Company that the amounts were for a further investment in its subsidiaries. No amendment has been made to the 
prior year financial statements as the Directors’ view is that any such adjustment would not fundamentally alter the financial statements.

Fair values
Under FRS26, all derivative financial instruments not in a hedge relationship are derivatives at fair value through the profit and loss account.  
All transactions in derivative financial instruments are undertaken to manage risks arising from underlying business activities.
For cash, the fair values are the same as the carrying value. For derivative financial instruments, fair values are obtained from the counterparty 
providing the instrument. For floating rate borrowings, fair values have been calculated by discounting the cash flows at appropriate prevailing 
market rates. Other assets and liabilities reflect management’s estimate of value on an appropriate basis.

Company Information Statement of compliance
The Board is firmly committed to ensuring business integrity and  
high ethical values across the Group’s operations. As an essential  
part of this commitment, the Board supports high standards of 
corporate governance and has a policy of seeking to comply with  
the recommendations of the Combined Code (the ‘Code’). Details of 
the mechanisms used by the Company to achieve compliance with  
the Code are shown in this Corporate Governance statement  
and in the Remuneration Report.
The Company was fully compliant with the provisions of the Code 
throughout the year, except that the Company did not have a Senior 
Independent Director between 31 December 2009 when David Porter 
retired until 30 April 2010 when Adrian Auer was appointed as a 
Non-executive Director and new Senior Independent Director.
The Board
Following the appointment of Adrian Auer as Non-executive Director 
on 30 April 2010, the Board currently consists of eight Directors: five 
Non-executive and three Executive. 
During the year to 31 March 2010, Brian McGowan resigned from the 
Board on 31 August 2009 and David Porter resigned from the Board  
on 31 December 2009. David Porter was interim Chairman of the 
Company from 31 August 2009 until 18 October 2009. Neil Johnson 
was appointed to the Board on 19 October 2009. During the periods 
from 31 August 2009 to 18 October 2009 and from 31 December 2009 
to 29 April 2010, the Board therefore consisted of seven Directors: four 
Non-executive and three Executive. The names, roles and biographical 
details of the Directors are set out on page 24. 
Each of the Non-executive Directors, including the Chairman, is free 
from any business or other relationship which could materially 
interfere with the exercise of his judgement. Each of the Non-executive 
Directors is considered by the Board to be independent.
The Board maintains a Practices and Procedures document which  
sets out the Board’s key administrative processes used to ensure 
information is provided to the Board and its committees to enable 
them to fulfil their roles properly. The Practices and Procedures 
document was updated by the Board in February 2008. The document 
contains the list of matters reserved for the Board which has been 
compiled to ensure that the Board is made aware of all matters that 
are appropriate for it to consider, and has also been communicated to 
the management of the Group’s companies to enable them to manage 
their operations within a clearly defined framework of control. Matters 
reserved for the Board include major investment decisions and changes 
in the composition of the Group. The Board approves the Group’s 
strategic plan, which includes financial and operational objectives, and 
considers detailed financial and operational reports on the progress of 
the Group. Senior executives below Board level are invited to attend 
certain Board meetings to make presentations and participate  
in discussions. Authority has been delegated to the executive 
management team to deal with specific matters, including capital 
expenditure, contract approval, acquisitions and disposals at certain 
levels as determined by the Board.
Non-executive Directors are encouraged to become familiar with  
the Group’s businesses and there is regular communication between 
executive management and Non-executive Directors. The Chairman  
is responsible for ensuring that Board meetings operate to an 
appropriate agenda and that adequate information is provided 
sufficiently in advance of meetings to allow proper consideration.  
He is supported by the Company Secretary, to whom all Directors  
have access. The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Board  
and audit committee. 
The Board has an agreed procedure for any Director to obtain 
independent professional advice at the Company’s expense. Directors’ 
and officers’ liability insurance is held by the Company and details have 
been circulated to the Directors.
The Board membership and that of its committees is designed to 
ensure that no one individual or group of individuals dominates 
proceedings and that the wide variety of skills allows effective 
leadership across the Group’s business activities. In view of the nature 
of the Group and the details shown in this Corporate Governance 
statement, the Board believes that the current number and balance  
of Directors is appropriate.
The Chairman and Directors regularly discuss matters informally 
outside of Board meetings. In addition, meetings of the Non-executive 
Directors are held annually, both with and without the Chairman being 
present. Such meetings are chaired by the Senior Independent Director.
The Senior Independent Director is responsible for appraising the 
performance of the Chairman and is available to meet shareholders to 
discuss concerns that they may have.
There is a clear division of responsibility between the Chairman  
and Chief Executive, which is reflected in the Board’s Practices and 
Procedures document. In summary, the Chairman is responsible for the 
leadership and running of the Board but does not have any executive 
powers or responsibilities. There have been no changes in the 
Chairman’s external commitments which have affected his ability  
to perform his role with the Group. The Chief Executive leads the 
executive management team in running the Group’s businesses and in 
implementing operating and strategic plans under authority delegated 
by the Board. The Group’s executive committee currently comprises 
Clive Snowdon, Doug Robertson and Andrew Moss as Executive 
Directors, Mike Giles as Group Operations Finance Director and Steve 
Bowers as Company Secretary.
Standing committees of the Board
The principal standing committees of the Board are the audit 
committee, the remuneration committee and the nomination 
committee. Each of these committees operates under written  
terms of reference which clearly set out their respective delegated 
responsibilities and authorities, copies of which are available from the 
Company Secretary or on the Company’s website www.umeco.com.

  Meetings and attendance
The Directors ensure the effectiveness of the Board through the holding of regular Board meetings and by having open lines of communication 
between all Board members. During the year to 31 March 2010, the Board met 13 times. The audit committee met on two occasions and  
the remuneration committee met five times. The nomination committee met eight times during the year, in relation to the appointments  
of Neil Johnson and Adrian Auer to the Board.

Audit committee
The audit committee is chaired by Graham Zacharias, who succeeded David Porter as chairman of the committee on 31 December 2009.  
At 31 March 2010, the other committee member was Stephen Bird. Adrian Auer was appointed a member of the committee on 30 April 2010. 
Graham Zacharias is a chartered accountant with recent and relevant financial experience and Stephen Bird and Adrian Auer are senior business 
executives who have significant experience of corporate financial matters. The members of the audit committee ensure that their knowledge of 
relevant legislation and best practice developments is maintained. The committee received reports from the external auditor who attended the 
committee’s meetings. The committee also calls upon the Chief Executive, Finance Director and Company Secretary to attend portions of its 
meetings. The committee’s work included reviewing the financial statements, accounting policies and significant areas of judgement. The 
committee also assessed the proposed external audit approach and the independence and objectivity of the external auditor. In assessing auditor 
independence the committee obtained confirmation from the external auditor that its ethics and independence policies complied with the 
requirements of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. The use of the auditor for non-audit work is monitored by the 
committee. The Board’s approval is required prior to the Company’s external auditor undertaking significant due diligence or similar project-
based advisory work for the Group. The Board and audit committee continue to believe that there are certain non-audit services where it is more 
efficient and more cost effective for the external auditor to be used. These include conducting financial due diligence in respect of potential 
acquisition opportunities. Details of the amounts paid to the auditor during the year for audit and other services are set out in note 3 to the 
consolidated financial statements on page 43.
The responsibilities and objectives of the audit committee are set out in the committee’s terms of reference, which are summarised as follows:
to review the financial statements of the Group and report on matters of significance to the Board, particularly any changes in accounting • 
policies and practices, major judgemental areas and significant adjustments arising from the external audit;
to be responsible for the appointment, re-appointment and removal of the Company’s external auditor, subject to consultation with the  • 
Board and shareholder approval, and to oversee the relationship with the external auditor;
to review the audit planning process and scope of work performed by the external auditor; and • 
to review the Company’s internal financial control system and risk management systems and to monitor the need for an internal audit • 
function, unless these have been expressly addressed by the Board itself.
Two audit committee meetings were held during the year. These considered the results of the interim and full year audit processes, and also 
considered the planning and scope for the auditor’s work in respect of these financial statements.

  Remuneration committee
The remuneration committee is chaired by Stephen Bird, who succeeded 
Graham Zacharias as chairman of the committee with effect from  
17 February 2010. The committee’s other members are Graham Zacharias 
and Chris Hole. In order to avoid any compromise in the activities of  
the remuneration committee, the chairman of the committee takes 
responsibility for minuting meetings. The committee’s main 
responsibilities are to determine the specific remuneration packages of 
the Chairman, Executive Directors and Company Secretary including 
salaries, annual bonus and longer term incentive schemes, pensions and 
other benefits. Further information on the structure of remuneration 
implemented by the committee is contained in the Remuneration Report, 
which also contains further details of the work of the committee. There  
is a separate Non-executive Directors’ remuneration committee which 
has responsibility for reviewing the remuneration of the Non-executive 
Directors. The members of the Non-executive Directors’ remuneration 
committee are the Chairman, Chief Executive and Finance Director. This 
committee did not meet during the year. Until 30 April 2010, there was a 
separate Chairman’s remuneration committee which had responsibility 
for reviewing the remuneration of the Chairman. The Chairman’s 
remuneration committee comprised the Chief Executive, Senior 
Independent Director and chairman of the remuneration committee.  
This committee met on three occasions during the year. Subsequent to 
30 April 2010, responsibility for the Chairman’s remuneration has been 
transferred to the remuneration committee.
Nomination committee
The Board recognises the need to refresh its membership and properly 
manage the process by which new Directors are appointed. The 
nomination committee is responsible for identifying and selecting 
candidates to fill Board vacancies for both executive and non-executive 
positions. The committee also keeps under review the structure, size 
and composition of the Board, to ensure the Board continues to have 
an appropriate balance of skills and experience. The committee 
comprises all members of the Board, other than the Director whose 
replacement is being selected. The Chairman of the Company is 
normally chairman of the committee, other than when the Chairman’s 
replacement is being selected, in which case the Senior Independent 
Director shall chair the committee. 
Where appropriate, the nomination committee uses the services of 
external recruitment consultants. Details of potential candidates 
provided by consultants may be initially reviewed by a sub-committee 
of the nomination committee and meetings with selected candidates 
are then held with Directors. Subsequently, the nomination committee 
meets to discuss and confirm an appointment.
In conjunction with the Company Secretary, the committee will ensure 
that on appointment to the Board, Non-executive Directors receive a 
formal letter of appointment setting out clearly what is expected of 
them in terms of time commitment, including committee service and 
involvement outside Board meetings, and will ensure they receive an 
adequate introduction to the Group and its activities, including site 
visits to the Group’s principal operations. The nomination committee 
also reviews the Company’s succession plans. 
The Board as a whole also considers this subject and considers 
succession planning for senior Corporate executives, with the 
nomination committee focusing specifically on succession planning  
for members of the Board.
The nomination committee met on a total of eight times during 
the year. The committee met on six occasions in relation to the 
appointment of a new Chairman. These meetings were chaired by 
David Porter, the Senior Independent Director at the time. In addition, 
the committee met on two occasions in relation to the appointment  
of a Non-executive Director to the Board, which led to the appointment 
of Adrian Auer as a Director on 30 April 2010. These meetings were 
chaired by Neil Johnson.
Investor relations
The Annual General Meeting is recognised by the Board as an 
important opportunity to meet and communicate with shareholders, 
particularly private investors. The 2009 Annual General Meeting was 
held on 29 July 2009 and was chaired by Brian McGowan, the 
Chairman of the Company at that date, and was attended by all  
of the Directors who then held office. The Chairman of the meeting 
encouraged debate and questions at the formal meeting and 
informally during refreshments afterwards.
Each substantially separate issue was put to the 2009 Annual General 
Meeting as an individual motion and the meeting was invited to adopt 
and approve the financial statements and the Directors’ Report for the 
year to 31 March 2009. A separate resolution for the approval of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report was also put to the meeting. Notice of 
the 2009 Annual General Meeting was sent to shareholders more than 
twenty working days in advance of the meeting and the level of proxy 
votes lodged for and against each resolution, together with details of 
abstentions, were disclosed at the meeting. After the conclusion of 
each annual general meeting the results in respect of every resolution 
are published through a Regulatory Information Service and on the 
Company’s website. Full details are also available upon request from 
the Company Secretary. In addition to the Annual Report, the Company 
produces an interim report which is sent to shareholders and publishes 
interim management statements in the second and fourth quarters  
of its financial year. The Group’s website, www.umeco.com, includes 
copies of certain key presentations made by senior management, 
recent annual and interim reports, press releases and links to the 
websites of the Group’s businesses.
The Board as a whole seeks to maintain a thorough understanding of 
the issues and concerns of major shareholders. Dialogue is maintained 
with shareholders and the Executive Directors regularly meet with 
institutional investors. The Chief Executive and Finance Director have 
primary responsibility for investor relations and updates on this 
subject are provided at all Board meetings. In addition, copies of 
analyst research notes and regular reports from the Company’s 
corporate broking advisors are provided to the Board. The Chairman, 
Senior Independent Director and other Non-executive Directors will 
consider requests for meetings with shareholders.

Company Information Board induction, development, evaluation and re-election
The Company ensures that all new Directors receive an adequate 
introduction to the Group and its activities, including site visits to the 
Group’s principal operations. During Directors’ service with the Group, 
regular input at meetings from a number of members of the executive 
committee assists in keeping the Board up-to-date with matters of 
significance to the Group, in addition to the reporting contained in 
papers provided to the Board each month. Board meetings are held at 
the Group’s principal operating units on a rolling basis, most recently  
at the facilities of Pattonair in Derby and Aerovac Systems in Keighley 
and Non-executive Directors are encouraged to make additional  
visits to the Group’s operations in order to ensure their knowledge 
remains current. The training and continuing professional development 
needs of Directors are kept under review with ongoing training being 
provided as necessary.
Formal evaluations of the performance of the Board and its 
committees are conducted annually. The most recent evaluation was 
made in March and April 2010 by the Chairman in conjunction with  
the Company Secretary. The evaluation took into account the views  
of each of the Directors on a wide range of matters, including the 
performance of the Board, its committees and the Directors, and 
matters relating to the leadership and culture of the Group. The  
results of the evaluation process are compiled and summarised by  
the Company Secretary, and then reported to the Board. Where 
required, the Board has then acted in order to enhance further the 
effectiveness of the Board’s procedures and working practices.
Each new appointee to the Board is required to stand for election at 
the next Annual General Meeting following their appointment. In 
addition, any Director who held office at the time of the two preceding 
annual general meetings and who did not retire at either of them, and 
any Non-executive Director who has been in office for a period of nine 
years or more will automatically stand for re-election.
The Board considers that each of the Directors seeking election and 
re-election at the 2010 Annual General Meeting should be supported  
by shareholders since each of these Directors continues to be effective 
and demonstrates commitment to his role.

Nature of the Group
The Group has a clear organisational structure and well established 
reporting and control disciplines. Directors of the Group’s operating 
companies assume responsibility for, and exercise a high degree of 
autonomy in, running day-to-day trading activities. These activities  
are conducted within a framework of clear rules, authority limits and 
policies regarding business conduct, which are documented in the 
Group’s Policies & Procedures Manual. The Manual sets out minimum 
standards for accounting systems and controls, and has been made 
available on the Group’s intranet to ensure all appropriate staff have 
ready access to its content. Certified quarterly reports are required 
from operating company management which confirm compliance  
with the Group’s key internal controls.
In view of the devolved nature of the Group, and the disciplines 
referred to above, the Company does not require an extensive  
head office function nor is it appropriate for it to operate with  
a large number of Executive Directors. The Board considers these  
to be commercial strengths for the Group and they have been 
important factors in the Board’s assessment of its corporate 
governance arrangements.
Each operating company has a local board that reports to the Chief 
Operating Officer. Through monthly board meetings held by each 
operating company, the Executive Directors maintain close and 
frequent contact with operating company management. In addition  
to financial performance, the reporting made by operating companies 
covers non-financial matters, notably health & safety and the 
environment. The reporting includes key performance indicators 
relevant for each operating company. Summaries of the Group’s key 
performance indicators are provided to the Board each month.
All operating companies prepare rolling forecasts extending for four 
calendar quarters and a strategic plan, which includes projections for 
the next three financial years. These are reviewed in detail by the 
Executive Directors and are consolidated for review and approval  
by the Board. Performance against forecast is continually monitored  
by the Executive Directors, reviewed at monthly meetings of the 
executive committee and reported to all meetings of the Board.

  Systems of internal control
As required by the UK Listing Authority, the Company has complied 
with the Combined Code provisions on internal control. The Company 
has in place risk assessment processes and established procedures 
necessary to implement the Turnbull Committee guidance, as updated 
by the Financial Reporting Council, and for reporting in accordance 
with that guidance.
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of  
internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness, whilst the role  
of management is to implement Board policies on risk and control.  
The system of internal control is designed to manage rather than 
eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can  
only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
There is a continuous process for identifying, evaluating and managing 
the significant risks faced by the Group, which has been in place for the 
year under review and up to the date of approval of this Annual Report.
The Board has reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s system of 
internal controls during the year, including strategic, operational,  
legal and compliance, risk management and financial controls. The 
processes used by the Board for their review include the following:
the Board receives regular reports from management which • 
highlight any material control weaknesses and discusses actions 
taken on weaknesses identified by management;
the audit committee, based on reports provided by the external • 
auditor, reviews the effectiveness of the internal financial control 
system, and any significant matters are referred to the Board for 
consideration. The chairman of the audit committee reports the 
outcome of the audit committee meetings to the Board; and 
the Board considers all significant financing and investment • 
opportunities relating to the Group, including the granting of 
guarantees, and monitors policy in respect of managing treasury  
and exchange risks.
Consistent with the Turnbull Committee guidance, the Group’s 
management operated a risk management process during the year 
which identifies the key risks facing each of the Group’s businesses  
and reports to the Board on how those risks are being addressed. This 
is based on each business reporting on risk assessment and business 
development policy, which identifies the key risks facing the business, 
the probability of those risks occurring and the actions being taken to 
mitigate those risks to the desired level.
These reports are combined to provide the Board with a report of the 
significant risks faced by the Group as a whole, together with details  
of the controls in place over those risks.
Whistleblowing policy
The Group is committed to the highest standards of openness and 
accountability and encourages its members of staff to raise genuine 
concerns about malpractice at the earliest practicable stage rather 
than wait for proof. The Group Policies & Procedures Manual 
encourages concerns to be disclosed, in confidence, orally or in writing, 
to the Group Operations Finance Director or the Company Secretary. 
The Group will take appropriate action against any person victimising 
another for using this procedure or deterring any person from 
reporting genuine concerns under it.
Internal audit
The Group does not have a separate internal audit function, however 
the central finance department conducts detailed reviews of the 
financial records and controls of the Group’s operating companies.  
The results of these reviews are provided to the Board and the external 
auditor. The Board periodically reviews the need for a separate internal 
audit function and has done so during 2010. In light of the reviews 
carried out by the central finance department, the current conclusion  
of the Board is that a separate internal audit function is not necessary.
Through the procedures outlined above, the Board has considered all 
significant aspects of internal control for the year and up to the date  
of this Annual Report. The Board believes that the Group’s system of 
internal control, which is designed to manage rather than eliminate 
risk, provides reasonable but not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.

Company Information Corporate social responsibility
The Board takes account of social, environmental and ethical 
considerations when managing the Group and when considering new 
investment opportunities. This is monitored as part of the Group’s 
annual risk assessment process. The direct environmental impact  
of the Group’s activities is limited, however the Group considers the 
environmental impact of all significant investment opportunities  
and is engaged in a continuing effort to improve the environmental 
performance of all of its businesses. The Group aims to reduce its 
impact on the environment by controlling energy usage, which  
may be achieved by avoiding any unnecessary expenditure,  
improving cost-effectiveness or taking any other appropriate  
steps to reduce energy consumption levels. The Group is a member  
of the FTSE4Good Index.
Health & safety remains a key component of the Group’s corporate 
social responsibility strategy. Reporting of health & safety matters is 
made to the Board every month. The Group’s health & safety policy 
statement is regularly updated and circulated to the Group’s operating 
companies. Specialist staff at each of these companies ensure 
compliance with this statement. Root cause analysis and similar 
investigative work is carried out following all health & safety incidents. 
The Group maintains accident reporting systems which are primarily 
used to identify trends with a view to developing strategies for 
reducing the number of accidents. There were no major health & 
safety incidents during the year to 31 March 2010.
The Group’s current system of risk management and control, which 
includes social responsibility matters, is led by each of the Group’s 
operations. Senior staff at these companies are responsible for 
complying with the relevant environmental regulations in all the 
geographical areas in which they operate. They report to the Board  
on such issues through the Chief Operating Officer, who has ultimate 
responsibility for such matters, as part of the Group’s system of 
internal control and risk management reporting. Overall the Group 
continues to believe that it has limited environmental impact. 
However, the Group recognises that it has a responsibility to 
understand the impact that its activities have at local, national and 
global level. These have been monitored and assessed, and solutions 
have been implemented as appropriate according to best practice, local 
legal and other requirements.
The Group continues to focus attention on areas where its impact on 
stakeholders is most beneficial, by delivering an improved and more 
secure environment for our employees, customers and suppliers, and 
by operating ethically as an international Group. The Group’s values 
statements, set out below, are key to the Group’s success and the way 
in which it conducts business:
build with integrity, fairness and trust; • 
challenge and innovate; • 
always put delivery first; and • 
make ambition work. • 
Employment
Employment policies throughout the Group have been established  
to comply with relevant legislation and codes of practice relating  
to employment, health & safety and equal opportunities. The  
Group provides high quality working environments and facilities for 
employees, and training and development appropriate to each of their 
roles. The Group does not discriminate against employees in any way 
and provides a competitive range of employee benefits. The Group 
keeps employees informed on matters relating to their employment 
and on financial and economic factors affecting the Group. This is 
achieved through management briefings, the Group’s website and  
by distribution of press releases and internal announcements. This 
enables employees to gain a better understanding of the Group’s 
business objectives and their roles in achieving them. Building and 
developing the skills, competencies, motivation and teamwork of 
employees is recognised by the Board as being key to achieving the 
Group’s business objectives. The Group places importance on the 
contributions to be made by all employees to the progress of the  
Group and aims to keep them informed by the use of formal and 
informal meetings.
The Group’s commitment to rewarding employees and valuing 
qualities such as determination are enshrined in the Group’s values 
statements. Encouragement is given to all UK employees to participate 
in the Group’s SAYE Share Option Scheme (the ‘Scheme’) under which 
options over the Company’s shares are granted to employees who 
enter into contracts to save agreed amounts each month. The most 
recent invitation under the Scheme was made in July 2009 and further 
invitations are planned.
Ability and aptitude are the determining factors in the selection, 
training, career development and promotion of all employees. The 
Group provides a range of training and development opportunities for 
employees, including induction training, health & safety training and 
support with programmes leading to relevant professional or academic 
qualifications, in addition to specific training related to the role of  
each employee. The Group recognises its responsibility under the UK’s 
Disability Discrimination Act 1995 and does not discriminate against 
disabled people. If an employee is, or becomes, disabled during their 
period of employment, the Group will, if necessary and to the extent 
possible, adapt the working environment to enable the employee to 
continue in their current position or retrain the employee for duties 
suited to their abilities following disablement. It continues to be the 
Group’s policy to consider applications for employment from disabled 
people on the same basis as other potential employees.
Health & safety training is part of the induction process for new 
employees. Specific training is given where relevant, for example 
regarding forklift truck operation and chemical handling, as well  
as fire safety and first aid matters.
Risk assessments are used in all parts of the Group, with these  
being updated on a regular basis and also when new equipment  
or machinery is acquired or new processes are introduced.

  Going concern
A review of Group business activities and future outlook are set out  
on pages 06 to 23 which includes the Chairman’s Statement, Chief 
Executive’s Review and Finance Director’s Review. The financial 
position of the Group, its cash flows and liquidity position are shown  
in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, Consolidated Statement of Cash 
Flows and accompanying notes to the financial statements. The 
principal business risks associated with the business are shown on 
pages 20 and 21. In addition, note 27 to the consolidated financial 
statements includes the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for 
managing its capital, its financial risk management objectives, details 
of its financial instruments and hedging activities and its exposures to 
credit and liquidity risk. 
The Group’s bank facilities amount to £166.7 million. This comprises a 
US$150.0 million committed revolving credit facility which extends to 
June 2014, a US$87.7 million term loan facility expiring in August 2011 
and an overdraft facility of £10.0 million. After considering the nature 
and duration of these facilities and making appropriate enquiries, 
based on the strength of the Group’s balance sheet, current 
expectations of future trading (based on future cash flow forecasts 
and revenue projections which the Directors believe are based on a 
realistic assessment of future business performance) and on the 
facilities available to the Group, the Directors believe they have 
reasonable grounds for stating that the Company and the Group have 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Environment
Umeco operates at the leading edge of environmental change in its 
principal markets, with the Group’s advanced composite materials and 
services being used to improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions.  
The Group’s customers operate in industries that demand high 
environmental standards from their suppliers and the Group 
continually raises its standards in response. 
Well established environmental management systems and 
comprehensive policies are in place. The Group strives to make 
continuous improvements to its usage of natural resources, in areas 
such as recycling and the efficient use of energy and water. Recycling 
processes have been in use in the Group for many years, and recycled 
materials are used wherever possible. Improvements to reduce the 
environmental impact of the Group’s operations are regularly 
implemented. Further details are set out on pages 22 and 23.
Community impact and involvement
The Group contributes to local worthwhile causes and charities, and 
ensures that the Group’s operations cause minimal negative impact 
within the community. In common with all companies, the Group has 
limited resources and the amount of money available for charitable 
purposes varies over time.
Relationships with suppliers, customers and other stakeholders
The Group recognises the obligations it has towards the parties with 
whom it has business dealings including customers, shareholders, 
employees, suppliers and advisors. Dealings with these parties  
depend upon the honesty and integrity of the Group’s staff and every 
effort is made to ensure that a high standard of expertise and business 
principles is maintained in such dealings. Where appropriate, training  
is given to maintain and to raise standards.
The Group’s policy towards suppliers is that each operating company is 
responsible for negotiating the terms and conditions under which they 
trade with suppliers. Once terms are agreed, payments to suppliers are 
made in accordance with those terms and conditions, subject always 
to the supplier having complied with them.

Company Information The Remuneration Report is presented to shareholders by the Board 
and sets out the remuneration policy and details of the remuneration 
of each Director. The Report will be put to the 2010 Annual General 
Meeting for approval by shareholders. 
Remuneration committee 
The remuneration committee is chaired by Stephen Bird, who 
succeeded Graham Zacharias as chairman of the committee with 
effect from 17 February 2010. The committee’s other members are 
Graham Zacharias and Chris Hole. The committee has access to the 
Company’s professional advisors and is empowered to seek further 
independent professional advice if this is required. The committee is 
responsible for all aspects of the remuneration packages of Executive 
Directors and the Chairman. The members of the committee have no 
personal financial interest in the Company, other than as shareholders 
and in respect of the fees received in their capacity as Non-executive 
Directors. They have no day-to-day involvement in the management of 
the Group nor do they have any potential conflicts of interest arising 
from cross-directorships, and they do not participate in any form of 
performance related pay or pension arrangements.
The Chairman and Chief Executive may attend meetings of the 
remuneration committee by invitation. No Executive Director  
or other attendee is present when their own remuneration is  
under consideration.
Remuneration policy
The remuneration policy is set by the Board as a whole with the 
remuneration committee then working within this policy to set 
individual levels of remuneration. The aim of the policy is for the Group 
to attract, motivate and retain high calibre executives by rewarding 
them with competitive salary, benefit and incentive packages which 
are linked to performance and which are designed to enhance the 
business and the creation of shareholder value. The remuneration 
committee uses the services of Deloitte LLP, whom it appoints to 
provide remuneration advice and salary benchmarking data. During 
the year, Deloitte LLP also provided corporate tax advisory services to 
the Group.
Review of executive remuneration
During the year, the remuneration committee has reviewed the 
structure of Executive Directors’ remuneration and has concluded  
that a number of changes be made going forward (i.e. for the year to 
31 March 2011 and beyond).  The changes are designed to strengthen 
alignment of management and shareholder interests, as well as to 
bring the package more in line with market practice.  These changes 
are summarised below:
subject to shareholder approval at the Company’s 2010 Annual • 
General Meeting, a Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’) will be 
introduced.  Typically this will operate with an annual award  
of 50 per cent of salary in performance shares. It is intended that for 
initial awards, half of the award will be subject to EPS growth 
targets and half will be subject to relative Total Shareholder Return 
(‘TSR’) performance;
a shareholding guideline of 1 x salary will be introduced for • 
Executive Directors;
at the same time, we will be reducing the maximum opportunity • 
under the annual bonus scheme (the ‘Umeco Bonus Plan’) from  
150 per cent of salary to 125 per cent of salary;
the amount deferred under the Umeco Bonus Plan will also be • 
reduced from three fifths of the bonus to two fifths of the bonus.  
The remuneration committee recognises that the trend in the 
market is towards greater deferral but believes that the overall 
package will create greater alignment with shareholders than 
previously, through the introduction of the Performance Share Plan 
and the shareholding guideline; and
annual bonus performance targets will also be re-calibrated to have • 
an element of personal performance.  Half of the bonus will be 
dependent upon the Group’s adjusted profit before tax, 25 per cent 
will relate to the Group’s working capital to sales ratio and 25 per 
cent will relate to personal objectives (which may or may not 
include financial targets).
The following sections set out the elements of the remuneration 
package for Executive Directors. Senior managers have similar 
arrangements.
Basic salaries
The basic salaries of Executive Directors are reviewed annually with 
effect from 1 April, or when a change in the scope of an Executive 
Director’s role occurs. The remuneration committee does not have  
a formal positioning policy for basic salary levels as it is aware of  
the issues arising from the setting of salary levels solely by reference  
to a benchmark. Instead, when reviewing salaries, the committee  
uses external salary information and also takes into account the 
performance of the Group, the calibre of the individual and their 
contribution to the success of the Group. The committee considers 
market data for executives of comparable status and skills in 
companies of similar size and complexity. At the Executive’s choosing 
and subject to the approval of the remuneration committee, salary 
may be converted into additional employer pension contributions.
Benefits in kind
Benefits in kind provided are primarily a fully expensed company car  
and private medical insurance. Directors may choose to forego the 
company car benefit in return for an additional payment of salary,  
such payment being calculated so as to leave the Company no worse  
off from the change.
Annual performance related bonus
Executive Directors participate in the Umeco Bonus Plan under which 
the value delivered to individuals is dependent upon the Group’s 
adjusted profit before tax. The targets set under the Umeco Bonus Plan 
are integrated with financial projections, prepared at the start of the 
year. Performance targets are reviewed in detail to ensure that they are 
sufficiently stretching and that they continue to be aligned with the 
Group’s strategy and the creation of shareholder value.

Company Information
Governance
Remuneration Report For the year to 31 March 2010, Executive Directors were eligible for a 
maximum award of 150 per cent of basic salary. Two fifths of the value 
of any award is paid in cash (i.e. up to a maximum of 60 per cent of 
basic salary) and the remaining three fifths is delivered in the form  
of a deferred award in the Company’s shares (i.e. up to a maximum  
of 90 per cent of basic salary). An individual must normally remain in 
employment with the Company for three years following the award 
date in order to receive the value of these deferred shares. Payments 
under the Umeco Bonus Plan are non-pensionable. 
Although deferred shares awarded will have been earned as a result of 
performance in a particular year, full entitlement to them is deferred, 
normally until the third anniversary of the award date. An Executive 
leaving during this three year period, other than for reasons acceptable 
to the committee, will forfeit their right to the deferred shares. Any 
shares required in respect of these deferred share arrangements will  
be acquired in the market and no new shares will be allotted.
Performance Share Plan
Subject to shareholder approval at the Company’s 2010 Annual General 
Meeting, Executive Directors will participate in a PSP.  Typically, an 
award of 50 per cent of salary will be made annually in performance 
shares. It is intended that for initial awards, half of the award will be 
subject to EPS growth targets and half of the award will be subject to 
relative TSR performance against an appropriate comparator group.
For awards made in the year to 31 March 2011, it is intended that the 
following targets will apply:
for the EPS portion, 25 per cent will vest for EPS growth of  • 
RPI + 5.0 per cent per annum over the three-year period from 1 April 
2010 to 31 March 2013 and 100 per cent will vest for EPS growth of 
RPI + 10.0 per cent per annum over the same period; and
for the TSR portion, 25 per cent will vest for median performance • 
over the three-year period from 1 April 2010 to 31 March 2013 
against the FTSE Industrial Goods and Services index and 100 per 
cent will vest for upper quartile performance.
Straight-line pro-rating will apply for EPS and TSR performance 
between these points.
The PSP would enable executives to earn shares in the Company  
based on the achievement of stretching performance conditions. 
Participation in the PSP will be offered to Executive Directors and 
selected individuals. For the 2010 grant cycle it is intended that  
awards of 50 per cent of salary will be granted to Executive Directors. 
Award levels to participants below Executive Director level will be 
appropriately scaled to reflect their role. Under the rules of the PSP, the 
maximum face value of PSP Awards granted to a participant in any 
financial year, may not exceed 100 per cent of their salary at the date 
of grant, other than in exceptional circumstances (e.g. recruitment) as 
determined by the remuneration committee, in which case the 
maximum would be 150 per cent.
The level of vesting of these shares will be subject to the achievement 
of stretching performance conditions satisfied over a three year period. 
Further details of the PSP are set out in the notes for Resolution 14.
Chairman’s 2010 Share Award Plan
Subject to shareholder approval at the Company’s 2010 Annual General 
Meeting, the Company proposes to introduce a specific share incentive 
arrangement for the Chairman. This new share matching plan is 
designed to align the Chairman’s interests with shareholders and also 
to incentivise him and reward him for superior performance of the 
Company. The remuneration committee consider that the targets are 
challenging and any rewards for the Chairman will thus be linked to 
material increases in shareholder value. Conditional on the Chairman 
purchasing 50,000 ordinary shares in the Company (which he has 
already done), he will receive a matching share award over up to 
300,000 shares. In order for these shares to vest both a share price 
condition and a TSR condition must be satisfied and he must continue 
to hold his own shareholding and generally remain appointed by the 
Company until 19 October 2012. Further details of the scheme are set 
out in the notes for Resolution 15.
Share options
Executive options
Executive Directors have been eligible to participate in the Umeco 
2001 Share Option Plan (‘2001 Plan’) under which options were 
granted at the prevailing market price at the time of grant, and were 
not normally exercisable before the expiry of three years from the date 
of grant. Options were not exercisable more than ten years after the 
date of grant. In line with the remuneration policy detailed in this 
report, no further grants of options are planned to be made under the  
2001 Plan and no options were outstanding as at 31 March 2009 or  
31 March 2010.
When granting options under the 2001 Plan, the remuneration 
committee took into account the salary level of the individuals concerned.
SAYE Share Option Scheme
The Group’s SAYE Share Option Scheme (‘SAYE Scheme’) is open to 
Directors spending at least 25 hours per week on Group business. 
Options under the SAYE Scheme are exercisable during a six month 
period commencing three years from the date of grant.

Company Information Directors’ pension entitlements
Details of Executive Directors pension entitlements are shown below. Executive Directors may convert an element of their pension entitlement 
into salary, or convert an element of their salary into pension contributions. All such conversions are subject to the approval of the remuneration 
committee. No conversions were made in the year to 31 March 2010.
Clive Snowdon
Clive Snowdon is entitled to employer’s pension contributions equivalent to 39.0 per cent of basic salary. The Company is the principal employer 
under a funded unapproved retirement benefits scheme (FURBS) in respect of Clive Snowdon.
Doug Robertson
Doug Robertson is entitled to employer’s pension contributions equivalent to 15.0 per cent of basic salary. At his choosing, these contributions 
are being paid into an independent SIPP arrangement. 
Andrew Moss
Andrew Moss is entitled to employer’s pension contributions equivalent to 20.0 per cent of basic salary. 
Andrew Moss is a member of the defined benefit section of the Umeco Scheme which is approved by HM Revenue & Customs. Until normal 
retirement date, members currently contribute 6.5 per cent of pensionable salary and the Group contributed 26.3 per cent of pensionable salary 
in the year to 31 March 2010. The Umeco Scheme had a cap on pensionable salary of £123,600 during the year. The Scheme provides members 
with a pension of up to two thirds of pensionable salary on retirement. It also provides a lump sum death in service benefit and pensions for 
dependants of members on their death in service or following retirement. Normal retirement age is 65. At Andrew Moss’ choosing, the remaining 
employer’s pension contribution entitlement is being paid into an independent SIPP arrangement.
Remuneration of Non-executive Directors
The policy of Non-executive remuneration is to pay an appropriate fee based on each Director’s time and work on the Board and its committees. 
The remuneration of the Non-executive Directors is determined by the Non-executive Directors’ remuneration committee. No Non-executive 
Director is involved in setting his own remuneration. David Porter’s remuneration was reviewed with effect from 31 August 2009 to reflect his 
additional responsibilities as interim Chairman. Fees of £22,000 were paid to David Porter in relation to his role as interim Chairman. These fees 
are included in the table of Directors’ remuneration on page 86.
Policy on external appointments and retention of fees
Subject to the approval of the Board in each case, Executive Directors may accept external appointments as Non-executive Directors of other 
companies and retain any related fees paid to them, provided always that such external appointments are not considered by the Board to prevent 
or reduce the ability of the Executive to perform their role to the required standard. Such appointments are seen as a way in which 
Executive Directors can gain a broader business experience and, in turn, benefit the Company. Clive Snowdon is a Non-executive Director of 
Hill & Smith Holdings PLC and has retained the fees paid to him for his services which, in the year to 31 March 2010, were £41,000 (2009: £36,000).
Service contracts
The Company has agreed service contracts with Executive Directors which are considered consistent with normal practice in quoted companies 
wishing to attract and retain suitably qualified executives. The dates of these service contracts and the letters of appointment of the Non-
executive Directors, copies of which are available from the Company Secretary, are as follows:

Deferred share awards
Deferred share awards are recognised as remuneration upon the lifting of the restrictions attaching to the awards. The 2006 deferred share 
award vested in June 2009 and the June 2007 award vested in March 2010. The vesting of the June 2007 award was accelerated from the normal 
vesting date of June 2010 in view of the higher personal income tax rate that would be borne by participants at the normal date of vesting. In 
common with other listed companies, the remuneration committee considered the accelerated vesting to be equitable in these circumstances. 
The table of Directors’ remuneration on page 86 includes the values of the June 2006 and June 2007 awards, based upon the Umeco share price 
at the dates of vesting. The deferred share awards held by the Executive Directors under the Umeco Bonus Plan are as follows:

Explanatory notes to the Resolutions 
Resolutions 1 to 9 are proposed as Ordinary Resolutions. This means 
that for each of those Resolutions to be passed, more than half of the 
votes cast must be in favour of the Resolution. Resolutions 10 to 15 are 
proposed as Special Resolutions. This means that for each of those 
Resolutions to be passed, at least three-quarters of the votes cast must 
be in favour of the Resolution. The Board considers that all the 
Resolutions to be put to the meeting are in the best interests of the 
Company and its shareholders as a whole. Your Board will be voting in 
favour of them and unanimously recommends that you do so as well.
Further information on the Resolutions are as follows:
Resolution 1 
This Resolution is proposed to receive the financial statements and the 
reports of the Directors and auditor thereon for the year to 31 March 2010. 
Resolution 2
This Resolution is to approve the Directors’ Remuneration Report, which is 
included on pages 82 to 89 of the Annual Report and provides details of the 
Group’s remuneration policy for the Directors. The vote on this Resolution is 
advisory and no Director’s remuneration is conditional upon the passing of 
this Resolution.

  Resolution 3
This Resolution is to approve payment of a final dividend of 11.0 pence per 
25 pence ordinary share in respect of the year to 31 March 2010, such 
payment to be made on 8 October 2010 to shareholders on the register at 
the close of business on 10 September 2010.
Resolutions 4 to 6
These Resolutions concern the election and re-election of Directors  
retiring in accordance with the Articles of Association. At this year’s Annual 
General Meeting, the Directors to retire are Neil Johnson, Clive Snowdon 
and Adrian Auer.
Neil Johnson joined the Board as Non-executive Chairman on 19 October 
2009. He currently holds a number of senior Board and advisory positions 
with public and private companies. He is Chairman of Motability Operations 
Group Plc (a financial business owned by the UK clearing banks) and Hornby 
Plc. Until January 2010, he was a Director of Cybit Holdings Plc. He is also a 
member of a Ministry of Defence Advisory Board and an Independent 
Member of the Metropolitan Police Authority.
Clive Snowdon joined the Group in April 1997 and has a broad industrial 
background with significant experience in both distribution and 
manufacturing. He is a member of the Board of Directors of the Midlands 
Aerospace Alliance, becoming Chairman in May 2009, and is a member of 
the Council of the A  D  S trade body. He has been a Non-executive Director 
of Hill & Smith Holdings PLC since May 2007 and was appointed Senior 
Independent Director in May 2009.
Adrian Auer joined the Board as a Non-executive Director and as Senior 
Independent Director on 30 April 2010. He is Chairman of Shanks Group plc 
and Readymix plc, Non-executive Director of Electrocomponents plc and 
Chairman of the charity Addaction. He has held the position of Finance 
Director in a number of major companies, notably in the building materials 
and construction sectors, in addition to senior finance positions with BP and 
ICI. Adrian Auer has been a member of the audit committee from 
the date of his appointment to the Board.
The Board remains satisfied that each of the Directors proposed for 
re-election is committed to the role and continues to be an effective and 
valuable member of the Board. 
Resolutions 7 and 8
These Resolutions are proposed to reappoint KPMG Audit Plc as auditor to 
hold office until the next general meeting of the Company at which 
accounts are presented and to authorise the Directors to determine the 
level of the auditor’s remuneration. 
Resolution 9
Paragraph (A) of this Resolution would give the Directors the authority to 
allot ordinary shares or grant rights to subscribe for or convert any 
securities into ordinary shares up to an aggregate nominal amount equal 
to £4,011,436 (representing 16,045,744 ordinary shares of 25 pence each). 
This amount represents approximately one-third of the issued ordinary 
share capital (excluding treasury shares) of the Company as at 18 June 
2010, the latest practicable date prior to publication of this Notice. 
In line with guidance issued by the Association of British Insurers (‘ABI’), 
paragraph (B) of this Resolution would give the Directors authority to 
allot ordinary shares or grant rights to subscribe for or convert any 
securities into ordinary shares in connection with a rights issue in 
favour of ordinary shareholders up to an aggregate nominal amount 
equal to £8,022,872 (representing 32,091,488 ordinary shares), as 
reduced by the nominal amount of any shares issued under 
paragraph (A) of this Resolution. This amount (before any reduction) 
represents approximately two-thirds of the issued ordinary share 
capital (excluding treasury shares) of the Company as at 18 June 2010, 
the latest practicable date prior to publication of this Notice.
The authorities sought under paragraphs (A) and (B) of this Resolution 
will expire at the earlier of 28 October 2011 and the conclusion of the 
Annual General Meeting of the Company held in 2011.
The Directors have no present intention to exercise either of the 
authorities sought under this Resolution. However, if they do exercise 
the authorities, the Directors intend to follow ABI recommendations 
concerning their use (including as regards the Directors standing for 
re-election in certain cases). 
As at the date of this Notice, no ordinary shares are held by the 
Company in treasury.
Resolution 10
This Resolution will be proposed as a Special Resolution, which requires 
a 75 per cent majority of the votes to be cast in favour. It would give 
the Directors the authority to allot ordinary shares (or sell any ordinary 
shares which the Company elects to hold in treasury) for cash without 
first offering them to existing shareholders in proportion to their 
existing shareholdings. 
This authority would be limited to allotments or sales in connection with 
pre-emptive offers and offers to holders of other equity securities if 
required by the rights of those shares or as the Board otherwise 
considers necessary, or otherwise up to an aggregate nominal amount of 
£601,715.25 (representing 2,406,861 ordinary shares). This aggregate 
nominal amount represents approximately 5 per cent of the issued 
ordinary share capital of the Company as at 18 June 2010, the latest 
practicable date prior to publication of this Notice. In respect of this 
aggregate nominal amount, the Directors confirm their intention to 
follow the provisions of the Pre-Emption Group’s Statement of Principles 
regarding cumulative usage of authorities within a rolling 3-year period 
where the Principles provide that usage in excess of 7.5 per cent should 
not take place without prior consultation with shareholders.
The authority will expire at the earlier of 28 October 2011 and the 
conclusion of the Annual General Meeting of the Company held 
in 2011. 
Resolution 11
Authority is sought for the Company to purchase up to 10 per cent of its 
issued ordinary shares (excluding any treasury shares), renewing the 
authority granted by the shareholders at last year’s Annual General Meeting.

Company Information The Directors have no present intention of exercising the authority to 
make market purchases, however the authority provides the flexibility 
to allow them to do so in the future. The Directors will exercise this 
authority only when to do so would be in the best interests of the 
Company, and of its shareholders generally, and could be expected to 
result in an increase in the earnings per share of the Company.
Ordinary shares purchased by the Company pursuant to this authority 
may be held in treasury or may be cancelled. The Directors will consider 
holding any ordinary shares the Company may purchase as treasury 
shares. The Company currently has no ordinary shares in treasury. The 
minimum price, exclusive of expenses, which may be paid for an 
Ordinary Share is 25 pence. The maximum price, exclusive of expenses, 
which may be paid for an Ordinary Share is the highest of (i) an amount 
equal to 5 per cent above the average market value for an Ordinary 
Share for the five business days immediately preceding the date of the 
purchase and (ii) the higher of the price of the last independent trade 
and the highest current independent bid on the trading venues where 
the purchase is carried out.
The Company has options outstanding over 1,319,386 ordinary shares, 
representing 2.7 per cent of the Company’s ordinary issued share 
capital (excluding treasury shares) as at 18 June 2010. If the Company 
bought back the maximum number of shares permitted pursuant to 
the existing authority given at last year’s Annual General Meeting and 
the authority now being sought by Resolution 11 and all such shares 
were cancelled, the total number of options outstanding would 
represent approximately 3.4 per cent of the Company’s ordinary issued 
share capital (excluding treasury shares) at that date.
The Company has no warrants in issue in relation to its shares. 
The authority will expire at the earlier of 28 October 2011 and the 
conclusion of the Annual General Meeting of the Company held in 2011.
Resolution 12
It is proposed in Resolution 12 to adopt new articles of association  
(the ‘New Articles’) in order to update the Company’s current articles  
of association (the ‘Current Articles’) primarily to take account of the 
coming into force of the Companies (Shareholders’ Rights) Regulations 
2009 (the ‘Shareholders’ Rights Regulations’) and the implementation 
of the last parts of the Companies Act 2006.
The principal changes introduced in the New Articles are summarised 
below. Other changes, which are of a minor, technical or clarifying 
nature and also some more minor changes which merely reflect 
changes made by the Companies Act 2006 or the Shareholders’ Rights 
Regulations or conform the language of the New Articles with that 
used in the model articles for public companies produced by the 
Department for Business, Innovation and Skills have not been noted 
below. A copy of the New Articles showing all changes to the Current  
Articles is available for inspection, as noted on page 103.
Principal changes to the Company’s Articles of Association
1. The Company’s objects
The provisions regulating the operations of the Company are currently 
set out in the Company’s memorandum and articles of association. The 
Company’s memorandum contains, among other things, the objects 
clause which sets out the scope of the activities the Company is 
authorised to undertake. This is drafted to give a wide scope.
The Companies Act 2006 significantly reduces the constitutional 
significance of a company’s memorandum. The Companies Act 2006 
provides that a memorandum will record only the names of subscribers 
and the number of shares each subscriber has agreed  
to take in the company. Under the Companies Act 2006 the objects 
clause and all other provisions which are contained in a company’s 
memorandum, for existing companies at 1 October 2009, are deemed 
to be contained in the company’s articles of association but the 
company can remove these provisions by special resolution. 
Further the Companies Act 2006 states that unless a company’s 
articles provide otherwise, a company’s objects are unrestricted. This 
abolishes the need for companies to have objects clauses. For this 
reason the Company is proposing to remove its objects clause together 
with all other provisions of its memorandum which, by virtue of the 
Companies Act 2006, are treated as forming part of the Company’s 
articles of association as of 1 October 2009. Resolution 12 (A) confirms 
the removal of these provisions for the Company. As the effect of this 
Resolution will be to remove the statement currently in the Company’s 
memorandum of association regarding limited liability, the New 
Articles also contain an express statement regarding the limited 
liability of shareholders.
2. Articles which duplicate statutory provisions
Provisions in the Current Articles which replicate provisions contained  
in the Companies Act 2006 are in the main to be removed in the  
New Articles. This is in line with the approach advocated by the 
Government that statutory provisions should not be duplicated  
in a company’s constitution.
3. Change of name
Under the Companies Act 1985, a company could only change its name 
by special resolution. Under the Companies Act 2006 a company will 
be able to change its name by other means provided for by its articles. 
To take advantage of this provision, the New Articles enable the 
directors to pass a resolution to change the Company’s name.
4. Authorised share capital and unissued shares
The Companies Act 2006 abolishes the requirement for a company  
to have an authorised share capital and the New Articles reflect this. 
Directors will still be limited as to the number of shares they can at any 
time allot because allotment authority continues to be required under 
the Companies Act 2006, save in respect of employee share schemes.

  5. Redeemable shares
Under the Companies Act 1985, if a company wished to issue 
redeemable shares, it had to include in its articles the terms and 
manner of redemption. The Companies Act 2006 enables directors  
to determine such matters instead provided they are so authorised  
by the articles. The New Articles contain such an authorisation. The 
Company has no plans to issue redeemable shares but if it did so the 
directors would need shareholders’ authority to issue new shares in 
the usual way.
6.  Authority to purchase own shares, consolidate and sub-divide 
shares, and reduce share capital
Under the Companies Act 1985, a company required specific enabling 
provisions in its articles to purchase its own shares, to consolidate  
or sub-divide its shares and to reduce its share capital or other 
undistributable reserves as well as shareholder authority to undertake 
the relevant action. The Current Articles include these enabling 
provisions. Under the Companies Act 2006 a company will only require 
shareholder authority to do any of these things and it will no longer be 
necessary for articles to contain enabling provisions. Accordingly the 
relevant enabling provisions have been removed in the New Articles.
7. Use of seals
Under the Companies Act 1985, a company required authority in its 
articles to have an official seal for use abroad. Under the Companies 
Act 2006, such authority will no longer be required. Accordingly, the 
relevant authorisation has been removed in the New Articles.
The New Articles provide an alternative option for execution of 
documents (other than share certificates). Under the New Articles, 
when the seal is affixed to a document it may be signed by one 
authorised person in the presence of a witness, whereas previously the 
requirement was for signature by either a director and the secretary  
or two directors or such other person or persons as the directors  
may approve.
8. Suspension of registration of share transfers
The Current Articles permit the directors to suspend the registration  
of transfers. Under the Companies Act 2006 share transfers must be 
registered as soon as practicable. The power in the Current Articles  
to suspend the registration of transfers is inconsistent with this 
requirement. Accordingly, this power has been removed in the  
New Articles.
9. Vacation of office by directors
The Current Articles specify the circumstances in which a director 
must vacate office. The New Articles update these provisions to  
treat physical illness in the same manner as mental illness. 
10. Voting by proxies on a show of hands
The Shareholders’ Rights Regulations have amended the Companies 
Act 2006 so that it now provides that each proxy appointed by  
a member has one vote on a show of hands unless the proxy is 
appointed by more than one member in which case the proxy has  
one vote for and one vote against if the proxy has been instructed by 
one or more members to vote for the resolution and by one or more 
members to vote against the resolution. The New Articles remove 
provisions in the Current Articles dealing with proxy voting on the basis 
that these are dealt with in the Companies Act 2006 and contain a 
provision clarifying how the provision of the Companies Act 2006 
giving a proxy a second vote on a show of hands should apply to 
discretionary authorities. 
11. Electronic conduct of meetings
Amendments made to the Companies Act 2006 by the Shareholders’ 
Rights Regulations specifically provide for the holding and conducting 
of electronic meetings. The Current Articles have been amended to 
reflect more closely the relevant provisions.
12. Adjournments for lack of quorum
Under the Companies Act 2006 as amended by the Shareholders’ 
Rights Regulations, general meetings adjourned for lack of quorum 
must be held at least 10 clear days after the original meeting. The 
Current Articles have been changed to reflect this requirement.
13. General
Generally the opportunity has been taken to bring clearer language 
into the New Articles and in some areas to conform the language  
of the New Articles with that used in the model articles for public 
companies produced by the Department for Business, Innovation  
and Skills.
Resolution 13
Changes made to the Companies Act 2006 by the Shareholders’ Rights 
Regulations increase the notice period required for general meetings  
of the Company to 21 days unless shareholders approve a shorter  
notice period, which cannot however be less than 14 clear days  
(Annual General Meetings will continue to be held on at least  
21 clear days’ notice.)
Before the coming into force of the Shareholders’ Rights Regulations on 
3 August 2009, the Company was able to call general meetings other 
than an annual general meeting on 14 clear days’ notice without 
obtaining such shareholder approval. In order to preserve this ability, 
Resolution 13 seeks such approval. The approval will be effective until 
the Company’s next annual general meeting, when it is intended that 
a similar Resolution will be proposed. 
Note that the changes to the Companies Act 2006 mean that, in order 
to be able to call a general meeting on less than 21 clear days’ notice, 
the Company must make a means of electronic voting available to all 
shareholders for that meeting.
Resolution 14
This Resolution proposes the adoption of the PSP, authorises the Board 
to do all acts and things which they consider necessary or desirable to 
implement the PSP, and authorises the adoption of further plans based 
on the PSP for the benefit of non-UK Group employees.

Company Information The proposed rules of the PSP are available for inspection at the 
Company’s registered office Concorde House, Warwick New Road, 
Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, CV32 5JG from the date of this letter  
to the conclusion of the annual general meeting and at the place of the 
meeting itself for at least 15 minutes prior to and during the meeting.
The principal features of the PSP are outlined below.
Administration
The operation of the PSP will be administered by the Board or any  
duly authorised committee thereof (i.e. in practice this will be the 
remuneration committee).
Eligibility
Awards under the PSP may be made at the discretion of the 
remuneration committee to any full-time or part-time employee  
of the Company, including Executive Directors.
Form of Award 
Awards under the PSP will normally be structured as an option  
to acquire Company shares with a zero or nominal exercise price  
(‘Nil Priced Options’).
The rules will also allow for Awards to be structured as:
a promise to the employee to receive free shares in the Company  • 
at a future date, subject to the achievement of performance 
conditions (‘Performance Shares’); or 
a cash alternative. • 
In these notes, ‘Award’ refers to any of these structures. Awards  
may be granted over newly issued shares, treasury shares or shares 
purchased in the open market.
Awards will not form part of pensionable earnings.
Timing of Award
It is intended that initial Awards would be made under the PSP 
following its approval at the 2010 Annual General Meeting, and  
on an annual basis to form part of the ongoing senior management 
remuneration package.
Awards in subsequent years may be granted during the period of  
42 days commencing when certain circumstances exist such as:
the announcement by the Company of its results; or • 
where there are exceptional circumstances (as identified by the • 
remuneration committee), which justify the grant of Awards.
Dividend and voting rights
Participants may be entitled to accrue dividend equivalents on the 
shares subject to Awards that vest. This is in line with ABI best practice 
guidelines.
Participants will not have voting rights on the Awards prior to vesting/
exercise.
Vesting of Awards
Awards will normally vest (and, in the case of Nil Priced Options, 
become exercisable) on the third anniversary of grant subject to:
continued employment; and • 
the satisfaction of any performance conditions set by the • 
remuneration committee at the time of grant (see ‘Performance 
conditions’ below).
Different provisions would apply where participants cease 
employment with the Company (or a group company as applicable)  
in special circumstances (see ‘Leaver provisions’ below), or following  
a change of control (see ‘Change of Control’ below).
For the avoidance of doubt, the employing company has the right to 
deduct/withhold any employment taxes due in respect of the Awards 
from payroll. If this is not practicable, the employing company has the 
right to sell vested shares if the relevant taxes are not paid by the 
participants.
Performance conditions
As outlined above, the vesting of an Award will be contingent upon the 
satisfaction of any performance conditions set by the remuneration 
committee when the Award is made. The details of the performance 
condition will be included as a schedule to the Award certificate.
Initially, the performance condition will be split equally between  
TSR and EPS targets. The remuneration committee will review the 
performance condition for subsequent Awards to ensure that they 
remain appropriate for the business.
The remuneration committee shall retain the discretion to adjust the 
calculation of any performance conditions to ensure it remains a true 
and fair reflection of performance. In particular, the performance 
conditions will provide that the remuneration committee may scale 
back Awards that would otherwise vest if it considers that the vesting 
outcome would not be consistent with the underlying financial 
performance and operational strength of the business. 
Vesting period
The normal vesting terms for Awards will be three years from the date 
of grant. However, in appropriate circumstances, the remuneration 
committee may define an alternative (longer or shorter) period.
Leaver provisions
The default treatment of leavers would be for any unvested Awards  
to lapse (or be forfeited) on cessation of employment. Vested Awards 
in the form of a Nil Priced Option will normally be exercisable for a 
limited period following cessation. Participants would be entitled to 
retain any shares which had already vested.

  However, there are certain ‘good leaver’ scenarios under which participants may remain entitled to a portion of their outstanding Awards, having 
regard to the time elapsed since the date of grant and the extent to which performance conditions have been achieved. Under normal 
circumstances, any outstanding unvested Awards to good leavers (other than on death) would vest on the normal vesting date (i.e. after the end 
of the performance period), however the remuneration committee will retain discretion to allow Awards to vest at the date of cessation (based 
on performance to this date).
The good leaver treatment is set out in the table below. In all leaver circumstances, the remuneration committee will retain the discretion to 
determine the treatment of the Award as it sees fit.
Event Treatment (subject to the remuneration committee’s overriding discretion)
Death The participant’s personal representatives will be entitled to retain Awards that have 
vested (or exercise an Award in the form of a Nil Priced Option for a specified period). 
Unvested Awards will vest as soon as practicable, (taking into account time elapsed 
and performance since the date of grant), and in the case of Nil Priced Options to be 
exercised within 12 months. 
Injury;
Illness;
Disability; 
Retirement;
Sale/transfer to a third party the part of the business 
for which the participant works; and/or
Any other ‘leaver’ circumstances in which the 
remuneration committee determines that Awards 
should vest (unless termination is for cause)
The participant will be entitled to retain shares that have vested.
Unvested Awards will vest at the discretion of the remuneration committee at the  
end of the performance period, taking into account the extent to which performance 
conditions have been met and the time elapsed, and other relevant factors including 
the conduct of the participant.
Vesting would occur at the time when it would otherwise have done so had  
cessation not occurred, unless the remuneration committee in its discretion 
determines otherwise.
In the case of Nil Priced Options, participants will have six months following vesting in 
which to exercise their options.
Any other reason which is not included in the ‘good 
leaver’ category specified in the row above (including 
resignation and termination for cause)
Participants will be entitled to retain shares that have vested.
Any unvested Awards will lapse.
Plan limits
The number of new shares issued to satisfy Awards, when aggregated with awards under all of the Company’s other employee share schemes, 
will not exceed 10 per cent of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital in any rolling ten year period. In addition the number of new shares 
issued to satisfy Awards, when aggregated with awards under all of the Company’s discretionary employee share schemes, will not exceed  
5 per cent of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital in any rolling ten year period. These limits do not include Awards that have lapsed  
and, unless stated otherwise in the Company’s remuneration report, treasury shares will be counted as newly issued shares.
Individual limits
For the 2010 grant cycle it is intended that Awards of 50 per cent of salary will be granted to Executive Directors. Award levels to participants 
below executive director level will be appropriately scaled to reflect their role.
Under the rules of the Plan, the maximum face value of PSP Awards granted to a participant in any financial year may not exceed 100 per cent  
of their salary at the date of grant, other than in exceptional circumstances (e.g. recruitment) as determined by the remuneration committee,  
in which case the maximum would be 150 per cent.
Change of control
Where possible, in the event of a change of control of the Company, participants would be offered the opportunity by the acquiring company  
to exchange their Awards over shares in the Company for equivalent awards over shares in the acquiring company (known as a ‘rollover’).
Alternatively, a participant’s unvested Awards may vest/ become exercisable at the discretion of the remuneration committee, taking into 
account the time elapsed and level of performance achieved in the period between the date of grant and the change of control.
Variation in share capital
The remuneration committee may adjust Awards and/or the exercise price payable (if any) as it deems appropriate following a variation in the 
share capital of the Company or a demerger.

Amendments to Plan rules
Minor amendments may be made at the remuneration committee’s 
discretion without shareholder approval to benefit the administration 
of the Plan, or which relate to any changes in legislation or which will 
maintain or obtain favourable tax, exchange control or regulatory 
treatment for any participating company or participant.
Shareholder approval will be required for subsequent amendments  
to certain provisions of the PSP that would advantage participants. 
These provisions relate to eligibility, individual and plan limits, rights 
attaching to Awards, adjustments of Awards on a variation of capital 
(as referred to above) and the amendment power. 
No amendment may be made which would adversely affect 
participants without the prior approval of at least 75 per cent (by value 
of Awards) of participants who vote on such amendment.
Life of the PSP
Once shareholder approval is obtained, Awards can be made under the 
PSP for a period of up to ten years, after which no further Awards will 
be made.
Resolution 15
This Resolution proposes the adoption of the Chairman’s Share Award 
Plan (the “SAP”) and authorises the Board to do all acts and things 
which they consider necessary or desirable to implement this plan.  
The proposed rules of this plan are available for inspection at the 
Company’s registered office Concorde House, Warwick New Road, 
Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, CV32 5JG from the date of this letter  
to the conclusion of the annual general meeting and at the place of the 
meeting itself for at least 15 minutes prior to and during the meeting. 
The principal features of the SAP are outlined below.
Form of award
The award under the SAP is structured as a conditional award over 
shares and matches the Chairman’s purchase of 50,000 ordinary shares 
in the Company. The award does not form part of pensionable 
earnings. No further similar awards can be made under the SAP. 
Vesting of awards
The award will normally vest on 19 October 2012 subject to:
continued appointment; and • 
the satisfaction of the share price and TSR performance conditions. • 
Different provisions apply if the Chairman ceases his appointment 
with the Company in special circumstances or following a change of 
control (see below).
Performance conditions
The share price condition is that the average closing share price over 
the period of 60 consecutive days ending on 19 October 2012 exceeds 
the share price in the table below (‘Share Price Condition’).

1 The final number of Award Shares is subject to scaling pursuant to the TSR Condition.
The number of Award Shares will be calculated on a straight line basis 
for other share prices (based on an additional 619 shares for every 1p 
rise in the share price above the relevant threshold). 
The TSR condition is that the Company’s performance measured 
against the TSR for the FTSE Small Cap Index over the three year period 
ending on 19 October 2012 will be as follows (‘TSR Condition’):
Top decile (91-100)   100 per cent
76-90   75 per cent
61-75   62.5 per cent
51-60   50 per cent
Median or lower   0 per cent
The remuneration committee shall retain the discretion to adjust the 
calculation of the performance conditions to ensure they remain a true 
and fair reflection of performance.
Vesting date
The normal vesting date will be on 19 October 2012. 
Leaver provisions
If the appointment ends at any time before 19 October 2012 by reason 
of death, ill health or disability, redundancy or such other permitted 
reason as the remuneration committee may determine, then the 
award may be retained and will vest based on the extent to which at 
the date of such cessation the Share Price Condition and TSR Condition 
have been satisfied. If the appointment ceases for any other reason or 
the Chairman disposes of his shareholding then the award shall lapse 
with immediate effect. 
Change of control
If any person obtains control of the Company then the award will vest 
to the extent that the Share Price Condition (measured against the 
offer price) and the TSR Condition have been satisfied at the date of 
the change of control.

Adjustment of Awards
If there is a variation in the share capital of the Company or in such 
other circumstances that the remuneration committee considers 
appropriate, then the number of shares in the award may be adjusted 
by that committee.
Amendment to the plan rules
The Company may change the terms of the award to get or keep 
favourable tax, exchange control or regulatory treatment for the 
Chairman or the Company and may make minor changes to ease the 
administration. However, subject to the above no change would be 
made which would adversely affect any of the Chairman’s rights 
except with his consent or which would be to his advantage without 
the prior approval of the Company’s shareholders.
Explanatory Notes for Annual General Meeting
The following notes explain your general rights as a shareholder and 
your right to attend and vote at the Annual General Meeting to be held 
on Wednesday 28 July 2010 or to appoint someone else to vote on your 
behalf.
1.  A member entitled to attend and vote at the above Meeting is 
entitled to appoint one or more proxies to attend, speak and vote 
on his/her behalf. Such proxy need not be a member of the 
Company. A shareholder may appoint more than one proxy in 
relation to the Annual General Meeting provided that each proxy is 
appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share or 
shares held by that shareholder. The return of a completed proxy 
form, other such instrument or any CREST Proxy Instruction (as 
described in paragraph 9 below) will not prevent a shareholder 
attending the Annual General Meeting and voting in person if he/
she wishes to do so. 
2.  To be valid, any proxy form or other instrument appointing a proxy 
must be received by post or (during normal business hours only) by 
hand at the Company’s registrars, Capita Registrars, PXS, 
34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent, BR3 4TU, no later than 
1.00pm on Monday 26 July 2010. 
3. Copies of all service contracts of Directors and copies of letters of 
appointment of the Non-executive Directors as well as a copy of 
the New Articles and a copy of the New Articles showing all 
changes to the Current Articles and the proposed rules for the 
Performance Share Plan and Chairman’s Share Award Plan will be 
available for inspection at the registered office of the Company  
and at the offices of Slaughter and May, One Bunhill Row, London, 
EC1Y 8YY during normal business hours from the date of this notice 
until the date of the Meeting and at the place of Meeting from 
12.30pm until the conclusion of the Meeting.
4.  To be entitled to attend and vote at the Annual General Meeting 
(and for the purpose of the determination by the Company of the 
votes they may cast), shareholders must be registered in the register 
of members at 6.00pm on Monday 26 July 2010 (or, in the event of 
any adjournment, on the date which is two days before the time of 
the adjourned meeting). Changes to entries on the register of 
members after 6.00pm on Monday 26 July 2010 shall be disregarded 
in determining the rights of any person to attend the meeting.

5. The total number of shares of the Company in issue as at 18 June 
2010 (being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of 
this Notice) is 48,137,234 carrying one vote each. Therefore, the 
total voting rights as at 18 June 2010 are 48,137,234.
6.  Any person who has sold or transferred his/her shares in the 
Company should pass this document and its enclosures to the 
person through whom the sale or the transfer was effected for 
transmission to the purchaser or the transferee. 
7.  Any person to whom this notice is sent who is a person nominated 
under Section 146 of the Companies Act 2006 to enjoy information 
rights (a ‘Nominated Person’) may, under an agreement between 
him/her and the shareholder by whom he/she was nominated, 
have a right to be appointed (or to have someone else appointed) 
as a proxy for the Annual General Meeting. If a Nominated Person 
has no such proxy appointment right or does not wish to exercise 
it, he/she may, under any such agreement, have a right to give 
instructions to the shareholder as to the exercise of voting rights. 
The statement of the rights of shareholders in relation to the 
appointment of proxies in paragraph 1 above does not apply to 
Nominated Persons. The rights described in these paragraphs can 
only be exercised by shareholders of the Company.
8.  CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through 
the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so by using 
the procedures described in the CREST Manual. CREST Personal 
Members or other CREST sponsored members, and those CREST 
members who have appointed a service provider(s), should refer to 
their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s), who will be able 
to take the appropriate action on their behalf.
9. In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the 
CREST service to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a “CREST 
Proxy Instruction”) must be properly authenticated in accordance 
with Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited’s specifications, and must 
contain the information required for such instruction, as described 
in the CREST Manual (available via www.euroclear.com/CREST). The 
message, regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment of a 
proxy or is an amendment to the instruction given to a previously 
appointed proxy must, in order to be valid, be transmitted so as to 
be received by the issuer’s agent (ID RA10) by 1.00pm on Monday 
26 July 2010. For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to 
be the time (as determined by the time stamp applied to the 
message by the CREST Application Host) from which the issuer’s 
agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the 
manner prescribed by CREST. After this time any change of 
instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should be 
communicated to the appointee through other means.
10. CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors, or 
voting service providers should note that Euroclear UK & Ireland 
Limited does not make available special procedures in CREST for 
any particular message. Normal system timings and limitations 
will, therefore, apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy 
Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned 
to take (or, if the CREST member is a CREST personal member, or 
sponsored member, or has appointed a voting service provider, to 
procure that his CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s))  such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is 
transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. 
In this connection, CREST members and, where applicable, their 
CREST sponsors or voting system providers are referred, in 
particular, to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning 
practical limitations of the CREST system and timings.
11. The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the 
circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertificated 
Securities Regulations 2001.
12. Any corporation which is a member can appoint one or more 
corporate representatives who may exercise on its behalf all of its 
powers as a member provided that they do not do so in relation to 
the same shares.
13. Under section 527 of the Companies Act 2006 members meeting 
the threshold requirements set out in that section have the right to 
require the company to publish on a website a statement setting 
out any matter relating to: (i) the audit of the Company’s accounts 
(including the auditor’s report and the conduct of the audit) that 
are to be laid before the Annual General Meeting; or (ii) any 
circumstance connected with an auditor of the Company ceasing 
to hold office since the previous meeting at which annual accounts 
and reports were laid in accordance with section 437 of the 
Companies Act 2006. The Company may not require the 
shareholders requesting any such website publication to pay its 
expenses in complying with sections 527 or 528 of the Companies 
Act 2006. Where the Company is required to place a statement on 
a website under section 527 of the Companies Act 2006, it must 
forward the statement to the Company’s auditor not later than the 
time when it makes the statement available on the website. The 
business which may be dealt with at the Annual General Meeting 
includes any statement that the Company has been required under 
section 527 of the Companies Act 2006 to publish on a website.

14. Any member attending the meeting has the right to ask questions. 
The company must cause to be answered any such question 
relating to the business being dealt with at the meeting but no 
such answer need be given if (a) to do so would interfere unduly 
with the preparation for the meeting or involve the disclosure of 
confidential information, (b) the answer has already been given on 
a website in the form of an answer to a question, or (c) it is 
undesirable in the interests of the Company or the good order of 
the meeting that the question be answered. If you are unable to 
attend the Annual General Meeting, but have a specific question 
you would like to ask at the meeting, you are invited to send the 
Chairman an email via the Company’s website at www.umeco.com 
or write to him at the registered office address.

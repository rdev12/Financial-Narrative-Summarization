Business Highlights Your Company is recovering from a very difﬁcult twenty four months. We have successfully moved
virtually all support operations to Mumbai in India, reorganised the sales units in Europe and
America and intend soon to be selling products in India.
Your executive team has signiﬁcantly improved cashﬂow with the result that we have reduced our
borrowings by £8.2 million.
Despite the fact that operating proﬁts have fallen, current trading is as expected.
Under the leadership of Ajit Patel the Company is moving towards a focused style of
entrepreneurial business units that is already bringing beneﬁts to shareholders. On your behalf 
I would like to thank directors, executives and all our staff for their hard and effective work over
the last year. 
Russell Race who has served you as an independent director since July 1998 is retiring from the
board at the AGM as his other business responsibilities have increased. We are actively recruiting
a new Independent Director to ﬁll this vacancy.
Full details of the Company’s activities are contained in the Chief Executive’s review and the
Finance Director’s report and I hope you will be pleased that your Board feel conﬁdent in
recommending a ﬁnal dividend of 2.5 pence which, with the 1 pence already paid, represents an
increase of 21% over the previous year.
Finally, you will be pleased to know that your company has donated surplus drugs, worth 
over £200,000, to the Bulgarian Red Cross and, for Jordan and surrounding territories, to the
Jordanian Red Crescent for immediate distribution to families in these countries.

Chairman

Chairman’s Overview 5
Overview
A year ago Goldshield embarked on a radical restructuring of its business. During many years of
rapid growth, group infrastructure played catch-up as we recruited and adapted to try to cope with
ever greater business demands. This ad hoc approach had to stop and we needed to rethink our
structure and systems.
Our Interims in December were also the occasion for the ﬁrst statement from our non-executive
Chairman, Peter Brown, another very important step in the development of Goldshield.
Another top priority during the year was the reduction in our debt. I am pleased to report that 
our total bank debt and deferred acquisition costs have been reduced to £5.6 million at 31 March
from £21.6 million a year ago. In order to achieve this we reduced marginal activities, drove
operational efﬁciencies and concentrated on better cash management. Financially, the group is
now in a much better position to build for the future. 
I am pleased to announce our results for the year ended March 2004. Overall sales are 
£87.1 million (2003: £104.9 million). They are a touch better than previously anticipated. 
Pre-exceptional earnings before interest, tax and amortisation (EBITA) were £13.8 million 
(2003: £19.9 million). The exceptional costs for the year were £1.2 million (2003: £1.0 million).
I am pleased to announce that the board is recommending a ﬁnal dividend of 2.5 pence (2003:
1.45 pence) bringing the total for the year to 3.5 pence (2003: 2.9 pence).
As part of our ongoing efforts to integrate businesses and provide them with focus, we have
reorganised them into smaller Strategic Units with a clearly deﬁned cost structure and grouped by
Channels of Distribution. The channels through which we distribute our products and services are:
Direct to Consumer, Retail, Hospital, Country Distributors and the yet to be established Out-
Licensing. We have also rescaled our operation in the USA giving us a better platform to build a
proﬁtable business in this lucrative market.
All units, whether they are product or service led, are now proﬁt centres. All support units are
working with a clear understanding of generating revenues over and above servicing internal
clients and contributing to the group bottom line.
The Group is introducing new performance pay systems based on parameters that are 
scientiﬁcally measurable in terms of quality and quantity deliverable. The focus is on lifetime
learning teams of entrepreneurs with the purpose of recruiting, retaining and enhancing the
customer base. This coupled with a new system of proﬁt accountability will have a signiﬁcant
impact on staff motivation.
Plans for developing a Goldshield Academy to enhance technical and management skills at all
levels have started. We are committed to recruit and develop people for both our immediate and
our future business competencies and as such this initiative is very high on our strategic agenda.
Our Indian operation, initially set up to handle outsourced processes from our operations in both
the US and Europe, has created a number of new opportunities. Our operations here have seen a
substantial expansion with over 500 staff located in Mumbai. We have been able to access high
quality staff at much lower cost than in the UK and US, taking advantage of the large numbers 
of well educated people, experienced in business and ﬂuent in English. We have recruited people
with many competencies other than call centres. These include medicine, commerce, IT and
inventory control. A signiﬁcant effort is being made to train these new staff, making sure they are
well versed in corporate goals, capable of operating with a focus on proﬁt and able to adapt to a
system that rewards well those staff able to achieve internal targets.
Our focus is to build a successful call centre business to serve Goldshield customers in Europe
and the USA and leverage this knowledge by assisting in the expansion of call centres owned 
by other companies. The total space available there will provide over 400 call centre, 250
managerial and over 160 training seats. In addition Goldshield is accessing the increasing
numbers of FDA and MHRA approved pharmaceutical plants in India. We will leverage these low
cost manufacturing capabilities by contract manufacturing our products for sale in India, Europe,
United States and other international markets which include the Middle East, South Africa 
and Australasia.
Chief Executive Officer’s Operating Review 6
Marketing and Sales Review
Direct to Consumer – Europe
Sales declined to £18.0 million (£22.1million 2003). Much of the decline is attributed to a
maturing of the market and a shortage of new customers. However we have made good progress
in the last six months in this important channel of distribution. Sales here have stabilised and the
decline halted. 
A new telemarketing Centre was established in India in May 2003. Since this time we have
enhanced our customer relationship approach, resulting in increased customer values and loyalty.
We have now undertaken a strategic review of the business and as a result have become more
customer orientated. We have also established a more focused customer recruitment group to
enhance our database.
The Internet business continues to grow and now represents over 10% of all orders processed.
More initiatives are being developed to maximise the returns from the Internet. The French
business continues to grow and during this period doubled its income through mailing and
advertising activity. At the end of this year we moved our French Call Centre to France in order to
move closer to our customers and optimise service levels.
During the year, gross margins have increased through improved purchasing on key lines, selective
introduction of price increases and the introduction of premium high margin products.
Retail Generic – Europe
The UK generics market has became increasing competitive. We are still primarily UK led in 
this distribution channel, however our European options are being evaluated. Despite tough
competition, our generic business grew 11% over the previous year with sales of £8.8 million
(2003: £7.9 million).
Inventory management issues and lower selling prices limited growth. Better focus on the 
product mix, coverage and customer loyalty plan helped increase sales. New product launches,
improvement in customer service levels and better management of cost will drive this business in
the future.
Hospital – Europe 
The hospital business in Europe has achieved sales of £12.7 million (2003: £11.1 million), an
increase of 14% over the previous year. 
The core of this business remains the Antigen injectables product range in the UK and Ireland
accounting for some 80% of its turnover. This element of our business was up 8% on the previous
year with growth mainly due to extension of some existing NHS contracts and award of some 
new ones.
Remodulin, prescribed for pulmonary arterial hypertension on a ‘named patient’ basis (due to not
having completed registration in the UK), was subject to pricing negotiations with the NHS,
resulting in a doubling of patients treated.
Following the recent granting of European marketing rights to Goldshield by Indigo Orb Inc. USA
of their spring loaded Autodetect Syringe for Epidural Procedures, a pilot study is planned in the
UK prior to an autumn launch. This is the ﬁrst step in developing a total hospital service provision
extending beyond just injectable pharmaceutical products. 
The European business has seen the biggest growth with sales up 91% to £0.9 million. The
supply problems with controlled drugs, particularly Pethidine, has impacted similarly on this
business with delays of orders which would have pushed the sales up further. Whilst many of
these issues have now been resolved, we are focused on putting safeguards in place to prevent a
reoccurrence in the future. 
The Goldshield oncology business was up 9% to £1.6 million. This growth was due to
Methotrexate contract awards for both injectable and solid dose presentations. As reported in the
Interim Statement, this year also saw the ﬁrst award for an in-house developed oncology product
Chief Executive Ofﬁcer’s Review
(continued) 7
complementing the products acquired from Wyeth. Within the coming year we will launch two
further in house developed oncology products into the UK market, with introductions into other
markets outside the UK planned.
Direct to Consumer – North America
During the period, we have reorganised our business in North America into two business units,
Goldshield Elite which focuses on multilevel marketing and Goldshield Direct which carries out
mailing and telemarketing activities. As reported earlier, we undertook considerable consolidation
here and our total operations here have been trimmed down signiﬁcantly. We had earlier in the
year sold our  products containing Ephedra, which together with rationalisation of other peripheral
activities had a marked impact on our sales which closed at £10.9 million. (2003: £26.8
million). The sales are now stable in the last 3 months and we have started the recovery process.
We are determined to build our presence here.
Since inception in June 2003, Goldshield Elite’s membership crossover from Changes
International, Golden Pride International/W.T . Rawleigh and Achievers Unlimited was slower than
anticipated. However, it increased during the ﬁrst quarter of 2004 due to various enrolment
campaigns offered to current members. Elite is in the process of consolidating all companies into
one. We expect to complete this by the end of June 2004.
Elite has adopted a new Corporate Customer Creation campaign to enrol new members. An
outbound sales campaign originating from India and a mini-web page email campaign originating
from the US will form the basis of this recruitment drive which aims to enrol 500,000 new
Members by 2010. Both campaigns were released on 1 June 2004.
Goldshield Direct, which was formed after merging PR Nutrition and Advanced Nutritional
Products, has started on recruiting new customers through outbound telemarketing campaigns
from India. This business is about a third of the size of Goldshield Elite.
Retail Brands – Europe
Sales in Retail Brands Europe reached £32.6 million this year, almost level with the previous 
year at £32.9 million. Sales in the UK increased from £22.2 million to £22.4 million, whilst in
Europe, sales declined from £10.7 million to £10.2 million.The majority of this decline is due 
to a combination of delays in technical transfers and out-of-stock situations.
In the UK, the Dispensing Doctor sales operation grew by 15% over the previous year. In January,
the Representatives started promoting Flexeze, a Glucosamine/Chondroitin product to General
Practitioners. The changes in the NHS resulted in more work focusing on Nurses, now an
important source of inﬂuence, who prescribe several Goldshield products. The Own Label business
has shown an increase in sales of 62% from £1.6 million to £2.6 million. In Ireland, traditional
Goldshield products have shown a 9% growth. 
In Europe, we have obtained a registration for Flexeze Capsules in Hungary and sales are expected
shortly. In Poland, we have submitted a registration for Flexeze Gel and in Kosovo, 8 registrations
were submitted for a variety of pharmaceutical products. As a result of Malta joining the EU, we
have had to register our products and we submitted 26 registrations. During the year, we have
identiﬁed many opportunities in the retail sector throughout Europe, which we will capitalise on.
Over the last year, the major change in the business has been the move away from a purely
prescription product business to one which markets a wider range of the Group’s products actively
through the retail channel and secondly to focus the unit on being a European wide business
ready for the expansion of the EU.
Country Distributors – Rest of World
This part of our portfolio saw a 3% decline in sales at £3.8million (2003: £3.9 million). Whilst
the Smith Kline Beecham (SKB) acquired products, which still account for more than 50% of this
Channel’s sales, grew by 11% it did not compensate for the downward sales trend in the Antigen
and Regina product sales. 8
South Africa was a source of excellent growth of over 63% over last year with Ecotrin (enteric
coated aspirin) remaining the leading product in its class for preventative use post-myocardial
infarction, coupled with the launch into the GP sector of various Flexeze (glucosamine)
formulations. Sales in Pakistan were up 34% fuelled by local sales growth across the SKB product
range. Australia/New Zealand saw a 15% growth attributable to the Goldshield product range 
and the last quarter saw preparations being ﬁnalized for the re-launch of Ecotrin in the New Year.
Thailand, which last year saw sales restricted due to product availability, recovered as soon as
supplies recommenced.
Regina business, which is mostly dependent on Duty Free Sales in the Far East, was down 18%
despite increased sales resulting from product inclusion with Thai Airways. The sales continued to
be hit by lower passenger air trafﬁc post the SARS epidemic and compounded during the year by
world-wide shortages in supply of raw material. 
Services – Global
This is a very new area of business for us. During the last 18 months of consolidation,
management restructure and the move of some of our back ofﬁce functions to India, we have
developed many competencies in the service sector. Most of these are simply an extension of what
is required for better functioning of our internal operations. Since all our service functions have
been broken down into smaller proﬁt centre units, it makes sense to offer these services externally
from our low cost base in India. In addition to incremental revenues, it will bring in better learning
and provide benchmarking against standards of others.
Whilst this is not our core business, we expect revenues to increase in the coming months.
Product Development
As part of the overall reorganisation, we have taken a fresh look at how Product Development
functions within the group. In order to fully maximise the potential of our acquired and own
developed products, we have created two product groups. Both of these are focused on their core
competencies which centre around the ability to get product registered and approved for sale. 
The unlicensed product group focuses on products that require minimum registrations and are 
a lot quicker to market, whilst the licensed product group manages the traditional prescription
product portfolio.
Both these groups will not only aim to maximize sales through all the internal Business Units but
also form relationships with external customers and promote out-licensing and sales of Goldshield
products under ‘own label’ supply. These groups are responsible for researching and developing
new products, increasing existing product leverage and developing marketing plans for all new and
selected existing products to be implemented by the internal Business Units. 
Within the unlicensed product group, we already have several exciting products in the pipeline,
focusing less on ‘me too’ and more on innovative and unique formulations, several of which will
be selected to undergo clinical evaluation in the coming months.
The focus for the Group with respect to Product Development for Licensed products over the 
last 12 months has been to consolidate the large number of product acquisitions made prior 
to March 2002. Effort has largely been concerned with transferring production into new
manufacturing sites to ensure long term continuity of supplies. This has involved the co-ordination
of Technical and Regulatory activity for these transfers especially on the signiﬁcant number of
injectable licenses acquired through the purchase of Antigen Pharmaceuticals. Despite the focus
on product transfers, the licensed product group has over the last 12 months, submitted product
license applications for 12 new molecules each representing a number of different presentations.
A number of new product licences have also been granted within European and some
International markets. The number of approvals achieved was less than our target, mainly as a
result of internal problems within the authorities.
Chief Executive Ofﬁcer’s Review
(continued) 9
Current Trading and Future Prospects
This year we will conclude the restructuring of the Group. We can then return to organic growth
and acquisitions. We now have a high-quality, highly-motivated team whose remuneration is
closely linked to their performance. Each business unit is tightly focused on its products and
markets. Our goal still remains that of better cash management. We expect to be debt free during
the current year. There is a great temptation to focus on immediate and short term results.
Nevertheless it is right to continue with the process of change started last year. I am conﬁdent
that with a better balance sheet, a more organised and efﬁcient infrastructure and a better quality
and motivated team, sales growth will resume during 2005/06 ﬁnancial year.
There is nothing new to report on either the SFO investigation or the DoH litigation. An update 
on the changes in the legal matters arising from our Irish acquisitions is set out in note 26 to the
ﬁnancial statements. We expect to continue defending our position until a proper and satisfactory
resolution has been achieved.

Turnover
Turnover for the year was lower at £87.1 million (2003: £104.9 miilion).
Sales in the UK & Western Europe were marginally lower at £70.3 million (2003: £72.5 million)
primarily due to lower sales of healthcare products.
Sales in the US were £10.9 million (2003: £26.8 million). The reduction was due to closure of
the Portland Call Centre and our ceasing to sell Ephedra products.
Sales in the Rest of the World registered an increase of 6% at £5.9 million (2003: £5.5 million)
which was primarily due to income from our India Ofﬁce which commenced call centre services
from the current year.
Gross proﬁt
The Group’s gross proﬁt for the year was £52.2 million (2003: £74.0 million). The gross margin
achieved was 60.1% (2003: 70.6%). This reduction was a result of a change in product mix.
Operating results
The Group operating proﬁt was £3.9 million (2003: £4.3 million) representing 4.4% of Turnover
(2003: 4.1%) The operating margin remains suppressed due to the impact of:-
• Exceptional legal and professional fees in connection with the SFO, Department of Health
claim and issues arising out of the Irish operations – see note 26 to the Financial Statements.
• Additional costs in setting up the India Ofﬁce with costs in the UK and USA running parallel
for part of the year
• Higher overhead costs in running the Goldshield Vitality TV Channel, which has since been
discontinued, effective 1 January 2004
Research and Development expenditure
Research and Development expenditure incurred and written off direct to the proﬁt and loss
account was £0.6 million (2003: £1.0 million). As at 31 March 2004 the Group does not have
any capitalised development expenditure (2003: nil).
Taxation
The taxation charge of £3.9 million (2003: £5.0 million) represents an effective tax rate of
118.1% (2003: 141.8%). The tax rate is high as a result of tax losses in the United States,
where deferred tax assets are not currently being recognised and other items which do not qualify
for tax relief. Deferred tax credit included in the tax charge was £2.6 million (2003: deferred tax
charge of £0.7 million)
Report of the Finance Director 11
Earnings and dividend
Basic earnings per share is (1.6) pence (2003: (3.9) pence). There are no diluted earnings per
share.
The Directors propose a ﬁnal dividend of 2.5 pence per share representing a total dividend for the
year of 3.5 pence (2003: 2.9 pence). The ﬁnal dividend will be subject to approval at the Annual
General Meeting, to be held on 28 July 2004, and is expected to be paid on 15 October 2004 
to Ordinary Shareholders on the register at the close of business on 24 September 2004.
Cash ﬂow and liquidity
At the year-end the Group had cash balances of £0.2 million (2003: £2.4 million).
As at 31 March 2004 the Group had bank loans outstanding of £5.5 million (2003: £13.7
million). The entire loan outstanding is due within one year.
During the year the Group also settled liabilities in respect of deferred consideration payments due
on acquisitions of £7.2 million.
As at 31 March 2004 the Group had liabilities in respect of deferred consideration payments due
on acquisitions of £0.1 million (2003: £7.9 million)
The Directors are conﬁdent that all current and future liabilities can be met from the Group’s
operating cash ﬂow when they fall due.
Transition to International Financial Reporting Standards
We have identiﬁed the areas of our ﬁnancial statements that will be most affected by the
transition to IFRS. The main issues identiﬁed are the non amortisation on goodwill arising on
business combinations, share based payment, the treatment of deferred tax assets and ﬁnancial
instruments.
We are currently identifying data capture issues and are taking steps to ensure that all IFRS
information is identiﬁed in our ﬁnancial reporting system. In the coming year we will calculate the
transition balance sheet, produce interim ﬁgures under IFRS and do an IFRS dry run with the
March 2005 comparative ﬁgures.

Report of the Directors 15
Employees
At 31 March 2004 the Group employed 737 personnel of whom 151 are based in the UK, 
55 in North America, 10 in Ireland and 521 in India. The Group is an equal opportunities
employer and does not discriminate between employees on the grounds of race, ethnic origin, 
sex, age or disability.
The success of the Group is dependent upon the quality and performance of its employees and
the Group continues to ensure this through continual training and development, facilitated by
Investors in People. Applications for employment by disabled persons are given full and fair
consideration for all vacancies in accordance with their particular aptitudes and abilities. In the
event of employees becoming disabled every effort is made to retrain them in order that their
employment with the Group may continue.
The Board acknowledges that its staff are its most important asset. It places a strong emphasis 
on the training and development of its employees through ‘on the job’ training and through staff
attending courses. This is a continuous process of training and all staff regularly attend courses 
on communications, planning, decision making and problem solving. In addition managers attend
courses and ‘on the job’ training on staff development, motivation, recruitment, appraisals and
team building. The Group also encourages staff to take vocational courses.
The Group encourages all of its employees to participate in its growth and welcomes staff input 
at all levels.
Information about the Group’s activities is regularly communicated through notices and
staff meetings.
Employee share save scheme
An employee share scheme is open to all eligible employees. Under the terms of the scheme the
Directors may offer options to purchase ordinary shares in the Company to employees who enter
into an Inland Revenue approved share save contract. The price of each share option was at a
discount of 20% from the market price at the date of granting the options. Options may normally
be exercised during the period of six months after the completion of the share save contract.
Share options
During the year the Directors granted share options to employees. Details of these are set out 
in note 18 to the financial statements.
Details of the Directors’ Share Options are shown in the Remuneration Report on page 25.
Charitable and political donations
Donations to charitable organisations amounted to £78,460 (2003: £3,327). In addition 
the group donated over £200,000 worth of drugs to the Bulgarian Red Cross and Jordanian 
Red Crescent.
Donations to political organisations amounted to £nil (2003: £nil). 16
Substantial shareholders
As at 25 May 2004 the Company has been advised of the following holdings, in addition to those

Barclays Global Investors 1,271,703 3.4
Payment policy and practice
It is the Group’s policy to settle the terms of payment with suppliers when agreeing the terms of
the transaction to ensure that suppliers are aware of these terms. In general the trading terms
entered into are payment at the end of the month following the month of invoice. Trade creditors
due at the year end amount to 49 days purchases (2003: 61 days).
Research and Development
Details of research and development expenditure are shown in the Report of the Finance Director
on page 10 under Research and Development expenditure.
Auditors
Grant Thornton offer themselves for reappointment as auditors in accordance with Section 385 
of the Companies Act 1985. On 1 July 2004 the Grant Thornton partnership will transfer its
business to a limited liability partnership Grant Thornton UK LLP. Under Section 26 (5)
Companies Act 1989 the directors intend to consent to extend the audit appointment to Grant
Thornton UK LLP from 1 July 2004.
Annual General Meeting
It is proposed that the next AGM be held on 28 July 2004, at 10.00 am, notice of which is 
set out on pages 49 to 51. In addition to the proposed resolutions to receive the Reports and
Accounts, declare a dividend, re-appoint Directors in accordance with the Company’s Articles of
Association, to appoint Grant Thornton UK LLP as Auditors and to authorise the Directors to ﬁx
the Auditors’ remuneration; and to approve the Remuneration Report, it is proposed that the
following business be transacted:
Directors’ authority to allot securities (Resolution 10 – Ordinary Resolution)
The Directors seek to renew this authority each year at the AGM. The effect of resolution 9 is to
grant to the Directors authority to allot new securities limited to a maximum amount of £617,000
representing approximately one third of the Company’s issued share capital as at 31 March 2004
(being the date of the Company’s last Annual Accounts). This renewed authority would remain in
force for 15 months from the passing the resolution or, if earlier, the next AGM.
Disapplication of pre-emption rights (Resolution 11 – Special Resolution)
The Directors seek to renew this authority each year at the AGM. Under the Companies Act 1985,
shareholders have “rights of pre-emption” in relation to the issue of equity securities. This means
that if new shares in the Company are to be offered for subscription for cash they must ﬁrst be
offered to the existing shareholders in proportion to their holdings at the time of such offer. The
Companies Act requires that the Directors seek the approval of the shareholders if they wish to
disapply these rights. The Directors are seeking authority to disapply pre-emption rights over
Report of the Directors
(continued) 17
1,850,887 equity securities, representing approximately 5% of the issued share capital of the
Company as at 31 March 2004. This renewed authority would remain in force for 15 months
from the passing the resolution or, if earlier, the next AGM.
Company’s authority to purchase its own shares (Resolution 12 – Special Resolution)
The Directors are seeking to renew the authority for the Company to purchase in the open market
up to 10% of the issued share capital of the Company. The Company undertakes that it will, if 
the resolution is passed, only exercise such authority to buy back its own shares if such purchase
would have the effect of increasing the earnings per share and if they believed that to do so would
be in the best interests of the shareholders generally. If the resolution is passed the Company will
be authorised to buy in one transaction or any number of transactions an aggregate maximum of
3,701,774 shares, representing approximately 10% of the issued share capital of the Company
as at 10 June 2004 (being the latest practicable date prior to publication of the Notice of AGM).
The maximum price the Company will be permitted to pay will be equal to 5% above the average
middle market quotations for the ﬁve business days preceding the transaction and the minimum
price will be 5 pence (being the nominal value of the shares).
The total number of options to subscribe for ordinary shares outstanding as at 10 June 2004 
was 1,977,621, representing approximately 5.3% of the issued share capital of the Company at
such date. If the authority to purchase shares were to be exercised in full, the total number of
options to subscribe for ordinary shares outstanding as at 10 June 2004 would represent 4.86%
of the issued share capital (assuming no other further ordinary shares were issued after that date).
BY ORDER OF THE BOARD

Corporate Governance
Application of principles
The Group is committed to applying the best principles of Corporate Governance. The Group has
applied the principle of Good Governance contained in the Combined Code to the extent they are
consistent with its size. The Compliance Statement is given under the Combined Code (1998).
Compliance Statement
The Group complied throughout the year except in three cases. The membership of the audit
committee did not comprise three non-executive directors throughout the year (provision D.3.1)
and that the non-executives comprised less than one third of the Board (provision A.3.1). Both
were remedied by the appointment of Peter Brown in August 2003. In addition, the transfer of
many business functions to India has prevented the audit committee from conducting its annual
review of internal controls on behalf of the Board this year (provision D.2.1).
The Board has conducted a corporate governance review to identify the extent of its compliance
with the Revised Code and is moving towards compliance with the Code in all material respects
having regard to its size and the exceptions permitted under the Codes in respect of smaller listed
companies. The Board has yet to introduce a process for evaluating the performance of the Board,
Committees and Independent directors. It is intending to work towards introducing an appropriate
evaluation process.
Board composition
The Board comprises the non-executive chairman (whom the Board considers to be independent),
the chief executive, four executive directors and two other non-executive directors (whom the
Board also consider to be independent).
All directors submit themselves for re-election at least every three years and at the ﬁrst AGM after
appointment. Non-executive directors retire by rotation in accordance with the Company’s Articles
of Association and one third of the Directors retire each year. Ken Pelton is the senior non-
executive director and having joined the Board in 1992 submits himself for reelection at the next
Annual General Meeting.
The Board met seven times during the year under review and has a schedule of matters reserved
to it for decision. At each meeting the Board receives reports from the chief executive, the ﬁnance
director, other directors and senior management as required.
The Board has three committees as follows:-
Audit committee
Russell Race (chairman)
Peter Brown
Ken Pelton
The committee’s terms of reference are to review the ﬁnancial statements and to monitor
accounting and ﬁnancial procedures and policies, including statutory and regulatory compliance. 
Audit committee meetings are also attended by representatives of the Group’s auditors and the
ﬁnance director. The committee considers the Group’s annual and interim ﬁnancial statements 
and any questions raised by the auditors on the statements and ﬁnancial systems.The Audit
Committee also meets with the Group’s auditors in the absence of management.
The Group’s auditors, Grant Thornton, provide some non-audit services. The Board does not
regard these to be signiﬁcant or to threaten their independence. The level of non-audit fees is
reviewed on an annual basis.
The Audit committee met three times in the year under review. 19
Remuneration committee
Ken Pelton  (chairman)
Peter Brown
Russell Race
The Remuneration committee meets at least two times in each ﬁnancial year  and determines 
the Directors’ remuneration. None of the committee has any personal ﬁnancial interest in the
matters to be decided (other than as shareholders), nor potential conﬂicts of interest arising from
cross-directorships nor any day to day involvement in the running of the business. The Committee
consults with the Board about its proposals and has access to professional advice from inside 
and outside the Group.
Nomination committee
Peter Brown
Ajit Patel
Russell Race
Ken Pelton
The Nomination Committee meets as required to select and recommend suitable candidates to the
Board for both executive and non-executive appointments. Following a recruitment and selection
process, the Committee decided to nominate Peter Brown as Chairman due to his considerable
experience as a Company Director.
Shareholder relations
The chairman, the chief executive and the ﬁnance director hold meetings with institutional
shareholders to discuss the Group’s strategy and ﬁnancial performance.
All shareholders can gain access to information about the Group, including the annual report,
through the Goldshield website www.goldshieldplc.com.
Risk management and internal controls
The directors acknowledge their responsibility for the group’s system of internal controls. The
intent is to manage risk rather than eliminate it and controls cannot provide an absolute assurance
against material misstatement or loss.
The key features of the Group’s systems of internal controls are as follows:-
control environment – short and direct lines of responsibility are designed to ensure that business
risks are communicated for prompt review. The performance of each business and support unit is
reviewed at regular monthly meetings. The full Board also reviews business risk and control issues
at regular board meetings held at least six times each year. A period of at least ﬁve days each year
is set aside for strategic planning and assessment of risks affecting the group; attended by senior
managers from all parts of the group.
• operating procedures – key ﬁnancial controls are documented as operating procedures setting
out responsibilities and ﬁnancial authority levels.
• budgeting – a comprehensive budgeting procedure is followed by both business and support
units resulting in an annual budget approved by the full board and with provision for reforecasts.
• acquisitions – purchases of companies and products are approved by the full Board and are
required to meet business ﬁt and ﬁnancial return criteria.
• information systems – the group’s accounting systems are backed up and scaleable to meet
business needs.
A regular review takes place with the company’s insurance brokers to assess the adequacy of the
Group’s insurance cover in the face of operational and other risks of the business.  20
Additional steps taken to audit and control ﬁnancial and other risks within the year under 
review include :-
• appointment of a team of internal auditors to carry out a review of ﬁnancial controls and other
systems in the Mumbai ofﬁce; and
• appointment of an internal auditor to review compliance with medical regulatory requirements
under wholesale dealer and other licences.
The Board fully recognises the importance of adopting appropriate risk control measures and has
intentions to further enhance such controls in relation in particular to sensible business continuity
measures to enable the business to survive risks which it is likely to face in the current climate,
with particular emphasis on ensuring that IT and other key systems are robust and appropriate to
the needs of the business.
Going concern
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason they
continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the ﬁnancial statements. An explanation of
the Group’s cash ﬂow position at 31 March 2004 is set out in the Report of the Finance Director.
Corporate Governance
(continued) 21
Corporate Social Responsibility
Goldshield is committed to being a socially responsible corporate citizen.
Environment
Common sense measures to save energy and ﬁnite resources are taken where practicable; in
particular relating to controlled use of energy, paper and other resources. The Board does not
consider it appropriate to implement a detailed environmental policy for its activities given that 
it does not itself manufacture products. The Board does however share current concerns on
environmental issues and will where possible ensure that its activities are carried out in an
environment friendly manner.
Health and safety
The Board aims to take due and proper care of risks to the health, safety and welfare of its
employees; taking account of the differences that apply to legislative requirements in the different
countries where it operates. Particular attention is paid to ﬁre drills and other safety procedures 
in establishments operated by the Group, in the current climate of international terrorist activity.
Ethics
The Group has policies on for example, business practices, receipt of gifts, use of the internet and
whistleblowing. The Group realises that its reputation depends on adopting ethical and socially
responsible procedures and will encourage adoption of employment, health and safety and other
appropriate procedures to meet this objective.
Employment
The Group employs over 730 employees worldwide based in the United Kingdom, India, Ireland
and the USA. Our success depends on the skills and attitude of our employees. Our human
resource strategies are aimed at ensuring that employees are trained to be competent to fulﬁl their
roles and with an opportunity to develop to their full potential. Emphasis is placed on sharing
knowledge for the beneﬁt of employees and the Group.
The Group operates in an international market and we believe it is important for all employees 
to be treated with dignity and respect. Decisions relating to recruitment, development, promotion
and training of individual employees are based on an objective assessment of skills and attitudes
and job requirements. To this end a system of 360 degree appraisals has been introduced to
supplement the one to one appraisal procedures already in place.
Community involvement
Employees are encouraged to make contributions to charities and other community causes and
collections are regularly made for charitable purposes. Goldshield has made donations of surplus
drugs to the Bulgarian Red Cross and Jordanian Red Crescent for distribution to those in need in
Bulgaria and Jordan and surrounding territories. 22
Remuneration Report
Directors’ remuneration
The Group recognises that Directors’ remuneration is of legitimate concern to the shareholders 
and is committed to following current best practice. 
Section 1: Information not subject to audit
The Remuneration Committee
In accordance with Section 241A of the Companies Act 1985, the Board presents the
Remuneration Report for Shareholder approval. Directors’ remuneration is determined by the
Remuneration Committee.
None of the Committee has any personal ﬁnancial interest in the matters to be decided (other
than as shareholders), potential conﬂicts of interest arising from cross-directorships, nor any day
to day involvement in the running of the business. The Committee consults the Chief Executive
Ofﬁcer about the Board’s proposals and has access to professional advice from inside and outside
the Group. The Committee carries out its policy on behalf of the Group Board. It meets at least
twice per annum.
Policy on Executive Directors’ remuneration
Executive Directors’ remuneration packages are designed to attract, motivate and retain Directors
of the calibre necessary to maintain the Group’s successful growth and to reward them for
enhancing shareholder returns. The Committee measures the performance of the Executive
Directors, paying particular attention to earnings per share growth. The Committee takes into
account remuneration levels in other companies, although comparisons are treated with caution 
to avoid an upward ratchet in remuneration levels.
There are three elements of the remuneration package:
• Basic annual salary and pension contributions
• Share option incentives
• Bonus
Each Executive Director’s basic salary is reviewed annually by the Committee. The Committee has
regard to salary levels in other emerging pharmaceutical companies as well as performance and
other internal factors. Salaries were last reviewed in March 2004 and it was decided, in the light
of the improved outlook, but recognising the continuing need to control costs tightly, to award
increases averaging 4.8%. Furthermore, some remuneration which has been waived during the
past year by some of the Directors, including the Chief Executive, Ajit Patel, has been restored for
the coming year.
Share options are seen as an effective tool for aligning Directors’ rewards with shareholder 
returns and maintaining a stable senior management team. As disclosed in the 2003 Report and
Accounts and following discussions with shareholders staff holding options with exercise prices
over £5 were offered the opportunity to exchange these for half the number of options with an
exercise set at 25% premium to the current market price. In the event holders of 481,358 options
exchanged their options with an exercise price of £1.96. Directors were ineligble. The Committee
believes that this has had a beneﬁcial impact on staff morale, motivation and retention. All
Directors’ options granted post ﬂotation are subject to performance criteria. These criteria measure
earnings per share and turnover growth against both absolute and relative targets and do not
beneﬁt from retesting if the targets are missed.
It is planned to introduce a bonus scheme covering all executive Directors, management and staff
during the current year. Awards under the bonus scheme will be based upon individual and group
performance and include an element of deferred payment. With increasing staff numbers overseas,
many of whom do not readily identify with options over shares in a UK listed company, the bonus
scheme is seen as an important component of overall remuneration policy. 23
The remuneration of Non-Executive Directors is decided by the full Board, the Non-Executive
Directors abstaining. Peter Brown, who joined as non executive chairman during the year, is being
remunerated partly in shares and Ken Pelton intends to take a proportion of the fees receivable by
the K O Pelton Partnership in shares.
The following table gives details of the contract of service for each person who has served as a
Director of the Company during the year.

Performance Graph
The above graph shows Goldshield’s Total Shareholders’ Return (TSR) performance compared to
the TSR of the FTSE Small Cap Index. TSR is deﬁned as the percentage change over the period,
assuming re-investment of income and funding of liabilities. 
The Company is a member of the FTSE Small Cap Index and as such is considered to be the 
most appropriate comparator group. TSR has been calculated on a one month’s averaging basis in
order to reduce volatility associated with spot prices.

No share options have been granted to the Non-Executive Directors.
The options granted under the unapproved share scheme were allotted as part of the remuneration 
package for nil consideration.

the year ended 31 March 2004 was 137.5 pence to 245 pence. 26
Equity incentives for Directors and employees
The Company has three share option schemes:
• The ‘existing scheme’
Share options granted to employees prior to the ﬂotation of the company.
• The ‘unapproved scheme’
The ‘unapproved scheme’ was introduced at the time of listing in 1998. Under this scheme
options have been granted to executive Directors and other employees.
•Employee share save scheme

Remuneration Report
(continued) 27
United Kingdom company law requires the Directors to prepare ﬁnancial statements for each
ﬁnancial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company
and of the proﬁt or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing those ﬁnancial statements, the
Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent
• state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material
departures disclosed and explained in the ﬁnancial statements
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records, for safeguarding the assets 
of the Group and for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other
irregularities. They are responsible for ensuring that the Annual Report includes information
required by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority.
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities 28
We have audited the financial statements of Goldshield Group plc for the year ended 31 March
2004 which comprise the principal accounting policies, the consolidated profit and loss account,
the balance sheets, the consolidated cash flow statement, the consolidated statement of total
recognised gains and losses and notes 1 to 28. These financial statements have been prepared
under the accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited the information in the
Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235
of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the
company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for
no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility
to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for
this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report, the Remuneration Report and the
ﬁnancial statements in accordance with United Kingdom law and accounting standards are set out
in the statement of directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the ﬁnancial statements and the part of the Remuneration Report 
to be audited in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and United Kingdom
auditing standards.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view and
whether the ﬁnancial statements and the part of the Remuneration Report to be audited have
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you if, in
our opinion, the Directors’ report is not consistent with the ﬁnancial statements, if the company
has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and
explanations we require for our audit, or if information speciﬁed by law regarding Directors’
remuneration and transactions with the group is not disclosed.
We review whether the corporate governance statement reﬂects the company’s compliance with
the seven provisions of the Combined Code speciﬁed for our review by the Listing Rules of the
Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required to consider whether
the Board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read other information contained in the annual report, and consider whether it is consistent
with the audited ﬁnancial statements. This other information comprises only Business Highlights,
Chairman’s Overview, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer’s Operating Review, Report of the Finance Director,
Five Year Review, Report of the Directors, Corporate Governance and the unaudited part of 
the Remuneration Report. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any
apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the ﬁnancial statements. Our
responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with United Kingdom auditing standards issued by the
Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant 
to the amounts and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements and the part of the Remuneration
Report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the signiﬁcant estimates and judgements
made by the Directors in the preparation of the ﬁnancial statements, and of whether the
accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances, consistently applied and
adequately disclosed.
Report of the Independent Auditors to the
Members of Goldshield Group plc 29
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which
we considered necessary in order to provide us with sufﬁcient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the ﬁnancial statements and the part of the Remuneration Report to be audited 
are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. 
In forming our opinion, we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information
in the ﬁnancial statements and the part of the Remuneration Report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and 
the Group at 31 March 2004 and of the results of the Group for the year then ended; and
• the ﬁnancial statements and the part of the Remuneration Report to be audited have been
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

Note: 
The maintenance and integrity of the Goldshield website is the responsibility of the directors: the work carried out by the
auditors does not involve consideration of these matters and, accordingly, the auditors accept no responsibility for any changes
that may have occurred to the ﬁnancial statements since they were initially presented on the website.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of the ﬁnancial statements may differ from
legislation in other jurisdictions. 30

Notes to the Financial Statements
1 PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards and under
the historic cost convention. The Directors have reviewed the principal accounting policies and consider they remain the most
appropriate for the Group. The principal accounting policies of the Group have remained unchanged from the previous year and
are set out below.
Basis of consolidation
The Group ﬁnancial statements consolidate those of the Company and of its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 31 March
2004. Proﬁts or losses on intra-group transactions are eliminated in full. The results of the subsidiary undertakings acquired
during the year have been included from the date of acquisition. On acquisition of a subsidiary, all of the subsidiary’s assets
and liabilities which exist at the date of acquisition are recorded at the fair values reflecting their condition at that date.
Goodwill arising on consolidation, representing the excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair values of the
identifiable net assets acquired, is capitalised net of any provision for impairment and is amortised on a straight line basis over
its estimated useful economic life.
Investments
Investments in subsidiary undertakings in the balance sheet of the Company are included at the cost of the shares held less
amounts written off.
Turnover
Turnover is the total amount receivable by the Group for goods supplied and services provided, excluding value added tax 
and trade discounts. Turnover is recognised on the delivery of goods and services to customers.
Intangible ﬁxed assets
Brand names, know-how, licences, trademarks and similar intangible items are capitalised at historical cost net of any 
provision for impairment and amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful economic lives, which range 
between seven and ten years.
Depreciation
Depreciation is calculated to write down the cost, less estimated residual value, of all tangible ﬁxed assets other than freehold
land over their expected useful economic lives.
The rates generally applicable are:
Freehold buildings 4% p.a. straight line
Office equipment 20% p.a. straight line
Plant and equipment 15% p.a. straight line
Motor vehicles 20% p.a. straight line
Depreciation commences in the month of purchase and is calculated on a pro rata basis in the year of acquisition.
Stocks
Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised on all timing differences where the transactions or events that give the Group an obligation to pay
more tax in the future, or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets are
recognised when it is more likely than not that they will be recovered. Deferred tax is measured using rates of tax that have
been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Pensions
The Group operates a deﬁned contribution pension scheme whereby contributions are made to individual employee pension
plans of certain employees. These costs are charged against proﬁts in respect of the accounting period in which they are paid.
Leased assets
Payments made under operating leases are charged to the proﬁt and loss account on a straight line basis over the period 
of the lease. 36
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and
liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. The financial statements
of foreign subsidiaries are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. The exchange differences arising
from the re-translation of the opening net investment in subsidiaries are taken directly to reserves. Where exchange differences
result from the translation of foreign currency borrowings raised to acquire foreign assets (including equity investments) they are
taken to reserves and offset against the differences arising from the translation of those assets. All other exchange differences
are dealt with through the profit and loss account. This accounting policy is as prescribed by Statement of Standard Accounting
Practice 20.
Research and development expenditure
All research and development expenditure is written off to the proﬁt and loss account in the period in which it is incurred. 
Financial instruments
Financial assets are recognised in the balance sheet at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Provision is made for
diminution in value where appropriate.
Interest receivable is accrued and credited to the profit and loss account in the period to which it relates.
Share options
The estimated cost of share options granted (being the difference between exercise price and market value at the date of grant)
are accrued over the period to which the benefit relates.

9 EARNINGS PER SHARE
The calculation of the basic earnings per share is based on the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders divided 
by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year.
The calculation of diluted earnings per share is based on the basic earnings per share, adjusted to allow for the issue of 
shares and the post tax effect of dividends, on the assumed conversion of all dilutive options. There is no diluted earnings 
per share as share options would not have a dilutive effect on the loss for the year.
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below.

The Board has reviewed the value of all of the intangible assets and is of the view that there is no need to provide for
impairment losses against the intangible assets.
In considering the value of goodwill attached to the US business, a future growth rate of 15% has been assumed, which
exceeds the average growth rate for that territory. The Board considers this appropriate in view of their future plans for the
recently restructured business.
The Board has considered the useful economic life for significant acquisitions and concluded in each case that the useful
economic life ranges between 8 and 10 years.

26 CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
Indemnities and guarantees
At 31 March 2004, the Company had undertaken to provide support to certain subsidiary undertakings.
There is a contingent liability in respect of bank borrowings of all companies within the Group which are secured by 
an inter company cross guarantee. The aggregate Group liability at 31 March 2004 amounted to £5,500,000 
(2003: £13,680,000).
The Group has given indemnities in respect of advance payments, deferred purchase consideration and import duty 
guarantees issued on its behalf in the normal course of business. The indemnities given at 31 March 2004 were 
£331,540 (2003: £535,156).
Irish Operations
On 28 November 2001 the Group acquired the sales, marketing and distribution rights for the Antigen brand from Antigen
Holdings Limited. The companies and assets were acquired at an estimated cost of £9.4 million. The estimated consideration
was to be settled in two parts, firstly by the payment of £5.2 million and secondly by an obligation to discharge the wider
scheme of arrangement covering all Antigen companies (including those not acquired by the Group). The directors obtained
legal opinion that the Group’s exposure to the debts covered by the scheme was restricted to the debts borne by the
companies it acquired.
On 29 October 2002, Miza Ireland Limited and each of its Irish subsidiaries, parties to the wider scheme of arrangement,
were placed into examinership. During the current year the liquidator of Miza Ireland Limited claimed the sum of C =20.8
million although no grounds for the claim have been specified in detail. Liability for the claim has been denied. The Directors
have received legal opinion that no basis for claim has been presented by the liquidator which could result in a liability on the
part of the company and that the subsidiaries concerned have grounds for defending the claim.
Serious Fraud Ofﬁce (SFO) Investigation
On 10 April 2002 the Group’s premises and those of the Chief Executive were visited by the SFO and certain documentation
taken away. A press statement issued by the SFO stated that its operations formed part of an investigation into suspected
conspiracy to defraud the National Health Service (NHS) concerning the prices charged for penicillin based antibiotics and
Warfarin between 1 January 1996 and 31 December 2000.
The Directors do not believe the Group has acted in an unlawful or improper manner, nor has it at any time conspired to
defraud the NHS and no provision has been made accordingly. Until any formal charges are made against the Group, its
maximum potential exposure under relevant legislation for the alleged offences cannot be quantified. Legal and professional
costs in this matter are expensed as incurred.
Department of Health (DoH) claim
On 20 December 2002, the DoH issued a legal claim against the Group and three other companies (Norton Healthcare
Limited, Norton Pharmaceuticals Limited and Regent – GM Laboratories Limited) amounting to £28.6 million for alleged 
anti-competitive practices involving the fixing of selling prices and controlling the market and production of Warfarin between
January 1997 and September 2000.
The Directors believe the Group is free from wrong-doing in respect of these allegations. A defence has been filed and no
provision has been made for amounts potentially due under this claim. The expected legal and professional costs for this
action have been accrued.
Notes to the Financial Statements

US operations
Changes Inc, which was acquired by Goldshield from Twinlabs Inc, has been named in a legal action brought by the estate of 
a deceased customer of Twinlabs Inc for a sum of around $ 8 milllion. The action relates to a period prior to the acquisition 
of Changes. Goldshield only acquired the assets of Changes Inc. The Directors have received US legal advice to the effect that
the prospects of success against Changes are remote. 
There were no other material contingent liabilities at 31 March 2004 or 31 March 2003.
27 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Group uses financial instruments, comprising cash, short term borrowings, trade debtors and trade creditors, which arise
directly from its operations. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Group’s operations.
Short term debtors and creditors
Short term debtors and creditors have been excluded from the following disclosures except those relating to currency risk.
Interest rate risk
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and bank facilities. Bank borrowings are made using
variable interest rates.
Liquidity risk
The Group seeks to manage financial risk, to ensure sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable needs and to invest
cash assets safely and profitably.
Short-term flexibility is achieved through overdraft facilities and short/medium term borrowings.
Maturity of ﬁnancial liabilities
The Group financial liabilities analysis at 31 March 2004 was as follows:
Group Company
2004 2003 2004 2003
£000 £000 £000 £000

In more than two years but less than five years
Bank and other borrowings – 7,500 – 7,500
5,610 21,578 5,500 12,100
Borrowing facilities
The Group has undrawn facilities available of £250,000 expiring within one year (2003: £500,000).
Currency risk
The Group is exposed to translation and transaction foreign exchange risk. In relation to translation risk the proportion of
assets held in the foreign currency are matched to an appropriate level of borrowings in the same currency. Transaction
exposures are hedged when known, mainly using the forward exchange hedge market.
The Group seeks to hedge its exposure using a variety of financial instruments, with the objective of minimising the impact of
fluctuations in exchange rates on future transactions and cash flows.
The Group has overseas subsidiaries operating in Ireland where reserves and expenses are denominated in Euros. The Group
has funded the acquisition cost and working capital by a Euro loan. As the Group receives net cash inflows in Euros this loan
is being reduced and replaced, as necessary, by funding denominated in Sterling.
£16.9 million (2003: £16.6 million) of the sales of the Group’s business is to customers in continental Europe/foreign
markets excluding North American operations. The majority of these sales are invoiced in the currencies of the customers
involved. The Group policy is to minimise all currency exposures on any balance not expected to mature within 30 days of its
arising through the use of forward currency contracts. All other sales of UK business are denominated in sterling. 48

 CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Another year of progress for T yman with further market share  
gains in North America and strong performance by ERA.
2014 has been another year of progress for Tyman with a good overall 
result delivered against a backdrop of improving market conditions in 
North America and the UK; however markets continued to be weak and 
less predictable in Continental Europe. We gained further share in North 
America during the year, predominately in Canada, and our UK business 
grew well ahead of the market.
For 2014 we have reported a 17.7 per cent increase in revenue to  
£350.9 million and a 42.4 per cent increase in underlying operating 
profit to £46.1 million. Despite the adverse impact of currency 
movements in the year and acquisitions, revenue increased by 7.4 per 
cent and underlying operating profit by 25.1 per cent on a constant 
currency like for like basis. We demonstrated good dropthrough in 2014 
with underlying operating margins increasing by 220 bps to 13.1 per 
cent (2013: 10.9 per cent). Underlying earnings per share increased by 
35.7 per cent to 18.61 pence.
The Group as a whole has delivered a further material improvement in 
its return on capital employed (“ROCE”) of 240 bps to 11.4 per cent as 
we continue to make progress towards our medium term target of a 
ROCE of 15 per cent.
Leverage at the year end of 1.56x was 0.25x lower than 12 months ago 
and towards the lower end of our core target range of 1.50x to 2.00x from 
the half year peak of 2.21x. This was despite the investments made in the 
balance sheet during the year and the acquisition of Vedasil for cash. 
The integration of Amesbury and Truth has now completed and we  
are moving forward with the next phase of the transformation of 
AmesburyTruth into a world class manufacturing business through 
rationalisation of the North American footprint. This will generate at 
least US$10.0 million of incremental profit for AmesburyTruth by 2020.
We have also announced the rebranding of Grouphomesafe  
as ERA, leveraging off the market presence and heritage of the UK’s 
longest standing lock brand. In 2014, ERA had another year of strong 
performance, growing well ahead of the market, and saw its net 
operating margin expand from 12.2 per cent to 14.9 per cent.
Schlegel International again had a challenging year, reflecting continued 
difficult markets in Europe; however Vedasil has performed strongly in its 
first 10 months of ownership and provides the Group with a platform  
for growth in South America. We have made further progress with the 
restructuring of the Division and the closure of the European Industrial 
Products business removes a significant management distraction.
Dividend
The Board is recommending a final dividend for 2014 of 6.00 pence per 
share (2013: 4.50 pence per share) which, together with the interim 
dividend of 2.00 pence per share, gives a 33.3 per cent increase in the 
total dividend for the year to 8.00 pence per share (2013: 6.00 pence 
per share). 
Board and corporate governance
We have continued to evolve and refine the Board’s approach to 
corporate governance. In 2014 we conducted our first independent 
appraisal of the Board and its committees and have derived valuable 
insights from the exercise into potential areas for the development of 
the Board. 
We have continued our established practice of the Board holding a 
scheduled meeting in each of the Divisions with meetings held in 2014 
in Statesville, North Carolina where we visited two AmesburyTruth 
facilities and Harrogate, Yorkshire where we visited the Ventrolla head 
office and the local Schlegel Building Products facility. 
In addition, the Board attended the Group Management Conference 
hosted by Schlegel International in Barcelona, participated in a number 
of workshops and product demonstrations as well as visiting the 
Schlegel International plant in Terrassa. These visits allow Board 
members the opportunity to meet with various levels of local 
management and employees as well as to see first hand Group 
products being manufactured. 05

Since the year end we have announced the appointments of Mark 
Rollins and Kirsten English to the Board as Non-executive Directors; 
joining the Audit, Remuneration and Nominations Committees of  
the Board. Mark brings to the Board his recent and relevant background 
as CEO of a listed company with international manufacturing 
operations and Kirsten brings significant international and private 
equity experience as well as her involvement in the investor community.  
We look forward to their respective contributions to the Board and  
to the Group.
Les Tench, who has served on the Board as a Non-executive Director 
and Chairman of the Group’s Remuneration Committee since 
December 2009, has indicated to the Board his wish to retire and will 
stand down as a Director following the Annual General Meeting. 
Following Les’ retirement, Mark Rollins will become Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee.
Les has made a significant and valued contribution to the Board over 
the past five years and, on behalf of the Board and the shareholders, I 
would like to thank him for his input and wish him well in his retirement.
New Employee Share Plans
The Board believes that it is important to encourage all employees to 
participate in the future growth and development of the Group and to 
take an active interest in the performance of the Company as a whole.  
In particular we want to allow employees to have the opportunity over 
time to build an equity holding in Tyman. With this in mind, we are 
seeking shareholder approval for two broadly-based contributory share 
plans – a UK Sharesave Plan and a separate plan on similar principles 
for US employees. It is intended that each of these will offer the 
potential for favourable tax treatment in accordance with applicable 
local legislation. We are also seeking authority to extend plans into 
other jurisdictions, on a similar basis, with appropriate variations.
Shareholders will be asked to approve these proposals at the 
forthcoming AGM on 15 May 2015 and further details are contained  
in the Notice of Meeting.
Health and safety
Providing a safe environment in which our employees can work is a  
key priority for Tyman and I am pleased to report that we have made 
further progress in developing the Group’s safety culture. While the 
increase in the number of lost time injuries year on year was 
disappointing, the severity of incidents was significantly reduced 
compared with 2013 and the majority of incidents can be categorised 
as slips, trips or manual handling injuries; all of which should be capable 
of being eliminated.
2014 has seen a focus across each of the Divisions in developing their 
near miss reporting as we try to prevent those incidents that are 
preventable from occurring. In total 3,829 near miss incidents were 
reported and dealt with, ranging in scope from shortfalls in general 
housekeeping to potentially dangerous practices or processes that could 
lead to physical harm. The level of engagement from all employees in the 
development of our near miss reporting has been very encouraging and 
in time should translate into a material reduction in our lost time injuries.
In conclusion, I would like to thank all of our employees and 
management for their hard work and efforts on behalf of shareholders 
in 2014 and look forward to Tyman making further progress in 2015.

Our markets are cyclical in nature and influenced by macroeconomic 
factors such as GDP, employment rates, population growth, rates of 
new build and RMI and consumer confidence.
Population and household formation
Population is expected to grow in most regions of the world and this 
in turn should drive increased housing formation.
New housing
Recovery in new housing starts in the US and the UK has led to 
increased demand for our products in these markets; however build 
rates remain below historic long run averages implying that there 
remains scope for further recovery.
RMI
In the UK, over 75 per cent of the housing stock was built before 
1980 and the median age of houses in the US is 40 years.  
Accordingly there is significant latent demand for RMI in the large 
installed base of existing homes.
Consumer confidence
Consumer confidence is key to our markets.  When homeowners feel 
confident that the value of their property is likely to appreciate they 
will be more inclined to invest in their home.  Our customers reported 
consistent quote levels through the downturn; giving us confidence 
that as markets recovered so too would demand.  Repairs are less 
discretionary and so incorporate an element of counter cyclicality.

Where we source or manufacture
In order to provide our customers with the service they need, the 
manufacturing decision is key. Is the customer best served by Tyman 
manufacturing the product ourselves or can the product be provided 
more efficiently and effectively through Tyman sourcing the 
components the customer needs?
We choose to manufacture certain products, such as complex balances, 
extrusions and seals, close to our customer base where flexibility, variety 
or complexity are key to the component manufacturing process and to 
the customer. 
For products that are less complex, have a high labour content or  
more predictable demand levels, we may choose to source from lower 
cost and sometimes more remote locations, often using third party 
manufacturers to make or assemble components on our behalf. 
Examples of sourced products would include handles and  
standard locks.
As part of the manufacturing decision we aim to ensure that we have 
flexibility in how we make or source the product such that we have  
built in redundancy. This may be geographic in the case of our own 
manufacturing plants, or may involve certifying and approving more 
than one potential supplier of a sourced product. This flexibility allows 
us to respond quickly to changes in product demand levels and to  
move manufacture around depending on capacity levels.
Our footprint review projects across all our Divisions, most notably in 
North America, will allow us to improve our manufacturing processes 
still further and give us even greater flexibility. 
Substantially all of the components we supply to our customers – 
whether manufactured by us in our own plants or sourced externally 
– are engineering led, value added products made to our designs, 
protected where possible and practical by patents and Intellectual 
Property, and manufactured on our own proprietary tooling.
Where we sell
We aim to optimise the manufacturing decision such that we can 
leverage our scale and geographic footprint in order to supply our 
customer base, whether it is our largest North American customers or 
our smaller local customers, with innovative solutions that are aligned 
with our quality and service standards.
In what remains a very fragmented industry in most markets, we 
believe Tyman is unique in being able to offer the complete range of 
door and window components to customers and to have a truly 
international offering.
Who we sell to
Our customers include OEMs, fabricators, distributors, retailers, builders’ 
merchants, architects, house builders and ultimately the homeowner.
What we sell
We aim to offer our customers a complete range of components 
ranging from hardware such as handles, locks, keeps and hinges to  
seals and extrusions. For each of our end customers, wherever they  
are located, we aim to provide a differentiated product offering that  
will in turn allow them to add value to their customer proposition. 
We believe we are the only manufacturer of scale that can offer our 
customer base the full range of door and window components. 09

Financial discipline
Underpinning our business model is a focus on financial disciplines that 
encompasses margin targets for each of our products, close scrutiny of 
the cost base, optimisation of working capital, and a rigorous approach 
to return on capital and its allocation, both internally in the form of 
capital investment and externally in the form of M&A.
Quality and service
The manufacturing decision for Tyman comes back to our desire to 
differentiate our product offering from that of our competitors by 
providing customers with the highest quality product at the relevant 
price point, delivered to specification on time and in full. 
This focus on quality and service leads to deeper customer relations, 
puts us front of mind as new designs are contemplated by OEMs and 
allows us to demonstrate our industry leadership credentials.
New product development programmes across all of our Divisions are 
focused on anticipating future trends within the industry and delivering 
customised engineered solutions to our customers. Throughout the 
downturn we remained committed as a Group to the development of 
our product offering and retained our key teams of designers and 
engineers at a time when many of our competitors were cutting back  
in this area.
Service is at the heart of what Tyman aims to offer its customers. For our 
largest customers we deploy our own engineers on their factory floors, 
allowing us early notice of product or service issues, however small, and 
giving us an early insight into future new product development. 
For our distribution customers we take care of critical elements of their 
supply chain, including inventory management, packaging and 
shipment to distribution hubs. 
For key manufacturing customers we have developed our processes 
such that we can deliver their component inventory on a just in time 
basis and sequenced in the order that they intend to consume the 
product and at the other end of the scale, the jobbing builder or local 
locksmith who uses a Tyman product will choose our brands over our 
competitors because they know they can rely on them.

 CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW
2014 has seen another year of good operational and financial 
progress for T yman with continued top line growth and margin 
expansion in our two largest Divisions – AmesburyTruth and ERA. 
The integration of Amesbury and Truth has now completed and we  
are moving forward with the next phase of the transformation of 
AmesburyTruth into a world class manufacturing business through 
rationalisation of the North American footprint.
Schlegel International has again seen difficult end markets in 
Continental Europe; however we continue to regard Europe as a 
significant medium term opportunity for the Group and have made 
further progress with the restructuring of the Division.
The integration of Vedasil into our South American business has 
progressed well and the business has performed strongly in the first  
10 months of ownership. 
2015 has started with order book levels ahead of 2014 and in line with 
our expectations across each of the Divisions. We continue to improve 
our manufacturing efficiency and cost base and expect to see further 
growth in our key end markets of the UK and North America, enhanced 
by a number of new products that will come to market this year in each 
of the Divisions.
2015 Priorities
Our key priorities for 2015 are a continuation of the themes we 
developed in 2014 and include:
1. Optimisation of our footprint in each of the Divisions with a 
particular focus on AmesburyTruth where we will start the five year 
project to rationalise our North American footprint. 
 Our aim is to ensure that each Division’s footprint is appropriate for 
the medium term needs of the business, taking into account 
opportunities for near shoring of those products best made or 
sourced close to the point of consumption.
2. Continuing to encourage strong communication, consistency of 
approach and standards of excellence across each of the Divisions. 
For our end customer, wherever they are located, this should mean 
the availability of a differentiated product offering at an 
appropriate price, delivered to specification, on time and in full. 
For 2014 we set ourselves six key priorities to deliver our overall 
strategy.  Here’s how we did:
2014 Priority Progress
Integration of 
Amesbury and 
Truth
Completion of integration and  
launch of AmesburyTruth.
Footprint 
evaluation
Good progress across each of the 
Divisions with evaluation of footprint 
requirements and announced the North 
American Footprint rationalisation.
Consistency and 
communication 
across Divisions
Formalised processes for sharing best 
practice in terms of supply chain, NPD, 
key account management and 
operations and developed cross selling 
opportunities for Group products 
worldwide.
Financial  
objectives
Continued margin improvement 
demonstrated by the Group along with 
growth in the Group’s ROCE.  
Investment in the balance sheet led to 
lower than normal cash conversion. 
Investment in the 
business
Launched a number of new products 
into our markets in the year, 
strengthened the operating teams in 
each of the Divisions, provided greater 
focus to supply chain and continued our 
planned investment in capital projects 
with gross capital expenditure running 
at 1.43x depreciation.
Acquisition 
programme
Acquisition of Vedasil successfully 
completed in the year and a number of 
potential acquisition candidates 
engaged with across a variety of 
markets.
  11
Tyman plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2014
3. Key financial objectives for each of our Divisions remain centred on 
sustained margin improvement and cash generation along with 
continued growth in the Group’s average return on capital. We 
expect developed markets will offer pricing opportunities in 2015  
as markets and volumes recover.
4. Continued investment in and improvement of the businesses; in 
particular in the areas of new product development, people, supply 
chain – where we intend to consolidate our Divisional sourcing 
arrangements in the Far East – and capital projects with a focus on 
automation and lean manufacturing to ensure we differentiate 
ourselves from our competitors and continue to take market share.
5. Supplementing our organic and self-help initiatives through our 
active acquisition programme, prioritising European markets where 
we currently have a niche seals and limited hardware range, and 
emerging markets where market position can best be obtained 
through acquisition.
Outlook
The current year has started in line with our expectations across each of 
the Divisions. At the end of February, order book levels in each of the 
Divisions are running ahead of 2014. Currency movements will again 
have a significant impact on reported numbers in 2015, however the 
strengthening of the US Dollar relative to international currencies, if 
sustained, should mean that reported profitability is enhanced relative 
to 2014. 
We expect further improvement in our North American markets  
in 2015 with continued growth in new build in the United States, 
supported by the sustained gradual acceleration in repair and 
remodelling expenditure. We expect the Canadian market will contract 
further in 2015 as housing starts continue to moderate; however we still 
intend to take additional market share, in line with our strategic goal.
The UK market is expected to show further growth in 2015, albeit 
probably at a slower rate than we saw in 2013 and 2014. In 2015, we 
have a number of new product introductions for ERA coming to market 
and we continue to explore opportunities in distribution where we 
remain relatively underweight. 
For Schlegel International, following the closure of the European 
Industrial Products business and the conclusion of our incremental 
investment programme, 2015 should see an improved performance. 
Material profit improvement, however, remains dependent on 
significantly increased European volumes which, given the 
macroeconomic environment, we do not expect to come through  
in 2015. 
Across Europe as a whole we expect to see broadly flat markets in  
2015 with some isolated pockets of growth. We expect continued 
improvement in Australasia and South East Asian markets and, while 
the overall Brazilian macroeconomic backdrop is subdued, construction 
markets are expected to show further growth in 2015. We are well 
positioned in the Brazilian market and are developing distribution into 
adjacent geographies.

2014 with residential private housing starts up 5.3 per cent in the year 
to 1,089,000 and completions (our most relevant in year new build 
indicator) up 19.6 per cent to 927,000. Single family housing starts 
increased by approximately 7.9 per cent across the year and 
completions by 17.4 per cent. Repair and remodelling continued to 
grow, with the NAHB Remodelling Market Index for Q4 2014 some  
4.8 per cent higher than at Q4 2013 and we estimate that the 
commercial market grew by approximately 12.0 per cent in the year.
Overall we believe the market for our products in the United States 
improved by c. 9.0 – 10.0 per cent in 2014. 
The Canadian market continued to weaken in 2014, despite the 
stronger levels of permits and starts seen in the first half of the year. 
Across the year as a whole, housing starts increased only marginally 
and completions contracted by 2.2 per cent; with single family 
completions contracting by some 5.3 per cent. Overall, we believe  
that the Canadian market for our products decreased by approximately 
3.5 per cent across the year as a whole. 
Combining the United States and Canadian statistics would indicate 
the addressable North American market grew by around 6.5 – 7.0 per 
cent over the year.
Performance
AmesburyTruth’s reported revenue increased by 32.6 per cent to 
US$363.7 million (2013: US$274.2 million) and by 9.6 per cent on a like 
for like basis. We saw consistent gains across the majority of product 
lines and strong performance from our hardware and foam sealing 
products in particular. Our more structured approach to pricing in North 
America saw us exit from some lower margin pile sealing business and 
meant that overall AmesburyTruth conceded a small amount of 
uneconomic share in the United States while gaining significant  
share in Canada. 
Underlying operating profit increased by 57.0 per cent to  
US$54.7 million (2013: US$34.8 million) and underlying operating 
margins improved from 12.7 per cent to 15.0 per cent due to 
operational gearing, automation benefits, some incremental  
pricing, scrap reduction and synergy delivery. 
Our Tier 1 customers saw good growth in 2015 with the larger higher 
end window manufacturers starting to regain traction in the market 
place and our Tier 2 and 3 customers saw significant growth during  
the year as they started to derive benefits from our segmented 
coverage model.
We have also seen some further consolidation among the overall 
customer base during the year, which should allow AmesburyTruth 
further opportunities to sell its differentiated product offering. 
We made good progress in developing our three strategic priorities with 
door hardware revenue increasing in the year by some 13.2 per cent, 
Canadian revenue increasing by some 13.0 per cent and commercial 
revenue increasing by some 23.6 per cent. In each case growth was 
achieved through a mix of deeper penetration of existing accounts and 
new customer wins. 17

Business developments
2014 saw the completion of the integration of Amesbury and Truth  
into a single entity structured on a functional basis. We announced the 
formal rebranding of the businesses as “AmesburyTruth”, at a leading 
industry trade show in September and the new brand has been well 
received by customers and employees. A leadership team, comprising 
individuals from both Amesbury and Truth and complemented by 
external hires, has been formed and the corporate office has been 
relocated to Minneapolis, closer to the Division’s principal facilities  
and customer base.
Integration initiatives have continued at all levels of the business, the 
most notable of which was the restructuring of the respective sales 
organisations into a single sales and marketing function. 
During 2014 the integration generated approximately US$5.5 million  
of cost and revenue synergies and we expect at least US$8.0 million  
of synergies will be generated in 2015 – an increase of 60 per cent over 
the original synergy target announced at the time of the acquisition.
We made good progress in the development of the consolidated 
AmesburyTruth ERP system with a second implementation completed 
at the Fremont, Nebraska plant and preparations made for an 
additional three sites to join the ERP system during the course of 2015.
During the year we closed the Covington, Georgia facility and moved 
production to our Cannon Falls, Minnesota facility, reflecting the focus 
of our extrusion business on high value added engineered component 
manufacture. Since the year end we have announced the exit from the 
Ontario, California facility with core extrusion manufacturing also 
transferring to Cannon Falls, coupler manufacturing transferring to the 
Fremont facility and the disposal of approximately US$7.0 million of 
non-fenestration extrusion business.
Automation of inefficient manual processes remains a key focus for the 
Group and a further five automation projects were delivered in 2014 
with a total investment of approximately US$2.5 million. The most 
significant automation project completed was the US$1.0 million 
investment made at our Owatonna, Minnesota facility in a new acrylic 
E-Gard Plus process which significantly enhances the quality and 
durability of our painted finish compared with our competitors, 
improves efficiency by allowing us to paint components in line and 
eliminates environmentally unfriendly barrel plating processes.
New product development initiatives continued in 2014 with a focus on 
the development of the next generation of products across certain key 
segments of our portfolio including foam door and window seals, 
window balances and casement operators.
100 YEARS OF TRUTH
Truth Hardware, now celebrating 100 years of production and 
serving an international market, grew from humble beginnings in 
rural Minnesota. In 1914, Truth Tool, as it was then called, began 
as a small blacksmith shop in Ellendale, Minnesota (about 20 miles 
south of Owatonna) by Arthur Cowden. Truth soon moved 
operations to Mankato, Minnesota where, as times changed, the 
hand tools that they were making were being requested by 
mechanics servicing the emerging automotive market. 
By the mid-1950’s Truth began engineering and manufacturing 
products for the window industry and operations were moved,  
in 1959, to Owatonna, Minnesota where the business has been 
ever since. 
Fast forward to July 2013, Truth Hardware was purchased by 
Tyman plc and became part of an international supplier of 
components to the door and window industry with design, 
manufacturing and distribution facilities strategically located 
around the world. As AmesburyTruth, the business offers best  
in class engineering resources with the broadest portfolio of 
innovative solutions that drive our customer’s success. 
Many things have happened since 1914 to today but one that has 
not changed is AmesburyTruth’s commitment to customer service 
and quality. This belief is embodied by the word’s first spoken by 
Truth’s founder, Arthur Cowden, in 1927 and echoed by the 
business today: 
“In the very beginning, in shaping our policy we decided to stake 
our all, our future, on TRUTH, and its principles. To be true to 
ourselves, our employees, and above all true to our customers – 
and TRUTH has carried us from a small blacksmith shop to our 
present spacious and strictly modern factory, which is equipped 
with the latest and most up-to-date machinery, operated by people 
who are happy and take pride in their work, people who believe in 
TRUTH and strive to have that belief reflected in the ‘products’ 
which they produce.”
Truth celebrated its 100th birthday with a party and open  
house for current and former employees and their families on  
20 September 2014.

 OPERATIONAL REVIEW CONTINUED
North American footprint review
At the time of the acquisition of Truth, the North American footprint 
comprised 14 manufacturing sites and two off site warehouses in 12 
locations. The two off site warehouses in Owatonna, Minnesota were 
closed shortly after acquisition and the Covington, Georgia site was 
closed in May 2014. Since the 2014 year end, the disposal of the 
Ontario, California site has also been announced.
The Group believes that there are significant potential benefits to be 
gained from rationalising the number of sites we operate within North 
America, while still ensuring that AmesburyTruth retains sufficient 
flexibility to service its customer base and take share in a market that 
remains some way below its long run average. 
Accordingly AmesburyTruth has launched a manufacturing footprint 
review and evaluation with the goal of ensuring that by 2020 our North 
American production and distribution footprint is refined and is 
appropriate for the needs of the business in the future. 
This project will bring significant opportunities to drive efficiencies  
and better manage revenue growth for AmesburyTruth as we combine 
operations and add new capabilities to the portfolio. The benefits of the 
rationalisation are expected to include more efficient manufacturing 
processes, shorter development times for bringing new products to 
market, a reduction in internal freight costs, a more efficient 
deployment of personnel and a reduction in divisional overheads.  
Each of these benefits will improve the AmesburyTruth business  
and will translate into a tangible improvement in our customers’  
overall experience.

The footprint rationalisation will centre around creating four 
manufacturing centres of excellence supported by a number of satellite 
manufacturing and distribution facilities. The creation of the Group’s 
manufacturing centres of excellence is expected to be phased over five 
years as individual sites are appropriately configured and we take 
advantage of lease breaks on surplus facilities. The project will be 
executed in two overlapping phases, the first beginning now and  
ending in early 2017 and the second phase beginning in 2017 and 
ending by 2020.
The cash costs for implementing the footprint rationalisation are 
expected to range from US$25.0 million to US$33.0 million. This  
comprises between US$15.0 million and US$23.0 million of net 
incremental capital investment in facilities and equipment and 
approximately US$10.0 million of incremental restructuring costs. The 
restructuring costs, together with certain non-cash costs incurred, are 
expected to be accounted for as exceptional items in the income 
statement over the rationalisation period. 
We expect that the annualised cost benefits of the successful 
implementation of the footprint restructuring will be not less than 
US$10.0 million per annum, with incremental benefits from the 
restructuring starting to flow from 2017 and full benefits from 2020. 
The table below presents the estimated total costs (both cash and non 
cash) associated with the footprint rationalisation, the net capital 
expenditure required to execute the plan and the savings expected to 
be realised. We will provide further updates as to progress over the 
coming months.

North American outlook
We expect the recovery in the United States new build market will 
continue into 2015, supported by the continued growth in repair and 
remodelling. The Canadian market is expected to contract further in 
2015; however we still intend to take additional market share, in line 
with our strategic goal.
2015 initiatives include the additional ERP implementations across a 
number of sites, further targeted automation projects to improve our 
manufacturing capabilities, investment in training and development 
with the creation of the first AmesburyTruth training academy, which  
we expect will help improve shop floor retention rates, further 
enhancements to our customer segmentation model and the start  
of the five year project to rationalise our North American footprint.  19
Tyman plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2014
Market
The UK market saw continued progress during 2014 with significant 
growth in the first half against soft comparative data, moderating 
somewhat over the summer and then a strong finish to the year. 
New build activity in 2014 increased by approximately 10.0 per cent 
and we estimate that RMI, which comprises substantially all of the UK 
market, increased by approximately 6.0 per cent. Overall, we believe 
that the market for our products grew by approximately 6.0 per cent in 
the year.
Rebranding as ERA
On 10 March 2015, we announced the rebranding of Grouphomesafe 
as ERA, leveraging off the market presence and heritage of the UK’s 
longest standing lock brand. ERA will be supported by the strong family 
of product brands that the Division goes to market within the UK, 
including the ERA lock brand, Balance UK, EWS, Fab & Fix, Schlegel and 
Ventrolla and 2015 will see further development of the ERA brand.
Performance
ERA had another strong year, generating market share gains across the 
entire components portfolio. These share gains arose from deeper 
penetration of the OEM customer base, as well as a number of new 
customer wins. 
Revenue increased overall by 7.4 per cent to £92.4 million  
(2013: £86.0 million) with our core components business growing  
by 10.8 per cent year on year. Underlying operating profit increased  
by 30.9 per cent to £13.7 million (2013: £10.5 million) with around  
£1.3 million of the increase due to the relative strength of Sterling  
over the year. 
As expected, the share gains in the components portfolio have led to  
a margin mix improvement for the Division with underlying operating 
margins increasing on a reported basis by 270 bps to 14.9 per cent 
(2013: 12.2 per cent) and by c. 110 bps once the beneficial impact of 
currency is stripped out. 
EWS, our specialist cold rolled steel reinforcer business, increased  
its output in metres and operating profit contribution year on year; 
however the continued decline in steel prices meant that its  
overall revenue was broadly flat. Ventrolla, our sash window 
refurbishment business, had another strong year with revenue 
increasing some 14.4 per cent and continues to make good progress  
in developing its domestic and commercial businesses.
Our routes to market saw particularly strong performance from  
our core OEM fabricator customers; contrasting with more  
subdued performance from the builders merchants and general 
distribution channels.
Business developments
Our new range of Bi-Fold hardware was successfully introduced into  
the market during the year and has seen strong take up from the OEM 
systems houses. Our premium Fab & Fix product range grew rapidly in 
2014 and took significant share, supported by the additional supplier 
capacity that was put in place by the Group in 2013 and the inventories 
laid down in 2014.
UK outlook
The UK market has now seen seven consecutive quarters of progress 
and appears to be well set for a further year of growth, albeit probably 
at a slightly lower rate than that seen in 2013 and 2014. ERA expects 
that it will be able to take further market share during 2015 through 
growth in both the OEM and distribution channels.
2015 initiatives include the launch of the Division’s full service 
e-commerce platform “ERA Everywhere” for the UK market and the 
further development of the ERA brand. This includes “ERA Expert” to 
bring all of the Division’s support functions under a common sub brand 
and the “ERA 5 Star Guarantee” that offers consumers a cash sum in 
the event that an ERA security product fails in the field. 
The Division also has a number of new products coming to market  
in 2015, including the proprietary Invincible
TM
 cylinder lock, a new range 
of PVC window hardware and a smartphone enabled cylinder lock as 
well as a new range of electromechanical security related products.

Strategic report
Corporate  
governance report Financial statements 20
Our Australian and Singapore businesses had good years and  
continued to take share in markets that were stronger than in 2013. 
Both businesses benefited from the introduction of the Truth product 
range to the portfolio. The market in Brazil recovered somewhat in the 
second half of the year following the World Cup and the presidential 
election and our enlarged business was assisted by the addition of the 
established Vedasil customer base as well as the proximity to market 
that our new manufacturing capabilities present.
Profitability in Schlegel International at the operational level  
benefited from the initial contributions of Vedasil and sale of Truth 
products, offset by higher levels of overhead as a result of the 
significant investment made in developing the Schlegel International 
management team. This incremental investment programme is now 
complete and we believe that Schlegel International remains well 
positioned for growth as and when European markets recover.
Business developments
At the end of 2014 we closed our Belgian facility and discontinued the 
manufacture of industrial products in Europe. Industrial products are 
not integral to the Group’s fenestration component offering and the 
European Industrial Products business had run at a small operating loss 
for the past two years. The closure removes a significant management 
distraction and allows the Divisional management team to focus on the 
development of the building products business in Europe.
Efforts to sell the Industrial Products business as a going concern were 
not successful and accordingly the closure of the facility resulted in  
cash costs of approximately £2.4 million, tangible asset write downs  
of approximately £0.7 million and intangible asset write downs of  
£3.8 million. 2014 revenue for the Industrial Products business was  
£1.7 million (2013: £2.5 million) and the operating loss was 
approximately £(0.7) million (2013: £(0.4) million). 
We made good progress with the restructuring of the Division and, in 
light of the sustained downturn in European markets, continue to 
evaluate the size and locations of our European footprint. In addition 
we continue to look actively for opportunities in Europe to give the 
Division the scale it requires, remaining mindful of our acquisition 
criteria, including our focus on absolute returns.

Markets and performance
Schlegel reported increased revenue of £37 .8 million (2013: £36.8 million) 
however, revenue decreased by some 3.2 per cent on a constant 
currency like for like basis. Difficult trading in Europe was offset in part 
by stronger performances in Brazil, where the Division benefited from its 
increased scale following the acquisition of Vedasil, and in Australia 
assisted by the addition of the full Truth product range to the portfolio.
Quarter by quarter revenue performance in each of Schlegel’s key 
geographies is broken out in the table below.

Europe remained a difficult trading environment with our two largest 
end markets, Germany and France, registering year on year declines 
and demand patterns across the customer base remaining variable.  
Our significant Eastern European markets of Russia and Poland did see 
improved demand during the first half of the year, however this was 
largely due to inventory restocking by distributors and reversed in the 
second half. We continued to outperform the market in Italy, where we 
have benefited from competitors exiting the market in recent years, and 
demand in Spain has begun to stabilise over the past 12 months.

RMI New build
Schlegel International has continued to develop its product portfolio 
during the year, as it aims to offer a complete range of sealing solutions 
to the market. New product introductions in 2014 included the launch 
at the Fensterbau Trade Show of the high performance Nova-Seal 
range and the introduction of the North American Foam-Tite seal to the 
European market. In conjunction with AmesburyTruth, the Division is 
also developing a lockable casement operator for the Australasian 
market which will come to market in 2015.
Schlegel América Latina
Following the acquisition of Vedasil in February we combined the 
businesses of Vedasil and our existing Brazilian business into a single 
operating entity – Schlegel América Latina. We closed our São Paolo 
distribution centre and consolidated all activities at the Vedasil site. 
Integration has progressed well and the enlarged business has 
performed ahead of our expectations in its first 10 months of  
operation making a meaningful contribution to the Division.
Outlook
Following the closure of the European Industrial Products business  
and the conclusion of our incremental investment programme, 2015 
should see an improved performance from the Division. Material profit 
improvement, however, remains dependent on significantly increased 
European volumes which, given the macroeconomic environment, we  
do not expect to come through in 2015.
Across Europe as a whole we expect to see broadly flat markets in  
2015 with some isolated pockets of growth. We expect continued 
improvement in Australasia and South East Asian markets and, while 
the overall Brazilian macroeconomic backdrop is subdued, construction 
markets are expected to show further growth in 2015. We are well 
positioned in the Brazilian market and are developing distribution into 
adjacent geographies. 
FENSTERBAU 2014
Schlegel International had their biggest stand for years at 
Fensterbau 2014 to place the famous Schlegel brand firmly back 
on the fenestration market map.
Fensterbau, a trade show for the window, door and façade 
construction sector, provided a useful vehicle to exhibit the 
extensive Schlegel range across Europe. 
Schlegel, who have recently expanded with new materials and 
designs showcased their extruded seals in TPE, PP and EPDM, as 
well as the exciting “new to Europe” Foam-Tite, specifically 
designed for aluminium and PVC framing.

 FINANCIAL REVIEW
The continued delivery of synergies and good dropthrough during the year 
contributed to a 42.4 per cent increase in underlying operating profit.
Revenue and profit
Group revenue increased by 17.7 per cent to £350.9 million  
(2013: £298.1 million), in large part due to the consolidation of Truth for 
a full 12 months compared with six months in 2013, and despite the 
adverse impact of currency movements in the year. On a constant 
currency, like for like basis, Group revenue increased by approximately 
7.4 per cent year on year. 
Reported gross margin decreased slightly to 32.7 per cent  
(2013: 33.3 per cent) principally arising from the realignment of costs 
accounted for in SG&A in 2013 into direct overhead in 2014 following 
the integration of AmesburyTruth. On a like for like basis, after the 
realignment of these costs, the Group’s ongoing gross margin improved 
by 100 bps.
Underlying administrative expenses increased slightly to £68.7 million 
(2013: £66.9 million), despite the increased levels of trading, principally 
reflecting the successful delivery of cost synergy benefits in 
AmesburyTruth along with tight cost control in the other Divisions. 
Underlying operating profit increased by 42.4 per cent to £46.1 million 
(2013: £32.3 million), and by 25.1 per cent on a constant currency like 
for like basis. We demonstrated good dropthrough during the year with 
underlying operating margins increasing to 220 bps to 13.1 per cent 
(2013: 10.9 per cent). 
Underlying profit before taxation increased by 45.6 per cent to  
£41.6 million (2013: £28.6 million) and by 23.4 per cent on a constant 
currency like for like basis.
Finance costs
Interest payable on bank loans and overdrafts increased to £4.6 million 
(2013: £3.5 million) reflecting a full year of interest charges on the 
Group’s higher absolute level of indebtedness following the acquisition 
of Truth. 
Capitalised borrowing costs written off through the income statement 
in the year totalled £2.5 million (2013: £1.0 million) of which £1.3 million 
related to accelerated amortisation following the repayment and 
cancellation of both the 2011 banking facility and the 2013 Truth 
acquisition facility.
Net finance costs in 2013 were reduced by £1.3 million as a result of the 
exceptional foreign exchange gain which arose on the conversion of 
equity proceeds into US Dollars to finance the acquisition of Truth.
Interest rates 
The Group’s average cost of funds and margin payable over the year as 
a whole was approximately 2.8 per cent (2013: 2.9 per cent). The Group 
holds interest rate contracts to swap around 70.9 per cent of the 
Group’s outstanding debt under its revolving credit facility at the year 
end from floating rates to a weighted average fixed rate of 1.2 per cent 
with a range of maturities between 2016 and 2020. 
As at 31 December 2014, the Group’s portfolio of swap contracts at fair 
value amounted to a liability of £0.3 million (2013: £0.8 million). Any 
changes in fair value until maturity, classified as an effective hedge, will 
be recognised directly in other comprehensive income, with only the 
ineffective portion taken through the income statement.
Taxation 
The Group incurred a tax charge on profit before taxation of  
£2.6 million (2013: tax credit of £0.2 million). Taxation before 
adjustments for deferred tax rate changes, amortisation and 
impairment of acquired intangibles and exceptional items amounted  
to £10.4 million, which represents an effective underlying tax rate  
of 25.0 per cent (2013: 26.7 per cent). The Group paid £6.3 million 
(2013: £6.2 million) of corporate taxes in the year which equates to a 
cash tax rate of 15.0 per cent (2013: 21.7 per cent).  23

The effective underlying tax rate was reduced by approximately  
170 bps due to the impact of the 2010 and 2011 LTIP awards both 
vesting in 2014 and the significant share price appreciation over the 
lifetime of those awards.
Several factors impact the Group’s taxation charge or credit, including:
• The Group’s operations are international in nature. In 2014, 70.6 per 
cent of the Group’s trading profits before central cost allocations 
were generated in the United States, 29.1 per cent generated in the 
UK and 0.3 per cent in Schlegel International’s overseas territories 
(depressed in 2014 by the trading losses made in Europe). The 
Group’s effective tax rate is therefore a function of the interaction of 
different country, state and local taxation rates and allowances. 
• The Group has a proactive capital investment programme in each of 
its Divisions. These investments are amortised for tax purposes in 
accordance with the laws relating to capital allowances in each 
country, which may not match with the Group’s depreciation policy.
• Group companies sometimes generate losses, in 2014 most notably 
in certain European jurisdictions. Where these losses can be relieved 
or carried forward to be relieved in future periods, the Group does so 
in accordance with the relevant laws, however this treatment is 
broadly dependent on sufficient eligible taxable profits being 
generated in the relevant jurisdiction. 
• Certain losses, most notably those related to the amortisation and 
impairment of intangible assets and the write off of goodwill arising 
on acquisition cannot be relieved against taxable profits. As the 
Group has developed through acquisition, these charges have a 
material impact on the Group’s statutory tax charge as a proportion 
of pre-tax profits.
• Group share options and LTIPs will generate varying levels of tax 
relief to the Group dependent on the vesting outcomes of awards 
and the share price as at the date of vesting.
• The Group does not make material use of special incentive 
arrangements that might impact the tax charge such as research 
and development tax credits or patent box structures. 
The Group conducts its tax affairs in accordance with the law and 
arranges its tax affairs in line with its commercial activities worldwide. 
As such, it follows the terms of double taxation treaties and relevant 
OECD guidelines in dealing with issues such as transfer pricing, 
repatriation of profits and the establishment of a taxable presence in 
countries where it trades. The Group seeks to engage proactively with 
tax authorities in each of its key jurisdictions in order to ensure that the 
Group’s tax affairs are clearly communicated. As far as practical, the 
Group aims to keep its legal and commercial structures straightforward 
in order to reduce risk and minimise compliance costs. 
The Group’s key transfer pricing arrangements comprise commercial 
agreements relating to trade between Group entities, intra-group 
financing and the recharging of shared-service administrative costs. 
Where Group entities do trade with each other, transfer pricing 
arrangements are appropriate for the territories involved and are 
enacted on a consistent basis.
Earnings per share
Underlying earnings per share increased by 35.7 per cent to  
18.61 pence (2013: 13.71 pence). The increase reflects the improvement 
in underlying operating profit, the continued delivery of synergies and  
the slightly lower effective tax rate for the year, offset in part by the 
increased finance charge and the higher weighted average number  
of shares in issue.
Basic earnings per share was 5.56 pence (2013: 0.63 pence).

Dividends
A final dividend of 6.00 pence per share (2013: 4.50 pence per share), 
equivalent to £10.1 million (2013: £7.6 million), will be proposed at the 
Annual General Meeting. The total dividend declared for the 2014 
financial year is therefore 8.00 pence per share (2013: 6.00 pence per 
share), an increase of 33.3 per cent over 2013 and which equates to 
dividend cover of 2.33x. 
The ex-dividend date will be 23 April 2015 and the final dividend  
will be paid on 20 May 2015 to shareholders on the register at close  
24 April 2015.
In accordance with IFRS, only dividends paid during the year have been 
charged in the 2014 financial statements. Dividends declared and paid 
in 2014 were the 2013 final dividend of 4.50 pence per share and the 
2014 interim dividend of 2.00 pence per share.

Exceptional items of £5.6 million were incurred during the year  
(2013: £10.9 million). 
Redundancy and restructuring costs principally concern the closures of 
the manufacturing facilities in Belgium (Gistel) and the US (Covington, 
Georgia). Costs of £3.1 million incurred in respect of the Gistel closure 
include tangible asset write downs of approximately £0.7 million, and 
redundancy costs and impairment of other assets of £2.4 million. Costs 
of £0.6 million incurred in respect of the Covington closure principally 
relate to an onerous lease provision made during the year. The 
remaining £0.5 million comprises costs incurred across various entities 
as part of redundancy and restructuring programmes, primarily in 
Schlegel International.
M&A costs of £0.4 million reflect directly attributable transaction costs 
and expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition of Vedasil 
together with other M&A activity in the year. Integration costs comprise 
£1.1 million in relation to the ongoing integration of AmesburyTruth  
and £0.2 million in relation to the integration of Vedasil. These costs 
predominantly relate to office closures, relocation, and redundancy 
costs. The costs in 2013 primarily related to the transaction costs and 
expenses directly attributable to the acquisition of Truth Hardware and 
associated integration costs.
The £2.3 million charge for the year ended 31 December 2013 relates 
to the one-off write off of the acquisition fair value adjustment to the 
book value of inventories acquired in the Truth acquisition.
The exceptional costs comprise £2.2 million of costs cash settled  
in 2014 (2013: £6.0 million) and £3.7 million of non cash costs  
(2013: £4.9 million).
Offsetting the exceptional costs incurred was the gain of £0.4 million 
(US$0.7 million) realised on the disposal of the surplus property in  
Sioux Falls, South Dakota, sold in February 2014 for £1.1 million  
(US$1.7 million).
These items are regarded by the Group as exceptional as they are 
significant and non-recurring in nature. 
Materials and input costs
We track the pricing of key raw materials closely within the Divisions in 
order to ensure we are procuring at the best price for the quantities we 
consume and that we are in a position to secure price increases where 
necessary. We were again successful with our continued policy of full 
input cost recovery; most notably with zinc in North America where we 
implemented a price surcharge in the fourth quarter.
We focus on three key categories of raw material – steel, oil derivatives 
and zinc. Our largest raw material and component purchase is steel 
across a number of different types and grades. Oil derivatives are used 
in the manufacture of our seal, extrusion and injection moulded 
products. Zinc has increased significantly in importance to the Group 
since the acquisition of Truth. In addition, we track closely the pricing of 
a representative basket of those products we source from the Far East 
into the UK – which will be influenced by local labour and overhead 
rates, raw material price changes and the exchange rate. 
The raw material cost price backdrop continued to be relatively benign 
in 2014, although was slightly more volatile than in recent years. The 
table below sets out the direction of pricing in 2014 of certain specific 
tracker purchases – galvanised steel in the UK, polypropylene in Europe, 
zinc in North America and the representative UK basket of components 
– which are tracked on a weekly basis at Group level. Each of these 
tracker purchases will also tend to be used in the manufacture of those 
products we source from third parties.

Acquisitions
The Group made one acquisition during 2014, which was the acquisition 
of Vedasil in Brazil. ROAI for the four businesses of size acquired since 
2010 are as follows:

Truth Jul 2013 US$206,437 14.6% 13.6%
Vedasil Feb 2014 BR26,639 19.6% 23.7%
The Group requires that all acquisitions target a run rate ROAI  
greater than 15 per cent in the first two years following acquisition. 
Achievement of this hurdle rate of return should ensure that any 
acquisition delivers a return significantly in excess of the Group’s cost  
of capital.
Fab & Fix has sustained its strong performance for the Group since 
acquisition and delivered a return significantly in excess of the minimum 
threshold. The cost and revenue synergies derived from the integration 
of Truth means that Truth’s run rate ROAI will exceed the threshold prior 
to its second anniversary and Vedasil has performed very strongly for 
the Group in the 10 months since acquisition.
Goodwill and acquired intangible assets
A goodwill impairment charge of £3.4 million was taken in the year 
following the decision to close the European Industrial Products 
business. The intangible amortisation charge of £18.2 million  
(2013: £16.6 million) increased principally due to a full year of 
amortisation of the intangible assets created as a result of the Truth 
acquisition together with the initial amortisation of the intangible 
assets acquired with Vedasil. 
In accordance with accounting standards, the Board has reviewed the 
carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets across the Group 
by Cash Generating Unit (“CGU”) in the light of current trading and 
prospects and progress towards achieving the Divisions’ strategic plans. 
The Board concluded that the carrying value of goodwill and other 
intangible assets remained appropriate for the continuing businesses 
and that no further impairment had occurred. 
The CGU with the lowest headroom remains the Schlegel International 
CGU, which is a function of the current levels of demand currently seen 
within that Division. In the event that there was a further material 
contraction in demand for Schlegel International’s products that leads 
to an expectation of a future permanent reduction in EBITDA levels, 
then a further impairment might be required. The Board will keep this 
under review.
During 2014 Amesbury and Truth were treated as separate CGUs. The 
two businesses now operate as an integrated Division under a common 
leadership team, and as product categories start to be consolidated, it 
is becoming increasingly difficult to allocate revenue and cash flows to 
the correct CGU. Accordingly, the Board intends to combine the 
Amesbury and Truth CGUs into a single AmesburyTruth CGU during 
2015 and future impairment testing will be conducted on that basis.

On 10 June 2014 the Group entered into an enlarged new banking 
facility (the “2014 Facility”) of up to £240 million with six relationship 
banks, comprising a £180 million committed revolving credit facility and 
a £60 million uncommitted accordion facility. The 2014 Facility offers 
the Group improved pricing, increased flexibility, and relaxation or 
removal of certain covenants. On completion of the 2014 Facility, the 
2011 facility was repaid in full and cancelled. 
In November 2014 the Group raised a total of US$100 million through 
its inaugural US private placement offering. The US$100 million 
acquisition facility put in place in 2013 to acquire Truth was repaid  
and cancelled in November 2014.
Liquidity 
At 31 December 2014 the Group had gross outstanding borrowings  
of £130.0 million (2013: £124.6 million), cash balances of £39.3 million 
(2013: £43.6 million) and committed but undrawn facilities of  
£114.7 million (2013: £29.7 million) as well as access to the 
uncommitted £60.0 million accordion facility.
Underlying net debt at the year end was £90.7 million  
(2013: £80.9 million) with £4.7 million of the increase due to exchange 
movements year on year. Under IFRS, which reduces gross debt by  
the unamortised portion of finance arrangement fees, net debt at  
31 December 2014 was £88.7 million (2013: £78.7 million). 
The Group maintains sufficient cash balances and undrawn borrowing 
facilities to finance all investment and capital expenditure included in its 
strategic plan; while retaining sufficient flexibility to be able to react to 
changes in market conditions and complete bolt on acquisitions without 
the need to raise external finance.

Shares in issue
The total number of shares in issue at 31 December was 170.1 million 
with the basic weighted average number of shares in issue 167.8 million 
(2013: 152.8 million) and the fully diluted weighted average number of 
shares 169.7 million (2013: 155.1 million). 
At 31 December 2014 the Group had 0.6 million shares in treasury 
(2013: 0.6 million) and the Tyman Employee Benefit Trust held  
1.6 million shares (2013: 2.2 million).
Cash and conversion
The Group made significant investment in the balance sheet during the 
year; with capital expenditure running well ahead of depreciation and 
trade working capital increasing. An element of the investment in trade 
working capital is due to timing of inventory shipments and should 
reverse in 2015.

The Group generated operational cash flow in the year of £33.1 million 
(2013: £37.7 million) after adding back £2.2 million (2013: £6.0 million) 
of exceptional costs cash settled in the year. Operating cash conversion 
of 71.8 per cent was accordingly lower than in the previous year  
(2013: 116.4 per cent). Since 2011 operating cash conversion has 
averaged 89.9 per cent and we continue to target our Divisions on  
100 per cent cash conversion.
Capital expenditure
Gross capital expenditure increased to £11.5 million (2013: £8.6 million) 
or 1.43x depreciation (2013: 1.31x depreciation) as we continued our 
programme of targeted capital investment ahead of depreciation 
across each of the businesses. Capital expenditure receipts in the year 
benefited from the proceeds of the Sioux Falls property disposal.
Of this amount, intangible capital expenditure comprised £2.1 million 
(2013: £1.3 million) principally as a result of our continuing investment 
in the AmesburyTruth ERP system.
Working capital
We retained our strong focus on management of working capital within 
each of the Divisions, with the aim of achieving an appropriate balance 
between commercial priorities and financial efficiency. Each Division is 
allocated specific cash targets which are monitored throughout the  
year and flexed according to demand levels and the Divisions are 
encouraged to seek out opportunities to secure permanent reductions 
in working capital.
Some investment in working capital was required in 2014 to support  
the increased activity levels in the two largest Divisions. The overall 
movement of working capital in 2014 was a net cash outflow of  
£10.9 million (2013: £12.4 million inflow).
Inventories on the balance sheet at the year end increased to  
£47.6 million (2013: £40.7 million) with £2.0 million of the increase due 
to exchange movements and Vedasil. The majority of the increase year 
on year was due to targeted investment in inventory at ERA to support 
the significantly higher levels of trading in Fab & Fix product. In 
addition, certain Far East shipments of inventory in advance of Chinese 
New Year fell into 2014 when provisional scheduling had indicated they 
would be shipped in 2015.
Despite the increased levels of trading, our trade receivables increased 
only marginally to £31.5 million (2013: £29.9 million) with substantially 
all of the increase due to exchange movements and Vedasil. This 
reflects the continued proactive management of the trade receivables 
book and bad debts written off in the year amounted to only 0.1 per 
cent of revenue (2013: 0.1 per cent). 
Our more structured approach to supply chain in each of the Divisions 
required some extension of trading terms with key suppliers and 
accordingly trade payables year on year decreased to £26.8 million 
(2013: £31.2 million). The Group will benefit in terms of service levels 
and responsiveness from its supplier base from this investment.
Net trade working capital to revenue at the year end increased by  
170 bps to 14.9 per cent (2013: 13.2 per cent). 
Pensions and post retirement medical benefits
The Group’s gross pension and post retirement medical benefit 
obligations under IAS 19 at 31 December 2014 were £24.9 million 
(2013: £21.1 million) with the majority of the movement over the course 
of the year being due to exchange differences and actuarial losses 
following reassessments of discount rates. The principal schemes are 
located in North America where the pension scheme is closed to new 
entrants and post retirement healthcare benefits are capped.
Cash contributions made to the schemes during the year were  
£1.0 million (2013: £0.9 million).
Summary 2015 guidance
Underlying tax rates for the Group for 2015 are expected to be slightly 
higher than in 2014 at c. 27 – 28 per cent. The final underlying tax rate 
for the year will principally depend on the Group’s geographical mix of 
taxable profits. Cash taxation rates are expected to be slightly below 
the Group’s underlying tax rate.

The principal foreign currencies that impact our results are the

Following the acquisition of Vedasil, the Brazilian Real has also become 
a more important currency for the Group. Each of these currencies was 
on average weaker versus Sterling in 2014 compared with the  
previous year.
The net effect of currency translation caused revenue and underlying

In addition there are transactional exposures for those Divisions that 
purchase or sell products in currencies other than their functional 
currency. These are principally Sterling/US Dollar or Renminbi for 
purchases by ERA from the Far East and Aus Dollar/US Dollar/Renminbi 
for purchases by Schlegel International’s Australian business from the 
USA and the Far East. In 2014, we estimate that the strength of Sterling 
benefited ERA’s reported profitability by approximately £1.3 million  
and the unhedged impact on ERA of a 1c movement in the US Dollar is 
approximately £0.2 million. Other transactional exposures benefit  
from the existence of natural hedges or are de minimis in size.
The Group’s policy is to recover adverse transactional currency 
movements through price increases or surcharges.
Currency in the balance sheet
The Group aims to mitigate the translational impact of exchange  
rate movements by denominating a proportion of total borrowings in 
those currencies where there is a material contribution to underlying 
operating profit. The Group’s 2014 facility allows the Group to draw 
funds in a number of different currencies.

Demand in the building products sector is 
dependent on levels of activity in new 
construction and property repair and 
remodelling markets. This demand can be 
unpredictable and the Group has a low visibility 
of future orders from its customers. The 
recovery in the US and UK has reduced risk for 
the Group but the risk of further decline in the 
European economies persists. 
In recent cyclical downturns management have 
proved effective in responding to such events and 
continue to have similar measures ready to deploy, 
such as:
• maintaining appropriate headroom and tenor  
in its available borrowing facilities;
• the geographic spread of our business; 
• our ability to flex our cost base;

• planning, budgeting and forecasting

Competitors

The Group may face significant competition, 
including competition from international 
businesses with large capital resources. 
Competition in the industry is based on: range 
and quality of products offered, geographical 
reach, product development, reputation and 
client relationships. The building products 
market has become increasingly competitive, 
particularly where overcapacity has been 
exacerbated by the economic recession. 
Aggressive pricing from our competitors  
could cause a reduction in our revenues  
and margins.
Some of our markets are relatively concentrated with 
two or three key players, while others are highly 
fragmented and offer significant opportunities for 
consolidation and penetration. The Group continues 
to differentiate itself through its wide range of 
products, its investment in new product development, 
a focus on setting industry leading standards for 
delivery on time and in full, its technical support, its 
geographical spread, strategic focus and reputation. 
We aim to minimise the impact of aggressive pricing 
by competitors through a low cost manufacturing 
strategy supported by our programmes of continuous 
process improvements and building long term 
relationships with our customers based on value, 
quality, service and added value technical support.

The raw materials used in the Group’s businesses 
include commodities that experience price 
volatility (such as oil derivatives, steel, aluminium

demand, and commodity market fluctuations. 
The Group’s ability to meet customer demands 
depends in large part on obtaining timely and 
adequate supplies of components and raw 
materials on competitive terms. Failure by any of 
the Group’s suppliers could significantly limit the 
Group’s sales and increase its costs. The raw 
material cost backdrop was relatively benign  
in 2014.
The Group continues to invest in and improve its 
sourcing and procurement capability. The Group 
manages the risks associated with raw material costs 
and supply chain failure through strong long term 
relationships with suppliers, economies of purchasing, 
multiple suppliers and inventory management. In 
addition, the Group will mitigate this risk by increasing 
selling prices or applying surcharges to recover 
unavoidable input cost increases. The Group’s  
third party component suppliers typically have 
longstanding relationships with the Divisions and 
manufacture product for the Group on an exclusive or 
semi-exclusive basis, to the Group’s designs and on 
the Group’s tooling. This gives the Group the balance 
of a committed supplier base with the flexibility to 
change suppliers if quality or service levels decline.

The Group will continue to make strategic 
acquisitions in the future, which will impact the 
performance and the risk profile of the Group. 
The subsequent integration of acquisitions 
involves further risks such as the diversion of 
management, disruption of operations and the 
retention of key personnel in the acquired 
business. 
The Group mitigates this risk by extensive due diligence 
prior to the acquisition and the preparation of a 
detailed integration plan following acquisition, covering 
all key areas of activity. The integration process is led by 
the Executive Directors and supported by dedicated 
project teams that include specialised management 
from the wider Group. Rolling out our ERP investment 
and our internal audit programme post acquisition 
helps to establish best practice in governance and 
control procedures. The Board regularly reviews post 
acquisition performance and integration.

The Group operates on a global basis and is 
therefore exposed to transactional and 
translational foreign exchange risk against 
Sterling. In particular, 71 per cent of the Group’s 
underlying operating profits are derived from 
US operations. The Group is also exposed to 
interest rate risks, liquidity and credit risks. 
The Group denominates some of its debt in foreign 
currency to match some of its exposure to the 
translational balance sheet risks associated with 
overseas subsidiaries. Ancillary bank facilities are 
available to manage some of the foreign exchange 
transactional risks and interest rate exposure through 
the use of derivative financial instruments. The Group 
maintains adequate cash balances and credit 
facilities with sufficient headroom and tenure to 
mitigate credit availability risk. Further information on 
these risks is given in note 18 to the Group’s financial 
statements. The successful refinancing of increased 
and extended bank facilities and the issuance of a 
debut US private debt placement in 2014 has helped 
reduce our funding risk.

RESPONSIBILITY REPORT
Employees
Diversity and equal opportunity
All Tyman employees have the right to work in an environment that 
supports diversity and fosters a culture of dignity and respect. The 
Group is committed to supporting employment policies and practices 
that make provision for equal opportunities, non-discrimination, and 
that comply with relevant local legislation and accepted employment 
practice codes.
Policies and practices of equal opportunities and non-discrimination  
will ensure that an individual’s ability, aptitude and talent are the sole 
determinants in recruitment, training, career development and 
progression opportunities rather than on the grounds of age, beliefs, 
disability, ethnic origin, gender, marital status, race, religion or sexual 
orientation.
In considering appointments to the Board and senior management 
positions, it is the Group’s policy to make an appointment on the basis 
of the candidate’s knowledge, skills and experience with due regard for 
the benefit of diversity. 
Across the Group, recruitment policies demonstrate a commitment to 
equal opportunities. Management-level employees have participated  
in local diversity programmes and training events. Any management 
opportunities are advertised internally to provide all employees with  
an equal opportunity for advancement.
Set out below is an analysis of the number of employees by gender as 
at 31 December 2014.

As at 31 December 2014, the Group had female representation of 22.6 
per cent in senior management positions and 16.7 per cent at the Board 
level. This proportion is higher across the total workforce, with 38.1 per 
cent of the profile being female.
Training, development and retention
The Board recognises that the long term growth and enduring success 
of the Group depends on its ability to attract and retain talented and 
skilled employees. Operational efficiencies across the Group are 
enhanced by building and developing the skills, competencies and 
motivation of all employees.
Each of the Group’s operating units are encouraged to implement 
comprehensive employment policies designed to attract, retain, 
appraise and motivate high calibre employees and to determine ways 
of applying their knowledge and skills in a manner that best contributes 
towards the success of the business.
The Group encourages and supports the continuing professional 
development and training of all its employees. Employees are  
provided with training to acquire and develop skills that will enable 
them to perform their duties and, where appropriate, allow for career 
progression. The Group also invests in a range of development activities 
including in:
• North America: the Tuition Reimbursement Program whereby 
employees can pursue a University qualification.
• United Kingdom: LMI Effective Leadership Development Course and 
Coaching for Performance training offered to all management-level 
employees.
The Group operates the Tyman Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) in 
which senior employees are invited to participate in the long term 
future of the Group through share ownership and intends to explore 
other all-employee share plans. The conditional annual awards of 
shares under the LTIP are at the discretion of the Remuneration 
Committee.
In 2015 we intend to seek shareholder approval for the introduction of a 
Group wide employee share save scheme. This will facilitate employees 
becoming shareholders of the Group and will hopefully encourage 
employee interest and engagement in the broader performance  
of Tyman.
Communication
In order for our employees to gain an understanding of the role they play 
within their local operations and that of the Group, employees are 
regularly kept informed on matters relating to their employment, recent 
business developments and other activities of the Group and its divisions. 
These communications are effected through management briefings, 
internal communications, quarterly newsletters, as well as external 
announcements and press releases posted on the Group’s website.

Health and safety
Management and accountability
Providing a safe environment in which our employees can work is a key 
priority for the Group. The Group is committed to ensuring a safe, clean 
and healthy working environment for all employees, customers and 
other persons with whom the Group has contact. The Group actively 
promotes a strong health and safety culture as well as encouraging the 
collective pursuit of continuous improvement in health and safety 
standards across all operations.
The CEO holds the overall responsibility for the Group’s health and 
safety performance. This responsibility is discharged to local 
management through the TMC.
Local management are tasked with the responsibility of creating a 
health and safety management system, and are held accountable for 
their:
• health and safety performance;
• adherence to the Group’s health and safety policies; and
• compliance with local health and safety regulatory requirements.
Health and safety performance is reviewed at each weekly TMC 
meeting. The CEO, at each meeting of the Board of Directors, reports 
on the health and safety performance of the Group.
Health and safety management system
All employees are made aware of the importance of health and safety 
in creating a safe and healthy working environment. Local 
management’s health and safety management systems:
• identify, assess and take action to reduce risks;
• mandate health and safety training and development of all 
employees; and
• develop safe working practices.
The Group requires that all accidents, dangerous incidents and near 
miss statistics are promptly and thoroughly investigated. The details of 
incidents as well as the remedial and preventative measures taken are 
shared between sites as a means of raising awareness and reducing the 
risk of repetition. Any incidents involving lost time of greater than one 
working day are reported to the TMC and the Board.
Operations representing 46.9 per cent of the value of total Group 
revenue in 2014 have achieved accreditation for OHSAS18001 (Health 
and Safety) or for OSHA SHARP (the Safety & Health Achievement 
Recognition Program run by the Occupational Safety & Health 
Administration of the United States Department of Labor). Most other 
Group operations have programmes in place with the objective of 
achieving accreditation.
2014 performance
The KPIs used to evaluate the Group’s health and safety performance 
are the lost time injury rate and the number of lost time injuries.
In 2014, there was a strong focus on improving health and safety in  
the workplace across all operating locations. Although further progress 
was made in developing the Group’s safety culture, the increase in  
the number of LTI in 2014 to 45 incidents (2013: 31 incidents) was 
disappointing. The severity of incidents was significantly reduced 
compared with 2013 and the majority of incidents, categorised as slips, 
trips or manual handling injuries, are preventable. 
In 2014, the Divisions focused on developing their near miss reporting 
in an effort to limit the frequency of preventable incidents. A total  
of 3,829 near miss incidents were reported ranging from general 
housekeeping shortfalls to potentially hazardous practices or processes 
with the potential to cause physical harm. The high level of employee 
engagement in the development of near miss reporting is expected to 
translate into a material reduction in LTIs in the future.

  CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT CONTINUED
Ethics, anti-corruption and compliance
The Group is committed to conducting its business with integrity  
and demands high standards of professional and ethical conduct 
throughout its operations. This will ensure compliance with the laws and 
regulations in jurisdictions in which the Group operates, protect the 
business from unforeseen liabilities and maintain a relationship of trust 
between the business and its stakeholders.
In all relationships and dealings, employees and persons acting on 
behalf of the Group are expected to implement the Group’s policies and 
procedures such that:
• the legitimate interests of the Group are advanced, having regard to 
the Group’s values and standards;
• they engage in ethical conduct, including the avoidance and 
reporting of any conflicts of interest;
• the misuse of confidential information for personal gain is 
prevented;
• all applicable laws and regulations in jurisdictions in which the Group 
operates are upheld, including the prevention of bribery, corruption 
and fraud;
• there is a zero-tolerance culture towards discrimination or 
harassment;
• all employees work in an environment that is healthy and safe;
• all customers are treated fairly, openly and honestly;
• business relationships with suppliers are maintained to high 
standards of integrity; and
• preferred suppliers are those who operate with the same values and 
standards as those of the Group.
The Group requires that formal and confidential whistleblowing 
procedures are in place and advertised at all its operating locations. 
Employees are encouraged to report any suspected incidence of 
non-compliance in accordance with local whistleblowing procedures.
Human rights
Human rights is not considered to be a material risk for the business 
owing to the fact that the Group’s activities are substantially carried  
out in developed countries that have strong legislation governing 
human rights. Whilst the Group does not have a specific human rights 
policy at present, careful consideration will be made as to whether a 
specific human rights policy is required in the future. 
The Group is considered to be in compliance with appropriate 
legislation in the jurisdictions in which it operates. In working with  
and during regular reviews of our suppliers, the Group always seeks to 
encourage suppliers to operate with values and standards equivalent  
to those of the Group.
OWATONNA SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS
During 2014, our Owatonna, Minnesota operating facility 
embarked on a project to further develop and improve its health 
and safety culture. Through the implementation of the following 
safety improvements, the facility achieved an approximate 50 per 
cent improvement in its lost time injury rate:
Storing steel vertically rather than horizontally:
• mitigates tripping risk;
• reduces forklift traffic by c. 90 per cent.
The previous die separation process required manual die 
separation with the use of a large hammer. The automated die 
separator:
• mitigates back strain risk;
• improves efficiency through reduction in set up time.
The switch from forklift to tugger for material delivery on the 
manufacturing floor:
• reduces forklift traffic through the facility by c. 50 per cent;
• mitigates the risk of inventory losses;
• achieves efficiencies through the reduction of put away racks.
Installation of light curtain safety barriers:
• proactively improves machinery safety;
• meets OSHA requirements.

Product integrity
The Group seeks to be honest and fair in its relationships with 
customers and suppliers, to source and supply goods and services  
in an efficient manner, in accordance with specifications, without 
compromising quality and performance.
By providing customers with standards of goods and service that have 
been agreed and by paying suppliers and sub-contractors on agreed 
terms, the Group aims to:
• maintain and grow market share through customer satisfaction;
• achieve cost efficiencies through effective supply chain 
management; and
• source and supply goods and services that are reliable, safe to use 
for their intended purpose and meet industry standards. 
Relationships with suppliers
Each Division is responsible for negotiating the terms and conditions of 
trade with suppliers. In North America, a significant portion of product 
sourcing is done through domestic suppliers, which are frequently 
audited and benchmarked to ensure that the AmesburyTruth Division 
receives the best quality, service and pricing on items procured. 
A substantial portion of UK, and a significant portion of North 
American, product sourcing is conducted through the combined activity 
of the Group’s Chinese operating units. Through its Chinese sourcing 
operations, the Group conducts annual quality assessments of its Asian 
supplier chain. These quality assessments are conducted by suitably 
qualified employees and involve the scoring of strategic suppliers’ 
procedures and efficiencies in respect of procurement, manufacturing, 
quality control, health and safety, social and environmental 
accountability. Appropriate actions are taken to address any 
underperformers identified from the annual assessment process.
Quality management standards
It is Group policy to maintain accreditation to the quality management 
standard ISO9001 and encourage operating units to gain accreditation 
to any specific standards required by the markets served.
ISO9001 certification will ensure that operations maintain and adopt 
efficient quality management systems that save time and cost, improve 
efficiency, and ultimately improve customer relationships.
ERA, THE 2014 COMPONENT SUPPLIER OF THE YEAR
In November 2014, ERA was announced as the UK Component 
Supplier of the Year at the prestigious G14 Awards held in London. 
In achieving this coveted Award, ERA was able to demonstrate 
excellence across a number of disciplines including technical, 
customer service, product innovation and delivery. ERA’s focus  
is firmly planted in the future with a strategy centred around 
delivering cutting-edge hardware innovation that enables its 
customers to present a unique and compelling door and window 
proposition to the homeowner.
Darren Waters, Grouphomesafe CEO comments: “It’s no secret 
that this industry has been through a tough time but despite 
turbulent economic conditions and the tightening of the home 
improvement economy, ERA has continued to grow and convert a 
great deal of business. What we were able to demonstrate in our 
award submission is that despite a tough trading arena our 
approach to business, which rests in traditional values,  
coupled with our market-leading innovation has resulted in 
significant growth.”
“What we’ve seen in the last 12 months is that companies are 
turning to ERA because they need to differentiate themselves in the 
market and can’t compete with a generic hardware product. We’re 
working with our customers to give them security products that 
create real stand out security features and benefits. That’s how our 
customers judge us and it’s what propels this business forward.”

Environmental
The Board recognises its responsibilities as a manufacturing concern  
to continue to reduce the environmental impact of its activities. In 
addition, the Group aims to develop and supply products to help 
customers meet their own environmental objectives and the demands 
of their customers and of government.
The most significant areas of environmental impact associated with  
the Group’s operations relate to manufacturing processes and the 
consequential environmental impact, discussed in the table on page 35.
The Group is committed to the introduction of environmental 
management systems such as ISO14001. Currently 15 of the Group’s 
manufacturing sites have achieved accreditation to the environmental 
management systems standard ISO14001.

Greenhouse gas emissions (“GHG”)
The Group applies the World Resources Institute/World Business Council 
for Sustainable Development Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate 
Accounting and Reporting Standard, Revised Edition, as the basis for 
reporting its emissions and includes the facilities over which it has 
operational control. This is the internationally recognised standard for 
corporate carbon reporting.
Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions data has been collected from all 
material locations operated or controlled by the Group. Emission 
sources falling outside the Group’s operational control and other  
Scope 3 emissions have not been collated and reported. Emissions data 
for businesses acquired during the year has only been included from the 
date of acquisition.
The Group has used revenue as its intensity ratio as this is the most 
appropriate and relevant factor associated with our activities and 
should provide an appropriate basis on which to compare trends  
over time.
GHG emissions generated by the Group’s operations present 
considerable risks to both the Group and the environment, including:
• the agricultural impact of the Group’s dependence on extraction 
and use of raw materials;
• the potential disruption of the Group’s operations and those of its 
customers and suppliers;
• changes in the nature or distribution of consumer demand.
These risks can be mitigated through the Group’s conscious efforts in 
minimising its release of GHG, through its environmental initiatives.

PROCESS DEVELOPMENT
The Group encourages the continuous improvement in the design, 
implementation and monitoring of environmentally efficient 
manufacturing processes. 
This includes monitoring the developments in alternative material 
sources which may reduce the environmental impact of products. 
Through internal development and investment, operations across the 
Group are encouraged to: 
• minimise energy consumption;
• reduce waste generation through re-use and recycling; 
• make use of recycled materials where possible;
• reduce transportation and logistical-related carbon footprint; and
• reduce harmful emissions.
ENERGY CONSUMPTION
The Group continues to invest in energy efficient measures such as 
lighting, improved heating and cooling systems.
Other energy saving initiatives implemented during the year include:
• installation of energy efficient lighting, including motion sensors 
to control lighting;
• the upgrade or installation of more energy efficient production 
machinery; and
• improvements in thermal insulation efficiencies such as upgrades 
to window and door sealing, chiller controls, and installation of 
tinted energy efficient windows. 
TRANSPORT AND LOGISTICS
The Group reduces the environmental impact of transport through 
vehicle efficiency measures such as improved load fill, reductions in 
empty running and route optimisation.
WASTE TO LANDFILL
The Group acts to minimise the amount of waste sent to landfill by:
• redesigning manufacturing floors to improve material flow and 
minimise waste; and
• selling for recycling waste that cannot be used internally. 
RECYCLED MATERIALS
The Group minimises the use of outer packaging where appropriate 
and encourages the use of returnable outer packaging formats. 
OTHER INITIATIVES
Other green initiatives implemented across our operations include: 
• Ontario, California: switching from propane to electric-powered 
forklifts to reduce harmful gas emissions;
• Owatonna, Minnesota: implementation of E-Gard plus, with the 
removal of environmentally unfriendly barrel plating;
• Cannon Falls, Minnesota: planting of trees along perimeter roads 
to create a noise barrier for neighbours; 
• Schlegel Singapore: replacement of the diesel forklift with an 
electric forklift to reduce noise and harmful smoke emissions; and
• Schlegel América Latina, Brazil: remodelling of main electrical 
components in the factory leading to substantial energy savings.

Community
The Group understands the importance of being a contributing 
member of society and its impact on the long term development and 
sustainability of the business. 
Each operating unit is tasked with the responsibility of managing its 
relationship with its local community, including the support of local 
educational and charitable causes. This responsibility involves:
• the positive engagement and support of worthwhile local projects 
and programmes as a company; and
• the volunteering activities and efforts of its employees.
Community engagement includes both the provision of financial 
donations and non-financial community service and participation. 
Some examples of Group community activities and programmes

BOARD AT 1 APRIL 2015 BY DIRECTORSHIP TYPE
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the corporate 
governance report for the year ended 31 December 2014. While other 
sections of the Annual Report cover our financial and operational 
achievements during the year, this section demonstrates the effective 
leadership of the Board and the commitment throughout the Group to 
promoting the highest standards of corporate governance.
I am pleased to confirm that Tyman plc complies with the UK  
Corporate Governance Code (September 2012) (“the Code”). This 
report, together with the Directors’ report, the Audit Committee report, 
the Directors’ remuneration policy report, the Directors’ remuneration 
implementation report and the Nominations Committee report, reviews 
the operation of the Company by reference to the Code. The Board 
believes that promoting the highest standards of corporate governance 
and maintaining an efficient, challenging and diverse Board is essential 
to enable the business to deliver its strategy. 
In accordance with the Code, Independent Audit Limited, a firm of 
specialised corporate governance consultants, performed an evaluation 
of the Board, its committees and each individual Director during the 
year. Details of the review and the findings are included in this report. I 
confirm that following the evaluation, all of the Directors continue to 
perform effectively and to demonstrate commitment to their roles. 
Accordingly, all Directors other than Les Tench who is retiring, will offer 
themselves for re-election at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 
15 May 2015. 
As referred to in my Chairman’s statement, Mark Rollins and Kirsten 
English will join the Board on 1 April 2015 and will each join the Board’s 
Audit, Remuneration and Nominations Committees. In accordance with 
Group policy, both Mark and Kirsten will offer themselves for election at 
Tyman’s Annual General Meeting to be held in May. The Board and I 
look forward to meeting shareholders at the forthcoming AGM.

The Board
How the Board operates
The Board meets regularly and is responsible for the overall leadership, 
strategy, development and control of the Group in order to achieve its 
objectives for continued earnings growth and to enhance shareholder 
value. The Board sets the Group’s strategic aims, ensures that the 
necessary financial and human resources are in place for the Group to 
meet its objectives, reviews management performance and ensures 
that high ethical standards of behaviour are followed. The Board also 
ensures that there is an effective system of controls to safeguard the 
Company’s assets and to enable risks to be properly assessed and 
managed.
The Board has a formal schedule of matters specifically reserved for it 
and this includes the following:
Responsibilities of the Board 
• Responsibility for the overall management of the Group, 
including monitoring the Group’s operating and financial 
performance.
• Approval of the Group’s long term objectives, commercial 
strategy and annual budgets.

To enable the Board to discharge its duties, all Directors receive 
appropriate and timely information. The Company Secretary distributes 
briefing papers to all Directors in advance of Board meetings. All 
Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company 
Secretary, who is responsible for ensuring that Board procedures are 
followed and that applicable rules and regulations are complied with. 
The appointment and removal of the Company Secretary is a matter 
for the Board as a whole. In addition, procedures are in place to enable 
the Directors to obtain independent professional advice in the 
furtherance of their duties, if necessary, at the Company’s expense.
Board composition
The Board comprises two Executive and four Non-executive Directors 
and the names and biographical details of all the current Directors are

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
The roles of the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer are clearly 
defined and approved by the Board. The Chairman is responsible for the 
leadership and effective running of the Board and its decision-making 
processes, for setting the highest standards of corporate governance, 
for setting its agenda and the style and tone of Board discussions. The 
Chairman’s role includes:
• leading the Board in determining the strategy and the overall 
objectives of the Group, while ensuring that the Board determines 
the nature and extent of the significant risks associated with 
implementing this strategy;
• creating the conditions to maximise overall Board and individual 
Director effectiveness;
• ensuring effective communication with shareholders and 
safeguarding their interests;
• ensuring that Directors keep their skills, knowledge and familiarity 
with the Group up to date while ensuring they receive accurate, 
timely and clear information; and
• regularly considering succession planning and the composition of 
the Board.
The Chief Executive Officer is responsible for the day-to-day 
management of the Group, provides leadership for the executive team 
and develops and implements the Group’s strategic objectives. He is 
assisted by the Tyman Management Committee. The Chief Executive 
Officer does not have any external directorships.
The Chief Financial Officer
The Chief Financial Officer is responsible for the financial reporting and 
management of the Group. In addition to the finance, audit, tax and 
treasury functions, he is also jointly responsible with the Chief Executive 
Officer for the Group’s M&A strategy, and investor relations. The Chief 
Financial Officer does not have any external directorships.
The Senior Independent Director
Mr Towers was the Senior Independent Director throughout the year 
under review and up to the date of this report. The Senior Independent 
Director is available for shareholders to voice any concerns which may 
not be appropriate for discussion through the normal channels of 
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer. The Senior 
Independent Director also leads the Chairman’s appraisal, serves as an 
intermediary for the other Directors with the Chairman as necessary 
and acts as a sounding board for the Chairman as required.
Non-executive Directors
At the date of this report Independent Non-executive Directors 
comprise 60 per cent of the Board, excluding the Chairman. The Board 
believes that the Non-executive Directors possess strong independent 
character and judgement and bring a wide range of business 
experience in some areas related to and in other areas complementary 
to the activities of the Group. The Board considered that all the 
Non-executive Directors met the criteria for independence set out in 
provision B.1.1 of the Code and there were no other relationships or 
circumstances, including other common directorships among the 
Directors, which were likely to affect, or could appear to affect, the 
Directors’ judgement.
Directors’ insurance cover
The Company maintains, at its expense, a Directors’ and Officers’ 
liability insurance policy to afford an indemnity in certain circumstances 
for the benefit of Group personnel including, as recommended by the 
Code, the Directors. This insurance policy does not provide cover where 
the Director or Officer has acted fraudulently or dishonestly.
Board performance
In accordance with the Code, an external review of the Board’s 
performance was undertaken in 2014, with the help of an external 
facilitator, Independent Audit Limited. Independent Audit is a firm of 
specialist board governance consultants and they do not have any 
other connection with the Company.
The review was based on a combination of questionnaires and 
interviews. Independent Audit’s Thinking Board questionnaire platform 
was initially used to gauge the views of the Directors and certain key 
executives (and to provide a benchmark for subsequent reviews). 
Interviews were subsequently held to follow up this exercise. 
Independent Audit also observed the Board meeting held in March 
2014 and considered the quality of Board and Committee papers.
The review covered key areas of Board performance including:
• the Board’s role;
• composition, skills and dynamics;
• the focus of the Board’s work;
• meetings;
• information and decision-making; and
• internal and external communications.
Strategic report
Corporate  
governance report Financial statements 44
The Board review was undertaken during February and March 2014 and 
Independent Audit’s report was considered by the Board at its June 
2014 meeting. The review concluded that the Board displays a good 
mix of skills and that the Board dynamics are very good. The Non-
executive Directors bring good challenge to the Executive Directors and 
there is constructive and open working relationships between 
Executives and Non-executives. Overall, Independent Audit Limited 
concluded that the Board performs very well.
The evaluation highlighted some areas for the Board to increase its 
focus on going forward, namely succession planning, devoting more 
time to longer term strategy and the Group’s risk framework and 
processes. The Board agreed that these recommendations could 
enhance its performance and has responded to these suggestions by 
holding an away-day in June 2014 to discuss strategy and by reviewing 
and discussing presentations on the Group’s risk management systems 
at the Board meeting in December 2014. Greater focus has been given 
to succession planning resulting in the recruitment of two Non-
executive Directors effective 1 April 2015.
Drawing on the Board review and using individual Director 
questionnaires, the Chairman undertook a review of the performance 
of each of the Directors. The Senior Independent Director undertook a 
review of the performance of the Chairman after taking into account 
the views of all the Directors. The results of these individual reviews and 
any improvements or personal objectives were discussed with the 
relevant Directors on a one-to-one basis.
The Board evaluation for 2015 is now underway and is being co-
ordinated by the Company Secretary, continuing to utilise Independent 
Audit’s Thinking Board questionnaire platform. The Board intends to 
engage an external facilitator again in 2017, with reviews in the 
intervening years conducted internally.
Relations with shareholders
We maintain an active engagement with our key financial audiences 
including institutional shareholders and sell side analysts as well as 
potential shareholders. During the year the Executive Directors had 
regular presentations to, and meetings with, institutional investors and 
analysts to discuss the Company’s past performance and strategy. The 
Board is provided with brokers’ reports, surveys on shareholders’ views 
and regular feedback from shareholder meetings. The Chairman and 
Non-executive Directors have the opportunity to attend meetings with 
major shareholders and expect to attend meetings at their request.
The Board uses the Annual General Meeting to communicate with 
private and institutional investors and welcomes their participation. 
Details of resolutions to be proposed at the Annual General Meeting 
can be found in the Directors’ report. The Company has set up a 
website www.tymanplc.com which shareholders, investors and other 
interested parties may access. The website permits users to download 
copies of published financial reports, press releases and Stock Exchange 
announcements.
Board committees
The Board has an Audit Committee, a Remuneration Committee and a 
Nominations Committee, each comprised of all three Non-executive 
Directors. The Chairman is also a member of the Remuneration and 
Nominations Committees. The existence of the committees ensures 
that time is allocated on a formal basis to consider relevant issues. 
Terms of reference for the Board and each of the Board committees are 
available for inspection on the Group website.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee’s primary responsibilities are to monitor the 
integrity of the financial statements and any formal announcements 
relating to the Company’s financial performance, to review any changes 
in accounting principles and consider the appropriateness of accounting 
policies adopted by the Company, review the Group’s internal and 
external audit activity and review and monitor the effectiveness of the 
risk management and internal control systems within the business.  
The membership and work of the Committee during the year ended  
31 December 2014 is described in detail in the Audit Committee report 
on pages 46 to 49.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee considers and approves the 
remuneration and benefits of the Directors in accordance with the 
remuneration policy approved by the shareholders in May 2014. The 
Committee also reviews the remuneration of the members of the 
Tyman Management Committee and the Company Secretary and of 
the service providers contracted to perform executive functions for the 
Group as well as long term share incentive and share option schemes 
for all employees.
The membership and work of the Committee during the year ended  
31 December 2014 and details of the remuneration policy and 
Directors’ remuneration packages are set out in the Directors’ 
remuneration report on pages 50 to 64.
Nominations Committee
The Nominations Committee identifies and nominates candidates for 
the office of Director of the Company. It meets as and when required 
and is chaired by Mr Pike, except that Mr Pike would not chair the 
Committee or attend it if it were to consider the appointment of a 
successor Chairman. 
The membership and work of the Committee during the year ended  
31 December 2014 is described in detail in the Nominations Committee 
report on page 65.
Internal control
The Directors acknowledge that they are responsible for the Group’s 
system of internal controls and for reviewing the effectiveness of those 
controls. The Board, including the Executive Directors, reviews the 
internal control framework on an ongoing basis.
Procedures have been developed to safeguard assets against 
unauthorised use or disposition of assets and to maintain proper 
accounting records to provide reliable financial information both for 
internal use and for publication. In accordance with the revised version 
of the Turnbull Guidance on Internal Control, the procedures are 
regularly reviewed in the light of an ongoing process to identify, 
evaluate and manage the significant risks faced by the Company. The 
process has been in place for the full year under review and up to the 
date of the approval of the Annual Report and Accounts. The 
procedures are designed to manage rather than eliminate risk and can 
only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CONTINUED 45
Tyman plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2014
Internal financial controls
The Group operates an effective Group reporting and consolidation 
system. During the year enhancements and updates were made to the 
Group reporting and consolidation system which have further 
strengthened the financial reporting and control process in the Group.
The Group has an established system for assessing the effectiveness of 
the Group’s systems of internal financial controls. This includes strategic 
business planning and monthly monitoring and reporting of financial 
performance. 
A detailed annual budget, prepared by senior management, is reviewed 
and formally adopted by the Board. The budget and other targets are 
regularly updated and regular business review meetings are held 
monthly involving the Tyman Management Committee to assess 
performance. The results of these reviews are in turn reported to and 
discussed by the Board at each meeting.
Going concern
The Group’s strategic plan covers the period to 31 December 2018 and 
the Group’s banking and private placement facilities are committed 
beyond the period of the strategic plan and contain significant 
covenant headroom. The Group’s published year end leverage target  
of 1.5x to 2.0x is designed to ensure that the Group has structural 
headroom on its financial covenants as it comes into each financial year 
such that it could withstand a material downturn in its end markets and 
any normalisation of interest rates. 
In order to satisfy themselves that the Group has adequate resources 
for the future, the Board reviewed the Group’s committed funding and 
liquidity positions, its ability to generate cash from trading activities and 
its ability to raise external funding in the future. The operational 
performance, as described in the Financial review on pages 22 to 27, 
the future plans for the Group and the risks facing the Group, described 
on pages 10 and 11, and 28 and 29, were also reviewed. In addition, 
note 18 to the consolidated financial statements includes the Group’s 
policies and processes for managing capital, liquidity and credit risks as 
well as details of its financial instruments and hedging strategies.
In performing their reviews, the Board acknowledged the current level 
of growth prospects in global markets and has considered various 
sensitivity analyses when assessing the forecast funding and headroom 
requirements of the Group.
The Directors are therefore confident, on the basis of current financial 
projections and the banking facilities available, and after considering 
sensitivities, that the Company and the Group has sufficient resources 
for its operational needs that will enable the Group to remain in 
compliance with its financial covenants in its bank facilities for at least 
the next 12 months. Accordingly the Directors continue to adopt the 
going concern basis.
Directors’ responsibilities statement
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, the 
Directors’ remuneration report and the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for 
each financial year. Under that law the Directors have prepared the 
Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the European Union 
(“EU”) and the Parent Company financial statements in accordance 
with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable laws). Under company 
law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they 
are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of 
the Group and the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for 
that period. In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are 
required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent; and
• state whether IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable UK 
Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the Group and Parent 
Company financial statements respectively.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of 
the Company and the Group and enable them to ensure that the 
financial statements and the Directors’ remuneration report comply 
with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible 
for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence 
for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
Company’s website (www.tymanplc.com). Legislation in the United 
Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
The Directors consider that the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a 
whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s 
performance, business model and strategy.
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed on pages 
38 and 39, confirm that, to the best of their knowledge:
• the financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance 
with IFRSs as adopted by the EU with respect to the Group and UK 
GAAP with respect to the Company, give a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the Group and 
Company; and
• the management report in the Strategic report and Directors’ report 
of the Annual Report and Accounts includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business and the position of 
the Group, together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that it faces.

The Committee is responsible for monitoring the integrity of the 
financial statements including significant judgements. This includes 
review through the year of the following areas:
• The appropriateness of Group accounting principles, practices and 
policies and changes to, and compliance with, accounting standards 
on an ongoing basis.
• Prior to recommending their publication to the Board, the 
Committee reviewed the half-year results for the six months ended 
30 June 2014 with the external auditor and compared the results 
with management accounts and budgets, focusing on key areas of 
judgement.
• At the half and full year ends, reviewing the Group’s committed 
funding and liquidity positions, cash flow projections and trading 
performance in order to recommend to the Board that the Group 
and Tyman plc continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the financial statements.
• The review, prior to advising the Board on whether the Committee 
believes the Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended  
31 December 2014, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, business model 
and strategy. 
 
In undertaking this review, the following critical accounting policies and 
judgements were discussed with management and the external auditor:
Carrying value of goodwill and intangibles
As set out in note 10 to the Group financial statements, at  
31 December 2014, the Group had goodwill of £254.4 million with 
intangible assets amounting in total to £101.3 million. In order to satisfy 
itself that these balances were appropriately stated, the Committee 
considered the impairment reviews carried out by management. These 
reviews involve the discounting of the forecasted cash flows of each 
cash generating unit, using appropriate discount rates relative to the 
Company’s cost of capital. These assumptions are then subjected to 
sensitivity analysis. The auditor provided the Committee with their 
review of the impairment review process and, following discussion, the 
Committee was satisfied that the assumptions used were appropriate 
and that there was sufficient headroom on all calculations thus 
obviating the need for any impairment.
The CGU with the lowest headroom remains the Schlegel International 
CGU, which is a function of the current levels of demand currently seen 
within that Division. In the event that there was a further material 
contraction in demand for Schlegel International’s products that leads 
to an expectation of a future permanent reduction in EBITDA levels, 
then a further impairment might be required. The Board will keep this 
under review.
Exceptional items 
During the year ended 31 December 2014 the Group incurred  
£5.6 million of non-recurring and exceptional items (see note 6 of the 
financial statements) which primarily relate to the integration of Truth, 
the closure of the Covington facility and the acquisition of Vedasil in 
Brazil, partly offset by the profit on the sale of surplus property in Sioux 
Falls. The Committee considered the accounting treatment and 
disclosure of these costs in the financial statements through a detailed 
review of management’s plans in respect to the related programmes, and 
also sought the views of the external auditor as to the appropriateness 
and consistency of the accounting treatment and disclosures. On the 
basis of this review the Committee concluded that the accounting 
treatment and disclosure of these items were appropriate.
Provisions
The Group has provisions of £12.2 million at 31 December 2014 as 
outlined in note 19 to the Group financial statements which, by their 
nature, are uncertain and highly judgemental in nature. The Committee 
considered the nature of the provisions, the potential outcomes, any 
developments relating to specific claims, and the prior history of lease 
obligations, provisions and claims in order to assess whether the 
provisions recorded are appropriate and suitably conservative. The 
Committee discussed with management and with the auditor the key 
elements of judgement to assure themselves as to the adequacy and 
appropriateness of the provisions. Following this discussion, the 
Committee was satisfied that the judgements exercised were 
appropriate and that the provisions were fairly stated in the  
annual accounts.
Strategic report
Corporate  
governance report Financial statements 48
Carrying value of inventory
As set out in note 12 to the Group financial statements, as at  
31 December 2014, the Group had gross inventories of £53.8 million  
and provisions for slow moving and obsolete inventories of £6.2 million. 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value,  
with due allowance for excess, obsolete or slow-moving items. Group 
management exercises judgement in assessing net realisable value and 
provisions for slow-moving and obsolete inventory which is based on 
current assessments of future demand, market conditions and new 
product development initiatives. The auditor provided the Committee 
with their review of inventories and following discussion, the Committee 
was satisfied that the inventory valuation was consistent with our 
accounting policy and previous practice and that the resultant  
valuation was reasonable.
Carrying value of trade receivables
As set out in note 13 to the Group financial statements, at  
31 December 2014, the Group had gross trade receivables of  
£33.6 million and provisions for bad debts of £2.2 million. Trade 
receivables are recognised initially at fair value plus transaction costs 
and subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective 
interest rate method, less appropriate allowances for estimated 
irrecoverable amounts. Provision against trade receivables is made 
when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to 
collect all amounts due to it in accordance with the original terms of 
those receivables. The amount of the write-down is determined as  
the difference between the carrying amount and present value of 
estimated future cash flows. Group management exercises judgement 
in assessing the amount of any write-downs required which is based on 
current assessments of the creditworthiness of current customers. The 
auditor provided the Committee with their review of trade receivables 
and following discussion, the Committee was satisfied that the book 
value of trade receivables was consistent with our accounting policy and 
previous practice and that the resultant valuation was reasonable.
Acquisition accounting
Following the acquisition of Vedasil in February 2014, an IFRS 3 fair 
value exercise was undertaken by the Group. In addition, during the 
year the Group finalised the fair value accounting for the Truth 
acquisition which had completed on 3 July 2013 and the provisional fair 
value exercise completed at 31 December 2013.
IFRS 3 requires assets and liabilities acquired to be recorded at fair value 
and to identify intangible assets separately from goodwill, initially 
measuring each group of intangible assets at fair value. Intangible 
assets for Vedasil consisted primarily of customer relationships with  
no value being ascribed to the Vedasil brand which was abolished  
on completion of the acquisition. There is judgement involved in 
estimating fair value, particularly in relation to identifiable intangible 
assets, which requires the Directors to estimate the useful economic life 
of each asset and the future cash flows expected to arise from each 
asset and to apply a suitable discount rate. The auditor provided the 
Committee with their review of the fair value exercises and following 
discussion the Committee was satisfied that the assumptions used were 
appropriate and that the resultant fair values were reasonable. Details 
of how these fair values have been accounted for are set out in note 21 
to the Group financial statements.
Following discussions with the auditor, and the deliberations set out 
above, we were satisfied that the financial statements dealt 
appropriately with each of the areas of significant judgement. The 
auditor also reported to the Committee on any misstatements that 
they had found in the course of their work and confirmed that no 
material amounts remained unadjusted.
In accordance with the Code, we also reviewed the Annual Report and 
were able to confirm to the Board that, in our view, the Annual Report 
and Accounts, taken as a whole, was fair, balanced and understandable 
and provided the information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Group’s performance, business model and strategy.
2 External audit
Appointment of external auditor
PwC were appointed for the first time as the Group’s auditors in 2012, 
following a competitive tender process. The 2014 year end audit is the 
third full audit that PwC have conducted. The Committee is satisfied 
with PwC’s performance, independence and effectiveness and their 
fees are regularly compared with peer companies by the Committee. 
Accordingly, the Committee has recommended to the Board that PwC 
should be reappointed as the Group’s auditors at the AGM. In 
determining whether to recommend the reappointment of PwC as 
auditors without a formal tender process, the Committee took into 
account the relatively recent full tender process undertaken by the 
Group that resulted in a new external audit firm being appointed in 
2012. Given the changes in regulation and best practice that are 
continuing in this area, the Committee will keep audit firm rotation 
under regular review. There are no contractual restrictions on the  
Group with regard to PwC’s appointment.
External audit effectiveness
The effectiveness of the external audit process is dependent on 
appropriate audit risk identification at the start of the audit cycle. In 
November 2014 the Committee reviewed a detailed audit plan from 
PwC, identifying their assessment of these key risks. For the 2014 
financial year the primary risks identified were in relation to the carrying 
value of goodwill and intangibles, acquisition accounting and the 
carrying value of provisions. The Committee reviews the work 
performed by the auditors to test management’s assumptions and 
estimates around these areas and assesses the effectiveness of the 
audit process in addressing these matters when reviewing the audit 
plan prepared by PwC. 
The Committee’s review of the performance of PwC included 
consideration of the views and opinions of the Executive Directors and 
senior management on PwC’s effectiveness in a number of areas 
including independence and objectivity, audit strategy, planning and 
effective execution, conduct and communication, audit findings and 
feedback, and expertise and supporting the work of the Committee.
For the 2014 financial year, the Committee was satisfied that there had 
been appropriate focus and challenge on the primary areas of audit 
risk, assessed the quality of the audit process to be good and that the 
auditor objectivity and independence is properly safeguarded.
The Chairman of the Committee also meets with the external lead 
audit partner outside the formal committee process during the year to 
provide additional opportunity for open dialogue and feedback from 
the auditor without management being present. Matters typically 
discussed include the auditor’s assessment of business risks and 
management activity thereon, the transparency and openness of 
interactions with management, confirmation that there has been no 
restriction in scope placed on them by management, independence  
of their audit and how they have exercised professional scepticism.
The Group Audit Partner, currently Simon O’Brien, is required to rotate 
after a maximum of five years, key audit partners after a maximum of 
seven years, and all other partners and senior team members after a 
maximum of 10 years. Simon O’Brien has completed three full audits 
and the Committee discusses audit partner rotation with PwC on a 
regular basis.
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED 49
Tyman plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2014
Non-audit services
The Audit Committee reviews any non-audit services provided by the 
auditors. In accordance with best practices and FRC guidelines, the 
Company policy in relation to non-audit services is kept under regular 
review, it outlines which non-audit services are pre-approved, which 
services require prior approval of the Audit Committee and which 
services the auditor is excluded from. 
The prohibited non-audit services include bookkeeping and accounting, 
internal audit, design or implementation of financial information systems, 
payroll, actuarial, legal and recruitment services. Permitted non-audit 
services requiring pre-authorisation include due diligence, tax planning, 
advice on IT projects and advice on corporate and reporting structures. 
The Committee is satisfied that the provision of such services does not in 
any way prejudice the objectivity and independence of the auditors.
Professional firms other than the auditors also provide tax compliance 
work and tax advice. Fees for permitted non-audit services can be 
pre-authorised by the CFO for fees up to £100,000 and by the CFO, 
after consultation with the Chair of the Committee, for fees up to 
£400,000. Where fees for permitted non-audit services exceed 
£400,000 or where the aggregate of such fees in a financial year 
exceeds 100 per cent of estimated Group audit fees for that financial 
year, the Committee will review and approve these non-audit services  
in advance.
Non-audit fees and services are reported to the Committee regularly. 
During 2014 total non-audit fees paid to PwC were 23 per cent of the 
annual Group audit fee, as outlined in note 4 to the Group financial 
statements.
External audit independence
PwC, as auditor, report to the Committee on their compliance with  
the fundamental principles of objectivity, integrity and professional 
behaviour, including independence. PwC use a global independence 
system which provides real time identification of independence issues. 
They have confirmed to the Committee that they have not identified 
any threats to independence that would impact on their ability to 
perform their audit work.
The Committee reviews the policy on auditor independence and 
non-audit services annually and takes into consideration of the nature, 
scope and appropriateness of non-audit services annually supplied by 
the external auditor.
The Committee continued to be satisfied with the external auditor’s 
independence and objectivity
3 Internal audit
During 2014 a specialist team from BDO provided internal audit 
services to the Group to complete an internal audit programme, visiting 
nine operating units in the Group. The Committee reviews reports from 
BDO detailing their audit findings together with divisional management 
responses and action plans. Progress completing these action plans are 
reviewed by the Committee at every meeting. 
In November 2014, the Committee conducted the annual review of the 
effectiveness of the Group’s Internal Audit function, including its terms 
of reference, its audit plans, its general performance and its relationship 
with the external auditors. The Committee was satisfied with the overall 
effectiveness of the Internal Audit function. The internal audit 
programme for 2015 was reviewed and approved by the Committee. 
The programme is structured to ensure that every operating unit will 
have an internal audit visit at least once every three years, with the 
largest operating units being audited at least once every two years.
4 Review the effectiveness of the risk management and internal 
control systems in the Group
Risk management reports, identifying the significant risks to the Group, 
were submitted to the Committee in November 2014. These reports 
summarise submissions from all areas of the business which the Tyman 
Management Committee have reviewed. The Audit Committee 
reviewed the effectiveness of the Company’s overall risk management 
framework, including the generic procedures for risk identification, 
assessment, mitigation, monitoring and reporting.
The Board as a whole is responsible for the Group’s system of internal 
control, however, the Committee assists the Board in meeting its 
obligations in this regard. The Committee’s review of risk is driven 
primarily by the Group’s assessment of its principal risks and 
uncertainties, as set out on pages 28 and 29. The Tyman Risk 
Committee assesses the Group’s significant business risks identified at 
both operating entity and Group levels and how these are managed. 
The Chief Executive Officer in turn reports back to the Committee who 
discuss and review the work of the Tyman Risk Committee. The Tyman 
Risk Committee, whose members comprise the Tyman Management 
Committee, discuss and review the various risk registers compiled by 
each reporting segment within the Group.
In order to ensure that the Committee fulfils its role relating to the 
adequacy and effectiveness of the Group’s internal control system, the 
Committee receives reports from the internal auditors. A major element 
of the current internal audit programme is the assessment of the 
internal control system throughout the Group. The recommendations 
for improving internal controls are reviewed and the follow-on action 
plans to implement improvements are monitored on an ongoing basis 
by the Committee.
Audit Committee priorities for 2015
The priorities for the Committee for 2015 are set out below:
• Continue to review the effectiveness of the Company’s overall 
risk management framework, including the generic procedures 
for risk identification, assessment, mitigation, monitoring and 
reporting.
• Prepare for and implement any relevant regulatory changes to 
Audit Committee governance, including the Statutory Audit 
Services for Large Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory 
Use of Competitive Tender Processes and Audit Committee 
Responsibilities) Order 2014 and the EU Audit Regulation.
• Prepare and implement any relevant changes in the 2014 edition 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code, in particular disclosures in 
relation to going concern, longer term viability, risk management 
and controls.
• Continue to monitor the effectiveness of the internal audit 
function and internal controls.
Committee effectiveness
The effectiveness of the Committee is reviewed on an annual basis by 
both the Board and the Committee itself and the Committee is 
considered to continue to operate effectively and efficiently.

REMUNERATION REPORT LETTER
Dear Shareholder
It is my pleasure to present the Directors’ remuneration report for the 
year ended 31 December 2014.
Group’s remuneration policy
The Group’s remuneration policy (the “policy”) was approved at  
the AGM in 2014 where 99.8 per cent of votes cast were in support  
of the policy. A summary of the policy is set out in the Remuneration 
policy report on page 52 and the full detailed policy can be found  
on the Tyman website (http://www.tymanplc.com/media/39270/
remuneration-policy-approved-agm-160514.pdf). No changes to the 
policy are proposed for 2015.
Activities of the Remuneration Committee
The main activities of the Committee since the last report were as 
follows:
• assessed performance of Executive Directors and determined 
annual bonuses for 2014;
• established the Executive Directors’ bonus arrangements and set 
bonus targets for 2015;
• consulted with shareholders and shareholder bodies on the 
following:
 – the second phase of a two-year salary increase for Executive 
Directors;
 – the introduction of malus/clawback provisions and a further 
two-year holding period after the initial three-year vesting period 
for all future LTIP awards;
 – the retrospective disclosure of annual bonus targets;
• reviewed the malus provisions of the deferred bonus share plan with 
the Executive Directors, who have voluntarily agreed to broader 
malus provisions;
• reviewed remuneration benchmarking for Non-executive Directors 
and revised fees with effect from 1 July 2014;
• reviewed remuneration benchmarking and set 2015 base salaries 
and benefit packages for some senior executives;
• reviewed plans for new employee share plan for employees across 
the Group;
• considered remuneration market trends and corporate governance 
developments; and
• prepared the Directors’ remuneration report.
Remuneration for 2014
Details of the remuneration decisions for 2014 are set out in the 
Directors’ annual remuneration report.
As highlighted in the Chairman’s statement, Tyman saw strong trading 
in both the AmesburyTruth and ERA Divisions during the year, offset in 
part by continued difficult market conditions in the Schlegel 
International European businesses. 
Despite adverse exchange rate movements during the year, the  
Group delivered a strong underlying profit before taxation (“PBTA”) 
performance in 2014 of £41.6 million. This was ahead of the threshold 
target of £37.9 million but just below the Meets target level of £42.1 
million, resulting in 44.3 per cent of the bonus relating to underlying 
PBTA becoming payable.
Despite significant investment in the balance sheet, the Group’s 
leverage decreased further in the year to 1.56x, at the bottom end  
of the target range of 1.5x to 2.0x net debt: underlying EBITDA. The 
requirements of our stock build programme, responding to short  
term shifts in demand, necessitated increased investment in working  
capital at 31 December 2014 such that the cash flow target of  
£33.1 million achieved in 2014 was slightly below the threshold target  
of £33.3 million, resulting in no bonus relating to operational cash flow. 
Overall, this resulted in the Executive Directors receiving a bonus equal 
to 31.0 per cent of 2014 salary for the year (2013: 89.6 per cent), of 
which 50 per cent will be deferred until March 2018 under the rules of 
the Deferred Share Bonus Plan.
The Committee has noted carefully institutional shareholder  
feedback around retrospective disclosure of annual bonus targets. The 
Committee has decided to disclose annual bonus targets once they are 
no longer considered by the Board to be commercially sensitive. The 
Remuneration implementation report now contains full details of the 
targets set for the 2014 bonus.
The announcement of the Group’s results for the year ended  
31 December 2014 was the trigger event for the vesting of the 2012 
LTIP awards. Cumulative EPS over the three-year period for the 2012 
awards was 43.81 pence against a performance range (Target to 
Stretch) of 32.39 to 44.75 pence. The Remuneration Committee is 
satisfied that this underlying EPS performance is a genuine reflection  
of the underlying performance of the Company over the performance 
period, having regard to the Company’s total shareholder return 
performance during that time. Therefore, 94.28 per cent of the 2012 
awards will vest.
To strengthen alignment with shareholders, the Committee extended 
the time horizon of 2014 LTIP awards, and all future LTIP awards, 
granted to Executive Directors through the introduction of a two-year 
holding period on vesting LTIP shares (net of tax). This means that the 
2014 LTIP awards must be retained until at least March 2019.
Key remuneration decisions for 2015
As described in the 2013 Remuneration report, following consultation 
with major shareholders holding c.50 per cent of share capital in 
January 2014, the Committee decided to phase-in Executive Director 
salary increases closer to median over a two-year period, subject  
to an annual review of each Executive’s performance and Company 
performance. In line with these discussions, and following the 
conclusion of the annual review of each Executive’s performance and 
Company performance, the Committee set the CEO’s base salary at 
£387,000 per annum (c. 16 per cent increase) and the CFO’s base salary 
at £237,000 per annum (c. 5 per cent increase) from 1 January 2015. 
Further background details to this decision are contained in the 
Remuneration implementation report.
For deferred bonus shares granted in 2014 or earlier, malus provisions 
apply during the deferral period in the exceptional circumstance of 
gross misconduct. 51
Tyman plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2014
During the year, the Committee considered carefully whether the 
circumstances were sufficient in light of market practice and best 
practice and intends to extend these for future awards to include the 
exceptional circumstances of a material misstatement, gross 
misconduct, or a material misjudgement of the performance of the 
Company. Whilst not explicitly provided for in the remuneration policy, 
the Executive Directors have voluntarily signed-up to these broader 
malus provisions. The Committee has disclosed these provisions in the 
implementation section of the remuneration report which is subject to 
an advisory vote at the AGM. The Committee also intends to include 
these provisions in a revised remuneration policy at the next formal 
approval of policy (which will occur not later than the 2017 AGM).
New employee share plans
The Board believes that it is important to encourage all employees to 
participate in the future growth and development of the Group and to 
take an active interest in the performance of the Company as a whole. In 
particular we want to allow employees to have the opportunity over time 
to build an equity holding in Tyman. With this in mind at the AGM, we are 
seeking shareholder approval for two broadly-based contributory share 
plans – a UK Sharesave Plan and a separate plan on similar principles for 
US employees. It is intended that each of these will offer the potential for 
favourable tax treatment in accordance with applicable local legislation. 
We are also seeking authority to extend plans into other jurisdictions, on a 
similar basis, with appropriate variations.
Shareholders will be asked to approve these proposals at the 
forthcoming AGM in May 2015 and further details are contained in the 
Notice of Meeting.
Remuneration disclosure
This report complies with the requirements of the Large and Medium-
sized Companies and Groups Regulations 2008 as amended in 2013, 
the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code (September 2012) 
and the Listing Rules.
The report contains two sections:
• The Directors’ remuneration policy report (pages 52 to 56). This 
section contains summary details of the remuneration policy that 
was approved at the 2014 AGM; and
• The Directors’ annual remuneration implementation report. This 
section sets out details of how our remuneration policy was 
implemented for the year ended 31 December 2014 and how we 
intend the policy to apply for the year ended 31 December 2015.
At the AGM in May 2015 the Directors’ annual remuneration report will 
be put to an advisory shareholder vote.
The Committee believes that Executive remuneration arrangements  
are structured to support the delivery of our strategic priorities. We  
will continue to keep the structure of remuneration arrangements  
under review.
Upon my retirement from the Board after the AGM in May, I will be 
delighted to hand over the Chairmanship of the Remuneration 
Committee to Mark Rollins, who will be joining the Board as a Non-
executive Director on 1 April 2015.

REMUNERATION POLICY REPORT
Introduction
The Group’s policy is to provide remuneration that reflects the contribution of senior Executives to the business, the performance of the Group, the 
size and complexity of the Group’s operations and the need to attract, retain, and incentivise Executives of the highest quality.
The Committee seeks to provide remuneration packages which are straightforward and easily comprehensible and which align the interests of the 
Directors with those of the shareholders. The general principles underpinning the Group’s remuneration policy are that the policy should support 
and incentivise the delivery of the Group’s strategy while providing an appropriate balance between fixed and variable rewards.
This policy statement was submitted and approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held on 16 May 2014 and took effect from the 
conclusion of the 2014 AGM and remains in effect until the 2017 Annual General Meeting, or earlier if amended by the shareholders. The policy has 
remained unchanged from the policy approved at the 2014 AGM. 
The full remuneration policy is published on the Tyman website (http://www.tymanplc.com/media/39270/remuneration-policy-approved-
agm-160514.pdf). A summary of the key components of the remuneration policy and associated arrangements for Board members are

on cumulative underlying EPS measured over a three-year period, with a discretionary underpin. Typically, 25 per cent 
vests for threshold performance (zero per cent below threshold) increasing pro rata to 100 per cent vesting for stretch 
performance. From 2014 new LTIP awards to be retained for two years after vesting, thereby making a five-year holding 
period for an LTIP award from date of grant to permitted disposal. 
Executive Directors’ remuneration policy
Purpose and link to strategy Operation and opportunity
Base salary
To pay Executive Directors at a level commensurate with 
their contribution to the Company and appropriately 
based on skill, experience and performance achieved.
The level of salary paid is considered appropriate for 
motivation and retention of the calibre of executive 
required to ensure the successful formation and delivery 
of the Group’s strategy and management of its business 
in the international environment in which it operates.
Salaries are reviewed annually by the Committee. In normal circumstances, annual 
increases in salary will be limited to the general annual salary increase received by 
Group employees in the relevant Director’s country of residence.
The Committee may consider it appropriate and necessary to award larger increases, 
for example, in circumstances where the nature or complexity of the Group has 
increased materially or if an individual assumes significantly more responsibility. If 
there were a material change in business size or complexity (up or down), then this 
would be reflected in the market comparability.
Benefits
To provide a range of market competitive benefits to 
encourage retention and which enable an Executive 
Director to perform his or her duties.
Eligible for a range of benefits that may include:
• life assurance cover;
• critical illness cover;
• private medical and dental cover;
• car allowances; and 
• professional tax and financial advice.
Pension
To provide a market-competitive benefit for retirement 
which rewards sustained contribution and encourages 
retention.
The maximum opportunity, either by way of a contribution to a Group pension 
arrangement or payment of a cash salary supplement, is 20 per cent of base salary. 53
Tyman plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2014
Purpose and link to strategy Operation and opportunity
Annual bonus
To reward achievement of annual financial goals 
consistent with the strategic direction of the business.
The maximum annual bonus opportunity is 100 per cent of salary.
In normal circumstances, the Committee would expect to set annual bonus targets 
100 per cent dependent on the achievement of defined financial performance 
targets.
Any bonus payable under the annual bonus scheme is paid 50 per cent in cash and  
50 per cent in shares deferred for three years under the Deferred Share Bonus Plan 
(“DSBP”) and is not pensionable.
Long term incentive plans
To align interests of senior executives and those of 
shareholders in developing the long term growth of the 
business and execution and delivery of the Group’s 
strategy. To facilitate share ownership by Executive 
Directors and other senior management to provide 
further alignment with shareholders.
Awards are determined by the Committee at its discretion, with a maximum annual 
performance share award under the current plan of 100 per cent of salary or 150 per 
cent of salary in exceptional circumstances. 
Awards are subject to the Company meeting underlying EPS targets over three 
financial years, starting with the financial year in which the grant takes place. A 
percentage of the award, typically 25 per cent, vests for threshold performance  
(0 per cent below threshold) increasing pro rata to 100 per cent vesting for stretch 
performance.
More recent LTIP awards have incorporated a discretionary TSR underpin and the 
Committee has introduced a two year holding period from the date of vesting. This 
will make the aggregate holding period for an LTIP award five years from date of 
grant to permitted disposal.
Minimum shareholding requirement
To require Executive Directors to retain a minimum 
shareholding in the Company to ensure alignment with 
shareholders’ interests as a whole.
Expected to retain a minimum shareholding equivalent to 100 per cent of basic salary.
Remuneration outcomes in different performance scenarios
The charts below set out an illustration of the remuneration policy for 2015. The charts provide an illustration of the proportion of total 
remuneration made up of each component of the remuneration policy and the value of each component.
Three scenarios have been illustrated for each Executive Director:
 
Below threshold performance • Fixed remuneration
• No annual bonus payout
• No vesting of LTIP awards
Meets performance • Fixed remuneration
• 50 per cent annual bonus payout 
• 25 per cent of LTIP awards vest
Stretch performance • Fixed remuneration 
• 100 per cent annual bonus payout 
• 100 per cent of LTIP awards vest
Strategic report
Corporate  
governance report Financial statements 54
The fixed pay element is based on the following elements:
• Base salary is the base salary effective for the year ended 31 December 2015, as set out on page 52.
• Benefits are the value of benefits paid in the year ended 31 December 2014, as set out on the table of Directors’ remuneration on page 57 .
• Cash contribution in lieu of pension effective for the year ended 31 December 2015, which is 20 per cent of base salary for the CEO and 15 per 
cent of base salary for the CFO.
Actual pay delivered will be further influenced by share price appreciation and dividends, which the scenarios below do not take into account:

Fees
Attract and retain high calibre Non-executive Directors. Fees are reviewed annually. Additional fees may be paid to Chairmen of Board 
Committees and to the Senior Independent Director. No eligibility to receive bonuses, 
retirement benefits or to participate in the Group’s long term incentive plans or 
employee share plans.
REMUNERATION POLICY REPORT CONTINUED 55
Tyman plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2014
Non-executive Directors’ letters of appointment
The Chairman and Non-executive Directors do not have service 
agreements but the terms of their appointment, including the time 
commitment expected, are recorded in letters of appointment.
Non-executive Directors are employed for terms of three years’ 
duration, terminable on a month’s notice by the Company or the 
Director. All Non-executive Directors are required to undertake that  
they will submit themselves for re-election at each Annual General 
Meeting occurring during their term of office and no Non-executive 
Director will serve more than three terms of three years without prior 
shareholder approval.
Non-executive Directors’ shareholding guidelines
Non-executive Directors do not have a minimum shareholding 
requirement, however they are expected to acquire and retain a 
shareholding in the Group for the duration of their appointment.
Other policies
Recruitment of Non-executive Directors
Non-executive Directors who are recruited to the Board will be 
employed on a letter of appointment of three years’ duration, 
terminable on a month’s notice by the Company or the Director.
The remuneration for Non-executive Directors consists of annual fees 
for their services as members of the Board and, where relevant, for their 
work on selected committees. New Non-executive Directors recruited  
to the Board will be paid the same rates and be subject to the same 
provisions concerning annual re-election and shareholdings as the then 
current Non-executive Directors.
Recruitment of Executive Directors
The Committee’s general policy on recruitment remuneration is that 
new Executive Directors should be offered a contract on similar terms to 
the existing Executive Directors.
In exceptional and unforeseen circumstances it may prove necessary 
for the Committee to exercise discretion and offer a variable pay 
opportunity (excluding buyouts) in the first year of employment to a 
new Executive Director that contains elements of variable remuneration 
which are in excess of the normal maxima stated in the policy table, 
however, the overall total variable pay opportunity on recruitment 
(excluding buyouts) would remain within the overall limit on variable 
pay of 250 per cent of base salary.
For a new CEO or CFO, their annual bonus framework and LTIP awards 
will normally be no more than those available to the current CEO or 
CFO, as applicable, at the date of recruitment. The Committee may 
agree that the Company will meet certain relocation and associated 
expenses of a new Executive Director, subject to circumstances.
In circumstances where individuals are promoted to the Board from 
within the Group, the terms and conditions of their existing share  
grants or awards will not normally be amended, however any new 
grants or awards would be subject to the same framework as the  
other Executive Directors.
In certain circumstances, and in order to secure the services of an 
outstanding candidate, it may be necessary to make an award to a new 
Executive Director to “buyout” unvested performance plan share or 
cash awards forfeited on leaving their previous employment. Any such 
reimbursement would be subject to independent confirmation of the 
existence, forfeiture on departure and probability of these historic 
awards vesting had the new Executive Director remained in post. In 
doing so, the Committee will seek to do no more than match the fair 
value of the awards forfeited, taking account of performance conditions 
attached to these awards, the likelihood of those conditions being met 
and the proportion of the vesting period remaining.
Any such reimbursement would be made in cash or in shares in Tyman 
plc, and may be subject to performance conditions attached to Tyman.
No incentives were paid in connection with the recruitment of  
Mr Eperjesi or for the promotion of Mr Brotherton to their respective 
roles, both of which occurred in 2010.
Exit payment policy for Executive Directors
The service agreements of the Executive Directors entitle them on 
termination of their contract by Tyman to payment equal to salary and 
the value of benefits, pension benefits (including life cover), health 
cover, dental cover and car allowance (but not annual bonus or grants 
under long term incentive plans) until the earlier of 12 months from 
notice of termination or the Director obtaining full time employment, 
with an obligation on the part of the Director to mitigate.
Payments will normally be made monthly, although the Committee 
retains discretion to agree settlement terms, which may include a bonus 
in respect of the period worked by the Executive Director up until the 
date of termination.
Executive Directors who are categorised as “Good Leavers” by the 
Committee will generally be eligible to receive historic awards under the 
LTIP and DSBP (the “Executive Share Plans”) as they vest in future years. 
Awards that vest under the LTIP post-employment may be pro-rated to 
reflect the fact that the Executive Director was not employed for the 
entire period under measurement. For LTIP awards made after the 2014 
AGM, the Committee retains discretion to waive the extended holding 
period requirement for Good Leavers depending on circumstances.
In the event that an Executive Director is dismissed for reasons 
constituting gross misconduct, no unvested awards under Executive 
Share Plans may vest and the Committee retains no discretion in this 
regard.
Policy on external appointments
Executive Directors are allowed to accept external appointments as  
a Non-executive Director of one other company, subject to Board 
approval, provided that these are not with competing companies and 
are not likely to lead to conflicts of interest. Executive Directors would 
normally be allowed to retain the fees paid from these appointments. 
Executive Directors may not serve as the Non-executive Chairman of 
another quoted company.
As at 10 March 2015, neither Louis Eperjesi nor James Brotherton held 
any external directorships.
Strategic report
Corporate  
governance report Financial statements 56
Other share plans
The Executive Directors may participate in any all-employee share plans 
on the same basis as other employees in their country of residence.
Consultation with employees
Although the Committee does not consult directly with employees on 
the Directors’ remuneration policy, the Committee does consider the 
general basic salary increase, remuneration arrangements and 
employment conditions for the broader employee population when 
determining remuneration policy for the Executive Directors.
Consultation with shareholders and shareholder bodies
The Committee is committed to regular engagement with shareholders 
and shareholder bodies and enters into extensive consultations in 
advance of implementing any material changes to the Executive 
Directors’ remuneration, as well as on the measures, duration and 
targets for each of the annual grants under the LTIP.
All Committee members attend the Annual General Meeting and may 
also be contacted through the Group’s Registered Office to answer any 
questions shareholders or shareholder bodies may have in relation to 
the Group’s remuneration policy.
Dilution
The general principle that the Group operates is that the vesting of 
share awards under Executive and Employee Share Plans should be 
satisfied either by the issue of shares out of treasury or, subject to 
Trustee consent, through the issue of shares acquired on the market by 
the Tyman Employee Benefit Trust.
Certain jurisdictions require that new shares are issued to employees to 
settle vesting under share arrangements. Where new shares are issued 
in these circumstances it is the Group’s intention to match the new 
shares issued with an equal purchase of shares on the market either 
into treasury or into the Tyman Employee Benefit Trust.

Additional disclosures for single figure total remuneration table
Base salary
As explained in the Chairman’s remuneration report letter in the 2013 
Annual Report, following consultation with major shareholders, the 
Committee decided to phase-in salary increases to close the substantial 
gap from median levels in the market over two years, subject to an 
annual review of each Executive’s performance and Company 
performance. The Committee carried out a rigorous review of both 
individual and Company performance and completed a further 
consultation with major shareholders in 2014. In its review, the 
Committee took into account factors including that the integration of 
AmesburyTruth has progressed well, with a strengthened leadership 
team now installed in the North American business and the combined 
North American business on track to deliver synergy benefits of at  
least US$5 million in 2014 and US$8 million in 2015, some 60 per cent 
ahead of the Group’s original expectations. ERA has continued to make  
good progress in 2014, gaining market share and improving net 
margins; further restructuring and investment has taken place in 
Schlegel International to position Schlegel for growth as and when 
markets return.
The Committee increased the CEO’s base salary by 25 per cent to 
£334,000 per annum and the CFO’s base salary by 11 per cent to 
£226,000 per annum from 1 January 2014. This was in excess of the 
general level of salary increases of 2.5 per cent in the Group’s UK 
businesses.
Annual cash bonus
The annual cash bonus for Executive Directors decreased by 59 per 
cent, and reflects the under performance in Schlegel in the year and the 
increased investment in working capital at the end of 2014. This was a 
more significant decrease than the 15 per cent decrease in the average 
UK senior management bonus entitlement in the year which is 
considered by the Committee to be the most relevant comparator 
group for bonus purposes.
Non cash benefits
The benefits provided to the Executive Directors included private 
medical insurance, permanent health insurance, and life assurance.  
The Executive Directors are not members of any of the Group pension 
schemes. There were no changes to the benefits policies or levels during 
the year.
REMUNERATION IMPLEMENTATION REPORT CONTINUED
Cash payments in lieu of pension
As explained in the Chairman’s remuneration report letter in the 2013 
Annual Report, the Committee also increased the cash pension 
allowance for the CFO from c. 5 per cent of salary to 15 per cent of 
salary (the CEO’s cash pension allowance remains 20 per cent of salary). 
In 2014, Louis Eperjesi was paid £67,000 (2013: £54,000) and James 
Brotherton was paid £34,000 (2013: £10,000) as a salary supplement 
in lieu of pension. These amounts were non-bonusable.
Performance related remuneration
Annual bonus
For 2014 the annual bonus scheme for Executive Directors was based 
70 per cent on underlying PBTA targets and 30 per cent on free cash 
flow. 50 per cent of Executive Director bonuses are delivered in the form 
of nil cost options under the Deferred Share Bonus Plan, to strengthen 
alignment with shareholders’ interests. These awards will normally vest 
(together with dividend equivalents in cash or shares) after three years 
and are not subject to any performance conditions. Other senior 
employees are also required to defer a proportion of their bonuses 
pursuant to the Deferred Share Bonus Plan.
2014 bonus outcome
As highlighted in the Chairman’s statement, Tyman saw strong trading 
in both the AmesburyTruth and ERA Divisions during the year, offset in 
part by continued difficult market conditions in the Schlegel 
International European businesses. Despite adverse exchange rate 
movements during the year, the Group delivered a strong PBTA 
performance in 2014 to achieve PBTA of £41.6 million for 2014. This 
was ahead of the threshold target of £37.9 million but just below the 
Meets target level of £42.1 million, resulting in 44.3 per cent of the 
bonus relating to PBTA becoming payable.
Despite significant investment in the balance sheet, the Group’s 
leverage decreased further in the year to 1.56x, at the bottom end of 
the target range of 1.5x to 2.0x net debt: underlying EBITDA. The 
requirements of our stock build programme, responding to short  
term shifts in demand, necessitated increased investment in working 
capital at 31 December 2014 such that the operational cash flow of 
£33.1 million achieved in 2014 was slightly below the threshold target  
of £33.3 million, resulting in no bonus relating to operational cash flow. 
Overall, this resulted in the Executive Directors receiving a bonus equal 
to 31.0 per cent of 2014 salary for the year (2013: 89.6 per cent), of 
which 50 per cent will be deferred until March 2018 under the rules of 
the Deferred Share Bonus Plan.
The actual target ranges for the two bonus components are set  
out below:

Tyman plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2014
The current remuneration policy provides that for deferred bonus 
shares, malus provisions apply during the deferral period in the 
exceptional circumstance of gross misconduct. However the Executive 
Directors have voluntarily agreed to be bound by broader malus 
provisions covering the exceptional circumstances of a material 
misstatement, gross misconduct, or a material misjudgement of the 
performance of the Company.
LTIP awards vesting
As the acquisition of Truth completed at an early point in the 2012 LTIP 
cycle (c. 1.5 years into the three-year performance period ending in 
December 2014), the Committee felt it was important for the incentive 
to capture the Group’s overall performance over the remainder of the 
performance period (rather than ringfence the effects of the 
acquisition). In light of this, as reported in the 2013 Remuneration 
report, the Committee decided to:
• make no adjustment to the existing EPS targets (25 per cent vesting 
at 33 pence up to 100 per cent vesting at 45.6 pence) for the Truth 
acquisition; but,
• restate the existing EPS targets for the capital raising completed as 
part of the Truth acquisition, based on the standard theoretical 
ex-offer price adjustment factor (c. 0.98).
The announcement of the Group’s results for the year ended  
31 December 2014 was the trigger event for the vesting of the 2012 
LTIP awards, which were made in July 2012. The awards covered the 
performance period from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2014. 
Awards were dependent on the cumulative underlying basic EPS from 
continuing operations for the three years measured against a defined 
target range.
The underlying basic EPS achieved over the three-year performance 
period ending in December 2014 is set out below.
 
Performance year
Earnings per 
share
2012 11.49p
2013 13.71p
2014 18.61p
Underlying cumulative EPS 43.81p
The percentage of awards vesting for the 2012 awards are set out 
below:
Award Range Achievement
% of award 
to vest
2012 awards 32.99 – 44.75p

43.81p 94.28%
1 As stated in the Remuneration implementation report in the 2013 Annual Report, 
following the acquisition of Truth in July 2013, the original EPS targets were restated for 
the capital raising, as this was at a discount to the prevailing market price, based on the 
standard theoretical ex-offer price adjustment factor (c.0.98).
The Remuneration Committee has satisfied itself that the recorded 
underlying cumulative EPS is a genuine reflection of the underlying 
business performance of the Group over the performance period, having 
regard to the Company’s total shareholder return performance during 
that time, and accordingly has approved the vesting of the 2012 awards 
at the calculated percentage of 94.28 per cent. As a result a total of 
1,065,719 awards, excluding dividend shares, vested in March 2015.
The number of awards that have vested for the Executive Directors and 
the senior managers, excluding dividend shares where eligible, is as 
follows:

Directors
Senior 
managers Total
2012 awards, excluding 
dividend shares 341,154 724,565 1,065,719

2012 award dividend shares 42 89 131
Awards will be satisfied in accordance with Group policy through the 
issuance of shares from the Tyman Employee Benefit Trust, shares out 
of Group treasury and new shares.
LTIP awards granted in 2014
On 26 June 2014 the Remuneration Committee granted nil or nominal 
cost options over 630,420 ordinary shares in the Company to around 23 
senior managers, executives and Executive Directors (“2014 Awards”). 
Vesting of the 2014 awards is based on the Company’s three year 
cumulative underlying EPS for the financial years 2014 to 2016.
If, over the three financial years 2014 to 2016, cumulative underlying 
EPS is less than 61 pence, no 2014 awards will vest; 25 per cent of 2014 
awards will vest for cumulative underlying EPS of 61 pence, rising on a 
straight-line basis to full vesting for cumulative underlying EPS of 68 
pence or higher. To strengthen alignment with shareholders, the 
Committee extended the time horizon of 2014 awards through the 
introduction of a two-year holding period on vested LTIP shares (net of 
tax). Malus/clawback provisions apply during the LTIP vesting and 
holding periods, in the exceptional circumstances of a material 
misstatement, gross misconduct, or a material misjudgement of the 
performance of the Company.
In addition, if and to the extent that it considers the recorded EPS is not 
a genuine reflection of the underlying business performance of the 
Company over the EPS performance period, the Committee may reduce 
the number of Vested Award Shares accordingly (the “Financial 
Underpin”).
In applying this Financial Underpin, the Committee shall (without 
limitation) have regard to:
• Tyman’s TSR relative to the FTSE All-Share Index and the TSR of the 
median company in a list of comparator companies, in order of their 
TSR performance over the three calendar years 2014, 2015 and 
2016, using such methodology for TSR calculations as the 
Committee shall consider appropriate; and

2014 LTIP award to CFO
In light of potential changes within the US Finance team following the 
Truth acquisition, whilst also recruiting a new UK FD, the Committee felt 
that retaining the Group CFO was critical. In these special 
circumstances, the Committee decided to increase the 2014 LTIP award 
to the Group CFO from 100 per cent to 110 per cent of salary. The 
Remuneration policy approved at the 2014 AGM, allows the Committee 
to determine LTIP awards at its discretion, with a maximum annual 
performance share award of 100 per cent of salary or 150 per cent of 
salary in exceptional circumstances. The Committee intends to revert to 
the normal LTIP grant size of 100 per cent of salary for 2015.
Dilution limit
Generally, it is the intention that LTIP awards will be satisfied through 
the transfer of existing shares by the Company’s Employees’ Benefit 
Trust unless the Remuneration Committee, in its discretion, feels that a 
new issue of shares would be more appropriate. In the event that LTIP 
awards are satisfied through new issue shares, the Company will 
operate within the Investment Association (“IA”) guideline dilution limit 
of 10 per cent in 10 years for all share-based incentive schemes. 
The Remuneration Committee has the flexibility to operate outside the 
IA guideline of 5 per cent in 10 years dilution limit for discretionary 
share-based incentive schemes to accommodate LTIP awards for a 
broader employee population. In managing dilution, the Company will 
nevertheless be mindful of the 5 per cent in 10 years guideline and will 
be prudent in managing the flow rates, keeping shareholders informed 
of actual and anticipated dilution levels over time. The majority of the 
2012, 2013 and 2014 LTIP awards are likely to be satisfied through the 
transfer of existing shares rather than the issue of new shares.
Assuming that all performance targets are met in full, the 
Remuneration Committee currently envisages that a maximum of 
688,566 of the 2,590,109 shares subject to all the Awards outstanding 
(approximately 27 per cent) will be satisfied through new issue shares to 
ensure that local trusts, tax and securities laws are complied with in 
certain overseas jurisdiction.
As at 31 December 2014, shares equivalent to 1.7 per cent of the 
Group’s issued share capital (excluding treasury shares) would be 
required to settle all outstanding awards under Employee and Executive 
Share Plans, assuming maximum vesting.
Tyman Employee Benefit Trust
The EBT held 1,596,794 Tyman ordinary shares at 31 December 2014.

1 The comparative value of the LTIP awards for 2013 have been trued-up using the actual exercise share prices. Consequently both the single figure of remuneration and the LTIP awards 
figure for 2013 are different to the values shown in the 2013 Remuneration report.
“n/a” = not applicable – individual was not employed as CEO of the Group in the year in question.
“n/e”= not eligible – individual was employed during the year but was not eligible to participate in the bonus or LTIP scheme as appropriate that year.

Statement of implementation of remuneration policy for the year 
ending 31 December 2015
Basic salary
As explained in the remuneration report in the 2013 Annual Report, 
following consultation with major shareholders, the Committee decided 
to phase-in salary increases to close the substantial gap from median 
levels in the market over two years, subject to an annual review of each 
Executive’s performance and Company performance. Following the 
completion of this performance review and further consultation with 
major shareholders, the Committee completed the second phase of  
the agreed plan and increased the CEO’s base salary by 16 per cent to 
£387,000 per annum and the CFO’s base salary by 5 per cent to 
£237,000 per annum from 1 January 2015.
Pension and benefits
The pension allowance for the CEO remains at 20 per cent of salary and 
for the CFO at 15 per cent of salary for 2015.
Annual bonus
The maximum opportunity for the two Executive Directors under the 
annual bonus plan is 100 per cent of basic salary. The performance 
measures for 2015 remain 70 per cent profitability (PBTA) and 30 per 
cent free cash flow. It is expected that targets for the 2015 annual 
bonus plans will be disclosed in the 2015 Annual Report provided they 
are not deemed to be commercially sensitive at that time.
LTIP awards
The maximum opportunity for the two Executive Directors under the LTIP 
is 100 per cent, or 150 per cent in exceptional circumstances, and further 
awards are expected to be made in 2015. The measurement period for 
the 2015 awards will be from 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2017 .
2015 Awards are expected to vest (to the extent that the performance 
conditions have been satisfied) in March 2018, however in line with the 
Group’s policy on vesting of LTIPs, Executive Directors will ordinarily be 
required to hold all vested awards under the 2015 Awards for a further 
two years until March 2020.
Proposed 2015 LTIP awards performance measures
As in previous years, the Committee intends to discuss the awards, the 
proposed performance measures and targets with major shareholders  
and shareholder bodies prior to finalising awards. The Committee will 
report back on the final position for the 2015 awards in its 2015 
Remuneration implementation report.

Share Plan, if approved and implemented.

Responsibilities
Role of the Nominations Committee
The key responsibilities of the Committee are as follows:
• Review and make recommendations to the Board on the 
structure, size and composition of the Board.
• Succession planning for Directors and other senior managers.
• Evaluate the balance of skills, diversity, knowledge and 
experience of the Board.
• Prepare a description of the role and capabilities required for a 
particular appointment and lead the recruitment process.
• Identify and nominate for the approval of the Board, candidates 
to fill Board and senior management vacancies as and when 
they arise.
• Review the time required from Non-executive Directors and 
evaluate the membership and performance of the Board and its 
committees.
• Recommend the re-appointment of Non-executive Directors and 
re-election of Directors.
Activities of the Committee during 2014
The following matters were considered by the Committee during 2014:
• Evaluated the balance of skills, diversity, knowledge and experience 
of the Board and recommended a recruitment plan to the Board.
• Recommended the appointment of Kirsten English and Mark Rollins 
as Non-executive Directors. Korn Ferry, the external search firm, 
which has no connection to the Company, worked with the 
Chairman to devise a long list of candidates. A short list was then 
compiled and the Committee together with the Executive Directors 
met with these candidates and was able to formulate its 
recommendation to the Board.
• Reviewed the succession planning for the Board and recommended 
to the Board that Mark Rollins should succeed Les Tench as 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee after the next AGM, 
when Les Tench will retire from the Board.
Diversity of the Board
The aim of the Committee is to ensure that the Board is well balanced 
and appropriate for the needs of the business and the achievement of 
its strategy, comprising Directors who are appropriately experienced 
and are independent of character and judgement. Before 
recommending new candidates to the Board, the Nominations 
Committee takes account of the balance of skills, knowledge, 
experience and diversity of psychological type, background and gender. 
However, all Board appointments will always be made on merit. 
Committee effectiveness
The effectiveness of the Committee is reviewed on an annual basis by 
both the Board and the Committee itself and the Committee is 
considered to continue to operate effectively and efficiently.

Results and dividends
The total Group profit for the year after taxation amounted to 
£9,331,000 (2013: £956,000).
The Board is recommending a final dividend of 6.00 pence per ordinary 
share (2013: 4.50 pence) to be paid on 20 May 2015, subject to approval 
at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) of the Company on 
15 May 2015, to shareholders on the register on 24 April 2015. The 
ex-dividend date will be 23 April 2015. This, together with the interim 
dividend of 2.00 pence per share paid in September 2014 brings the total 
dividends for 2014 to 8.00 pence per ordinary share (2013: 6.00 pence).
Directors

governance report on pages 42 to 45. Details of the Directors’ 
remuneration, notice periods under their service contracts or terms of 
appointment and their interests in the share capital of the Company 
are shown in the Remuneration implementation report on pages 57  
to 64. The service contracts for Executive Directors and terms of 
appointment for Non-executive Directors are available for inspection  
at the Company’s registered office and at the AGM.
Re-election of Directors
In accordance with best practice under the UK Corporate Governance 
Code, each Director will stand for re-election at each AGM. Accordingly, 
Mr Pike, Mr Eperjesi, Mr Brotherton, Dr Westerwelle and Mr Towers will 
offer themselves for re-election at the 2015 AGM. Mr Tench, who has 
served as a Non-executive Director and Chairman of the Group’s 
Remuneration Committee since December 2009, has indicated to the 
Board his wish to retire and will stand down as a Director following the 
AGM. Following their appointment on 1 April 2015, Kirsten English and 
Mark Rollins will retire and seek election at the 2015 AGM.
Share capital
The Company’s shares are listed in the premium segment of the Official 
List and are traded on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange. 
The Company had 170,104,385 ordinary shares of 5 pence each in issue 
at 31 December 2014. Full details of the Company’s issued share 
capital, including the rights, obligations and restrictions attaching to the 
shares, are set out in note 22 to the financial statements.
Financing
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits, 
equity and borrowings. The Group does not trade in financial instruments.
On 10 June 2014 the Group entered into an enlarged new banking 
facility (the “New Facility”) of up to £240 million with six relationship 
banks, comprising a £180 million committed revolving credit facility  
and a uncommitted £60 million accordion facility. The New Facility is 
unsecured and is repayable in June 2019. It offers the Group improved 
pricing, increased flexibility, and relaxation or removal of certain 
covenants. On completion of the New Facility, the September 2011 
facility was repaid in full and cancelled.  67
Tyman plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2014
On 21 November 2014 the Company completed the issuance of a 
debut private debt placement with US financial institutions totalling 
US$100 million. The debt placement comprises US$55 million debt with 
a seven year maturity at a coupon of 4.97 per cent and US$45 million 
with a 10 year maturity at a coupon of 5.37 per cent. The debt 
placement diversifies the Group’s sources of debt finance and extends 
the tenor of its overall facilities. Subsequently the Group repaid and 
cancelled the US$100 million acquisition facility put in place in order to 
acquire Truth in June 2013.
Full details of the Group’s borrowing facilities are set out in note 16 to 
the financial statements.
The main risks arising from the Group’s borrowings are market risk, 
interest rate risk, liquidity risk, foreign currency risk and credit risk. The 
Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and 
the policies, which have been applied throughout the year, are set out in 
note 18 to the financial statements.
Acquisition
On 26 February 2014, the Group acquired 100 per cent of the issued 
share capital of Vedasil Brasil (“Vedasil”), the market leader in the 
manufacture and supply of pile weatherseals in Brazil, for a net cash 
consideration of £6.5 million. Vedasil manufactures and supplies 
polypropylene extruded seals under the Eco-PDM brand and other seal 
and screen components to the Brazilian door and window market. Full 
details of the Vedasil acquisition are set out in note 21.2 to the financial 
statements. 
Purchase of the Company’s own shares
A resolution concerning the purchase of the Company’s own shares was 
approved at the AGM on 16 May 2014. The Directors believe that the 
Company should continue to have an authority to purchase shares of 
the Company. They will therefore propose a special resolution, in 
accordance with best practice, at the forthcoming AGM to obtain 
authority to make market purchases up to the date of the AGM in 2016. 
The authority will be limited to 14.99 per cent of voting shares in issue 
(that is, excluding shares held in Treasury).
Allotment of shares
The Companies Act 2006 (“the Act”) provides that the Directors may 
not allot ordinary shares unless authorised to do so by the Company in 
general meeting or by its Articles. At the forthcoming AGM the Directors 
will seek renewal, for a further period expiring at the earlier of the close 
of the next AGM or 15 August 2016, of the authority previously granted 
to the Directors at last year’s AGM held on 16 May 2014.
The Act gives holders of ordinary shares, with limited but important 
exceptions, certain rights of pre-emption on the issue for cash of new 
equity securities. The Directors believe that it is in the best interests of 
the Company that, as in previous years, the Board should have limited 
authority to allot some shares for cash without first having to offer such 
shares to existing shareholders. The Directors’ current authority expires 
at the close of the forthcoming AGM and, accordingly, will seek to renew 
this authority on similar terms for a further period, expiring at the earlier 
of the close of the next Annual General Meeting or 15 August 2016.

intends to use its website as its default method of publication to  
provide documentation and communications to shareholders 
(“E-communication”), except to those shareholders who elect to  
receive hard (printed paper) copies by post. E-communication allows 
shareholders faster access to important information about the 
Company. In line with good environmental policies the Board believes 
that it is not in the Company’s or the shareholders’ best interests to 
incur the costs or create the adverse environmental impact of 
unnecessarily printing and distributing hard copies of these documents.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF TYMAN PLC
Report on the Group financial statements
Our opinion
In our opinion, Tyman plc’s Group financial statements (the “financial statements”):
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2014 and of its profit and cash flows for the year then ended;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the European Union; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
What we have audited
Tyman plc’s financial statements comprise:
• the Consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2014;
• the Consolidated income statement and Consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year then ended;
• the Consolidated cash flow statement for the year then ended;
• the Consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year then ended; and
• the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
Certain required disclosures have been presented elsewhere in the Annual Report, rather than in the notes to the financial statements. These are 
cross-referenced from the financial statements and are identified as audited.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the financial statements is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by 
the European Union.
Our audit approach
Overview
Materiality
Audit scope
Areas of  
focus
 
• Overall group materiality: £2 million which represents approximately 5 per cent of Group underlying operating profit 
before tax.
• Eight operating units subject to full scope audits on the basis of financial significance.
• Specific procedures over certain transactions and balances at six further operating units and consolidation 
adjustments where the particular balances were financially significant.
• Specific procedures in an additional operating unit. This unit was selected based on it being new to the Group and in 
a remote location (Brazil).
• Our audit scope addressed 66 per cent of Group revenue and 62 per cent of Group underlying operating profit 
before tax. 
• Goodwill and intangible asset impairment assessments, particularly in respect of the Schlegel International Cash 
Generating Unit (“CGU”).
• Accounting for the acquisition of Vedasil Brasil, including the valuation of intangible assets.
• Carrying value of provisions, particularly property related provisions and warranty provisions.
The scope of our audit and our areas of focus
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”).
We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In particular, we 
looked at where the Directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making 
assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management override 
of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the Directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to 
fraud.  71
Tyman plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2014
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit, including the allocation of our resources and effort, are identified as 
“areas of focus” in the table below. We have also set out how we tailored our audit to address these specific areas in order to provide an opinion on 
the financial statements as a whole, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures should be read in this context. This is not a 
complete list of all risks identified by our audit. 
Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus
Goodwill and intangible assets impairment assessment
Refer to page 47 (Audit Committee report), page 90 (significant 
accounting policies) and page 91 (notes).
There is £254.4 million of goodwill and £101.3 million of intangibles on 
the balance sheet, predominantly arising from past acquisitions. The 
Group operates in the building products market and therefore future 
results are impacted by fluctuations in the housing market and wider 
economy.
We focused on these balances because the determination of whether or 
not an impairment charge was necessary involved significant judgements 
about the future results of the business.
In particular, we focused on the estimated value in use calculations of the 
Schlegel International Cash Generating Unit (“CGU”) (£14.3 million 
goodwill and £1.5 million intangibles) for which there is limited headroom 
as a result of it having a high degree of exposure to European markets, 
where the housing market and wider economic environment continues to 
be difficult. The Schlegel International CGU has not met budget for the 
last two years, predominantly due to market factors.
The value in use calculation to support the carrying value of goodwill and 
intangibles in the Schlegel International CGU includes the impact of 
some anticipated improvement in European housing markets and 
realisation of the benefits of investment made by the Group over the last 
two years in consolidating the manufacturing footprint and 
strengthening the management structure.
The group’s other CGUs ERA, Amesbury, and Truth operate in the United 
Kingdom or United States markets which have experienced positive 
growth and each have headroom greater than 47 per cent of the CGU 
carrying value.
For all CGUs, including Schlegel International, we evaluated the 
Directors’ future cash flow forecasts and tested the underlying value in 
use calculations. We agreed the Directors’ forecast to the latest Board 
approved strategic plan. We also compared historic actual results to 
those budgeted to assess the quality of management’s forecasting. 
Based on this testing we considered the forecasts to be balanced. 
The key assumptions in the calculations were growth in revenue and 
EBITDA margins. In assessing these assumptions we considered 
external construction industry outlook reports and economic growth 
forecasts from a variety of sources, as these are the main drivers of 
building product sales. Where management’s growth assumptions were 
in excess of these external forecasts, we evaluated managements 
rationale, being the benefit of restructuring completed and investment 
made over the last two years and consider the forecasts to have been 
prepared on a supportable basis.
We also challenged:
• the Directors’ assumption in respect of the long term growth rates in 
the forecasts by comparing them to long term average growth rates 
of the economies in the relevant territories; and
• the discount rate by assessing the cost of capital for the company 
and comparable organisations.
We were satisfied that these assumptions were appropriate.
Sensitivity analysis was also performed in respect of the key 
assumptions where we flexed the key assumptions within a reasonable 
range, and determined at what level this would eliminate the headroom 
in the model. The Schlegel International CGU was the only CGU which 
was highly sensitive to changes in the assumptions, as outlined in the 
disclosure in note 10. We are satisfied the disclosures in note 10 highlight 
the limited headroom and the sensitivity of Schlegel International to 
changes in key assumptions.
Accounting for the acquisition of Vedasil Brasil
Refer to page 48 (Audit Committee report), page 110 (significant 
accounting policies) and page 111 (notes).
The Group acquired Vedasil Brasil (“Vedasil”) on 26 February 2014 for 
consideration of £6.6 million. Vedasil manufactures, purchases and 
supplies pile weather seals in Brazil, and the acquisition provides the 
Group with local manufacturing facilities in this market. 
Accounting standards require that all acquired assets and liabilities are 
recorded at their fair values on acquisition. In the Vedasil acquisition, the 
identification and subsequent valuation of intangible assets, in particular 
the customer relationships intangible asset (£3.8 million), required 
significant judgement in estimating the life of customer relationships, 
forecast revenue and profit, and customer attrition rates. 
We evaluated the nature of the intangible assets acquired as part of the 
Vedasil acquisition, considering the rationale for the acquisition and 
nature of the business. The only material intangible asset identified was 
the customer relationship intangible. 
We tested the methodology and assumptions used by the Directors in 
valuing this asset. We evaluated the cash flow forecasts used by 
challenging key assumptions, which included the length of the life of the 
relationships, the forecast revenue and profit over this period, and the 
customer attrition rate. These assumptions were compared to historic 
experience with previous acquisitions of businesses in similar industries. 
We were satisfied that the value of the intangible asset identified was 
supportable, and the assumptions used in valuing the intangible were 
reasonable.

governance report Financial statements 72
Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus
Carrying value of provisions
Refer to page 47 (Audit Committee report), page 104 (significant 
accounting policies) and page 105 (notes).
The Group holds a number of provisions which are inherently 
judgemental, including:
Property related provisions (£5.4 million)
The Group has been built up through acquisition and has consolidated 
manufacturing and warehouse facilities as functions have been 
integrated post-acquisition. Consequently there are a number of 
manufacturing and warehouse sites which are no longer used. Provisions 
have therefore been made in relation to onerous leases. In addition, a 
number of leasehold properties require the Group to reinstate them to 
their original state of repair, for which provisions have been made. We 
focused on these because there is inherent judgement in assessing the 
likelihood a disused property could be sub-let within the lease term and in 
assessing the cost of repairs at the end of a lease term.
 
Warranty provisions (£2.0 million)
The provision is based on the estimated costs of warranty claims on 
products sold. We focused on this provision as the estimation and timing 
of costs in respect of future warranty claims requires judgement, and, as 
such, there is a risk that the provision may be understated.
Property related provisions
Onerous lease provisions are based on the residual lease period and 
contractual lease payments, discounted for the time value of money. 
Our approach to onerous lease provision calculations included agreeing 
remaining rental costs to lease agreements and assessing the 
reasonableness of discount rates applied in light of the Groups cost of 
capital. We were satisfied the onerous lease provisions were made on a 
reasonable basis. 
The Group has implemented a rolling programme of obtaining updated 
external valuations for costs of reinstating leasehold properties to their 
original state of repair. We reviewed available external valuation reports, 
assessed the competence of the valuer, and agreed the estimate by the 
expert to management’s calculation. Where no external valuations were 
available, we considered the reasonableness of the items included in the 
calculation, being the estimated removal costs of equipment, and repair 
costs considering the relative size and complexity of work across sites. 
We also compared the provisions made by management in prior years 
to the external valuations to assess the accuracy of management’s 
estimations, noting that there was no significant difference between 
management’s previous estimate and the external valuation. 
Based on the work performed, we were satisfied that the property 
related provisions had been made on a reasonable basis.
Warranty provisions
We tested the accuracy of management’s calculation of forecast claims, 
which contain a general element based on percentage of claims relative 
to production levels, and specific elements for known warranty issues, 
and compared the level of historic warranty claims to that forecast. 
Based on the work performed, we were satisfied that the provision was 
made on a reasonable basis.
How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, 
taking into account the geographic structure of the group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the group operates. 
The Group is structured along three business lines being AmesburyTruth, Schlegel International, and ERA. The Group financial statements are a 
consolidation of the 69 reporting units for the group’s operating businesses, which map into the three business lines and centralised functions, which 
include head office functions and consolidation units.
Of the Group’s 69 reporting units, we identified eight which, in our view, required an audit of their complete financial information, due to their size. 
The units were based in the United Kingdom (“UK”) and United States (“US”). Specific audit procedures on certain balances and transactions were 
performed at a further six reporting units, as while overall the units were not financially significant, certain transactions and balances were material 
or considered to be higher risk, including provisions, borrowings, cash, and interest expense. PwC Brazil also undertook specific procedures on a small 
reporting unit, Vedasil, in line with our plan of rotating visits to different financially insignificant units to incorporate unpredictability and provide 
comfort over the units not subject to audit of their complete financial information. This was selected on the basis that it was new to the Group and 
in a remote location. 
In establishing the overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be performed at each of the reporting units 
either by us, as the Group engagement team, or the US and Brazil PwC network firms operating under our instruction. Where work was performed by 
the US firm, the UK engagement leader visited the US component team, and participated in the US component clearance meetings. We held 
regular phone calls with the US team and obtained formal reporting. The US engagement leader participated in the Group Audit Committee 
meeting. We concluded sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the Group financial statements  
as a whole.
Our scoping provided coverage of 66 per cent of Group revenue and 62 per cent of Group underlying operating profit. We considered the 
quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the remaining reporting units which comprise a large number of small units in which we consider the 
risk of material misstatement to the Group to be low. Together with additional procedures performed at the Group level on balances such as 
goodwill and intangible assets and taxation, this gave us the evidence we needed for our opinion on the Group financial statements as a whole.

Tyman plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2014
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together with 
qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate 
the effect of misstatements, both individually and on the financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Overall group materiality £2 million (2013: £1.5 million).
How we determined it Approximately 5 per cent of underlying operating profit before tax.
Rationale for benchmark 
applied
Underlying operating profit before tax is the key measure used internally by management in assessing the 
performance of the Group, and is the measure disclosed as a key performance indicator in the annual report. This 
measure provides us with a consistent year on year basis for determining materiality and eliminates the impact of 
non-recurring items. Underlying operating profit excludes net finance costs, exceptional items, amortisation of 
acquired intangible assets, and impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill. In 2013, we determined 
materiality based on 0.5 per cent of revenue as a result of fluctuating profit levels year on year. This has been 
re-evaluated in the current year in light of changes in the profitability of the business. Had the equivalent basis 
been applied for the 2013 audit, the resulting materiality would have been £1.6 million.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £100,000 (2013: £75,000) as 
well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the Directors’ statement, set out on page 45, in relation to going concern. We have nothing to 
report having performed our review.
As noted in the Directors’ statement, the Directors have concluded that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements using the going concern 
basis of accounting. The going concern basis presumes that the group has adequate resources to remain in operation, and that the Directors intend 
it to do so, for at least one year from the date the financial statements were signed. As part of our audit we have concluded that the Directors’ use 
of the going concern basis is appropriate.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the Group’s ability to continue as 
a going concern.

Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the Directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 45, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs (UK & Ireland). Those 
standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 
of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or 
to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
What an audit of financial statements involves
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the 
financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
• whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; 
• the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and 
• the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the Directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming our own judgements, and 
evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide a reasonable basis 
for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures or a combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited 
financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge 
acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider 
the implications for our report.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Parent Company financial statements of Tyman plc for the year ended 31 December 2014 and on the 
information in the Directors’ remuneration report that is described as having been audited.

Tyman plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2014
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. General information
Tyman plc (“the Company”) and its subsidiaries (together, “the Group”) is a leading international manufacturer and supplier of components to the 
door and window industry. The Group has 22 manufacturing sites in eight countries along with a further six sourcing and distribution sites across the 
Americas, Europe, Asia and Australasia with its products being found in homes and buildings worldwide.
The Company is a public limited company listed on the London Stock Exchange. The Company is incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales. 
The address of its registered office is 29 Queen Anne’s Gate, London, SW1H 9BU .
2. Accounting policies and basis of preparation
The accounting policies in this section relate to the financial statements in their entirety. Accounting policies, including critical accounting 
judgements and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements, that relate to a particular note, are described in the specific note to 
which it relates.
2.1 Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of Tyman plc have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) 
and IFRS Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”) as adopted by the European Union (“EU”) and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies 
reporting under IFRS. 
The consolidated financial statements are principally prepared on the basis of historic cost. Where other bases are applied, these are identified in the 
relevant accounting policy. 
The 2013 consolidated balance sheet has been restated for fair value adjustments to the net assets acquired with acquisitions in 2013 (see note 21). 
2.2 Going concern
Refer to the Corporate governance report on page 45 for narrative of the Board’s review of going concern. 
2.3 Accounting judgements and estimates
The preparation of financial statements requires management to exercise judgement in applying the Group’s accounting policies. It also requires 
the use of certain critical accounting estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. 
Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in 
which the estimate is revised and in any affected future periods. 
The areas representing the critical judgements made by management in the preparation of the Group’s financial statements are listed below 
and in more detail in the related notes: 
• Carrying amount of goodwill and intangible assets (note 10).
• Carrying amount of inventories (note 12).
• Carrying amount of trade receivables (note 13).
• Provisions (note 19).
• Business combinations (note 21).
The areas involving key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty that are significant to the financial 
statements are listed below and in more detail in the related notes: 
• Deferred tax assets (note 8).
• Defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit schemes ( note 20).

2.4 Changes in accounting policy and disclosures
2.4.1 New, revised and amended EU endorsed accounting standards
The table below represents new or amended EU endorsed accounting standards relevant to the Group’s results that are effective in 2014 and are 
considered to have an immaterial impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements.
Accounting standard Requirement
IFRS 10 Consolidated financial 
statements
The standard builds on existing principles by identifying the concept of control as the determining factor in 
whether an entity should be included within the consolidated financial statements of the parent company. 
Additional guidance assists in the determination of control where this is difficult to assess. 
IFRS 11 Joint arrangements The standard focuses on the rights and obligations of the parties to the arrangement rather than its legal form. 
IFRS 12 Disclosures of interest in 
other entities
This standard includes the disclosure requirements for all forms of interest in other entities, including joint 
arrangements, associates, structured entities and other off balance sheet vehicles. 
IAS 32 Financial Instruments: 
Presentation
The amendment clarifies that the right to set off must not be contingent on a future event. It must also be legally 
enforceable for all counterparties in the normal course of business, as well as in the event of default, insolvency 
and bankruptcy. The amendment also considers settlement mechanisms. 
IAS 36 Impairment of assets The amendments require disclosure regarding the measurement of the recoverable amount of impaired non-
financial assets. This amendment removed certain disclosures of the recoverable amount of Cash Generating 
Units which had been included in IAS 36 by the issue of IFRS 13. 
IAS 39 Financial Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement
The amendment considers the legislative changes to “over-the-counter” derivatives and the establishment of 
central counterparties. The amendment provides relief from discontinuing hedge accounting when novation of a 
hedge instrument meets specified criteria.
IFRIC 21 Levies IFRIC 21 is an interpretation of IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets. The interpretation 
sets out what the obligating event is that gives rise to a levy and when a liability should be recognised. 
 
2.4.2 New, revised and amended accounting standards currently EU endorsed but not yet effective
A number of new, revised and amended accounting standards and interpretations are currently endorsed but are effective for annual periods 
beginning after 1 January 2015, and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements. None of these are expected to 
have material impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.
There are no other IFRSs that are not yet effective that would be expected to have material impact on the Group.
2.5 Consolidation
Subsidiaries are entities that are directly or indirectly controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable 
returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully 
consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also 
eliminated. Where necessary, amounts reported by subsidiaries have been adjusted to conform to the Group’s accounting policies.
2.6 Foreign exchange
2.6.1 Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in 
which the entity operates (the functional currency). The consolidated financial statements are presented in British Pounds, which is the functional 
currency of the Company and the presentation currency of the Group.
2.6.2 Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. 
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of 
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement, except when deferred in other 
comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges. These are recognised directly in equity, other than the 
ineffective element, until the disposal of the net investment, at which time they are recognised in the income statement.
2.6.3 Group companies
On consolidation, assets and liabilities of Group companies denominated in foreign currencies are translated into British Pounds at the exchange 
rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated into British Pounds at the average rates throughout the year.
Exchange differences arising on the translation of opening net assets of Group companies, together with differences arising from the translation of 
the net results at average or actual rates to the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date, are taken to other comprehensive income. On 
disposal of a foreign entity, the cumulative translation differences recognised in other comprehensive income relating to that particular foreign 
operation are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal.

Tyman plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2014
3. Segment reporting
3.1 Accounting policy
3.1.1 Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable. Revenue represents the amounts receivable for goods supplied, 
stated net of discounts, returns and value added taxes.
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Group and when the amount of revenue can 
be reliably measured. Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have been 
substantially transferred to the buyer, usually on dispatch of the goods.
3.1.2 Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-makers. The chief 
operating decision-makers, defined as the Board of Directors, are responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the 
operating segments.
3.2 Segment information
The reporting segments reflect the manner in which performance is evaluated and resources allocated. The Group operates through three clearly 
defined Divisions, namely: AmesburyTruth, ERA and Schlegel International. Each Division is headed up by a Divisional CEO and management team, 
and each reporting to the Board via the CEO and CFO on a regular basis. Accordingly, the Board has concluded that the most appropriate segmental 
analysis for stakeholders is that of the three reporting Divisions with an allocation of Group central overheads made to each Division. 
From January 2014, our North American businesses have been managed as a single functional organisation with an integrated management team. 
The Truth and Amesbury operating segments have therefore been combined from the start of 2014 and are no longer included in the segmental 
analysis as distinct operating segments. 
Each reporting segment broadly represents the Group’s geographical focus, being the North American, the United Kingdom and International 
operations respectively. The Schlegel International segment includes Schlegel Building Products, the Group’s UK-based manufacturer of pile 
weatherstrip and extrusions. In the opinion of the Board, there is no material difference between the Group’s operating segments and segments 
based on geographical splits. Accordingly, the Board does not consider geographically defined segments to be reportable.
The following tables present Group revenue and profit information for the Group’s product segments, which have been generated using the Group 
accounting policies, with no differences of measurement applied, other than those noted above.

5. Employees and employee costs
5.1 Accounting policy
5.1.1 Wages and salaries
Wages and salaries are recognised in the income statement as the employees’ services are rendered. 
5.1.2 Termination benefits
Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the Group before the normal retirement date, or whenever an employee 
accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. The Group recognises termination benefits at the earlier of the following dates:
• when the Group can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits; and
• when the entity recognises costs for a restructuring that is within the scope of IAS 37 and involves the payment of termination benefits.
In the case of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy, the termination benefits are measured based on the number of employees 
expected to accept the offer. Benefits falling due more than 12 months after the end of the reporting period are discounted to their present 
value.
5.1.3 Profit-sharing and bonus plans
The Group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses and profit-sharing, based on a formula that takes into consideration the profit 
attributable to the Company’s shareholders after certain adjustments. The Group recognises a provision where contractually obliged or where 
there is a past practice that has created a constructive obligation.

6. Exceptional items
6.1 Accounting policy
Where certain income or expense items recorded in the period are material by their size or incidence, the Group presents such items as 
exceptional within a separate line on the income statement, except for those exceptional items that relate to net finance costs and tax. Separate 
presentation provides an improved understanding of the elements of financial performance during the year so as to facilitate comparison with 
prior periods and to assess trends in financial performance.
Exceptional items include one-off redundancy and restructuring costs, and transactions costs associated with merger and acquisition activity.

8. Taxation
8.1 Accounting policy
Income tax (charge)/credit comprises current tax and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates to 
items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity; in which case it is recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.
The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in the 
countries where the Company and its subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income.
Deferred income tax is recognised on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the 
consolidated financial statements. No deferred tax liabilities are recognised if it arises from the initial recognition of:
• goodwill;
• an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable 
profit or loss.
Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and are expected to 
apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary 
differences can be utilised.
Strategic report
Corporate  
governance report Financial statements 86
8. Taxation continued
Deferred income tax liabilities are provided on taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries except for deferred income tax 
liabilities where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not 
reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised on deductible temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries only to the extent that it is 
probable the temporary difference will reverse in the future and there is sufficient taxable profit against which the temporary difference can be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same 
tax entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
8.1.1 Key source of estimation uncertainty: Deferred tax assets
Estimation is required of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their tax base. Deferred tax liabilities 
are recognised for all taxable temporary differences but, where deductible temporary differences exist, management’s judgement is required as 
to whether a deferred tax asset should be recognised based on the availability of future taxable profits. It is possible that the deferred tax assets 
actually recoverable may differ from the amounts recognised if actual taxable profits differ from management’s estimates.

The standard rate of corporation tax in the UK changed from 23 per cent to 21 per cent with effect from 1 April 2014. Accordingly, the Group’s UK 
profits for this accounting period are taxed at an effective rate of 21.50 per cent (2013: 23.25 per cent). A tax rate of 20 per cent from 1 April 2015 
was substantively enacted on 2 July 2013. This reduction in the UK corporation tax rate is likely to lead to a further reduction in the future UK current 
tax charge. 
The Group’s UK deferred tax assets and liabilities have been remeasured at a rate of 20 per cent, being the rate applicable during the period the 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to be utilised. 
Taxation for other jurisdictions is calculated at rates prevailing in those respective jurisdictions.

£’000
Capital losses 3,992 4,581
Trading losses 16,578 11,543
20,570 16,124
As the future use of these losses is uncertain, in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy, only a portion of these losses have been recognised 
as a deferred tax asset. The amounts of deferred tax not recognised are as follows: 
2014
 £’000
2013
£’000
Capital losses (798) (916)
Trading losses (3,780) (1,542)
 (4,578) (2,458)
No deferred tax liability is recognised on temporary differences of £53,800,000 (2013: £49,300,000) relating to the unremitted earnings of overseas 
subsidiaries. As a result of UK legislation, which largely exempts from UK tax the overseas dividends received, the temporary differences arising on 
unremitted profits are unlikely to lead to additional UK corporate taxes. Furthermore, although the remittance to the UK of those earnings could still 
result in a tax liability, arising as a result of withholding taxes levied by the overseas tax jurisdictions in which those subsidiaries operate, such 
jurisdictions provide currently for zero dividend withholding tax in their tax agreements with the UK.
9. Earnings per share
9.1 Non-GAAP measure accounting policy
The Directors believe that the “underlying” profit and earnings per share measures provide additional useful information to shareholders on the 
underlying performance of the business. These measures are consistent with how business performance is measured internally. The underlying 
profit before tax measure is not recognised under IFRS and may not be comparable with “underlying” profit measures used by other companies. 
The adjustments made to reported profit before tax is to derive underlying profit before taxation exclude the following:
• Exceptional items – these are largely one-off in nature and therefore create volatility in reported earnings.
• Amortisation of borrowing costs, accelerated amortisation of borrowing costs, amortisation of acquired intangible assets, impairment of 
acquired intangible assets, impairment of goodwill, and unwinding of discount on provisions. These are non-cash in nature and the events 
giving rise to them are expected to be infrequent.

Profit for the year 9,331 956

Basic earnings amounts are calculated by dividing net profit for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders by the weighted average number of 
ordinary shares outstanding during the year. 
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number 
of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all 
the diluted potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.

has been based on underlying earnings for each financial year and on the same weighted average number of shares in issue as the earnings per

10. Goodwill and intangible assets
10.1 Accounting policy
10.1.1 Goodwill
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the Group’s interest in the net 
fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the Cash Generating Units (“CGUs”), 
that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated represents the 
lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. Goodwill is monitored at the operating 
segment level.
Goodwill impairment reviews are undertaken annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment. 
The carrying amount of goodwill is compared to the recoverable amount, which is the higher of value in use and the fair value less costs of 
disposal. Any impairment is recognised immediately as an expense and is not subsequently reversed.
10.1.2 Intangible assets
Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment. On acquisition of businesses by the Group, the Group 
recognises any separately identifiable intangible assets separately from goodwill, initially measuring the intangible assets at fair value.
Purchased intangible assets acquired through a business combination, including purchased brands, customer relationships, trademarks and 
licences, are initially measured at fair value and amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic lives as follows:
• Acquired brands – 5 to 20 years.
• Customer relationships – 9 to 15 years.
• Internally developed computer software – 10 years.
• Purchased computer software – 3 to 4 years.
Development costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group 
are recognised as intangible assets when the following criteria are met:
• it is technically feasible to complete the software product so that it will be available for use;
• management intends to complete the software product and use it or sell it;
• there is an ability to use or sell the software product;
• it can be demonstrated how the software product will generate probable future economic benefits;
• adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the software product are available; and
• the expenditure attributable to the software product during its development can be reliably measured.
Directly attributable costs capitalised as part of the software product include the software development employee costs and an appropriate 
portion of relevant overheads. Other development expenditures that do not meet these criteria are recognised as an expense as incurred. 
Development costs previously recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period. Computer software development 
costs recognised as assets are amortised when the intangible assets are in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating 
in the manner intended by management. 
The estimated useful lives of acquired intangible assets are reviewed whenever events or circumstances indicate that there has been a change in 
the expected pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits embodied in the asset. Any amendments to the estimated useful lives of 
intangible assets are recorded as a change in estimate in the period the change occurred.
10.1.3 Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets
Intangible assets, including goodwill, that have an indefinite useful life or intangible assets not ready to use are not subject to amortisation and 
are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances 
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying 
amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of the asset’s fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. For 
the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are largely independent cash inflows (CGUs). Prior 
impairments of non-financial assets (other than goodwill) are reviewed for possible reversal at each reporting date. Goodwill previously impaired 
cannot be reversed at a later date.
10.1.4 Critical accounting estimates and judgements: Carrying amount of goodwill and intangibles
As at 31 December 2014, the Group had goodwill of £254,375,000 with intangible assets amounting in total to £101,290,000. An impairment 
review using a value in use calculation has been performed for each CGU. There is significant judgement involved in determining appropriate 
assumptions to use in the calculations, including the forecasted cash flows of each CGU and appropriate discount rates relative to the 
Company’s cost of capital. These assumptions have been subjected to sensitivity analyses. Details of estimates used and sensitivities in the 
impairment reviews are set out in this note.

10.2.1 Impairment tests for goodwill
Assumptions
The recoverable amounts of CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. Value in use is determined by discounting the future pre-tax cash 
flows generated from the continuing use of the CGU, using a pre-tax discount rate. 
Cash flow projections are derived from financial plans approved by the Board and cover a five year period. They reflect management’s expectations 
of revenue growth, operating cost and margin for each CGU based on past experience. Cash flows after the five year forecast period were 
extrapolated using a long term growth rate of 1.50 per cent in order to calculate the terminal recoverable amount. 
Discount rates are estimated using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risk profiles of the CGUs. 
The key assumptions used in the value in use calculations in each of the Group’s CGUs at 31 December 2014 are as follows: 
Average pre-tax discount rate
Average revenue growth for 
years one to five
 2014 2013 2014 2013
Amesbury 13.3% 14.1% 4.8% 12.5%
Truth Hardware 13.2% 13.7% 6.8% 4.5%
ERA 9.4% 10.2% 6.0% 6.0%
Schlegel International 12.7% 12.6% 5.9% 10.0%
Impairment review results: 2014
The closure of the Belgium Industrial Products operations has given rise to a £3,411,000 impairment of goodwill, previously forming part of the 
Schlegel International CGU. Impairment of goodwill is included in administrative expenses in the income statement.
A review of the carrying amount of goodwill and intangibles assets across the Group has been carried out at year end in light of current trading 
conditions and future prospects. The annual impairment review did not result in any further impairment losses being recognised in the 2014 year. 
Whilst economic conditions in European markets continue to be challenging, the carrying amounts of goodwill and intangible assets in Schlegel 
International are considered to be sustainable based on current projections. If markets continue to deteriorate, this could give a further impairment 
charge at a future date. 
Impairment review results: 2013
No impairment arose from the impairment review process in 2013.

10. Goodwill and intangible assets continued
Sensitivity of assumptions
A sensitivity analysis was conducted on the basis of lowering the forecast EBITDA margin, the assumption the model was most sensitive to, by a 
constant percentage each year from year one onwards in perpetuity until the excess of value in use over the carrying amount of the CGU’s assets 
was reduced to zero. The EBITDA margin would need to be lower by 1.54 percentage points for each year from year one onwards in perpetuity 
before any impairment would arise in respect of the CGU with the lowest impairment headroom. Given the strengthened management structure 
and significant investment made in this CGU, it is considered unlikely that such a sustained deterioration in EBITDA margins will occur.

11. Property, plant and equipment
11.1 Accounting policy
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Cost includes expenditure that is directly 
attributable to the acquisition of the assets. Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as 
appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the specific asset will flow to the Group and the cost of the 
item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the 
income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Freehold land is not depreciated. Depreciation is provided on all other property, plant and equipment at rates calculated to write off the cost less 
estimated residual value of each asset on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life, at the following annual rates:
• Freehold buildings – 2 per cent to 5 per cent.
• Plant and machinery – 7.5 per cent to 33 per cent.
The carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment periodically if events or changes in circumstances indicate 
that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The assets’ residual values, useful lives and method of depreciation are reviewed, and 
adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised in the income statement.

12. Inventories
12.1 Accounting policy
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined in accordance with the first-in, first-out method. Cost 
includes the cost of materials determined on a purchase cost basis, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of manufacturing overheads 
based on normal levels of activity. It excludes borrowing costs. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of 
business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
Where necessary, a provision is made to reduce cost to no more than net realisable value having regard to the nature and condition of inventory, 
as well as its anticipated saleability.
12.1.1 Critical accounting estimates and judgements: Carrying amount of inventories
The carrying amounts of inventories are stated with due allowance for excess, obsolete or slow-moving items. Group management exercises 
judgement in assessing net realisable value and provisions for slow-moving and obsolete inventory which is based on current assessments of 
future demand, market conditions and new product development initiatives.

An impairment charge of £741,000 (2013: £1,077,000) was recognised in respect of inventories during the year. 
There were no borrowings secured on the inventories of the Group (2013: £Nil).
13. Trade and other receivables
13.1 Accounting policy
Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for goods sold in the ordinary course of business. If collection is expected in one year or less 
(or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer) they are classified as current assets; otherwise they are presented as non-current 
assets.
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value plus transaction costs and subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective 
interest rate method, less appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts (provision for impairment).
13.1.1 Critical accounting estimates and judgements: Carrying amount of trade receivables
Provision against trade receivables is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due to it in 
accordance with the original terms of those receivables. The amount of the write down is determined as the difference between the carrying 
amount and present value of estimated future cash flows. Group management exercises judgement in assessing the amount of any write downs 
required which is based on current assessments of the creditworthiness of current customers.

On 10 June 2014, the Group entered into a new banking facility of up to £240,000,000, comprising a £180,000,000 committed multi-currency 
revolving credit facility and a £60,000,000 uncommitted accordion facility. On completion of the new facility, the September 2011 facility was 
repaid in full and cancelled. The new banking facility extends to 10 June 2019, is unsecured and guaranteed by Tyman plc and its principal  
subsidiary undertakings. 
The proceeds from the private debt placement (see 16.2.2) were used to repay and cancel the 2013 US$100,000,000 acquisition facility put in place 
in order to acquire Truth Hardware (note 21.3).

On 19 November 2014, the Group completed the issuance of a debut private debt placement with US financial institutions totalling 
US$100,000,000.
The debt placement is unsecured and comprises US$55,000,000 debt with a seven year maturity at a coupon of 4.97 per cent and US$45,000,000 
with a 10 year maturity at a coupon of 5.37 per cent. 
The debt placement successfully accomplishes the Group’s objectives of diversifying its sources of debt finance along with extending the tenor of its 
overall facilities.

17. Derivative financial instruments
17.1 Accounting policy
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are 
subsequently re-measured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as assets when fair value is positive and as liabilities when fair value is negative.
The Group designates certain derivatives as either:
• hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or a firm commitment (fair value hedge);
• hedges of a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction (cash flow hedge); or
• hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation (net investment hedge).
For those instruments designated as hedges, the Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging 
instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. The Group 
also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging 
transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
The full fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability when the remaining hedged item is more than 12 months 
and as a current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months.
For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised immediately in the 
income statement.
17.1.1 Fair value hedges
Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and qualifying as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together with any 
changes in fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk. 
17.1.2 Cash flow hedges
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are recognised in other 
comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to the income statement in the period in which the hedged item affects profit or loss. When a 
hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in 
equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement. When a 
forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the 
income statement.
17.1.3 Net investment hedge
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges. Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument 
relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is 
recognised in the income statement. Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the income statement when the foreign operation is 
partially disposed of or sold.

17.2.2 Cash flow hedges
The notional principal amounts of the outstanding interest rate swap at 31 December 2014 were £46,501,000 (2013: £51,100,000). 
During the year a profit of £518,000 (2013: loss of £163,000) was recognised in the statement of comprehensive income and £Nil (2013: £Nil) in the 
income statement for the ineffective portion of changes in the value of cash flow hedges.

The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the fair value of the derivative assets on the balance sheet. 
Refer to note 18.4 for the fair value measurement methodology. 
17.2.3 Net investment hedges
The Group uses foreign currency denominated debt to hedge the value of its foreign currency denominated net assets due to movements in foreign 
exchange rates. At 31 December 2014, the value of the net investment hedge was £94,380,000 (2013: £101,007,000). This hedge is considered 
highly effective and no ineffective portion has been recognised in the income statement. 
18. Financial risk management and financial instruments
18.1 Accounting policy
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the 
instrument and are generally derecognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires.
18.1.1 Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They are 
included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the end of the reporting period. These are classified as non-current 
assets. The Group’s loans and receivables comprise “trade and other receivables” (note 13) and “cash and cash equivalents” (note 14) in the 
balance sheet.
18.1.2 Financial liabilities held at amortised cost
Financial liabilities held at amortised cost comprise “trade and other payables” (note 15), and “interest-bearing loans and borrowings” (note 16).

18.3 Financial instruments: risk profile
18.3.1 Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital structure to ensure that it will be able to continue as a going concern. The capital structure of the Group consists of 
cash and cash equivalents (note 14), interest-bearing loans and borrowings (note 16) and equity attributable to the shareholders of the parent as 
disclosed in the consolidated statement of changes in equity.
18.3.2 Financial management
The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise bank loans, private debt and cash and short term deposits. The Group has various other 
financial instruments such as trade receivables and trade payables that arise directly from its operations. No trading in financial instruments is 
undertaken.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each financial instrument risk and they are summarised below.
18.3.3 Liquidity and credit risk
The Group maintains sufficient cash and marketable securities and the availability of funding through an adequate amount of credit facilities. 
Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s liquidity on the basis of expected cash flow. 
The Group manages liquidity risk by the pooling of cash resources and depositing funds available for investment in approved financial instruments 
with financial institutions. Counterparty risk with respect to cash and cash equivalents is managed by only investing in banks and financial 
instruments with independently assessed credit ratings of at least A-2 as published by Standard and Poor’s. Individual risk limits are assessed by 
management based on the external ratings. Management does not expect any losses from the non-performance of these counterparties. 
Credit risk is also attributable to the Group’s exposure to trade receivables due from customers. Management assesses the credit quality of 
customers taking into account their financial position, past experience and other factors. In order to mitigate credit risk the Group utilises credit 
insurance in those areas of its operations where such insurance is available. In areas where such insurance is not available, management monitors 
the utilisation of credit limits by customers, identified either individually or by group, and incorporates this information in credit risk controls. There 
are no significant concentrations of credit risk due to the diverse nature of the Group’s client base. 
Trade receivables are presented in the balance sheet net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Group’s management based on 
prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment. 
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying amount of financial assets recognised at the balance sheet date. Management considers 
all financial assets that are not impaired for each of the reporting dates under review are of good credit quality, including those that are past due. 
During the year ended 31 December 2014 the Group operated within its borrowing facilities.

Interest rate sensitivity
The impact of a 50 basis point movement in floating interest rates on borrowings would have a c. £500,000 (2013: £500,000) impact on profits. 
This impact would be reduced by the tax effect on such a change.

Interest rate risk of financial assets
The Board periodically reviews any exposure the Group may have to interest rate fluctuations. The weighted average interest rate received on 
deposited funds was 0.3 per cent during the year (2013: 0.3 per cent).
18.3.5 Foreign currency risk
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect to the  
US Dollar and the Euro. Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial and financing transactions, recognised assets and liabilities 
denominated in a currency that is not the Group’s functional currency and net investments in overseas entities.
The Group has a number of overseas subsidiaries, whose net assets are subject to currency translation risk. The Group borrows in local currencies as 
appropriate to minimise the impact of this risk on the balance sheet.

18.3.6 Capital management
The Group’s capital management objectives are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern so as to provide returns to 
shareholders and benefits to stakeholders. The Group defines its capital as total equity plus net debt. 
In maintaining the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount paid as dividends to shareholders, issue new shares or dispose of assets to 
reduce debt.
The Group monitors its financial capacity by reference to financial covenant ratios, including leverage and interest cover. If the Group fails to meet 
its key financial ratios required by its lenders, this could impact the Group’s average interest rate of borrowings and the future availability of credit to 
the Group.
The Group is in compliance with its financial covenants within its committed bank credit facilities, and has been in compliance throughout the 
financial year.

18.4 Fair value estimation
The Group’s derivative financial instrument used for hedging is measured at fair value. The Group uses the following hierarchy for measuring fair value:
• Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
• Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
• Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that is not based on observable market data.
Derivatives shown at fair value in the balance sheet have been valued by reference to level 2 techniques described above.
There were no transfers between levels during the year.
18.4.1 Valuation techniques used to derive level 2 fair values
Level 2 hedging derivatives comprise interest rate swaps fair valued using forward interest rates extracted from observable yield curves. The effects 
of discounting are generally insignificant for level 2 derivatives. The fair value of the derivative financial instruments at 31 December 2014 is a net 
asset of £105,000 (2013: net liability of £767,000).
There were no changes in valuation techniques during the year.
18.4.2 Group’s valuation process
The Group has a team that performs the valuations of financial assets required for financial reporting purposes. This team reports to the Chief 
Financial Officer and the Audit Committee.
18.4.3 Fair value of financial assets and liabilities measured at amortised cost
The fair values of borrowings are as follows:
2014
 £’000
2013
£’000
Non-current (129,272) (116,421)
Current – (7,300)
 (129,272) (123,721)
The fair values of the following financial assets and liabilities approximate their carrying amounts:
• Trade and other receivables.
• Cash and cash equivalents.
• Trade and other payables. 
19. Provisions
19.1 Accounting policy
Provisions are recognised when:
• the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event;
• it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and
• a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet 
date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to 
settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. 
The increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised in the income statement within net finance costs. Provisions are not 
recognised for future operating losses.
19.1.1 Critical accounting estimates and judgements: Carrying amount of provisions
Provisions, by their nature, are uncertain and highly judgemental. Provisions are measured at the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure 
required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date based on the nature of the provisions, the potential outcomes, any developments 
relating to specific claims, and previous experience.

(2013 restated: £1,386,000). Property provisions are expected to be utilised by 2018.
For onerous leases, the Group has provided for the rental payments due over the remaining term of existing operating lease contracts where a 
period of vacancy is ongoing. The provision has been calculated after taking into account both the periods over which properties are likely to remain 
vacant and any likely sub-lease income on a property-by-property basis. The provision covers potential transfer of economic benefit over the full 
range of current lease commitments disclosed in note 27.
The provision for leasehold dilapidations relates to contractual obligations to reinstate leasehold properties to their original state of repair. 
The transfer of economic benefits will occur at the end of the leases set out in note 27 .
19.2.2 Restructuring
Restructuring provisions include provisions for employee redundancy costs at restructured business units and are expected to be utilised by 2016.

20. Retirement benefit obligations
20.1 Accounting policy
The Group operates both defined contribution and defined benefit pension plans and post-employment medical plans.
20.1.1 Pension obligations
Defined contribution plans
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into publicly or privately administered pension 
insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. The Group recognises contributions as an employee benefit expense when they 
are due and has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The Group has no legal or constructive obligation to pay 
further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current or 
prior periods. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund in the future is available.
Defined benefit plans
A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that is not a defined contribution plan. Typically defined benefit plans define an amount of pension 
benefit an employee will receive on retirement. This amount is usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and 
compensation.
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at 
the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries 
using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of 
high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity 
approximating to the terms of the related pension obligation. In countries where there is no deep market in such bonds, the market rates on 
government bonds are used.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity in other 
comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
Past-service costs are recognised immediately in income.
20.1.2 Other post-employment obligations
Some Group companies provide post-retirement healthcare benefits to their retirees. The entitlement to these benefits is usually conditional on 
the employee remaining in service up to retirement age and the completion of a minimum service period. The expected costs of these benefits 
are accrued over the period of employment using the same accounting methodology as used for defined benefit pension plans.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity in other 
comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. These obligations are valued annually by independent qualified actuaries.
20.1.3 Key source of estimation uncertainty: Defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit schemes
The defined benefit obligations are calculated using a number of assumptions including future salary increases, increases to pension benefits, 
mortality rates and, in the case of post-employment medical benefits, the expected rate of increase in medical costs. The plan assets consist 
largely of listed securities and their fair values are subject to fluctuation in response to changes in market conditions. Effects of changes in the 
actuarial assumptions underlying the benefit obligation, effects of changes in the discount rate applicable to the benefit obligation and effects 
of differences between the expected and actual return on the plan assets are classified as actuarial gains and losses and are recognised directly 
in equity. Further actuarial gains and losses will be recognised during the next financial year. An analysis of the assumptions that will be used by 
management to determine the cost of defined benefit plans that will be recognised in the income statement in the next financial year is 
presented in this note.
20.2 Defined contribution pension schemes
The Group operates a number of defined contribution pension schemes, the assets of which are held externally to the Group in separate trustee 
administered funds. The costs of the Group’s defined contribution pension schemes are charged to the income statement in the period in which they 
fall due. The Group had no unpaid pension contributions included within employee benefit liabilities (2013: £Nil).

The Group’s principal defined benefit pension scheme and post-employment medical benefit scheme are operated in the United States. The defined 
benefit schemes provide benefits to members in the form of guaranteed level of pension payable for life. The level of benefits provided depends on 
members’ length of service and their salary in the final years leading up to retirement. 
For US plans, pensions in payment do not receive inflationary increases. The benefit payments are from trustee-administered funds. Plan assets held 
in trusts are governed by local regulations and practice in the US, as is the nature of the relationship between the Group and the trustees and their 
composition. 
Responsibility for governance of the plans, including investment and contribution schedules, lies jointly with the Group and the board of trustees. 
The board of trustees must be composed of representatives of the Company and plan participants in accordance with the plan’s regulations.
The current service cost, past service costs and expenses relating to the administration of the defined benefit schemes are included in the income 
statement within administrative expenses. Net expense is included within net finance income and costs. 
Actuarial gains and losses from participant experience, changes in demographic assumptions, changes in financial assumptions and net return on 
plan assets are recognised, net of the related deferred tax, in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 109
Tyman plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2014
Through its defined benefit pension plans and post-employment medical plans, the Group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of 
which are detailed below: 
Asset volatility The plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields; if plan assets 
underperform this yield, this will create a deficit. The US plans hold a significant proportion of fixed income 
investments, comprising a mixture of government and corporate bonds, and provides an acceptable level of 
investment risk to better match liabilities. The Group believes that given the long term nature of plan liabilities, and 
the strength of the supporting Group, a level of continuing equity investment is an appropriate element of the 
Group’s long term strategy to manage the plans efficiently. Equities are expected to outperform corporate bonds 
in the long term while providing volatility and risk in the short term. As the plans mature, the Group intends to 
reduce the level of investment risk by investing more in assets that better match the liabilities.
Changes in bond yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase 
in the value of the plans’ bond holdings.
Inflation risk Some of the Group’s pension obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities 
(although, in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect the plan against extreme 
inflation). The majority of the plans’ assets are either unaffected by fixed interest bonds or loosely correlated with 
equities inflation, meaning that an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit. In the US plans, the pensions 
in payment are not linked to inflation, so this is a less material risk.
Life expectancies The majority of the plans’ obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life 
expectancy will result in an increase in the plans’ liabilities.
The significant actuarial assumptions were as follows: 
2014 2013
Discount rate 3.8% 4.5%
Inflation 2.3% 2.3%
Salary growth rate n/a n/a
Pension growth rate 0.0% 0.0%
Health care cost trend
1
7.0% to 4.5% 7.0% to 4.5%
1 The level of healthcare contributions are capped and adopting a higher trend rate does not materially affect the liability. 
Assumptions regarding future mortality are set based on actuarial advice in accordance with published statistics and experience in each jurisdiction. 
These assumptions translate into an average life expectancy in years for a pensioner retiring at age 65:
 2014 2013
Retiring at the end of the reporting year 
Male 21.3 19.6
Female 22.9 21.5
Retiring in 20 years after the end of the reporting year
Male 22.6 19.6
Female 24.1 21.5
The sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in the weighted principal assumption is: 
Impact on defined benefit obligation
  Change in assumption Increase in assumption Decrease in assumption
Discount rate 0.25% Decrease by 3.20% Increase by 3.40%
The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. In practice, this is unlikely to 
occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant 
actuarial assumptions the same methodology has been applied as when calculating the pension liability recognised within the statement of 
financial position.
The methods and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analyses did not change compared to the previous year.
The pension scheme is closed to new entrants; as a result the service costs to the Group will rise in future years. The expected level of contributions 
to the defined benefit pension scheme and post-employment medical benefits in the year to December 2015 is £1,128,000.
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 13.1 years.

21. Business combinations
21.1 Accounting policy
The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary 
is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interest issued by the Group. 
The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Identifiable 
assets acquired, liabilities assumed and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the 
acquisition date.
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the 
contingent consideration that is deemed to be an asset or liability is recognised in accordance with IAS 39 either in profit or loss or as a change to 
other comprehensive income. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not re-measured, and its subsequent settlement is 
accounted for within equity.
The excess of the consideration transferred and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value 
of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill (note 10.2). If the total of consideration transferred is less than the fair value of the 
net assets of the subsidiary acquired in the case of a bargain purchase, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement.
21.1.1 Critical accounting estimates and judgements: Acquisition accounting
IFRS 3 requires assets and liabilities acquired to be recorded at fair value and to separately identify intangible assets from goodwill, initially 
measuring each group of intangible assets at fair value. Groups of intangible assets include purchased brands and customer relationships. There 
is judgement involved in estimating fair value, particularly in relation to identifiable intangible assets, which requires the Directors to estimate the 
useful economic life of each asset and the future cash flows expected to arise from each asset and to apply a suitable discount rate.

21.2 Acquisition of Vedasil Brasil
On 26 February 2014, the Group acquired 100 per cent of the issued share capital of Vedasil Brasil (“Vedasil”), the market leader in the manufacture 
and supply of pile weatherseals in Brazil. Vedasil manufactures and supplies polypropylene extruded seals under the Eco-PDM brand and other seal 
and screen components to the Brazilian door and window market. This acquisition provides the Group with a market leading position and local 
manufacture in Brazil.

Property, plant and equipment 514

The fair value of financial assets includes trade receivables with a fair value of £866,000 and a gross contractual value of £1,066,000. The best 
estimate at the acquisition date of the contractual cash flows not recoverable is £200,000.
The Group incurred acquisition-related costs of £138,000 for professional fees paid and legal advice. These costs have been included in exceptional 
costs in the Group’s consolidated income statement (note 6). 
Revenue included in the consolidated income statement since 26 February 2014 contributed by Vedasil was £4,702,000. Vedasil also contributed 
£1,246,000 to the profit before taxation over the same period.
Had the acquisition of Vedasil been completed on the first day of the financial year, an additional £1,041,000 of revenue and £379,000 of profit 
before taxation would have been contributed to the Group.
Fair values remain provisional in relation to this acquisition and the Group will complete this review by early 2015. Any adjustment to the carrying 
amount is unlikely to be significant to the individual acquisition. The fair values of identifiable intangible assets recognised at acquisition include 
customer relations of £3,778,000 and other intangible assets of £22,000. No value was ascribed to the Vedasil brand which was withdrawn shortly 
after the completion of the acquisition.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is attributable to the expected profitability of the acquired business arising from:
• savings and benefits, including shorter supply chains, associated with the enhanced local manufacturing capability;
• acquired market and technical production process knowledge; and
• the market growth potential and opportunities to develop the Schlegel International business across Southern and Latin America. 
The estimated value of intangibles, including goodwill, deductible for tax purposes is £Nil.
21.3 Acquisition of Truth Hardware
On 3 July 2013, the Group acquired 100 per cent of the issued share capital of Truth Hardware. At 31 December 2013, the fair values in relation to 
this acquisition were provisional. The Group has completed its review and the fair value adjustments below relate to adjustments between the 
provisional fair values at 31 December 2013 and final fair values at 2 July 2014.

22. Share capital and share premium
22.1 Accounting policy
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares or options are shown in equity 
as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Where any Group company purchases the Company’s equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any directly 
attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes) is deducted from equity attributable to the Company’s owners until the shares are cancelled 
or reissued. Where such shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction 
costs and the related income tax effects, and is included in equity attributable to the Company’s owners.

On 23 May 2013, the Group completed the fully underwritten firm placing and open offer of ordinary shares as part of the funding for the 
acquisition of Truth Hardware (see note 21.3). Net proceeds of £71,031,000 were raised through the sale of 6,864,000 treasury shares and the issue 
of 32,816,904 new ordinary shares at the issue price of 185 pence per share. The sale of treasury shares resulted in a transfer of £6,235,000 from the 
treasury reserve against share premium.  
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 113
Tyman plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2014
23. Share-based payments
23.1 Accounting policy
The Group operates an equity-settled share-based compensation plan (Long Term Incentive Plan, “LTIP”) for certain employees under which the 
entity receives services from employees as consideration for equity instruments (share options) of the Group. The fair value of the employee 
services received in exchange for the grant of options is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate 
of shares that will eventually vest.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the 
impact of any non-market vesting conditions. Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are 
expected to vest. At each balance sheet date, the entity revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest, with any 
changes in estimate recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment in equity. The fair value of awards granted under 
LTIP is measured using a probability model to predict target EPS levels.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium when 
the options are exercised.
23.2 LTIP
In 2014, the Group operated the LTIP. The charge to the income statement in 2014 was £903,000 (2013: £681,000). 
Conditional, annual awards of shares are granted under the LTIP to certain Executive Directors and senior managers at the discretion of the 
Remuneration Committee. Provided the participant remains an employee of the Group and the performance conditions are met, awards will vest 
three years after the date of the grant at no cost to the employee. To strengthen the alignment with shareholders, the Remuneration Committee 
extended the time horizon to 2014 LTIP awards, and all future LTIP awards granted to Executive Directors through the introduction of a two year 
holding period on vested LTIP shares (net of tax). This means that the 2014 LTIP awards must be retained until March 2019. The percentage of 
shares that will actually vest is dependent upon the Group’s earnings per share growth over a three year measurement period. The Remuneration 
Committee also has the discretion to adjust the number of shares vesting depending on the Tyman performance during the vesting period. Further 
information on the LTIP and the performance conditions is given in the Remuneration report.
The fair value of the awards granted under the LTIP and the assumptions used in the calculation of the share-based payment charge are as follows:
Valuation model Probability model to predict EPS levels
Date of grant 26 June 2014
Number granted 630,420

remaining core extrusion manufacturing will be transferring to Cannon Falls, Minnesota, and the coupler manufacturing will be transferring to the 
Fremont, Nebraska, facility. 
The sale of the custom extrusion non-fenestration business is expected to complete on 13 April 2015.

• give a true and fair view of the state of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2014 and of its cash flows for the year then ended;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the European Union and as 
applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
What we have audited
Tyman plc’s financial statements comprise:
• the Company balance sheet as at 31 December 2014;
• the Parent cash flow statement for the year then ended; and
• the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
Certain required disclosures have been presented elsewhere in the Annual Report, rather than in the notes to the financial statements. These are 
cross-referenced from the financial statements and are identified as audited.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the financial statements is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by 
the European Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.

Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the Directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 45, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs (UK & Ireland). Those 
standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 
of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or 
to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
What an audit of financial statements involves
We conducted our audit in accordance with ISAs (UK & Ireland). An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the 
financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by 
fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
• whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Parent Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; 
• the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and 
• the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the Directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming our own judgements, and 
evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide a reasonable basis 
for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures or a combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited 
financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge 
acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider 
the implications for our report.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements of Tyman plc for the year ended 31 December 2014.

NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. Accounting policies
1.1 Basis of preparation
The separate financial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006. As permitted by that Act, the financial 
statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards (“UK GAAP”).
The financial statements are prepared on the going concern basis, under the historical cost convention. The principal accounting policies, which 
have been applied consistently throughout the year, are set out below.
1.2 Operating leases
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to profit and loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
1.3 Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less any provisions for impairment.
1.4 Financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Company’s balance sheet when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of 
the instrument.
Trade debtors are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated recoverable amounts.
Trade creditors are stated at their nominal amount.
1.5 Borrowings
Interest-bearing loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received. All borrowing costs are expensed as incurred, on an accruals basis, to 
the Company profit and loss account using the effective interest rate method.
1.6 Share-based payments
The Company has applied the requirements of FRS 20 “Share-based payments”. The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments to 
certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of options is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, 
based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the impact of 
any non-market vesting conditions. Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to 
vest. At each balance sheet date, the entity revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest, with any changes in estimate 
recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment in equity. The fair value of awards granted under LTIP is measured using a 
probability model to predict EPS levels.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium when the 
options are exercised.
The grant by the Company of options over its equity instruments to the employees of subsidiary undertakings in the Group is treated as a capital 
contribution. The fair value of employee services received, measured by reference to the grant date fair value, is recognised over the vesting period 
as an increase to investment in subsidiary undertakings, with a corresponding credit to equity in the parent entity accounts.
The social security contributions payable in connection with the grant of the share options is considered an integral part of the grant itself, and the 
charge will be treated as a cash-settled transaction.
2. Profit attributable to the shareholders of the Company
The Company is an investment holding company. It receives dividend income from subsidiaries and bank interest. It pays loan interest to a 
subsidiary. The majority of administrative expenses are paid by the Company’s subsidiary, Tyman Management Limited, including the whole 
amount of relevant auditors’ remuneration and operating lease costs.
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has elected not to present its own profit and loss account for the year. The 
Company reported a profit for the financial year ended 31 December 2014 of £523,000 (2013: loss of £4,242,000). 
3. Employees
Other than the Directors, there were no employees of the Company during the year (2013: Nil). Directors’ emoluments are set out in the Directors’ 
remuneration report in the Group’s financial statements on pages 50 to 64.

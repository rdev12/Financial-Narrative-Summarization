Inland Homes is an established land regeneration business, 
focused on developing sites in southern England for residential and 
mixed use projects. our foundations have been built on a proactive 
and decisive approach to identifying the right land opportunities, 
and our ability to navigate the complex planning system and 
maximise the potential of the final development.
our versatile structure, relatively small team, local insight and 
opportunistic approach gives us a competitive advantage, ensuring 
we can react fast to secure the sites we want at a price that 
provides healthy returns. once secured, our knowledge of and 
relationships with local authorities, and the wealth of experience in 
our land team, means that we are able to secure the right planning 
consent for the sites we own and manage.
our ambitious developments, combining style, comfort and 
sustainability for a wide social demographic, deliver appropriate 
rewards for our business, our stakeholders, our shareholders and 
the local community. 
Increasingly, we are utilising our own land bank to grow our 
housebuilding operations and this growth will continue to optimise 
our revenue profile.

CHAIRmAN’S St Ateme Nt
This has been a significant year for Inland Homes, with record 
breaking financial results achieved through the delivery of a well-
balanced strategy of new homes, land sales, land purchases and 
rental income. The Group’s results demonstrate that our small 
team has been highly successful in delivering and managing the 
significant increase in both turnover, profitability and shareholders’ 
funds achieved from our expanding housebuilding and the sale of 
consented land. 
our focus remains on development opportunities in Southern 
England in locations where the economy is strong and demand  
is high. 
Inland built and sold 248 private homes and 39 homes for housing 
associations with an average sale price of £264,000 for our 
private units. This is a 52% increase in overall completions when 
measured against the comparable period last year.
we completed the sale of 440 building plots (2014: 169 building 
plots) and our rental income was £0.8m, although this has 
increased significantly since the year end to £1.1m per annum.
During the financial year, Inland acquired 76 existing houses, 
together with undeveloped land, that was released by the Defence 
Infrastructure organisation at w ilton Park in Beaconsfield, 
Buckinghamshire. The Group intends to hold the houses as 
investment properties and we have seen a revaluation surplus on 
these properties of £14.5m at the balance sheet date.
These transactions have resulted in a record profit before tax of 
£34.0m (including the revaluation surplus on investment properties 
of £14.5m), an increase of 254% over the previous year. 
our varied portfolio of mainly 1, 2 and 3 bed homes are particularly 
popular with first time buyers and investors. The Government’s 
‘Help to Buy’ initiative is a very attractive incentive with 31% of our 
buyers taking advantage of this scheme during the financial year. 
we are pleased to note that this scheme has been extended by the 
Government to 2020. 
The forward sales position of homes that have been reserved or 
where contracts have been exchanged, is very strong at £31.1m.
The Group’s balance sheet has strengthened significantly over 
the previous period with cash balances of £21.4m at the year end 
and shareholders’ funds of £88.8m. Net borrowings amounted 
to £34.9m (2014 restated: £40.9m). Borrowings have increased 
post the year end date due to continuing investment in land 
opportunities and a further increase in work in progress.
Despite the substantial increase in plot sales with planning 
permissions and completed homes, I am pleased to report that the 
land bank has increased to a record 5,176 plots (2014: 3,734 plots), 
a significant achievement by any measure. 
The Group’s administrative expenses have increased as we 
continue to invest in quality personnel in a competitive  
marketplace and as a result of the substantial increase in the 
activities of the Group. 
Given the Group’s strong earnings, forward sales position and 
sound balance sheet, the Board is proposing to increase the 
final dividend by 17% to 0.7p per share (2014: 0.6p) subject to 
shareholders’ approval at the AGM which is to be held on  
14 December 2015. The final dividend will be paid to shareholders 
on 22 January 2016. Together with the interim dividend of 0.3p per 
share paid in July 2015 this brings the total dividends for the year 
to 1.0p, an increase of 67%.
Finally, I should like to extend my thanks once again to our small, 
highly motivated team led by our CEo, Stephen w icks, for their 
continued hard work during the year which has made these 
outstanding results possible.

vicki Noon Sales & Marketing Director
The UK housing market slowed down in the early part of 2015 but 
has recovered since the general election in May 2015. House prices 
in the South East, where the Group predominantly operates have 
increased by 6.7% in the year to July 2015 according to the office 
for National Statistics. This is in contrast to the 11.6% increase in 
the previous year. 
The rapid growth that we have seen is widely attributed to the 
Government’s ‘Help to Buy’ Scheme, which has enabled 120,000 
households, most of them first time buyers, get onto the property 
ladder who had been unable to do so since the credit crunch. 
This sudden increase in demand pushed the prices up but these 
levels of price increases could only ever be temporary and we have 
now seen them normalise. w ith the fundamental undersupply 
of homes, prices will inevitably continue to rise, especially when 
expectations in interest rate increases in the near future have 
softened. Recent research by the housing charity Shelter has 
shown that in the two and a half years since its launch 3% has 
been added to the average cost of a UK home as a direct result of 
the scheme. The scheme has now been extended to 2020, bringing 
some certainty back into the sector. This year, 31% of the homes 
sold by Inland used this scheme and this shows that certain types 
of purchaser are still very reliant on the Government’s help to 
obtain a deposit.
The Council of Mortgage Lenders have forecast an 8% increase in 
lending during 2015 and mortgage rates are still at historic lows.
Annual UK housing completions in the 12 months to June 2015 
were up 15% compared to the previous year at 131,060 but the 
housing starts during the same period were down by 1%. To keep 
up with demand we should be building 220,000 dwellings  
per annum. 
w ith such a shortage of homes, increases in mortgage availability 
and an expected increase in employment growth we expect house 
prices to continue to rise in our operating area, albeit at a slower 
rate than that experienced over the last two years.
The new Government is putting housing at the forefront of their 
list of priorities and Inland has been involved in the consultation 
process on Starter Homes, even receiving Prime Minister David 
Cameron on a site visit to our Carter’s Quay development in  
Poole, Dorset.

ou R AgILe bu SINeSS mode L
The key to our agile business model is 
balancing resources, both land and cash, 
to enable regular land purchases and a 
constantly developing land bank. This feeds 
opportunities to the planning team who begin 
the value adding process by securing important 
planning permission. The asset can then be 
monetised in several different ways: selling 
the land with planning permission, selling 
a proportion of the plots to developers, or 
utilising our housebuilding capabilities and 
selling houses directly to homeowners. Each of 
these processes is underpinned by an ongoing 
dual assessment — of the market conditions 
and customer demands, and our own cash 
and opportunity flow. The continual decision 
making and plan refining process based on 
these considerations means that Inland not 
only produce highly sought after homes and 
developments, but deftly balance their assets 
and cash, maintaining a responsive forward-
looking financial strategy.
ASSeSSmeNt o F mARket CoNdIt IoNS
The planning teams undertake thorough 
research into sites before, during and after 
purchase, to establish the factors at play, 
from local authority restrictions or demands 
on the site and community pressures, to the 
nature of the landscape and its surrounding 
areas. Before an application is submitted, 
extensive consultation is undertaken with 
planning bodies to establish the parameters 
for a project. our in-depth knowledge and 
experience as well as research into the specific 
area ensures that the proposed project is not 
only likely to be supported by the local council, 
but that there is high demand for the resultant 
properties and the project will be profitable. 
External consultants are used to advise on 
a range of aspects of the project, including 
sustainability, and once a plan is drawn up 
we continue to refine and adjust it based on 
the constant monitoring of local and market 
forces. As a result, we have a stellar track 
record of achieving planning permission even 
on the most difficult sites, and the resulting 
developments are tailor-made for the local 
community, completely transforming brownfield 
land into attractive homes and landscapes.
HoLISt IC ASSeSSmeNt o F ou R po Rt FoLIo
w hen it comes to deciding on whether to 
sell the site with planning to developers or 
undertake the build internally, we assess 
influencing factors such as cost of labour, 
timescales and location to decide on the most 
appropriate route to take. Considering the 
financing of a project build is critical to this 
decision making process, and we crucially 
assess this not only on a project basis, but in 
terms of how it will affect the cash flow of the 
Group as a whole. Inland procures funding 
from a number of sources, including joint 
ventures and loan finance. However, a major 
source of funding is using our own equity, and 
a holistic decision has to be made on whether 
certain consented sites should be realised into 
cash to finance future projects and overheads. 
The inbuilt flexibility and agility of this model 
allows us to operate sustainably, and undertake 
projects which deliver sound returns for our 
shareholders.

1
 Increase the size of our land bank year on year
2
 Continue the core activity of plot sales to other developers  
to generate cash to fund our operations
3
 Maximise the value from our land bank by expanding our 
housebuilding programme
4
 Maintain borrowings at a manageable level through a strong 
focus on cash management and vendor financing
our strong land team continues to focus on increasing the size of 
the land bank. w ith the recent introduction of our Strategic Land 
Team, the purchases now range from sites ready for immediate 
development, to tactical acquisitions of sites which open up the 
potential of neighbouring land, to areas which will become key 
housebuilding terrain in the future. All these purchases are funded 
by our careful financial strategy, which balances loan finance, 
joint venture funding and cash released by sales of other sites and 
completed residential units.
As our planning team adds value to land through achieving 
planning permission, we are able to make attractive short term 
margins through sales to developers. In this strong housebuilding 
climate there is high demand for quality land, so our strategy 
means that we are well poised to take advantage of this and 
generate strong revenue streams to feed back into our land buying 
programme.
Having proved our credentials as a quality housebuilder with 
award-winning developments such as Drayton Garden village and 
Carter’s Quay, we continue to build momentum and develop our 
quality portfolio. we currently have 223 residential units under 
construction across nine sites and this is likely to increase in the 
medium term. This will in part be achieved by our move towards 
undertaking larger projects. our housebuilding capabilities 
have bolstered our reputation and attracted some significant 
partnerships, for example the project in Chapel Riverside, 
Southampton.
Lastly, our varied range of financing options gives us flexibility. 
our business plan includes the sale of consented land, which we 
can tailor to our cash flow requirements. Additionally, we have an 
increasing bank of properties, which are providing a steady stream 
of rental income and cash that contributes to our overheads.

exceptional skills in large-scale brownfield development. we 
have capitalised on favourable market conditions in order to 
significantly increase our housebuilding activity. we intend 
to maintain our growth strategy to enhance our land bank;

building plots were sold to a national housebuilder for £19m. 
This was the last significant parcel of land on the site. A 
phase of 43 housing units is being built by Inland and 13 
of these had completed at the year end at prices in excess 
of budget. we intend to obtain planning on eight more

 Historical growth trends show that housing demand and, 
consequently, house prices tend to increase faster in the 
South East as compared to the rest of the UK. As London 
is an international hub, as well as the UK’s capital city, we 
are confident that demand for jobs and homes will continue 
to increase demand for housebuilders. Growth forecasts 
suggest that employment in the South East will increase over 
the next decade, which gives us confidence in our strategy to

2015, the Group sold 31% of its open market units through 
the Government’s Help to Buy. Under the scheme, the 
Government provides up to 20% of the purchase price, which 
they send to us on completion, and this allows the purchaser 
to exchange contracts with us for a 5% deposit.

 The Company’s shares are perceived to be trading at a 
significant premium to stated NAv. However, the stated 
NAv does not reflect the underlying value of all of the 
Group’s assets. Inland generally purchases all its sites 
unconditionally without planning permission and then adds 
value through the planning process. The sites within the 
land bank will be at various stages of this process with 
some having built up substantial unrealised value as they 
have either achieved or are very close to securing planning 
permission. The cumulative unrealised value will significantly 
increase the underlying NAv. NAv is a key performance 
measure used in the real estate industry. However, IFRS 
NAv does not provide shareholders with the most relevant 
information on the fair value of the assets within an ongoing 
real estate company with a long term strategy. Accordingly, 
after consultation with our advisers, we have decided to adopt 
the accounting practices of the European Public Real Estate 
Association (“EPRA”) to address this issue. Specifically, the 
EPRA NAv measure highlights the fair value of net assets on 
a long term, ongoing basis. w hile not recognising unrealised 
gains due to planning gains in the income statement, the 
adjusted value of trading assets and land subject to planning 
gains would reflect their current fair value under EPRA’s NAv 
measure. we intend to introduce this additional disclosure for 
the six months ending 31 December 2015.

A
 The major development in the last year has been the 
increased housebuilding activity, as more companies respond 
to the uplift in the economy and undertake developments. 
This has led to greater competition for site purchases, and 
an increased pressure on labour and material resources, 
pushing prices up. It is the nature of our markets to have 
fluctuations and, as always, Inland remain true to our core 
values of integrity and openness when dealing with our 
customers and suppliers. we continue to cultivate strong 
working relationships which accounts for these market 
changes. Additionally, Inland’s key strengths of our speed, 
agility and efficiency mean that despite challenging market 
forces, there is no shortage of opportunities, successful site 
purchases and developments.
Q

INLANd IN t He LASt 12 mo Nt HS?
A
 The Land and Planning teams have expanded this year, 
and crucially have introduced a Strategic Land department. 
This department researches and undertakes purchases of 
sites that Inland have identified as strategically important 
— land which may be a gateway to unlocking other key 
sites (such as the purchase which enabled the w ilton Park, 
Beaconsfield project, see page 22), or land that in the 
future may become a prime housebuilding opportunity. The 
strategic land department is complementary to Inland’s 
main focus of brownfield land purchase and development, 
but adds depth to the land portfolio, acquiring sites with 
more of a long term focus. There is a major housing crisis 
in the UK, with insufficient residential properties available, 
and whilst brownfield regeneration is a major contributor 
to the solution, there is not enough brownfield land to 
solve the crisis alone. Therefore, adding this Strategic 
Land Department will help Inland continue to respond (in a 
sustainable way) to the housing shortage into the future.
Q

 Inland continues to focus on its core attributes of expedient 
and rigorous risk assessments together with decisive 
action on potential opportunities. our skilled planning and 
stakeholder negotiation and flexible approach to realising 
the value of developments with sales at different stages 
of completion. By remaining true to the Inland ethos, the 
talented team at Inland are able to be competitive in different 
market climates. Inland are retaining the traditional focus on 
the South East of England; however, the land team are willing 
to consider sites of outstanding potential further afield, for 
example the highly successful projects on the South coast. 
our responsive and agile acquisition strategy means Inland 
are well poised to pursue new opportunities, such as those 
generated by relationships with local authorities. w ith recent 
successes in city centre regeneration projects, as well as 
large developments, Inland will continue to build on this 
momentum and seek similar projects in the future.

considered several options, we are very pleased to be in

well with Inland’s. This ongoing complementary partnership 
and further cash resources will contribute to the opportunity

 Producing a brief is one of the most important components 
of the planning process. From this brief we can generate a 
design which is appropriate to the site and our capabilities, 
and is likely to receive planning approval. The brief is an 
assessment and response to all the constraints and issues 
that need to be considered when looking at any site, such 
as the technical, urban design and planning constraints, 
the political environment and sales and marketing 
considerations. Technical constraints include issues such as 
levels, sunlight services, highways, ecology and archaeology; 
and urban design constraints include all those physical 
issues that define the environment within which a scheme 
is being developed. we also consider planning constraints 
and the political environment within which a scheme is being 
developed, looking at the planning policy at national, regional 
and local level, as well as the nature of the scheme whether 
it be a location that is micromanaged, regeneration led, 
open for ideas, or tied by party politics. Having considered 
these external factors, we carefully summarise all of our 
findings in a brief, so that we can begin to propose a solution 
appropriate to the location and local environment, and 
produce responsive and sensitive designs, that take on board 
all the appropriate issues and maximise the opportunity for 
us. As part of this preparatory stage we consider the strategy 
for achieving a planning approval, which may be short or long 
term, drawing on the extensive public consultation which 
runs alongside the whole planning process. we also try and 
establish relationships with local councils, seeking support 
from stakeholders throughout the local community and 
Government.

CASe Study —

The ongoing w ilton Park project in Beaconsfield is a prime 
example of our strategy in action. The acquisition of the site 
demonstrates careful planning, a strategic land purchase and 
sensitive management of relationships. As a result of the delicate 
and skilful work of the land buying and planning teams, we are 
now in possession of this highly desirable 114 acre development 
site, which has potential for 350 attractive homes.
The site, previously the home of the Ministry of Defence (MoD)
School of Languages, has always had great potential for a 
residentially led mixed use development, but had a number of 
difficulties, particularly the road access. The existing access 
is through a bottleneck junction, inconvenient for the local 
community and unsuitable for a major new housing development. 
The one appropriate option was to develop a new road from a 
nearby roundabout, that would eventually form part of a relief road 
planned by the council. However, the land necessary for this new 
access was owned by a number of parties. Aware of its critical 
importance, we negotiated the purchase of this key piece of land, 
releasing the immense potential of the w ilton Park site. This 
forward-looking and strategic purchase meant that the council 
and MoD then supported our bid for acquiring the site. This is a 
prime example of careful research and consultation with local 
government, alongside conversations and negotiations with land 
owners and the community, demonstrating the value of investing in 
strategic land.
A further reason we were successful in the acquisition of the 
w ilton Park site was our existing relationship with the MoD. w ilton 
Park was the fourth site Inland has purchased from the MoD, and 
this proven track record meant that the MoD were confident in our 
ability to deliver on promises, and solve the unique challenges that 
come with such a site. For example, there is an active air cadets 
training base within the site, which we have made provisions for, 
enabling it to continue functioning before relocating to a new 
base elsewhere on the site when development commences. 
Such attention to detail and care for local causes is another 
reason the MoD entrusted Inland with this site, as we previously 
demonstrated by transforming the RAF west Drayton site into the 
successful Drayton Garden village development.
As this site has significant potential, we are exercising another 
aspect of our strong business model by ensuring meticulous 
planning is undertaken, and scheduling development to begin at 
the most appropriate time. Public consultations and research are 
currently under way. During this process we are generating rental 
income from the site in its present state. As part of the purchase 
Inland has acquired 76 existing homes, which are currently offered 
for rent; we are also leasing other parts of the land for filming and 
storage uses. The site is also being used for community activities, 
including the air cadets and police dog training. Infrastructure 
planning and preparation is under way, and we are considering 
how best to roll out the development of the project, but crucially 
the site is earning an income during this preparatory stage.
The finished project will be an attractive development, that will 
respect the surrounding greenbelt. There will be neighbourhood 
resources including a nursery, community hub, shop, and café, 
meaning that as well as catering for the needs of the local 
and neighbouring residents, the development will also provide 
employment. The acquisition of this site has been a tremendous 
success, and the future development will provide desirable, quality 
housing that will transform the area.

I am delighted to report on a record year for Inland with the 
business achieving 48% growth in net assets per share to 43.92p 
(2014 restated: 29.63p per share) and a profit before tax of £34.0m 
(2014 restated: £9.6m).
As set out in the Chairman’s Statement, this has been a significant 
year for our Group, with record sales of 440 building plots, together 
with the sale of 248 private homes and 39 for housing associations. 
our average selling price of £264,000 for our private units 
means that we are at the end of the market where our product is 
affordable and where demand from buyers is strongest.
This outstanding set of results has been helped by a revaluation 
surplus of £14.5m on the existing housing portfolio at w ilton 
Park, Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire where 76 houses are being 
held as investment properties. This revaluation should help give 
shareholders an indication of some of the underlying value behind 
Inland’s stated NAv per share. These properties are being rented 
out on assured shorthold tenancy agreements with 31 properties 
going under offer to tenants in the first few months. once all the 
houses at w ilton Park are let, we expect gross residential rental 
income on this project to exceed £1m per annum.
Despite the utilisation of 727 plots through sale of land and 
construction of homes, our land bank has continued to rise and 
now stands at a record 5,176 plots. This is testament to our small 
land team led by Paul Brett, the Group Land Director. 
The status of the land portfolio is as follows:
Plots
owned or contracted with planning consent or 
resolution to grant planning consent 1,086
owned or contracted without consent 1,344
Held within joint ventures without consent 1,329
Plots controlled or terms agreed with consent or 
resolution to grant planning consent 114
Plots controlled or terms agreed without consent 1,303
t otal 5,176
w hilst our primary business is residentially led brownfield 
regeneration, wherever possible we ensure that our assets 
generate an income stream that contributes significantly towards 
the running costs of the business. our short term target is to 
achieve a rental income in excess of £2m per annum.
The substantial increase in work in progress within our 
housebuilding operations and the continuing investment into good 
land opportunities, particularly into major projects such as w ilton 
Park, has led to an increase in our borrowings after the year end 
and the Board is comfortable with the position as the underlying 
asset value of the business has also grown substantially. The 
increased borrowings are also supported by a strong forward sales 
position and growing recurring rental income.
The Group has in the order of 50 projects at various stages of the 
development cycle and I set out below further details on a number 
of the more significant ones.
w ILt oN pARk, be ACoNSFIeLd, bu CkINgHAmSHIRe
we achieved adoption of the planning brief for the development of 
this site during the course of the year. This confirms the capacity 
for at least 300 new homes, together with commercial space and 
the retention of a substantial number of existing former MoD 
houses.
we now intend to apply for planning permission based on the 
principles set out in the brief and, in the meantime, expect to 
commence the construction of the first section of the new access 
road into the site from the Pyebush roundabout. This will also 
serve as the first section of the long awaited Beaconsfield relief 
road which will connect to Amersham Road (A355) in due course. 
In the short term, and until consent is granted, our focus will 
be on generating short term income and preparing the site for 
development.
This site is our ‘jewel in the crown’ and is geographically situated 
in one of the most affluent parts of the country outside Central 
London. we estimate the gross development value to be in the 
order of £250m. Shareholders can rest assured that we are 
managing and nurturing this asset very carefully.

we are very proud of what has been achieved on this project. we 
have turned what was a derelict wasteland of rundown buildings 
into a superb community of new homes in a highly landscaped 
environment with a number of beautifully laid out village greens 
and children’s play areas.
A combined heat and power system was installed with a 
new energy centre that delivers hot water and heating to the 
development in an extremely efficient manner, with estimated 
carbon savings of 40% when compared to a more conventional 
system.
The sale of 205 building plots to a major housebuilder in June 2015 
means that our work is now nearly finished. The development of 43 
new homes by Inland, which are all pre-sold, will also conclude in 
this financial year.
The development has been extremely profitable and has 
demonstrated the ability of Inland to manage a large-scale complex 
development from inception through to completion, creating an 
excellent living environment in the process. The development is also 
experiencing additional value brought about by the new Cross Rail 
station at west Drayton which will be an easy walking distance away.

The development of 152 apartments on a complex, brownfield 
former hospital site was completed during the year. The 
apartments proved to be very attractive to a substantial number 
of first time buyers and investors. A block of 59 units was sold to 
an investor prior to commencement of the development and this 
underpinned the financing for the project. The demand for the 
homes was very strong with all units sold well ahead of completion 
of the building works.

Inland’s share is £2.6m.
we continue to maintain our success rate in securing planning 
permissions on our brownfield sites and are pleased to see a 
growing recognition of our regeneration skills by landowners, 
particularly local authorities where we are working in partnership 
with a number of councils to bring forward regeneration and much 
needed homes in Southern England. of particular note on this 
front is our joint venture with Southampton City Council where 
we have signed heads of terms on a site, ‘Chapel Riverside’. This 
opportunity is for approximately 350 homes and a new commercial 
centre and will regenerate ten acres of land owned by the Council.

The UK housing market slowed down in the early part of 2015, 
in all likelihood due to the uncertainty caused by the May 2015 
general election. Due to the continual undersupply of new housing 
and the expectation of low interest rates for the foreseeable 
future, it is more likely that house prices in Southern England 
will continue to rise. The market has recovered since the general 
election and the changes to stamp duty and the ‘Help to Buy’ 
scheme have been of significant assistance. The introduction 
of the National Planning Policy Framework has led to a much 
needed increase in residential consents; however, this increase 
is insufficient to meet the country’s demand especially in areas of 
greatest need.

w ith purchasers’ confidence high, supported by a removal of any 
political uncertainty and continuing strong demand for homes 
and building land, we have every confidence in delivering further 
significant progress in the current financial year.

Sout HAmpto N
The former Meridian Tv studios in Southampton is a site of great 
local significance, in terms of both its heritage and its waterside 
location fronting the River Itchen. The seven acre site has changed 
hands a number of times, but none of the historical plans for its 
development have been crystallised. As part of Southampton City 
Council’s major regeneration project, the Meridian site is a key 
priority for a flagship development, and has great potential despite 
requiring careful and knowledgeable planning. As part of our due 
diligence into the site, there was extensive consultation with the 
council about their ambitions for the area and its relationship 
to major transport infrastructure. The conversation saw Inland 
advising the council as well as consulting with them to gauge 
where this site fits into their plans for the city as a whole.
Key to our bid for the site was proving our ability to ‘place make’, 
to transform a previously neglected site into an attractive place 
to live. Inland’s great track record of turning around sites and 
capturing homeowners’ interest served us well in this instance.  
For example, in Poole, Dorset, we created a real buzz transforming 
a previously dormant site into a flagship regeneration 
development, not only rapidly selling out the development 
but also attracting award shortlistings including Sunday 
Times ‘Development of the Year’ 2015. The level of community 
consultation that goes into planning at Inland ensures that the 
homes developed are attractive to potential buyers, and as such we 
were a natural choice for Southampton to work with to spearhead 
the regeneration of the area.
The plans developed for the site reflect the needs of both the 
community and the wider city, including infrastructure works 
contributing a portion of a new flood defence system the city are 
building along the water bank. Building work will commence 
soon, with Inland undertaking the infrastructure works. This is an 
example of our agile business model in action, where Inland and 
our partners benefit from a clear vision as well as the flexibility to 
release cash in different timescales dependent on the sale of the 
plots before or after their completion.
our purchase of this site, which was previously in receivership, is 
already contributing momentum to the development of the area, 
following stalled attempts in the past. once the development is 
complete, our ability to add value to an area will once again be 
seen in the 351 quality new homes delivered. The project will also 
be a great addition to our portfolio, and a strong example of the 
recent shift into more city centre builds, and particularly in ‘place-
making’ regeneration projects. Furthermore, in a city with so much 
potential for future projects, establishing a strong relationship 
with Southampton City Council is very valuable for the future, and 
the success of this project may open the way for further fruitful 
partnerships in the region.

FINANCe d IReCt oR’S Rev Iew
once again the Group has produced a tremendous set of results 
which has been the product of a better balanced business model, with 
an increased amount of housebuilding alongside the sale of a number 
of consented plots from the land portfolio. The recovery within the 
housebuilding sector is now well recognised and evidenced by  
the significant improvement in performance reported by the UK’s 
major housebuilders.
Inland Homes generally purchases its sites unconditionally without 
planning consent and funding for such acquisitions remains very 
difficult to procure. The debt market for residential development 
has become more relaxed than it was five years ago, which has 
also supported the momentum in the sector.
In December 2014, the Group entered into an option arrangement 
with wilton Park Developments Ltd (wPDL), a company owned 
by funding partners, to acquire the land and 76 existing freehold 
residential properties at wilton Park in Beaconsfield, over a period 
of time. The site was acquired by wPDL for £35.0m, of which £29.0m 
was deferred over a period of three years. As at the balance sheet 
date, £19.0m of the deferred consideration remains outstanding and 
is non-recourse to the Group. In accordance with IFRS 10, the Group 
is required to consolidate wPDL within its financial statements 
and this has led to the inclusion of that company’s results, part of 
which has then been deducted as a minority interest as they are 
not attributable to the shareholders of Inland Homes plc. Further 
information on the treatment of wPDL within the Group accounts is 
provided in notes 4, 14 and 22 to the accounts.
In June 2015 the Conduct Committee of the Financial Reporting 
Council (Committee) wrote to the Group requesting information 
and explanations as to why the Company did not consolidate 
Drayton Garden village Limited (DGvL) in the Interim Results  
for the half year ended 31 December 2014 in accordance with  
IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements which was effective  
for the Group for the first time this year.
Following discussions with the Committee, the Board has concluded 
that the Group controls DGvL because of the following reasons:
•	 The Group has power over DGvL because it has the practical 
ability to direct the relevant activities that significantly affect 
DGvL ’s returns. Such relevant activities would include obtaining 
planning permission to develop the site and subsequently 
managing the property to realise its value. The Group also has 
an option to acquire the share capital of DGvL which provides it 
with a mechanism by which it can direct the relevant activities.
•	 The services that the Group provides to DGvL and the 
arrangement by which the Group receives its fees are such that 
it has rights to variable returns as a result of its involvement 
in delivering the various property services to DGvL. The Group 
is currently entitled to 90% of the profits from the project 
at Drayton Garden village and thus provides it with a very 
significant part of the returns generated from its involvement 
with DGvL.
•	 The Group also has the ability to use its power to affect its 
returns by virtue of its involvement with DGvL.
In view of the above the Group believes that under the principles 
of IFRS 10 it had control over DGvL from the date it entered into 
the agreement with DGvL and has therefore consolidated the 
results and financial position of DGvL within the Group accounts. 
Accordingly, the comparatives for earlier financial years have 
been restated. The profit share attributable to the shareholder of 
that company has been included within non-controlling interests 
and more information can be found in notes 4, 14 and 22 to the 
accounts.
The consolidation of w PDL and DGvL has led to an increase in 
revenue, inventories and borrowings amongst other items and 
has had a corresponding effect on reported cash flow movements. 
These effects are shown in note 32 to the accounts.

gRoup INCome St Ateme Nt
Group revenues have increased significantly by 94% to £114.2m (2014 
restated: £58.9m). The main driver of this has been the increased 
housebuilding activity which generated £66.1m (2014 restated: 
£29.2m) of revenue from 248 (2014 restated: 114) private residential 
unit completions of which 123 units were at our development in 
Ashford, Middlesex. The sale of 440 (2014 restated: 169) plots with 
planning consent contributed £39.6m (2014 restated: £15.1m) to 
revenue.
Gross profit has increased by 114%, from £16.1m (restated) to 
£34.4m and represents a gross margin of 30.1%. The significant 
increase in the Group’s activities has been reflected in an increase 
in administrative overheads of £1.6m over the previous period.
During the year, the Group acquired part of the land and 76 existing 
freehold residential properties at w ilton Park in Beaconsfield. It 
is the Group’s intention to hold the existing freehold properties 
for their rental value and for the longer term. These properties 
have therefore been revalued at the balance sheet date resulting 
in a surplus of £14.5m being recognised in the Group income 
statement. This reflects a change in accounting policy and the 
effects of this change are explained below in ‘Financial position’.
The fair value of the option over the issued share capital of DGvL of 
£541,000 has been written off during the year as the future profits 
from Drayton Garden village that would be available for distribution 
to the shareholder have decreased. 
The Group’s loan interest expense has increased significantly to 
£8.4m (2014 restated: £4.3m) in line with the increased debt funding 
used in our house building activities. The increase has also been 
due to some relatively more expensive debt used to acquire land, 
as funding for unconsented land is still very difficult to procure 
at competitive rates. A notional interest charge of £1.2m (2014: 
£57,000) has resulted due to the discount applied to deferred 
consideration on site acquisitions. £948,000 of this charge relates to 
wPDL. 
The net finance expense is £8.2m and is covered 3.4 times (2014 
restated: 2.6 times) by earnings before interest and tax and 
excluding revaluations of investment properties.
t AxAt IoN
The total tax charge of £5.1m represents 14.9% of the profit before 
tax. This is lower than the effective tax rate of 20.75% principally 
due to the unrealised revaluation surplus on investment properties 
not being subject to any tax in the current year.
As the Group has sufficient capital losses brought forward, 
a deferred tax charge has been offset against recognition of 
capital losses in respect of the revaluation surplus on investment 
properties.

CASH FLow S
During the year ended 30 June 2015, we increased net cash inflows 
from operating activities before movements in working capital by 
£16.6m to £28.4m and after taking account of movements in working 
capital, cash flow generated from operations amounted to £36.8m. This 
is a significant change from the previous year where we experienced net 
cash outflows of £27.5m. This was due to the 94% increase in turnover 
and gross profitability mentioned earlier in my report.
Investment in fixed assets, which includes the acquisition of the 76 
existing properties at w ilton Park, amounted to £11.5m. The Group 
also arranged two joint ventures into which we invested £4.9m 
by way of loans and equity. These investments are included in 
outflows from investing activities of £16.7m (2014: inflows  
of £1.9m).
Net cash outflows from financing activities amounted to £9.8m 
with net inflows from borrowings of £nil, interest paid of £7.2m and 
£1.2m of dividends paid. 
FINANCIAL poSIt IoN
Investment properties include our property at Hamworthy, Poole 
and the 76 residential properties at wilton Park in Beaconsfield. 
The property in Poole was valued by the Board at £8.0m, which was 
the fair value of the property after any transfers to inventories. The 
76 residential properties at wilton Park were professionally valued 
at £26.0m at the year end resulting in a surplus of £14.5m. This 
increase was due to a certificate of lawfulness having been obtained 
by the Group from the local authority as well as an increase in the 
value of houses in Beaconsfield since the site was purchased from 
the MoD. During the year the Group changed its accounting policy 
for investment properties from a deemed cost basis to a fair value 
basis. This has resulted in a restatement of the figures for the years 
ended 30 June 2013 and 2014, where both fixed assets and the 
profit and loss reserve have improved by £4.1m less an associated 
deferred tax asset of £2.1m, which had been previously recognised.
Investments in and loans to joint ventures of £4.7m represents the 
fair value of our share of investment into three sites within the two 
joint ventures, referred to in the Chief Executive’s Review.
Inventories have increased by 16.1% to £121.0m, which includes 
the land and buildings at w ilton Park and DGv which are held for 
trading. Debtors have decreased from £10.4m (restated) to £8.0m. 
Cash balances at the balance sheet date were £21.4m (2014 
restated: £11.1m) and net debt amounted to £34.9m (2014 restated: 
£40.9m), which represented a decrease in net gearing by 41.4% to 
39.2% (2014 restated: 66.9%). The substantial increase in work in 
progress within our housebuilding operations and the continuing 
investment into good land opportunities, particularly into major 
projects like w ilton Park, has led to an increase in our borrowings 
after the year end and the Board is comfortable with this position 
as the underlying asset value of the business has also grown 
significantly. The increased borrowings are also supported by a 
strong forward sales position and growing recurring rental income.
Land creditors were £23.5m (2014 restated: £9.3m), of which 
£16.1m relates to w ilton Park and is non-recourse to the Group.
Net assets attributable to shareholders were £88.8m at 30 June 
2015 equating to 43.92p (2014 restated: 29.63p) per share. The 
major part of the Group’s land bank is held as inventories at the 
lower of cost and net realisable value and it should be noted that 
the unrealised value within the portfolio of sites is significantly 
higher than the stated value. NAv is a key performance measure 
used in the real estate industry. However, IFRS NAv does not 
provide shareholders with the most relevant information on the 
fair value of the assets within an ongoing real estate company 
with a long term strategy. Accordingly, after consultation with our 
advisers, we have decided to adopt the accounting practices of the 
European Public Real Estate Association (“EPRA”) to address this 
issue. Specifically, the EPRA NAv measure highlights the fair value 
of net assets on a long term, ongoing basis. w hile not recognising 
unrealised gains due to planning gains in the income statement, 
the adjusted value of trading assets and land subject to planning 
gains would reflect their current fair value under EPRA’s NAv 
measure. we intend to introduce this additional disclosure when 
we report the Group’s half year results for the six month period 
ending 31 December 2015, expected in March 2016.

At Inland, ensuring sustainable operations and 
development is of paramount importance. our 
caring attitude to our colleagues, partners and 
the communities and environments in which we 
work means we strive to function in a way that 
is best for everyone. our key values of integrity, 
openness and trust dictate our interactions with 
each of our major stakeholder groups:
•	 communities
•	 homeowners
•	 developers
•	 colleagues
•	 local and national government
•	 the environment
The value we place on meeting the needs of each 
of our stakeholder groups intuitively informs  
all of our policies. w ith sustainability at the 
heart of everything we do, the following six areas 
describe our main focuses, and include many of 
our achievements.
SUSTAINABILITY
AT THE HEART
OF EVERYTHING 
WE DO
Colour Rush Charity obstacle Run
CommuNIty
Care for the community permeates all our activities, and our core 
focus of transforming potentially contaminated land into desirable 
family homes and community spaces is always undertaken with 
the needs of future residents and neighbours firmly in mind. our 
ongoing consultations with communities anticipate the wider 
needs of the homeowners, with green spaces, care homes, shops 
and communal facilities included to make sure our developments 
improve the neighbourhood. Inland ensures that sites are used 
to benefit community initiatives, such as at w ilton Park where 
the site is used for Air Cadet training. At Brooklands College, 
we contributed financially and used our expertise to ensure 
the community gym was maintained at the site until it could be 
relocated, saving it from closing down (read more in the case 
study on page 40). This is one of many examples of Inland as a 
company going above and beyond to support local communities, 
and a similar attitude is seen within our team, such as the nine 
colleagues who tackled the tricky 5k Colour Rush obstacle Run, 
raising over £10,000 for local hospice charity Shooting Star Chase.

Maintaining strong relationships with our customer groups, 
homeowners and developers is key to the sustainability of our 
agile business model (see page 11). Ensuring customers have a 
positive experience throughout their interaction with us increases 
the likelihood of recurring project partnerships with developers, 
and repeat custom or recommendations from homeowners. 
our strong reputation for quality, reliability and delivery leads to 
many opportunities, for example, land vendors trust Inland to 
honour promises and offer sales opportunities, while council and 
community groups seriously consider our bids knowing we have 
the capability to transform difficult sites.
w hen sales are made to developers, we retain them as partners 
in the development of the site, co-ordinating over branding and 
ensuring the site retains a clear identity. The intimate insight we 
achieve into the site and local community remains a key source of 
knowledge for developers, and they continue to receive value from 
us as we advise and collaborate on the project. 
The relationship with homeowners also continues after the sale 
of a house, with close monitoring and support provided, and 
customer feedback used in future projects.

w hen retiree valerie Rossides decided to downsize from her 
home of 40 years in Bishops Stortford, Hertfordshire, she 
wanted a fresh, new start. Little did she know she would end up 
feeling like she was on a permanent holiday.
“My son has a boat building workshop over the bridge in Poole 
and I decided to move to be nearer to him,” valerie explains.  
“I looked at a few places nearby and then walked into the show 
house at Inland Homes’ Carter’s Quay. Straight away I was 
100% sure that this was the place for me.”
valerie instantly realised the benefit of living close to Poole 
town centre. “Carter’s Quay is so close to the waterside and 
everything the town has to offer,” she says. 
Having moved from a large house with a big garden which 
had become a chore rather than a pleasure, she loved the fact 
that her home was fresh and new and she could move in with 
minimum hassle. “The layout is very well thought out and I loved 
the kitchen/diner and the fact that I could have my family sitting 
with me when cooking in the kitchen,” she explains. “I wanted 
three bedrooms so I could have a spare room for when people 
come and stay and also a study, so it’s perfect.”
“I have since learned that the houses can very easily be 
converted into four bedrooms, as the loft is enormous and 
comes fitted with electricity and provision for velux windows,” 
she adds. 
Since valerie moved in she has been delighted by the 
friendliness of the new community at Carter’s Quay. “All the 
people living here are so welcoming. I even know of one family 
who are so happy here that other family members are moving 
here too! It’s been a fantastic way to meet new people when you 
are moving somewhere completely new. I really do feel like I 
am on holiday every day!”

HeALt H ANd SAFety
In the last year, the Construction (Design and Management) 
Regulations 2015 were released, formalising the need to consider, 
anticipate and respond to health and safety issues from the earliest 
stage of planning a project. All projects are now required to appoint 
a ‘lead designer’, who amongst other duties must “plan, manage, 
monitor and coordinate health and safety in the pre-construction 
phase of a project” and “provide relevant information to the principal 
contractor to help them plan, manage, monitor and coordinate 
health and safety in the construction phase” (HSE CDM 2015). 
over the last year, we have focused on training to accommodate 
these new policies. our integrated business model, and ownership 
of projects from conception to completion means we are able to 
fulfil these regulations, and are able to naturally appoint a ‘lead 
designer’ from our skilled team to ensure all necessary health and 
safety procedures are instigated at the earliest stages of the project, 
and followed through on. our internal focus on health and safety, 
combined with the wide pool of external experts we draw upon for 
advice, means we are positioned to achieve a high standard health 
and safety design and planning.
Supp Ly CHAIN
The uplift in the economy and booming housing industry in 
recent years has placed more pressure on material and labour 
supplies, and as such, prices have risen. Achieving a steady 
supply of resources at competitive prices is a challenge for all 
housebuilders. we pride ourselves on reliability, transparency, and 
the ability to build and maintain strong relationships with strategic 
partners. The relationships we have nurtured with contractors in 
the past are now supporting us through this period, as contractors 
know that they will get a fair deal and so continue to work with 
us. our legacy of fairness and honesty means that our ongoing 
relationships help us to maintain an even and sustainable supply 
chain despite market fluctuations.
Additionally, there are broad challenges to the sustainability of the 
industry as a whole, with limited labour availability and a lack of 
skilled workers. we are committed to contributing to the future of 
housebuilding, and require contractors to include apprentices in 
projects, to ensure new talent develops. Internally there is also a 
strong focus on training, to support future generations of planners 
and land buyers (see our People, page 39).
SuSt AINAbLe HomeS
Planning the sustainability of developments begins at the earliest 
stages of a project, when potential sites are assessed — for 
example, considering what materials are present on the site and 
if these could be reused in construction. Throughout the planning 
of the infrastructure, buildings, and construction strategies, 
sustainability is a core focus, and decisions are taken which make 
both financial and ecological sense. on larger projects we have 
the scope to undertake ambitious sustainable projects, such as 
installing energy centres, and all of our projects use a range of 
environmentally friendly materials and construction methods.
our efforts to achieve sustainable builds have been recognised 
in recent awards. Prestigious prizes have included the Thames 
valley Property Awards House Builder of the Year 2015, as well 
as awards for specific projects such as Drayton Garden village, 
which was commended for the Sunday Times British Homes 
Awards ‘Development of the Year’ (100+ houses) 2014 and awarded 
the whatHouse ‘Best Landscape Design’ 2014 silver prize. The 
whatHouse judges were particularly impressed by the planting 
used to encourage ecological protection, and the site-wide water 
management strategy in the communal spaces and gardens, 
deeming the development “a refreshing example of what can  
be achieved”.

Brooklands College building
CASe Study —  
bRook LANdS CoLLege,  
ASHFoRd
The land previously occupied by Brooklands College in Ashford 
is a desirable ten acre town centre site, with extremely good 
transport links. w ith the college moving to new local premises, 
the land became available for purchase with certain conditions, 
including the retention of a health and beauty college on site. 
After the purchase had been completed, we became aware that 
a community gym on-site, which had been served notice to leave 
the premises, had not yet been able to raise enough funds to build 
a newly located facility, and as such was going to have to close 
down. The well-loved and famous gym had been behind Britain’s 
Got Talent’s dance troupe Spellbound, as well as a number 
of olympic athletes, and was frequented by both professional 
sportspeople and members of the local community, including over 
1,000 children a week. Despite not being contractually required 
to, we identified with the cause and as part of our commitment 
to the local community, decided to restructure the contract of the 
sale and offer both financial aid and free expert assistance for the 
relocation of the gym. we have thus far been able to save the gym 
from closing down, to the delight of its members.
our assistance has been critical to the gym’s survival. Following 
our lease renegotiations we generously donated £50,000 to 
help towards the fundraising that will enable the construction 
of the new gym facility nearby, whilst also contributing project 
management and advice regarding the planning and build stages 
of the new facility. w hen the new building is ready, we will be able 
to commence the full build project on the Brooklands College site, 
knowing that the local population will still be served by the great 
gym facility. our sense of duty to local communities is central to 
all project planning and development, but going above and beyond 
to ensure the local community was content with the development 
plans in this case was particularly rewarding for all involved.
The finished development will also serve the community well, with 
around 350 attractive homes featured alongside communal space, 
a three acre public park, and educational facilities including the 
health and beauty college. As well as the strong relationships 
with the local council, communities and institutions which this 
project demonstrates, another key partnership this project rests 
on is that with CPC Group, our joint venture partner, who have 
provided funding to the project. w hilst Inland retains control of 
planning and development stages of a project, CPC enable us to 
have greater buying power to acquire land opportunities. Following 
the infrastructure and early development stages of the Brooklands 
College site, Inland and CPC Group will decide whether to 
sell plots to developers, or whether Inland will complete the 
housebuilding themselves. ARou Nd

sound corporate governance and have reported on our Corporate 
Governance arrangements by drawing upon best practice available, 
including those aspects of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
2012 we consider to be relevant to the Company and best practice.
Aud It Comm Ittee
The Audit Committee comprises Terry Roydon (Chairman) and 
Simon Bennett. The Audit Committee meets at least three times a 
year and is responsible for ensuring that the financial performance 
of the Group is properly reported and monitored and for meeting 
the auditor and reviewing their reports in relation to the financial 
statements and internal control systems. The Group’s auditor 
provides some non-audit services, but these are not considered to 
threaten their independence. The committee reviews the level of 
non-audit fees on an annual basis. The Audit Committee meetings 
are also attended by invitation by representatives of the Group’s 
auditor, the Group Finance Director and the Chief Executive.
In June 2015 the Conduct Committee of the Financial Reporting 
Council (Committee) wrote to the Group requesting information 
and explanations as to why the Company did not consolidate DGvL 
in the Interim Results for the half year ended 31 December 2014 in 
accordance with IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements which 
was effective for the Group for the first time this year. Following 
discussions with the Committee, the Board concluded that the 
Group controls DGvL from the date it entered into the agreement 
with DGvL and has therefore consolidated the results and financial 
position of DGvL within the Group accounts. As this was a change 
in accounting policy, the comparatives have been restated. 
Since 30 June 2014 the Audit Committee has met four times to 
consider the planning of the statutory audit and to review the 
Group’s draft half and full year results prior to Board approval and 
to consider the external auditor’s detailed reports thereon.
INte RNAL CoNt RoLS
The Board is responsible for maintaining a sound system of 
internal control to safeguard shareholders’ investment and the 
Group’s assets and for reviewing its effectiveness. Such a system 
is designed to manage, but not eliminate, the risk of failure to 
achieve business objectives. There are inherent limitations in any 
control system and accordingly even the most effective system can 
provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
The Board reviews the effectiveness of the Group’s system of 
internal control on an ongoing basis. Annual budgets are prepared 
and detailed management reports are presented to the Board and 
used to monitor financial performance and compliance with the 
Group’s policies and procedures. All controls are covered including 
financial and operational controls to manage risk. The Board 
meetings are also used to consider the Group’s major risks.
ReLAt IoNS w It H SHAReHoLde RS
The Company has institutional shareholders and is, where 
practicable, willing to enter into a dialogue with them. The Chief 
Executive and Group Finance Director meet with institutional 
investors within the confines of relevant legislation and guidance.
The Board invites communication from its private investors and 
encourages participation by them at the AGM. All Board members 
are present at the AGM and are available to answer questions from 
shareholders.
INte RNAL Aud It
The Board reviews from time to time the need for an internal audit 
function and remains of the opinion that the systems of internal 
financial control are appropriate to the Group’s present activities 
and that such a function is unnecessary.
RemuNeRAt IoN CommIttee
The Remuneration Committee comprises Simon Bennett 
(Chairman) and Terry Roydon. The principal functions of 
the committee are to determine the Group’s policy on the 
remuneration of the Executive Directors and to determine the 
remuneration package of each Executive Director. The committee 
also determines long term incentive plans and the allocation of 
share options to the Executive Directors and other employees. The 
Remuneration Committee meetings are also attended by invitation 
by the Chief Executive and the Group Finance Director. During 
the year the committee met four times to review the Executive 
Directors’ remuneration package.
The Directors comply with Rule 21 of the AIM Rules relating 
to Directors’ dealings and take all reasonable steps to ensure 
compliance by the Company’s applicable employees. The Company 
has adopted and operates a share dealing code for Directors and 
employees in accordance with the AIM Rules.

dIReCt oRS’ RemuNeRAt IoN Repo Rt (uNAud Ited)
t here is no requirement for companies quoted 
on AIm to produce a formal remuneration report. 
As a consequence, this Remuneration Report is 
produced for information purposes in order to 
give shareholders and other users of the financial 
statements greater transparency about the way in 
which the directors of Inland Homes are remunerated 
and is not included within the scope of the audit.
This report sets out the remuneration paid to the Directors for the 
year ended 30 June 2015 and sets out the remuneration policy for 
the forthcoming financial year and beyond. 
Compo SIt IoN ANd RoLe o F t He Remu NeRAt IoN CommIttee 
The Board has established a Remuneration Committee which 
currently consists of Simon Bennett, independent Non-executive 
Director, who is Chairman of the committee and Terry Roydon, the 
Company’s Non-executive Chairman. The role of the Remuneration 
Committee is to determine the specific remuneration package for 
each of the Executive Directors and no Director is involved in any 
decisions that will affect his own remuneration. The Remuneration 
Committee has access to information provided by the three 
Executive Directors of Inland Homes, namely Stephen w icks, Chief 
Executive, Nishith Malde, Group Finance Director, and Paul Brett, 
Land Director; and independent advice from external consultants 
where it considers this to be appropriate.
The Remuneration Committee meets formally at least three times 
a year and on such other occasions as may be required.
poLICy FoR exe Cut Ive dIReCt oRS’ RemuNeRAt IoN
The policy for Executive Directors’ remuneration is designed 
to attract, motivate and retain high calibre individuals with a 
competitive remuneration package. The remuneration policy takes 
into account the overall performance of the Company and the 
individual Executive Directors and the prevailing pay structures in 
the markets in which Inland Homes operates.
The Executive Directors’ remuneration is designed to provide a 
balance between fixed and variable rewards, although it is recognised 
that it is common industry practice for total remuneration to be 
significantly influenced by annual bonuses and long term incentive 
plans. Consequently, remuneration packages for individual Executive 
Directors comprise a basic salary, deferred bonus plan, a long term 
incentive plan and benefits in kind. In agreeing the basic salary 
and annual bonuses, in addition to the factors outlined above, 
the Remuneration Committee takes into account the aggregate 
remuneration to be received by the individual Executive. 
In 2013, in line with best corporate governance and market 
practice, the Remuneration Committee introduced a new deferred 
bonus plan and a long term incentive plan for the Company’s 
Executive Directors, which have been designed to incentivise the 
Executive Directors to grow the business and maximise returns to 
shareholders. The latter is known as The Inland Homes plc 2013 
Growth Plan (“2013 LTIP”), which will operate for a period of six 
years and was approved by shareholders in general meeting in 
December 2013. The key elements of the scheme are set out below.
bASIC SALARy
The basic salaries of the Executive Directors are reviewed on an 
annual basis. The Remuneration Committee seeks to establish a 
basic salary for each position commensurate with the individual’s 
responsibilities and performance, taking into account comparable 
salaries for similar companies of a similar size in the same market.
deFeRRed boNuS pLAN 
The Deferred Bonus Plan came into effect on 1 July 2013. Executive 
Directors can earn up to 100% of basic annual salary as an annual 
bonus. The plan provides for 50% of an Executive Director’s bonus to 
be mandatorily deferred into ordinary shares in the Company. Under 
these arrangements, bonuses would be based on a percentage of 
the individual Executive Director’s base salary as follows: 
•	 50% of salary for “on target” performance; and 
•	 a further 50% of salary for “out-performance”. 
For example, for achieving 90% of on target performance there 
will be a discretionary bonus of up to 25% of salary (and pro rata 
between 90% and 100% of on target performance) and there will be 
no bonus for less than 90% of on target performance. 
The target is measured by reference to two equally weighted 
performance measures, namely: 
•	 profit before taxation as compared with brokers’ market 
forecasts following the announcement of the preliminary 
results of the previous accounting period; and 
•	 net debt levels. 
once the quantum of the Executive Directors’ bonuses has been 
calculated, these will be settled as to 50% in cash and as to 50% 
by the issue of ordinary shares of the Company. The issue of any 
ordinary shares awarded under the Deferred Bonus Plan will be 
deferred for three years and will be subject to forfeiture in the 
event that an Executive leaves the Company as a “bad leaver”, but 
would not be subject to further performance conditions. 
LoNg t eRm INCeNt Ive pLANS
The Company operates both an unapproved share option scheme, 
which is open to all employees of Inland Homes and the 2013 LTIP 
for the Executive Directors.
Awards under the unapproved share option scheme are made 
on a periodic basis to the Company’s Executive Directors and 
employees. The share options in this scheme vest three years after 
the date of grant and have an exercise period of seven years. The 
schemes are equity-settled.
The following is a summary of the principal features and terms of 
the 2013 LTIP: 
1. Creation of growth Shares 
The plan operates by reference to rights attached to a special 
class of share in a newly established intermediate holding 
company between the Company and the Group’s current trading 
subsidiaries. The special class of shares are called “Growth 
Shares”. The Growth Shares are qualifying shares for the purposes 
of the Employee Shareholder Status scheme, a recently introduced 
proposal by the Government, the aim of which is to provide tax 
benefits to employees and Directors who achieve growth for their 
employing companies.
The vesting of the Growth Shares will be subject to performance 
targets (“Performance Targets”) and when such Performance Targets 
are achieved, a relevant proportion of the Growth Shares will vest.

Our Governance 24303.04    10 November 2015 12:43 PM   proof 6
2. vesting and exchange of growth Shares 
Subject to the Performance Targets being met, the Growth Shares 
will only vest three years after their award and thereafter annually 
if and when each Performance Target is met. After vesting, the 
Growth Shares may be realised by being exchanged for a fixed 
number of the Company’s ordinary shares. 
The Growth Shares will not carry any entitlement to dividends, 
capital or voting unless and until they vest and are exchanged for 
shares in the Company. 
3. performance t argets 
vesting will only occur if specific Performance Targets (which are 
linked to the share price of Inland Homes plc over six consecutive 
performance periods) are met or exceeded for 15 working days 
in the relevant performance period. The first performance period 
ended 20 working days after the announcement of the Company’s 
preliminary results for the year ended 30 June 2014, being  
27 october 2014. The second performance period commenced on 
the day following the expiry of the first performance period and will 
end 20 working days after the announcement of the Company’s 
preliminary results for the year ended 30 June 2015 and so on. 
The target share prices for the 2013 LTIP are based on 
compounded growth being achieved and accordingly, if the 
Performance Target is missed in one period, the participants’ 
awards can still vest if the required compound percentage of 
growth is achieved in subsequent periods. For instance, if in the 
first period the Performance Target for that period is not met, then 
the related number of Growth Shares which could have vested 
may still vest in the following period or periods, provided that the 
Performance Target for those periods is achieved, as the target 
gets increasingly more stretching. 
The first Performance Target was set as a price of 60.5 pence 
per ordinary share (the “First Target Performance Price”), which 
was a 30% premium to the share price of 46.5 pence per ordinary 
share (the “Initial Base Price”), being the mid price at the close of 
business on 20 December 2013, the date 2013 LTIP was adopted. 
The table below shows the accounting periods and the total 
number of ordinary shares in the Company that would be issuable 
on exchange for vested Growth Shares assuming the Performance 
Target for each year of the respective years is achieved:

1 July 2018 10% compounded 1,350,504
11,350,504
dIReCt oRS’ RemuNeRAt IoN Repo Rt CoNt INued
4. dilution 
The total number of shares in the Company which may become 
issuable on the exchange of Growth Shares (assuming vesting in full) 
is 11,350,504, equivalent to 5.6% of the current issued share capital 
of the Company. In order for the maximum of 11,350,504 ordinary 
shares in the Company to become issuable under the 2013 LTIP, 
the price for each Inland Homes ordinary share, in the absence of 
a takeover, will have had to have more than doubled before the end 
of the final performance period (being 20 working days after the 
announcement of the preliminary results for the year ending 30 June 
2019), when compared with the Initial Base Price of 46.5 pence per 
ordinary share. This increase is approximately equivalent to a 14% 
annual compound rise in the ordinary share price. 
5. Change of Control 
The 2013 LTIP will allow realisation from three years after the 
award, provided the Performance Targets have been met. As is 
customary, the 2013 LTIP does provide for early vesting of Growth 
Shares in the event of a takeover of Inland Homes before the expiry 
of the plan, such that all the Growth Shares will vest, provided that 
the offer price is greater than the share price required to achieve 
the Performance Target for the relevant performance period in 
which the takeover occurs. 
6. participants 
The Executive Directors who will participate in the 2013 LTIP and 
their allocations of Growth Shares are as follows: Stephen w icks 
47%, Nishith Malde 38% and Paul Brett 15%. In addition, any 
awards to the Executive Directors under the 2013 LTIP are subject 
to good and bad leaver provisions. 
ot HeR be NeFIt S
Depending on the exact terms of each individual Executive 
Director’s service contract with the Company, they are entitled 
to a range of benefits including either a car allowance or a fully 
expensed company car, contributions to pension schemes, private 
fuel, private health care insurance, permanent health insurance 
and death in service insurance.

All of the Executive Directors are employed on rolling contracts 
subject to one year’s notice from either Inland Homes or the 
Executive Director in relation to Stephen w icks and Nishith Malde, 
and three months’ notice in relation to Paul Brett, and which 
contain confidentiality provisions and restrictive covenants for the 
Company’s protection. 
The Executive Directors’ service contracts do not provide 
specifically for any termination payments, although the Company 
might make payments in lieu of notice. For this purpose, such 
payments would consist of basic salary and other benefits for the 
relevant period and depending on the circumstances, any awards 
due under the 2013 LTIP.

Inland Homes has two independent Non-executive Directors, 
namely Terry Roydon, the Chairman and Head of the Audit 
Committee, and Simon Bennett, Head of the Remuneration 
Committee. Both Non-executive Directors have letters of 
appointment, initially for a three year period and thereafter on six 
months’ notice from either Inland Homes or the individual and 
contain confidentiality provisions for the Company’s benefit.
The Non-executive Directors’ letters of appointment do not provide 
specifically for any termination payments, although the Company 
might make payments in lieu of notice. 
Non-executive Directors’ fees are determined by the Executive 
Directors, having regard to the requirement to attract high calibre 
individuals with the right experience, the time requirements and the 
responsibilities incumbent on an individual acting as a Non-executive 
Director for a company, such as Inland Homes, listed on AIM. The Non-
executive Directors are not eligible for annual discretionary bonuses 
and do not participate in the Company’s long term incentive plans. 
The current service contracts of the Executive Directors, the letters 
of appointment of the Non-executive Directors and the Rules of the 
2013 LTIP are available for inspection at the Company’s registered 
office during normal office hours and at the Company’s Annual 
General Meeting (“AGM”) until the conclusion of the AGM.

A review of the financial results for the year ended 30 June 
2015, as more fully set out in the Chairman’s Statement, the 
Chief Executive’s Review and the Finance Director’s Review, 
demonstrates that Inland Homes has had another year of 
outstanding performance with record profits for the year and a 
£14.5m uplift in investment properties at w ilton Park. The financial 
results have been equally strong with revenue having increased 
by 94% and, excluding the revaluation of investment properties, 
operating profit up 158% and profit before tax for the year up 167%. 
Net assets per share up 48%, which excludes any unrealised 
profits within the land bank and dividends up 67%. 
In light of the excellent results recorded by the Group, the following 
bonuses have been awarded by the Remuneration Committee to 
the Executive Directors, as follows:
Stephen w icks £204,000
Nishith Malde £204,000
Paul Brett £134,000
In accordance with the rules of the Deferred Bonus Plan, further 
details of which are set out above, these bonuses will be settled as 
to 50% in cash and as to 50% in ordinary shares of the Company. 
The ordinary shares awarded in respect of these bonuses will be 
deferred for three years and will be subject to forfeiture in the 
event that an Executive Director leaves the Company as a bad 
leaver, but are not subject to any further performance conditions. 
The award of ordinary shares of the Company will be granted on 
terms that, when they vest, the number of ordinary shares subject 
to the award shall be increased by deeming the net dividends paid 
on the ordinary shares from the date of the award until the date  
of vesting to have been cumulatively reinvested in additional 
ordinary shares.

2013 Lt Ip
The initial price for determination of awards under the 2013 LTIP was 46.5 pence per ordinary share. The share price performance of Inland Homes over the last 18 months has been strong and I can report 
that both the initial performance target of 60.5 pence per ordinary share and the next target performance target of 69.5 pence per ordinary share have now been achieved. As a result, 4,000,000 of the 
11,350,504 ordinary shares, representing approximately 35.2% of the total number of ordinary shares that can be issued in exchange for vested Growth Shares, have now been earned. These shares, which do 
not vest until December 2016, will then be allocated in accordance with the rules of the 2013 LTIP scheme, as follows:
ordinary 
shares of 
10p each
Stephen w icks 1,880,000
Nishith Malde 1,520,000
Paul Brett 600,000
The next target performance target under the 2013 LTIP, to earn the equivalent of a further 2,000,000 ordinary shares, will be achieved once the Inland Homes share price has reached 76.5 pence per ordinary 
share for the qualifying period.

buSINeSS Rev Iew
A review of the development and performance of the business 
during the year and the future outlook of the Group is set out in the 
Chairman’s Statement on page 8 and the Chief Executive’s Review 
on page 26. The Group’s key performance indicators are monitored 
closely by the Board and the details of performance against these 
are on page 24.
FINANCIAL RISk mANAgeme Nt ob JeCt Ive S ANd po LICIeS
All potential areas of financial risk are regularly monitored and 
reviewed by the Directors and management. Any preventative or 
corrective measures are taken as necessary.
The Group uses various financial instruments. These include loans, 
cash and trade receivables that arise directly from its operations. 
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance 
for the Group’s operations.
The existence of these financial instruments exposes the Group to 
a number of financial risks, which are described in more  
detail below.
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are 
liquidity risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and capital risk. The 
Directors review and agree policies for managing each of these 
risks and they are summarised below.
LIQuIdIty RISk
The Group seeks to manage financial risk by ensuring sufficient 
liquidity is available to meet foreseeable needs and to invest cash 
assets safely and profitably.
Flexibility is achieved by loans and overdraft facilities.
INte ReSt RAte RISk
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of equity and 
bank and other borrowings. The Group controls the exposure to 
interest rate fluctuations by ensuring that the level of gearing is 
maintained at a reasonable level.
CRed It RISk
The Group’s principal financial assets are trade and other 
receivables, cash and cash equivalents. The Group trades  
and deals with counterparties after having considered their  
credit rating. In certain circumstances the Group may seek 
additional security.
CApIt AL RISk mANAgeme Nt
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the 
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide 
returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to 
maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may 
adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital 
to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
Consistent with others in the industry, the Group monitors capital 
in relation to overall financing. Further information can be found in 
note 27 to the Group financial statements.

the Long Term Incentive Plan. The total consideration paid  
was £382,000.

The Board has reviewed the performance for the current year and 
forecasts for the future period. It has also considered the risks and 
uncertainties, including credit risk and liquidity risk. The Directors 
have considered the present economic climate, the state of the 
housing market and the current demand for land with planning 
consent. The Group has continued to see an increase in demand 
for consented land in the areas in which it operates. The Group has 
significant forward sales of residential units and is in discussions 
for the sale of some of the land within its projects and expects to 
make sufficient disposals in the foreseeable future to ensure it 
has adequate working capital for its requirements. The Directors 
are satisfied that the Group will generate sufficient cash to meet 
its liabilities as and when they fall due for a period of 12 months 
from signing these financial statements. The Directors therefore 
consider it appropriate to prepare the financial statements on the 
going concern basis.

The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and 
the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors 
have to prepare Group financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by 
the European Union and have elected to prepare Parent Company 
financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards and applicable laws). Under company law the Directors 
must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs and profit or 
loss of the Company and Group for that period. In preparing these 
financial statements, the Directors are required to:
•	 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
•	 make judgements and estimates that are reasonable  
and prudent;
•	 state whether applicable IFRSs have been followed in relation 
to the Group accounts and applicable UK Accounting Standards 
have been followed in relation to the Parent Company accounts, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in 
the financial statements; and
•	 prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 
2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors confirm that:
•	 so far as each Director is aware there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s auditor is unaware; and
•	 the Directors have taken all steps that they ought to have taken 
to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and 
to establish that the auditor is aware of that information.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ 
from legislation in other jurisdictions.

The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the Group financial statements are set out below.
Basis of preparation
The Group financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for certain financial instruments and 
investment properties which are measured at fair value, and in accordance with applicable international f inancial Reporting standards 
(if Rs) as adopted by the EU and as issued by the international accounting standards Board. These financial statements have also been 
prepared in accordance with those parts of the c ompanies act 2006 that are relevant to companies that prepare their financial statements 
in accordance with if Rs.
The accounting policies that have been applied in the opening statement of f inancial Position have also been applied throughout all 
periods presented in these financial statements and this has resulted in a restatement of prior year results where necessary for changes 
in accounting policies which took place. During the period the Group changed its policy for investment properties from a deemed cost 
basis to a fair value basis. The introduction of if Rs 10 has resulted in the requirement for the Group to consolidate the results of DGVl 
into its financial statements, further information on this assessment can be found in note 4. f urther information on the financial impact 
of these changes in accounting policies can be found in note 32. Other than these two areas the accounting policies have been applied on 
a consistent basis. These accounting policies comply with each if Rs that is mandatory for accounting periods ended on 30 June 2015.
as mentioned previously, if Rs 10 became effective during the period and this has resulted in the consolidation of Bucks Developments 
l td (BDl ) and Wilton Park Developments l td (WPDl ), which are not owned by the Group, but where the Group controls the companies. 
as this was the first year that these companies were in existence this has not caused a change in policy from prior years. as if Rs 10 
requires the question of control to be reassessed on an ongoing basis the matter of the consolidation of BDl , WPDl and DGVl will be 
kept under review. f urther information can be found in note 4. c ertain other new standards and interpretations have been issued but are 
not expected to have a material impact on the Group’s financial statements. 
at the date of approval of these financial statements, certain new standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards have 
been published by the ias B but are not yet effective, and have not been adopted early by the Group.
Management anticipates that all of the relevant pronouncements will be adopted in the Group’s accounting policies for the first period 
beginning after the effective date of the pronouncement. information on new standards, amendments and interpretations that are 
expected to be relevant to the Group’s financial statements is provided below. 
Standards in issue but not yet effective
n ew standards and interpretations currently in issue but not effective, based on EU mandatory effective dates, for accounting periods 
commencing on 1 July 2014 are:
•	 Defined Benefit Plans: Employee c ontributions (amendments to ias 19) (EU effective date 1 f ebruary 2015)
•	 annual improvements to if Rss 2010–2012 c ycle (EU effective date 1 f ebruary 2015)
•	 annual improvements to if Rss 2011–2013 c ycle (EU effective date 1 January 2015)
n one of the standards above are expected to have an impact on the Group’s financial statements.

Going concern
The Board has reviewed the performance for the current year and forecasts for the future period. it has also considered the risks and 
uncertainties, including credit risk and liquidity risk. The Directors have considered the present economic climate, the state of the 
housing market and the current demand for land with planning consent. The Group has continued to see an increase in demand for 
consented land in the areas in which it operates. The Group has significant forward sales of residential units and is in discussions for the 
sale of some of the land within its projects and expects to make sufficient disposals in the foreseeable future to ensure it has adequate 
working capital for its requirements. The Directors are satisfied that the Group will generate sufficient cash to meet its liabilities as and 
when they fall due for a period of 12 months from signing these financial statements. The Directors therefore consider it appropriate to 
prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis. 
Basis of consolidation
The Group’s financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the c ompany and all of its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 
30 June 2015. subsidiaries are entities over which the Group is exposed, or has rights to, the variable returns from its involvement with 
the subsidiary and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the subsidiary. The Group obtains and exercises control 
through voting rights, development agreements and option agreements. f urther information can be found in note 4.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its subsidiaries are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless 
the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. amounts reported in the financial statements of subsidiaries 
have been adjusted where necessary to ensure consistency with the accounting policies adopted by the Group.
acquisitions of subsidiaries are dealt with by the acquisition method. The method involves the recognition at fair value of all identifiable 
assets and liabilities, including contingent liabilities and non-controlling interests of the subsidiary, at the acquisition date, regardless 
of whether or not they were recorded in the financial statements of the subsidiary prior to acquisition. On initial recognition, the assets 
and liabilities of the subsidiary are included in the Group statement of f inancial Position at their fair values, which are also used as the 
basis for subsequent measurement in accordance with the Group accounting policies. Goodwill is stated after separating out identifiable 
intangible assets. Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the Group’s share 
of the identifiable net assets and non-controlling interests of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition. 
Joint ventures
Joint ventures are entities in which the Group has shared control with another entity, established by contractual agreement. Jointly 
controlled entities are accounted for using the equity method from the date that the jointly controlled entity commences to the date that 
the joint control of the entity ceases. all subsequent changes to the share of interest in the equity of the joint venture are recognised in 
the Group’s carrying amount of the investment. c hanges resulting from the profit or loss generated by the joint venture are recognised 
in the Group’s carrying amount of the investment. c hanges resulting from the profit or loss generated by the joint venture are reported 
in ‘share of profits of joint venture’ in the Group income statement and therefore affect net results of the Group. These changes include 
subsequent depreciation, amortisation or impairment of the fair value adjustments of assets and liabilities. if the share of losses equals 
its investment, the Group does not recognise further losses, except to the extent that there are amounts receivable that may not be 
recovered or there are further commitments to provide funding. Both realised and unrealised gains on transactions between the Group 
and its joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s investment in joint ventures. Realised and unrealised losses are also 
eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. The accounting policies of the joint 
ventures are consistent with those of the Group.

Business combinations
acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration is measured as the 
aggregate of the fair values (at the date of exchange) of assets given and liabilities incurred or assumed by the Group in exchange for 
control of the acquiree.
identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair 
values at the acquisition date. acquisition related costs are recognised in the Group income statement as incurred.
Revenue
Revenue is measured by reference to the fair value of consideration received or receivable by the Group for goods supplied, excluding VaT 
and trade discounts.
Sale of land
Revenue from the sale of land is recognised on legal completion when all the following conditions have been satisfied:
•	 the Group has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods which is when contracts have been 
completed;
•	 the Group retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership nor effective control 
over the land sold which is when the contract has been completed;
•	 the amount of revenue can be measured reliably;
•	 it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group; and 
•	 the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably. 
Sale of residential units
Revenue is recognised on legal completion, which is when the title passes. 
Contract income
The Group acts as a main contractor on certain building projects, primarily on behalf of housing associations where the Group must 
provide social housing units as part of its s106 obligations under the planning consent. Once the Group considers that the outcome of the 
contract can be reliably estimated, revenue and profit is recognised on the basis of the proportion of the contract that is completed. The 
stage of completion is determined by reference to the valuation certificate provided by a third party surveyor engaged to certify the value 
of works completed at various intervals in respect of the contract sum.
Interest
interest is recognised using the effective interest method which calculates the amortised cost of a financial asset and allocates the 
interest income over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts 
through the expected life of the financial asset to the net carrying amount of the financial asset. 
Rental Income 
Rental income derived from operating leases is recognised on a straight line basis over the lease term. 
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment. 
Disposal of assets
The gain or loss arising on the disposal of an asset is determined as the difference between the disposal proceeds and the carrying 
amount of the asset and is recognised in the Group income statement.
66

Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 June 2015 1. accountin G policies c On Tin UED
depreciation
Depreciation is calculated to write down the cost less estimated residual value of all property, plant and equipment by the straight line 
method where it reflects the basis of consumption of the asset. The rates generally applicable are: 
f ixtures and fittings — 25%
Office equipment — 25%
Motor vehicles — 25% 
l easehold property — Over shorter of lease term and useful economic life 
Material residual value estimates are updated as required, but at least annually.
Investment property
investment properties are those properties which are not occupied by the Group and which are held for long term rental yields, capital 
appreciation or both. investment property also includes property that will be developed for future use as investment property.
investment properties are initially measured at cost, including related transaction costs. at each subsequent reporting date they are 
remeasured to their fair value. Movements in fair value are included in the Group income statement.
subsequent expenditure is capitalised to the asset’s carrying value only where it is probable that the future economic benefits associated 
with the expenditure will flow to the Group.
any gain or loss resulting from the sale of an investment property is immediately recognised in the Group income statement. an 
investment property shall be derecognised on disposal. When the Directors consider that the status of the property has changed to 
being a development property it is transferred to inventories. a property is transferred to inventories when it has been decided that the 
units being constructed will be sold and no future rental income is expected. When a partial disposal or transfer is made, the proportion 
relating to the disposal or transfer is derecognised.
Where the Group employs professional valuers the valuations provided are subject to a comprehensive review to ensure they are based 
on accurate and up-to-date tenancy and market information. Discussions are also held with the valuers to test the valuation assumptions 
applied and comparable evidence utilised to ensure they are appropriate in the circumstances.
Previously the Group carried investment properties at cost and reviewed the carrying amount annually for impairment. This year the 
policy has changed and there has been a restatement of prior year figures as a result.
Inventories
inventories consist of land and work in progress and are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. c ost includes the purchase 
of sites, the cost of infrastructure and construction works, and legal and professional fees incurred during development prior to sale. n et 
realisable value is estimated based upon the future expected selling price, less estimated costs to sell.

Taxation
c urrent tax is the tax currently payable based on taxable profit for the period calculated using tax rates and laws substantively enacted at 
the reporting date. 
Deferred income taxes are calculated using the liability method on temporary differences. Deferred tax is generally provided on the 
difference between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. However, deferred tax is not provided on the initial 
recognition of goodwill, nor on the initial recognition of an asset or liability unless the related transaction is a business combination or 
affects tax or accounting profit. Temporary differences include those associated with shares in subsidiaries and joint ventures unless 
reversal of these temporary differences can be controlled by the Group and it is probable that reversal will not occur in the foreseeable 
future. in addition, tax losses available to be carried forward as well as other income tax credits to the Group are assessed for recognition 
as deferred tax assets. 
Deferred tax liabilities are provided in full, with no discounting. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that the 
underlying deductible temporary differences will be able to be offset against future taxable income. c urrent and deferred tax assets and 
liabilities are calculated at tax rates and laws that are expected to apply to their respective period of realisation, provided they are enacted 
or substantively enacted at the year end date. 
c hanges in deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognised as a component of tax expense in the Group income statement except where 
they relate to items that are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity in which case the related deferred tax is also 
recognised in other comprehensive income or equity respectively. 
Leased assets
l ease payments (excluding costs for services such as insurance and maintenance) applicable to operating leases where substantially all 
the benefits and risks of ownership remain with the lessor are recognised as an expense on a straight line basis over the lease term. 
Employee benefits
Defined contribution retirement benefit scheme
The pension costs charged against operating profits are the contributions payable to the scheme in respect of the accounting period.
Equity-settled share-based payment 
all shared-based payment arrangements are recognised in the Group financial statements. all goods and services received in exchange 
for the grant of any share-based payment are measured at their fair values using the Black–scholes options pricing model for share 
options and the Monte c arlo simulation technique for l TiPs. Where employees are rewarded using share-based payments, the fair values 
of employees’ services are determined indirectly by reference to the fair value of the instrument granted to the employee. This fair value is 
appraised at the grant date and excludes the impact of any non-market vesting conditions. 
all equity-settled share-based payments are ultimately recognised as an expense in the Group income statement with a corresponding 
credit to retained earnings.
if vesting periods or other non-market vesting conditions apply, the expense is allocated over the vesting period, based on the best 
available estimate of the number of share options/l TiPs expected to vest. Estimates are subsequently revised if there is any indication 
that the number of share options/l TiPs expected to vest differs from previous estimates. any cumulative adjustment prior to vesting is 
recognised in the current period. n o adjustment is made to any expense recognised in prior periods if share options/l TiPs ultimately 
exercised are different to that estimated on vesting. 
Upon exercise of share options/l TiPs the proceeds received net of attributed transactions costs are credited to share capital and, where 
appropriate, share premium.

The Executive Directors receive 50% of bonuses in shares which are purchased by the Employee Benefit Trust. The number of shares 
purchased corresponds to the number of shares which would have been able to be purchased at the closing price on 30 June for the 
relevant year. The shares will be transferred to the Directors three years after the period to which they relate. f urther information can be 
found in the remuneration report.
Employee Benefit Trust
The Directors consider that the Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) is under the de facto control of the c ompany as the trustees look to the 
Directors to determine how to dispense the assets. Therefore, the assets and liabilities of the EBT have been consolidated into the Group 
accounts. The EBT’s investment in the c ompany’s shares is eliminated on consolidation and shown as a deduction against equity. any 
assets in the EBT will cease to be recognised in the Group statement of f inancial Position when those assets vest unconditionally in 
identified beneficiaries.
Financial assets
f inancial assets are divided into the following categories: loans and receivables and financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. 
f inancial assets are assigned to the different categories by management on initial recognition, depending on the purpose for which they 
were acquired. 
all financial assets are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. f inancial assets 
other than those categorised as at fair value through profit and loss are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs. f inancial 
assets categorised at fair value through profit or loss are recognised initially at fair value with transaction costs expensed through the 
Group income statement.
f inancial assets at fair value through profit or loss include financial assets that are designated by the entity as at fair value through profit 
or loss upon initial recognition. subsequent to initial recognition, the financial assets included in this category are measured at fair value 
with changes in fair value recognised in the Group income statement. f inancial assets originally designated as financial assets at fair 
value through profit or loss may not be reclassified subsequently. 
l oans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. 
Trade receivables and loans to associate are classified as loans and receivables. l oans and receivables are measured subsequent to 
initial recognition at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. any change in their value through 
impairment or reversal of impairment is recognised in the Group income statement. 
Provision against trade receivables is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due to 
it in accordance with the original terms of those receivables. The amount of the write-down is determined as the difference between the 
asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flow, discounted at the original effective interest rate. 
interest and other income resulting from holding financial assets are recognised in the Group income statement. 
a financial asset is derecognised only where the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or the financial asset is 
transferred and that transfer qualifies for derecognition. a financial asset is transferred if the contractual rights to receive the cash 
flows of the asset have been transferred or the Group retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the asset, but assumes 
a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to one or more recipients. a financial asset that is transferred qualifies for derecognition 
if the Group transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset, or if the Group neither retains nor transfers 
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership but does transfer control of that asset.

Borrowing costs
The Group capitalises borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset as part of 
the cost of that asset where developments are considered to fall under the requirements of ias 23 Borrowing c osts (Revised). Qualifying 
assets are those which are being constructed over a significant period of time. The Directors consider a significant period of time to be 
over 12 months. Otherwise the Group expenses borrowing costs in the period to which they relate through the Group income statement 
using the effective interest method which calculates the amortised cost of a financial asset and allocates the interest income over the 
relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the 
financial asset to the net carrying amount of the financial asset. 
Financial liabilities 
f inancial liabilities are obligations to pay cash or other financial assets and are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument. 
all financial liabilities are recorded at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest-related charges recognised as an 
expense in finance cost in the Group income statement. f inance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and 
direct issue costs, are charged to the Group income statement on an accruals basis using the effective interest method and are added to 
the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
a financial liability is derecognised only when the obligation is extinguished, that is, when the obligation is discharged or cancelled  
or expires. 
Cash and cash equivalents
c ash and c ash equivalents comprise cash in hand and demand deposits, together with other short term, highly liquid investments that 
are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Dividends
Dividend distributions payable to equity shareholders are included in other short term financial liabilities when the dividends are approved 
in a general meeting prior to the year end date. interim dividends are recognised when paid.
Equity
an equity instrument is a contract which evidences a residual interest in the assets after deducting all liabilities. Equity comprises  
the following:
•	 ‘share capital’ represents the nominal value of equity shares;
•	 ‘share premium’ represents the excess over nominal value of the fair value of consideration received for equity shares, net of 
expenses of the share issue;
•	 ‘Employee benefit trust’ represents the purchase of the c ompany’s own shares and are deducted from total equity until they are 
issued to employees under the l ong Term incentive Plan;
•	 ‘special reserve’ represents the distributable surplus created by the transfer of an amount from the share premium to rectify the 
deficit which existed on the profit and loss reserve; and 
•	 ‘Profit and loss reserve’ represents retained profits.

Financial risk factors
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: credit risk; and liquidity risk. The Group’s overall risk management 
programmes focus on the unpredictability of financial markets and seek to minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’s  
financial performance.
Risk management is carried out centrally under policies approved by the Board of Directors.
(a) Credit risk
The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk other than its loans to joint ventures which are secured over the assets of the 
joint ventures. f urther information can be found in notes 14 and 17. it has policies in place to ensure that sales of products and services 
are made to customers with an appropriate credit history.
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying amount of financial assets recognised at the year end date, as summarised 
below:
2015
£000
2014
£000
c lasses of financial assets — carrying amounts
l oans to joint ventures due in more than one year 3,246 —
Trade and other receivables 7,342 10,189 
10,588 10,189 
The Group’s policy is to deal with creditworthy counterparties. 
The Group’s management considers that all the above financial assets for each of the reporting dates under review are of good credit 
quality. The Directors consider that none of the receivables are past due or impaired. 
The credit risk for liquid funds and other short term financial assets is considered negligible, since the counterparties are reputable 
banks with high quality credit ratings.
(b) Liquidity risk
Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash balances and ensuring availability of funding through an adequate 
amount of credit facilities. The Group aims to maintain flexibility in funding by keeping credit lines available. The Group also purchases 
property under deferred consideration arrangements. 
3. se GMent infor Mation
in accordance with if Rs 8, information is disclosed to enable users of financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of 
the business activities in which the Group engages. 
in identifying its operating segments, management differentiates between land sales, housebuilding, rental income and other income. 
These segments are based on the information reported to the chief operating decision maker and represent the activities which generate 
significant revenues, profits and use of resources within the Group. an analysis of the Group’s results by segment are disclosed in note 5.

4. critical accountin G esti Mates and Jud GeMents 
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historic experience and other factors, including expectations of 
future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. 
Critical accounting estimates
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, rarely equal 
the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are outlined below. 
(a) Valuation of inventories
in applying the Group’s accounting policy for the valuation of inventories the Directors are required to assess the expected selling 
price and costs to sell each of the plots or units that constitute the Group’s land bank and work in progress. c ost includes the cost of 
acquisition of sites, the cost of infrastructure and construction works, and legal and professional fees incurred during development prior 
to sale. Estimation of the selling price is subject to significant inherent uncertainties, in particular the prediction of future trends in the 
market value of land. 
Whilst the Directors exercise due care and attention to make reasonable estimates, taking into account all available information in 
estimating the future selling price, the estimates will, in all likelihood, differ from the actual selling prices achieved in future periods and 
these differences may, in certain circumstances, be very significant. The critical judgement in respect of receipt of planning consent (see 
below) further increases the level of estimation uncertainty in this area. 
(b) Income taxes
The Group recognises tax/deferred tax assets and liabilities for anticipated tax based on estimates of when the tax/deferred tax will be 
paid or recovered. When the final outcome of these matters is different from the amounts initially recorded, such differences impact the 
period in which the determination is made. c ritical accounting estimates relate to the profit forecasts used to determine the extent to 
which deferred tax assets are recognised from available losses and the period over which they are estimated. 
(c) Fair value of derivatives and other financial instruments 
The fair value of instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation techniques. The Group uses its 
judgement to select a variety of methods and makes assumptions that are mainly based on market conditions existing. 
(d) Fair value of investment properties 
The fair value of completed investment property is determined by independent valuation experts using the open market value of existing 
use method, subject to current leases and restrictions, as this has been assessed currently as the best use of these assets. investment 
properties awaiting construction are valued by the Directors using an appraisal system; critical accounting estimates relate to the 
forecasts prepared in order to assess the carrying value. This system has been used to establish the fair value of the investment property 
in Poole when restating the results of 2014 and 2013.
(e) Fair value of assets and liabilities acquired with business combinations
The fair value of assets and liabilities is determined by the Directors at the date of acquisition using residual valuation model for property 
assets,the recoverable amount for debtors and the discounted cash flow method for deferred consideration of inventories in accordance 
with ias 39. c ritical accounting estimates relate to the experience of the Directors in reaching their valuations and the cost of debt capital 
used as an appropriate discount rate.
(f) Discounting on deferred consideration of inventories 
The Group discounts deferred consideration of inventories using the discounted cash flow method; the Group considers that the cost of 
debt capital is the most appropriate discount rate and this is a significant estimate.

Critical judgements in applying the entity’s accounting policies 
Inventories
The Group values inventories at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The net realisable value is based on the judgement of the 
probability that planning consent will be granted for each site. The Group believes that, based on the Directors’ experience, planning 
consent will be given. if planning consent was not achieved then a provision may be required against inventories.  
Zero dividend preference shares 
The Group has in issue Zero Dividend Preference shares which are accounted for as a debt. ZDP shares are repayable, plus accrued 
interest to date, in the event of a takeover. The Directors consider that the potential early repayment meets the definition of a derivative 
instrument under ias 39. However, they consider that this instrument is closely related to the host contract and therefore have not 
accounted for the embedded derivative separately. 
Consolidation of Drayton Garden Village Limited
in December 2008 the Group entered into an Option and Development services agreement (the agreement) with DGVl . 
The Board has reviewed the requirements of if Rs 10, to assess whether the Group controls DGVl and has concluded that, although it 
does not own any of its share capital it does control DGVl because of the nature of the contractual arrangements between the Group and 
DGVl . in particular:
•	 The Group has power over DGVl because it has the practical ability to direct the relevant activities that significantly affect DGVl ’s 
returns. such relevant activities would include obtaining planning permission to develop the site and subsequently managing the 
property to realise its value. The Group also has an option to acquire the share capital of DGVl which provides it with a mechanism by 
which it can direct the relevant activities.
•	 The services that the Group provides to DGVl and the arrangement by which the Group receives its fees are such that it has rights to 
variable returns as a result of its involvement in delivering the various property services to DGVl . The Group is entitled to 90% of the 
profits from the project at Drayton Garden Village and thus provides it with a very significant part of the returns generated from its 
involvement with DGVl .
•	 The Group also has the ability to use its power to affect its returns by virtue of its involvement with DGVl . 
in view of the above the Group believes that it had control over DGVl from the date it entered into the agreement with DGVl and has 
therefore consolidated the results and financial position of DGVl within the Group accounts. accordingly, the comparatives with prior 
years have been restated. see note 32 for further details.
Consolidation of Bucks Developments Ltd and Wilton Park Developments Ltd
in December 2014, the Group entered into an Option with WPDl . The Option entitles the Group to acquire land from WPDl within ten 
days of the date that the land is released from the vendor’s charge, as payment of deferred consideration is made by WPDl to the vendor 
and this could be before any decisions about the relevant activities take place. The terms of the option allow the Group to purchase the 
land from WPDl at a price of cost plus 20% plus indexation. The Directors have considered the requirements of if Rs 10 ‘c onsolidated 
f inancial statements’ and have consolidated WPDl as part of these results from the date the Option was granted. The Directors are 
of the opinion that the Group controls WPDl , and therefore also its parent undertaking BDl , as it has an option to acquire the only 
significant asset of that group and because these entities were incorporated solely for the purpose of purchasing the land under Option.

Investment in joint ventures
The Group’s joint venture investments in aston c linton s.a.R.l . and Project Helix Holdco l imited (Project Helix) are not in equal share 
(the Group owns 10% of the share capital of aston c linton s.a.R.l . and 20% of the share capital of Project Helix); however, the Group 
has joint control over the activities of the companies with the other parties due to its entitlement to veto any decisions. in addition, the 
Group and the other parties to the agreements only have rights to the net assets of these companies through the terms of the contractual 
arrangements. With aston c linton s.a.R.l . the Group is entitled to 50% of the net assets and with Project Helix there is a ratchet 
mechanism which depends on the amount of profit each development contributes to the joint venture. Therefore, these entities are 
classified as joint ventures and are accounted for using the equity method.

The different valuation method levels are defined below.
l evel 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
l evel 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in l evel 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or 
indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
l evel 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
These levels are specified in accordance with if Rs 13 f air Value Measurement. Our property valuation approach and process is set out 
within the ‘Valuation and sensitivity’ section of this note below. Property valuations are inherently subjective as they are made on the basis 
of assumptions made by the valuer which may not prove to be accurate. f or these reasons we have classified the investment property 
valuations as l evel 3 as defined by if Rs 13.
The Group’s policy is to recognise transfers between fair value hierarchy levels as of the date of the event or change in circumstances that 
caused the transfer. There have been no transfers during the period.
at 30 June 2015, the Group’s investment properties were valued at £34m (2014 restated: £11.8m) and the historical costs were £12.3m 
(2014: £1.1m).
During the year the Board took the decision to change the accounting policy for investment properties from a ‘deemed cost’ basis to a 
‘fair value’ basis. f urther information on the effects of this change can be found in note 32.
During the year a decision was made to build 65 homes at Poole for sale to the public. Therefore, a transfer at a fair value of £3.8m was 
made to inventories to reflect this decision. The direct operating expenses for the period arising from the investment property was £nil 
(2014: £nil). The investment property generated no rental income during the period and is being held as an investment property as the 
Directors intend to let the land or construct rental properties on the site.
Both the Poole and Wilton Park investment properties are pledged as security on borrowings.
Valuation and sensitivity
The Group’s residential investment properties were valued by an independent external valuer, c luttons ll P, on the basis of ‘existing 
use’ in accordance with the Valuation standards, Guidance n otes and appendices contained in the Rics Valuation — UK & Global 
(January 2014). The valuer used the comparable method of valuation involving the assimilation of relevant lettings, as well as analysing 
data obtained from internet based research in order to form an opinion of annualised market rent for the entire portfolio, by property 
type. a similar method was used to ascertain the capital values of the properties, but with sales information used rather than lettings 
information. a discount was then applied to the capital value to ensure a minimum rental yield of 4%.
if market rental values decreased by 5% this would result in a reduction in fair value of £1.25m.
The Group’s development property at Poole is now carried at fair value which has been established using an internal appraisal model 
based on the ‘residual method’. The inputs for this model are the market value of units to be constructed in accordance with the planning 
permission, the costs of any housebuilding, infrastructure, local authority fees and professional fees. The market value of the units has 
been assumed to be at a similar level to the prices obtained by the Group on earlier phases of the same development for similar property 
types. Housebuilding and infrastructure costs have been forecast using costs incurred by the Group on this or other similar developments 
with an allowance for cost increases. l ocal authority fees were agreed at the time of the signing of the planning permission and are 
therefore known costs. Professional fees are input using costs incurred on similar projects and finance holding costs are the Group’s cost 
of debt capital. Using a profit margin of 20% this generated a land value for the remaining site of £8m. The Directors are of the opinion 
that developing the site reflects the highest and best use of this asset.

as a residual valuation model is used, if house prices were to fall by 5% this would result in a reduction in fair value of £2.2m in order to 
maintain a profit margin of 20% on the development. if costs should increase by 5% this would result in a reduction in fair value of £1.8m 
in order to maintain the required 20% profit margin.

On 18 December 2008, inland entered into an Option and Development services agreement with DGVl which granted inland l imited an 
option for a consideration of £250,000 to purchase the share capital of DGVl at an exercise price of £1. although the Group consolidates 
DGVl , none of the share capital is owned by the Group and the payments for the option were made to the shareholder of DGVl , not to 
DGVl itself. The initial period of the option was for one year from the date of the agreement and this could be extended on up to four 
occasions to a maximum period of ten years by making further payments. During the years ended 30 June 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 
2014, the option period was extended to expire on 15 January 2019 for a total consideration of £1,200,000. in accordance with the Group’s 
accounting policy for financial assets, the option has been measured at fair value at 30 June 2015, which resulted in a fair value loss 
of £541,000 (2014: loss of £822,000) which has been recognised in the Group income statement, resulting in the option being valued 
at £1,200,000 less than the actual consideration paid for the option. The fair value of the option has decreased as the profits are being 
realised and are available for distribution to the shareholder of DGVl . 
The Group’s joint venture in c roxley Green, Hertfordshire came to an end during the year ended 30 June 2014. The Group’s 50% share of 
the profits after tax for the year ended 30 June 2014 amounted to £613,000 and has been recognised in the Group income statement.

Deferred income tax assets are recognised for tax losses carried forward to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit 
through future taxable profits is probable. The Group has capital losses amounting to £24,783,000 (2014 restated: £36,202,000) that have 
not been recognised as the Directors consider the realisation of the losses is not expected to crystallise in the future.

During the year, a total of £79,841,000 (2014: £42,857,000) of inventories was included in the Group income statement as an expense. The 
Group conducted a review of the net realisable value of its land bank in view of current market conditions. Where the estimated future net 
realisable value of the site is less than the carrying value within the Group statement of f inancial Position, the Group has impaired the land 
value. This has resulted in an impairment of £300,000 (2014: £nil). included in the value of inventories above is £7.4m (2014: £13.6m) which 
is carried at fair value less costs to sell (net realisable value). The amount of inventories pledged as security against borrowings is £70.1m 
(2014: £61.1m). Within inventories is land transferred from investments properties at a fair value of £3.8m.

27. capital Mana GeMent policies and procedures 
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are:
•	 to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other 
stakeholders; and
•	 to ensure sufficient liquid resources are available to meet the funding requirement of its projects and to fund new projects where 
identified.
This is achieved through ensuring sufficient bank and other facilities are in place; further details are given in note 28 to the Group 
financial statements. The Group monitors capital on the basis of the carrying amount of the equity less cash and cash equivalents as 
presented on the face of the Group statement of f inancial Position.
The movement in the capital to overall financing ratio is shown below. The target capital to overall financing ratio has been set by the 
Directors at 40% and results over this amount are considered to be a good performance against the target.

The Group manages the capital structure and makes adjustments in light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics 
of the underlying assets. in order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the level of dividends paid to 
shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
Every quarter the Group must report to the ZDP shareholders that the covenants attached to the ZDP shares have not been breached. 
The most significant covenant is the gearing ratio which is calculated as adjusted gross assets:financial indebtedness. This covenant 
is monitored on a monthly basis by the Board and has not been breached at any time. f urther details can be found in the inland ZDP 
Prospectus on the c ompany’s website at www.inlandhomes.co.uk/inland-zdp-plc.

28. financial assets and liabilities c On Tin UED
The following tables present financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in the Group statement of f inancial Position in 
accordance with the fair value hierarchy. This hierarchy groups financial assets and liabilities into three levels, based on the significance 
of inputs used in measuring the fair value of the financial assets and liabilities. The fair value hierarchy has the following levels:
l evel 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
l evel 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in l evel 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or 
indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
l evel 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
The level within which the financial asset or liability is classified is determined based on the lowest level of significant input to the fair 
value measurement.
The financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in the Group statement of f inancial Position are grouped into the fair value 
hierarchy as follows:

(a) Listed securities and debentures
all the listed equity securities and debentures are denominated in sterling and are publicly traded in the United Kingdom. f air values 
have been determined by reference to their quoted mid prices at the reporting date. The ZDP shares are carried at their accrued value of 
120.20p per share (2014: 111.34p); however, their closing price on the main market of the l ondon stock Exchange on 30 June 2015 was 
132.75p (2014: 124.00p).
(b) Assets not based on observable market data
The option to purchase the share of DGVl is measured at fair value using an option valuing model. However, during the year the Directors 
decided that, as the project is nearing an end and the profits are available for the shareholder of DGVl to extract, that option no longer 
has a fair value and the entire value should be written off.

32. chan Ge in accountin G policies 
During the year the Group changed its investment property accounting policy from a ‘deemed cost’ basis to a ‘fair value’ basis. f urther 
information on the valuation methods used can be found in note 13. The Directors are of the opinion that the revaluation model gives a 
more accurate reflection of the value of the investment properties held by the Group. The Group also adopted if Rs 10 and this resulted 
in the consolidation of DGVl . f urther information on the reasons for this change can be found in note 4. The impact of these changes in 
policy on each line item of the Group income statement, Group statement of f inancial Position and Group statement of c ash f lows for 
the current and the prior year is shown in the table below for investment properties and for the prior year only for the adoption of if Rs 10

Shareholder Information
Strategic Report
Our Financials 1. principal accountin G policies 
Basis of preparation 
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards and under the historic 
cost convention. The Directors have reviewed the principal accounting policies and consider they remain the most appropriate for the 
c ompany. The principal accounting policies of the c ompany have remained unchanged from the previous year. 
Investments
investments are included at cost less amounts written off. 
Equity-settled share-based payment
all share-based payment arrangements are recognised in the financial statements.
all goods and services received in exchange for the grant of any share-based payment are measured at their fair values using the Black–
scholes options pricing model or the Monte c arlo simulation. Where employees are rewarded using share-based payments, the fair 
values of employees’ services are determined indirectly by reference to the fair value of the instrument granted to the employee. This fair 
value is appraised at the grant date and excludes the impact of any non-market vesting conditions.
all equity-settled share-based payments are ultimately recognised as an expense in the profit and loss account with a corresponding 
credit to reserves brought forward.
if vesting periods or other non-market vesting conditions apply, the expense is allocated over the vesting period, based on the best 
available estimate of the number of share options expected to vest. Estimates are subsequently revised if there is any indication that the 
number of share options/growth shares expected to vest differs from previous estimates. any cumulative adjustment prior to vesting is 
recognised in the current period. n o adjustment is made to any expense recognised in prior periods if share options ultimately exercised 
are different to that estimated on vesting.
Upon exercise of share options the proceeds received net of attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital and, where 
appropriate, share premium. 
Employee benefit trust
The Directors consider that the Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) is under the de facto control of the c ompany as the trustees look to the 
Directors to determine how to dispense the assets. Therefore, the assets and liabilities of the EBT have been consolidated into the 
c ompany accounts. The EBT’s investment in the c ompany’s shares is eliminated on consolidation and shown as a deduction against 
equity. any assets in the EBT will cease to be recognised in the c ompany Balance sheet when those assets vest unconditionally in 
identified beneficiaries.
Deferred taxation 
Deferred tax is recognised on all timing differences where the transactions or events that give the c ompany an obligation to pay more tax 
in the future, or a right to pay less tax in the future, have occurred by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets are recognised when 
it is more likely than not that they will be recovered. Deferred tax is measured using rates of tax that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date on an undiscounted basis.

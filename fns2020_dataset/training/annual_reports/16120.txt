CHAIRMAN’S LETTER
Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to inform you that we have made excellent progress for the period, as our ambitious performance objectives 
have been achieved for yet another year.
We indicated back in mid June 2012, that having restored a healthy momentum to the Group by then reporting a profit of £5.0 
million, that we would aim to double profits by mid June 2015 and would have a well established progressive dividend policy.
By reporting an underlying pre-tax profit of £9.2 million for the year ended March 2014, it seems clear that we are well on 
our way to this doubling of profit aspiration by the same time next year; however, after the 2013–14 reporting period, on  
30 May 2014 shareholders approved the acquisition of Viterie Italia Centrale (VIC) in Italy for an initial £22.5 million funded 
mainly by bank debt, thus considerably adding to the next year’s profit performance with minimal shareholder dilution — and 
so, potentially, considerably outperforming our 2015 forecast made three years earlier.
Our strategy over the past three years has primarily been to drive organic growth via the six elements of our Group  
business model:
•	 Combining our low cost Asian manufacturing with global distribution logistics — both supported by engineering design 
and application to multi site/multi-nationals in Europe, Asia and the USA. By the end of this reporting year we had achieved 
Approved Supplier status with over 40 multi-national customers — each of whom projecting multi-million dollar annual 
fastener and Category ‘C’ component purchasing budgets 
•	 Own brand specialist fasteners — for sheet metal and plastics selling internationally to both OEMs and distributors
•	 TR Direct — 24 hour UK delivery of standard DIN fasteners to OEMs offering competitive pricing and guaranteed quality 
and service levels 
•	 Lancaster Fastener — 24 hour UK and EU delivery of a wide range of standard and specialised fasteners promoted by an 
extensive online and printed catalogue that is regularly updated with new product ranges 
•	 Plastic fasteners and spacing pillars — promoted throughout the Group and just completed its successful second year 
since launch 
•	 Highly engineered manufacturing licences — investments have been made within the period for both existing and newly 
developed fastener drives and thread forms aimed to improve OEM assembly time or component weight. These tangibly 
support our reputation, status and growth within the automotive, electronics and domestic appliance customer sectors 
It has also been our mission to supplement steady organic growth with a sustained search for the ‘right’ acquisition to extend 
our geographic and product range and customer base. However, our target business has to be profitable, cash generative and  
self-managing with strong leadership — plus have a realistic independent growth strategy for the foreseeable future. This 
demanding requirement was met in late 2011 the acquisition of Power Steel & Electro Plating works (PSEP) in Malaysia, and we 
are delighted that this was again met 30 months later at the end of May 2014 by the VIC acquisition. We accept that we apply 
extremely strict criteria to acquisitions, and so we are grateful to colleagues and shareholders for their forbearance and patience 
throughout our search and selection process.
During the period, the UK TR Fastenings Board of Directors, under the leadership of Dave Fisk (UK MD) and mentorship 
of Geoff Budd (MD — TR Europe), has taken full responsibility for the strategy, policies and operations of what has hitherto 
been half of the Group’s revenue, thus allowing the Main Board to focus more on acquisition activity and other aspects of 
Group strategy. In fact, all of our Group’s country and business location directors and managers have successfully risen to the 
demanding challenges of continuing to improve their operating margins, inventory management and cash generation, and so, 
to them and their hard working teams, I offer my sincere respect and grateful thanks.
Trifast has historically been categorised by the LSE as a Fledgling PLC, but with our improved share price and trading liquidity, 
we achieved a promotion to the Small Cap index on 23 June 2014, thus making us eligible to be a Tracker Fund investment 
and so possibly enhancing our value.
Finally, thank you for your loyalty and support as a valued investor in our Company, and I very much look forward to keeping 
you updated as we continue our further exciting development.
Malcolm Diamond MBE 
Executive Chairman

TR’S MULTI FACETED BUSINESS MODEL
Stock Code: TRI
Trifast plc Annual Report 2014
08 23401.04 28 July 2014 6:24 PM Proof 8
The fastener supply sector, both 
nationally and globally, is extremely 
fragmented, with no company able 
to claim either market dominance or 
brand leadership. However, the global 
market is estimated to be around £50 
billion per annum — and growing — of 
which we have assumed that £25 billion 
falls within our target customer sector 
capability.
This has given Trifast an ideal 
opportunity during the past five years to 
develop both a strategy and a market 
reputation to be able to ‘stand out from 
the crowd’ within our sector.
We started to realise that we were 
on the right track back in 2010 
when several multi-national OEMs 
in electronics and Tier 1 automotive 
conducted quality and environmental 
audits on our Singapore and Taiwan 
factories.
Not only did our factories pass these 
audits — which then led on to TR being 
nominated as ‘Preferred Vendors’ on 
a global basis, but we also received 
feedback that these major fastener 
buyers had benchmarked us against 
several other multi-national fastener 
suppliers and found that TR had  
unique advantages:
•	 Low cost/high quality manufacturing 
capability
•	 Distribution logistics capability in over 
50 countries across three continents
•	 Design and application engineers 
available to customers on site
The reason for being assessed as 
unique is that, although we are not the 
largest global supplier, no other player 
appears to combine an equal capability 
in manufacturing, lean distribution and 
on-site engineering resources.
In early 2010 our sales teams had been 
given a challenge to secure long term 
supply relationships with 30 multi-
national OEMs that had, as an absolute 
minimum, a £500k annual spend on 
fasteners and other ‘consumable’ 
components.
This target of 30 customers was met by 
mid 2012, and by year end March 2014 
this number was over 40; moreover, 
with some multi-nationals operating as 
many as 200 assembly sites around the 
world, our initial aim of £500k spend 
per company now looks decidedly 
conservative. Our OEM multi-national 
activities now account for over a third of 
Group revenue.
However, there is so much more to TR’s 
key strengths than just successfully 
supplying multi-national OEMs, as we 
blend sales growth of historically strong 
branded products for sheet metal and 
plastics with new initiatives on product 
ranges and technical design innovations 
for lower cost assembly techniques. 
These dynamics are further enhanced 
by our ongoing geographic expansion 
within Europe and Asia.
Our annual recruitment 
of young, well educated 
apprentices ensures that we 
enjoy the benefits of new 
blood bringing in fresh ideas”
Our Company profile has been 
substantially raised in recent years, 
as has our reputation for being fair, 
trustworthy and reliable — which has 
been so reassuringly fed back to us by 
many of our staff, customers, suppliers 
and shareholders. We believe that this 
is why we are regularly approached by 
potential vendors of fastener businesses 
around the world, with genuine 
reasons for wanting us to acquire 
their business, perhaps because of 
the founder’s lack of an heir, a major 
shareholder needing to liquidate their 
assets or because there is a realisation 
that survival and growth increasingly 
depends on being global. Our recent 
additions of PSEP in Malaysia and VIC 
in Italy are prime examples of how high 
quality manufacturers have been such 
welcome assets to support our future 
aspirations for strong growth, deriving 
from the drive of competent and 
ambitious team leaders around  
the Group.
Key strengths of any business clearly 
rely on quality products and services at 
competitive prices being offered to the 
appropriate markets; however, they fade 
into relative insignificance without being 
managed and motivated by the right 
people. We try very hard to encourage 
our people to grow their confidence 
and skills by personal training and 
development, and by avoiding the 
stifling of enthusiasm and initiative 
by micro management. Their loyalty 
and dedication is clearly indicated by 
the fact that around 40% of our staff 
have been with us for over ten years. 
Our annual recruitment of young, well 
educated apprentices ensures that we 
enjoy the benefits of new blood bringing 
in fresh ideas, alongside the stability 
and knowledge provided by older 
colleagues.
Without doubt Trifast is a people 
business before any other asset.

PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES AND 
BUSINESS REVIEW
The principal activity of the Group during 
the financial year has been that of the 
manufacture and distribution of industrial 
fastenings and category ‘C’ components.
A review of the business activity and future 
prospects of the Group are covered in the 
Chairman’s & CEO’s Statement and the 
Directors’ Business Review. 
A balanced and comprehensive review of 
the development and performance of the 
Group and its position at the year end is 
given on page 12 to 20.
A description of the principal risks 
and uncertainties facing the Group is 
discussed on page 26 to 27.
A description of the main trends and 
factors likely to affect future development 
is given on page 26 to 27.
Information on environmental and social 
issues is provided on page 32 to 39.
The key assumptions underlying the going 
concern basis of preparation are included 
on page 99. 
POLICY AND PRACTICE ON 
PAYMENT OF CREDITORS
The Group does not follow any code or 
standard on payment practice as it is the 
Group’s policy to settle creditors promptly 
on mutually agreed terms. The terms will 
vary from supplier to supplier and suppliers 
will be aware of the terms of payment.
For smaller suppliers where no terms are 
agreed, payment will normally be made in 
the month following receipt of goods or 
services. 
The number of days purchases in trade 
payables at the end of the financial year for 
the Company was 55 (2013: 56) and  
56 (2013: 61) for the Group.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Information in respect of the Group’s 
policies on financial risk management 
objectives including policies to manage 
credit risk, liquidity risk and foreign 
currency risk are given in note 26 to the

CHAIRMAN’S & CEO’S STATEMENT
The Trifast Board, management and staff take pride in reporting an impressive track 
record of Total Shareholder Return (TSR) since early 2009, especially when compared to 
the two relevant FTSE indices shown below for the same period.
1000%

In March 2009, the share price was languishing at around 8p; during this year being 
reported, the share price traded between 57p and 87p giving a market capitalisation at 
31 March 2014 of £94.6 million (1 April 2013: £61.7m). As at 12 June 2014 the Group’s 
share price closed at 127p, thus taking the market capitalisation from below £10 million 
in 2009 to over £141 million. This quantum leap in value is testament that our investors 
support our growth strategy and aspirations (recently underpinned with our largest 
acquisition in history which extends our offering and European footprint). This together 
with reasonable ongoing share trading liquidity has enabled Trifast shares to be promoted 
from the Fledgling index to be included within the FTSE Small Cap and FTSE All-share 
indices, from 23 June 2014. This inclusion widens the category of potential institutional 
investors. We consider that our enhanced profile coupled with our tangibly progressive 
dividend policy has positioned us firmly within the investor fraternity, whilst providing 
powerful motivation to our entire workforce to drive the business even harder for the 
immediate and medium term future.

BUSINESS OVERVIEW
Whilst pleased with this year’s organic 
growth results, we have openly expressed 
our objective to accelerate expansion 
by strategic acquisitions; we have also 
committed to applying strict criteria 
to the structure and current/potential 
performance of selected targets. Although 
at any one time there is always at least 
one target under scrutiny, our selectivity 
clearly restricts our commitment to 
finalising a transaction; however, there are 
sufficient opportunities in our market for 
us to remain confident that continuing our 
search remains entirely legitimate. 
This search for the ‘right’ acquisition has 
been highly active over a two year period 
since acquiring PSEP in Malaysia at the 
end of the 2011 calendar, and post the 
financial year end culminated in extending 
our business through the acquisition of 
Viterie Italia Centrale Srl (‘VIC’) in Italy 
which we completed on 30 May 2014. 
More detail about this acquisition can be 
found on pages 19 and 50.
Meanwhile, our ongoing ‘self help’ 
initiatives continue to make material 
improvements around the business 
particularly with gross margins — thus 
providing tangible impetus to our ongoing 
financial progress.
WHERE OUR ORGANIC GROWTH 
‘HOTSPOTS’ ARE DEVELOPING
ASEAN Region (comprises Singapore, 
Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, 
Philippines and Indonesia)
The ASEAN Free Trade Area (‘AFTA’) is 
now revealing opportunities for TR as new 
factory investments are starting to favour 
the region, sometimes as an alternative to 
China. Part of local government incentives 
depend on the requirement for new 
participating beneficiary companies to 
source a minimum of 40% of materials and 
components from within the AFTA region. 
TR has two fastener factories in Malaysia 
and one in Singapore, thus providing a 
steady flow of potential new assembly 
customers moving into the region — 
sometimes from China.
For this reason, TR has strengthened 
personnel resources by setting up a 
subsidiary in Thailand and has registered 
for VAT in order to allow local currency 
invoicing. Our main sector targets are 
automotive (two and four wheel) and 
electronics (mainly consumer).
Once again, we congratulate 
and thank all of our colleagues 
around the world for these 
outstanding results yielded with 
less than a 1% increase in staff 
numbers employed”
Taiwan
Our operation in this region, Special 
Fasteners Engineering Co Ltd (‘SFE’) is 
already a strategic supplier to fastener 
distributors in Europe and the USA 
plus TR Fastenings as a group. Due to 
competitive pricing, quality and service for 
manufacturing specialised components, 
SFE is enjoying both full capacity and 
sufficient Return On Capital Employed 
(‘ROCE’) to actively seek opportunities to 
increase capacity of both buildings and 
plant, and these initiatives have gained full 
Trifast Board support.
Shanghai
Following extensive product and 
engineering training from TR colleagues 
in Europe last year, our Shanghai team 
(TR Formac) is gaining increasing 
business from sister plants of our existing 
automotive Tier 1 customers who are 
already long established with TR within 
Europe. This validates one of our core 
growth strategies set five years ago to 
develop global multi-national assembly 
customers that we can follow from 
country to country. The rising cost-driven 
trend for the major car manufacturers 
to establish ‘global platforms’ (the most 
costly component to developing the 
main floor pan) for example, the new 
imminent Ford medium saloon broadens 
our opportunities to offer common 
platform components, such as reclining 
seat bolts on a global basis ultimately to 
plants in Asia, Europe and the USA where 
uniformity of price, quality and availability is 
a minimum requirement to gain orders.
Shanghai is also gaining the benefit from 
mobile phone base station renewals as 
4G technology supplants 3G, where the 
hardware is substantially different.
Our forecasting for the next three years 
reflects our confidence in the ongoing 
growth from both automotive and 
electronics sector dynamics within China.

Singapore
Despite being in a high cost country, TR 
Formac Singapore continues to deliver 
strong margins, and for this reason 
our earlier thoughts of transferring the 
manufacturing facility across the border to 
Malaysia have been discounted as we now 
focus on new customer potential around 
the AFTA region, with particular emphasis 
on South Korea and Thailand.
Malaysia
Power Steel & Electroplating Works 
SDN (Bhd) (‘PSEP’) continues to expand 
its capabilities with high tech larger 
components as a key resource within 
TR, especially to automotive customers. 
Sales activity is now beginning to embrace 
Thailand as a key future potential  
market opportunity.
In order to prepare for anticipated 
expansion of demand for safety critical 
automotive components in the region, 
approval has been given for investing in an 
additional new large diameter cold forging 
machine to be installed.
This £1 million machine is a ‘Best of 
Breed’ multi-stage parts former weighing 
42 tonnes. Manufactured in Japan this 
investment will provide a quantum leap in 
our production capability with regard to 
complexity and accuracy of customised 
components.
USA
Our relatively new Houston location for 
TR Fastenings Inc continues to expand 
its resources, both with extra personnel 
and enlarged warehousing; we anticipate 
that there will be a year of consolidation 
in order to service the emergence of 
automotive opportunities arising from the 
increasing globalisation of component 
specification where TR already is supplying 
sister plants in Europe and Asia.

Following on from an excellent 
performance in the year under review, 
all of our UK, Ireland and mainland 
European business teams expect this 
trend to continue, driven substantially by 
automotive new model production start 
dates running from mid-2014 into 2015 
as a result of exhaustive work involving 
concept and application engineering, 
estimating, quoting, prototyping and 
component testing undertaken as far back 
as winter 2012. Although the development 
cycle of new specifications can be as long 
as two years or more before production 
invoicing commences, these types of 
contracts tend to run for the lifetime of the 
vehicle, typically five to seven years. As 
a result, this restricts competitive activity 
to a relatively limited number of fastener 
suppliers who have the financial and 
engineering resources to cope with this 
level of complexity and delay, and even 
less, who can offer support on a global 
scale. We believe that this limited choice 
of alternatives to TR has, and continues to 
contribute to our organic growth.

TR Sweden had a particularly good 
year in terms of sales growth, profit and 
cash generation. This was in both the 
automotive and telecoms sectors, and TR 
Holland likewise enjoyed sales growth both 
in automotive and domestic appliances, 
whilst TR Hungary’s growth has been 
predominantly in electronics.
The only division that has struggled is 
TR Norway, mainly due to the demise 
of traditional business emigrating to 
lower cost countries. However, much 
preparatory work has been done both on 
the supply and sales side to develop our 
business into the oil and gas industries 
which are so prevalent in the Norwegian 
economy; this new diversification is also 
proving to be relevant to our Scottish 
and Houston teams. We expect this 
sector focus switch to begin yielding both 
revenue and profit positive results  
by mid 2015.
Meanwhile, the electronics and white 
goods sectors show tangible evidence 
of recovery within Europe, which TR 
should benefit from, due to its strong 
presence in the electronics sector and the 
recent acquisition of VIC which operates 
predominantly in the white goods sector.
‘CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT’
In last year’s Report we highlighted the 
focus on sales, profit and cash, and also 
the adoption of the 80/20 Pareto Principle 
by each of the 15 UK and mainland 
Europe business team locations. This has 
been a major contributor to the profitability 
and cash generation improvement across 
all of these business teams and is now a 
constituent part of our routine operational 
disciplines and processes. This concept 
that ‘80% of our results come from 20% 
of our activity’ has been widely accepted 
and is part of our induction and training 
programmes for everyone in the business.
It was also indicated that more sales 
applications engineers would be recruited; 
since then, we have added four new 
and experienced experts to the global 
automotive team. With clear geographic 
segmentation and targeted product 
category sales activity these developments 
and strategy rollout are reflected in this 
year’s results. The product launch of 
plastic fasteners as a stand-alone new 
sector has proven very successful and has 
become a meaningful part of our growth 
strategy that is measured and reported to 
the Board on a monthly basis.

Ongoing margin improvement has been 
achieved by innovative Group sourcing 
policies, key vendor consolidation and 
freight and packaging efficiencies. Further 
software enhancements to our global sales 
enquiry portal during last year is enabling 
all new major Group potential contracts 
to be monitored at Board level at the time 
of quoting. This is a risk management 
process to ensure that our teams resist 
any price pressure that could result in 
them being tempted to apply sub-optimal 
margins in order to gain an order more 
easily. This direct ‘power of veto’ has been 
the main driver behind cost modelling 
enhancements and improving buy/sell 
margins with major OEM customers. 
Our mission is to sell ‘total installed cost 
reduction’, whilst the actual component 
price is usually only a small part of  
that equation. 
It is for this reason that our marketing 
strategy for large volume OEM assemblers 
has been focused on senior management 
who are in a position to calculate the 
indirect costs of ‘Goods In’ processing 
and storage, deployment of components 
to the line, the cost of shortages and 
quality issues to production continuity, 
and the benefits of TR engineers assisting 
in new product optimum design and 
application. Whereas the procurement 
personnel are invariably only measured on 
price, which during the recent prolonged 
five year downturn has forced many 
component producers out of business. 
The irony that is developing, as recovery 
now slowly builds momentum, is that there 
are clear signs of restricted capacity in 
some component sectors, thus inevitably 
replacing the focus on lowest price with 
best availability. It is for this reason that 
the Board consider further investment in 
production capacity is timely.
Management development and succession 
planning is progressing on two levels. 
The TR Fastenings UK Board that was 
established in June 2013 has met regularly 
and proven effective in co-ordinating 
the key functions of sales, inventory 
management, finance, quality, HR and 
IT. The Management Development 
Programme for all UK and European 
Business Unit Managers is providing 
the dual benefit of improving overall 
business skills and awareness whilst at 
the same time enhancing the teamwork 
across numerous locations, an essential 
requirement for effectively supporting 
sister plants of multi-national OEMs where 
consistency of service, quality and price is a 
minimum in gaining preferred vendor status.
GROUP STRATEGIC OVERVIEW 
The global fastener market has been 
estimated to exceed £25 billion per year 
and growing at a CAGR of 5% until 
2022; therefore, current market share 
for Trifast is not a fundamentally relevant 
metric, but nevertheless clearly points 
to the huge opportunities ahead for 
growth by marketing our relatively unique 
combination of low cost/high quality 
manufacturing, global logistics resources 
and engineering design and application — 
predominantly to global OEMs.
Although supplying multi-national OEMs 
is our foundation business model that 
currently yields 40% of Group revenue, this 
strategy is underpinned by five additional 
target markets (previously described as 
‘strings to our bow’).

These are:
•	 TR Branded products  
(specialised components for sheet 
metal, PCBs and plastic mouldings) 
supplied mainly to distributors in the 
UK, Europe and the USA
•	 TR Direct 
standardised ‘off the shelf’ fasteners for 
next day delivery to OEMs in the UK
•	 Lancaster Fastener Company 
expanding range of catalogued 
standard and specialised fasteners for 
next day delivery to distributors in the 
UK, Europe and beyond
•	 Plastic fasteners and spacers 
for global OEMs — available both from 
inventory and to customer specification
•	 Manufacturing licences 
acquired for specialised highly 
engineered large volume fastener 
applications for automotive and 
electronics OEM multi-nationals
The Management team is confident that 
this combination of strategic and dynamic 
business streams is not only driving our 
current organic growth, but will continue to 
do so for the foreseeable future; moreover, 
as the fastener supply sector remains 
highly fragmented, there is ample scope 
for consolidation by acquisition.
Following the successful acquisition of 
Malaysian based PSEP in December 
2011, the Board has committed to the 
ongoing search for additional earnings 
enhancing acquisitions that deliver both 
a cultural and strategic fit with TR. During 
the year, we engaged closely with two 
opportunities, one a European distributor 
and the other, a US based manufacturer.
Although both were eminently strong 
culturally and strategically, unfortunately, 
after due diligence was undertaken, we 
failed to complete the transactions on the 
basis of current profitability and inadequate 
strategic and tactical resources for forward 
profit growth.

We are very clear in openly declaring that 
we do not want to risk investor funds with 
turnaround requirements where either 
there is a lack of current operational 
profitability or competent incumbent 
management in order to financially justify 
growth by acquisition. Our search has 
continued for targets that ‘add value’ for 
minimal risk.
POST YEAR END ACQUISITION
Following extensive research and 
individual assessments of potential 
targets as explained above, shareholder 
approval was granted on 30 May 2014 for 
completion on the Class 1 acquisition of 
Viterie Italia Centrale Srl in Italy (normally 
referred to as ‘VIC’). Summarising the key 
facts relating to VIC, below is an extract 
from our RNS announcement released 
from the London Stock Exchange on 
Tuesday, 6 May 2014:
•	 VIC is complementary to the Group’s 
business model and significantly 
strengthens TR’s presence in the 
domestic appliance market whilst also 
offering TR additional opportunities in 
existing electronic and automotive  
Tier 1 markets
•	 Funded from a new bank facility 
and minimal dilution arising from the 
allotment of consideration shares to  
the vendor
•	 A technological innovator, VIC is 
utilising its ‘know-how’ and customised 
approach in fastening applications 
gained from its leading position in 
the white goods industry and taking 
it into different markets, including the 
automotive and electronics sectors
•	 VIC has grown rapidly through 
integration and diversification of its 
product since its formation in 1964
•	 VIC offers tailor-made solutions and 
a highly efficient logistics service to a 
strong customer base
•	 Long-standing relationships and key 
customers encompass Europe’s 
leading manufacturers of white goods, 
including Indesit, Whirlpool, Electrolux, 
Elica, BSH Bosch and Siemens
•	 VIC’s operational management team will 
benefit from Trifast’s global sales and 
marketing resources 
•	 Acquisition will extend the Group’s 
customer base as well as increasing 
TR’s overall business with limited overlap
•	 Significant opportunity to grow 
the enlarged business consistent 
with Trifast’s strategy and grow the 
combined businesses by selectively 
investing in new facilities, plant  
and machinery
•	 VIC will form a key additional part of 
Trifast’s future expansion by providing 
an additional competitive manufacturing 
facility in Europe to complement the 
Group’s existing resources in Asia
•	 VIC will be earnings enhancing, self-
managing without the need  
for synergies 
The feedback on this transaction has been 
extremely positive, with highlights being 
the logical strategic fit, the immediate 
earnings enhancement, the broadening 
of our domestic appliance customer 
sector and the introduction of major 
manufacturing capability into Europe 
— thus offering short lead times and 
protection from EU anti-dumping threats  
in the future.
This clearly had a positive impact on the 
share price. 
IT’S ALL ABOUT OUR PEOPLE
The Board of Directors is under no 
illusions as to what is driving us forward 
in size, capability and profit, and so for 
that reason, we are in awe of what our 
TR management and their teams are 
achieving, and so offer our heartfelt 
appreciation and thanks for their 
unflinching efforts and ‘can do’ attitude.
We welcome also our new colleagues 
in Italy to the TR portfolio — we were 
delighted to receive resounding support 
from our investors at the end of May to 
enable us to complete the acquisition — 
we look forward to working with the team, 
sharing ideas, skills and resources.

OUTLOOK
The Directors are pleased to report that 
the business is continuing to benefit from 
the uplift in economic confidence and 
manufacturing output, this is being seen 
across a number of our key sectors and 
across our business units. TR’s focus 
on overhead control remains key whilst 
also balancing our investment for future 
growth; cash management continues to 
be highly effective and the balance sheet 
remains strong. We will continue to pursue 
opportunities to add geographic coverage, 
product range and customers to the  
TR footprint.
The Group entered this new financial 
year with confidence and enthusiasm; to 
date, underlying organic growth has been 
encouraging and this has been bolstered by 
the introduction of VIC into the Group and 
the opportunities that this brings. 
Management remains confident that we 
can continue to deliver another strong 
performance and we look forward to 
keeping all stakeholders updated with  
our progress.

FINANCIAL REVIEW continued
UK, Europe and USA all showed strong, organic growth in excess of 10%. The UK 
continues to benefit from the resurgence from the automotive sector as well as the 
general macro-economic outlook. Holland and Sweden also benefitted from the growth 
in automotive, whereas Hungary grew by 18% on the back of its electronic sales. Within 
Asia, although revenue was down 1.3%, this part of our business delivered an impressive 
performance which included ‘back-filling’ the end of two sizeable component supply 
contracts, which we highlighted in last year’s Annual Report and delivering a set of results 
which was adversely affected by the weakening of the Asian currencies. Malaysia’s 
currency for instance, weakened by 16% against Sterling, Singapore 11%, China 10% 
and Taiwan 12% respectively. The effect of this was a reduction in Asian revenue of £0.89 
million; at constant currency the result would have shown a small growth for the Asian 
region. 
Despite this foreign exchange impact on revenue, the Asian profitability has witnessed 
strong growth as shown below.
With the exception of USA, which has been investing in additional resources to support 
their potential future growth, the other regions have showed respective increases in 
their operating margins. Underlying operating profit was up by 21.7% to £9.70 million, 
which has been achieved by increasing gross profit margins by 170pbs to 27.7% 
(2013: 26.0%), whilst maintaining overheads at around 20% of revenue and an average 
headcount increase of only 1%. 
Net financing costs fell by a quarter to £0.53 million (2013: £0.72m) reflecting the 
reduction in gross debt in the UK and Asian regions. 
Overall this resulted in an increase in underlying profit before tax of £9.16 million (2013: 
£7.25m) representing 7.1% of revenue (2013: 6.0% of revenue). 
TAXATION
Taxation in the period was £2.28 million (2013: £1.73m), which equates to an Effective 
Tax Rate (‘ETR’) of 25.6% (2013: 26.9%) — the decrease being assisted by the reduction 
in the UK tax rate. The Group’s blended tax rate based on the geographical regimes was 
20.9% (2013: 21.3%).

BALANCE SHEET
Despite the Group’s increase in retained profit during the period, the net assets were 
only marginally up by 2.1% to £61.67 million (2013: £60.42m), as foreign exchange 
translation, largely resulting from the weakening Asian currencies reduced the Group’s 
assets by £5.08 million. This consequently also impacted working capital which, as a 
percentage of sales, reduced significantly during the year from 30% to 26%, resulting in a 
positive effect on operating cash flow.
Cash generated from operations in the period was £11.83 million (2013: £7.87m) with net 
cash generated of £10.02 million (2013: £6.44m).
There was a decrease in the Group’ s property, plant and equipment to £11.83 million (2013: 
£13.36 million), which represents 11.4% of the Group’ s total assets. Intangible assets 
reduced to £16.96 million (2013: £18.37m). 
The monitoring of inventory levels remains a priority and at the end of the year being 
reported, levels were consistent with the previous year at £30.57 million (2013: £30.44m). 
Net inventory weeks were 19.1 (2013: 20.2). Debtor days improved slightly at 65 days 
(2013: 67). Total bad debt charge for the year was £0.15 million (2013: £0.29m). 
Modest capital expenditure of £0.84 million, predominantly within our ASEAN operations was 
at similar levels to last year. It is envisaged that during this current financial year ending 2015 
further increased investment will be made, particularly at our T aiwanese and Malaysian sites.

POST BALANCE SHEET EVENT
On 30 May 2014, the Group acquired 
the entire issued capital stock of Viterie 
Italia Centrale Srl (‘VIC’) for an aggregate 
consideration of €27.00 million  
(£22.50 million). 
The consideration for the acquisition 
comprised €24.15 million (£20.12 million) 
payable in cash on completion of the 
acquisition and €2.85 million (£2.38 
million) to be represented by the issue and 
allotment of 3,000,000 shares of 5 pence 
each in Trifast plc, subject to adjustment in 
the event that the agreed level of working 
capital was not left in VIC at completion. 
Under Italian law, the capital stock of VIC 
is represented solely by ‘quotas’ rather 
than shares, and Trifast will be purchasing 
the entire issued capital stock of VIC.
In addition, it was agreed that a further 
payment may become due to the vendors 
of VIC (the ‘Vendors’) depending on 
the performance of VIC over the twelve 
month period ending on 31 December 
2014. If VIC generates a post-tax profit 
(as defined in the Acquisition Agreement) 
for the year ending 31 December 2014 
which exceeds €3,000,000, then for 
each €1 above this sum an additional €5 
is payable to the Vendors, subject to a 
maximum amount of €5,000,000. This 
sum would be paid once the post-tax 
profit has been calculated in accordance 
with the Acquisition Agreement. Until such 
time as these additional monies have been 
paid in accordance with the Acquisition 
Agreement, any warranty or indemnity 
claims can be off-set (if proved or settled) 
against monies due to be paid, and if any 
claim is not settled or resolved an amount 
can be withheld from the monies paid until 
this matter is resolved.
I would personally like 
to acknowledge the 
finance teams around the 
business who support 
and add value to the TR

GROUP BANKING
The Group had combined facilities within 
the UK of £23.30 million at 31 March 2014 
and the business traded well within its 
facilities and covenants.
In May 2014, the Group agreed new 
additional banking facilities with HSBC, 
comprising:
•	 a term loan facility of up to €25.00 
million (‘Facility A’) used to fund the 
acquisition of VIC; and
•	 a revolving, multi-currency credit facility 
(RCF) of up to £10.00 million (‘Facility 
B’), replacing the existing £5.00 million 
RCF.
The obligations of Trifast under Facility 
A and Facility B (the ‘Facilities’) are 
guaranteed by the UK non-dormant 
subsidiaries of the Company.
Facility A is repayable in semi-annual 
instalments of €1.25 million on 31 October 
2014, 30 April 2015, 31 October 2015,  
30 April 2016 and 31 October 2016; then 
at the rate of €2.50 million payable on  
30 April 2017, 31 October 2017, 30 April 
2018 and 31 October 2018, with the final 
balance being payable on the date five 
years after the date of the facility.
Interest on the Facilities is charged at the 
aggregate rate of LIBOR/EURIBOR plus 
a margin (initially 2.40%), ratcheted from 
six months after drawdown in accordance 
with a formula incorporating the ratio of 
consolidated net debt of the Group against 
the consolidated EBITDA of the Group.
RETURN ON CAPITAL EMPLOYED
ROCE remains a key driver, therefore it is 
pleasing to report that this has increased 
to 16.3% (2013: 12.1%) reflecting the 
increase in operating profit and the 
Group’s success in cash generation, 
giving the Group a net cash position at the 
period end. 
EARNINGS PER SHARE
The adjusted diluted earnings per share 
(‘EPS’) which, in the Directors’ opinion, 
best reflects the underlying performance 
of the Group rose by 25.8% to 5.95 pence 
(2013: 4.73p). Basic earnings per share 
increased by 38.5% to 6.08 pence (2013: 
4.39p).
DIVIDEND
Subject to Shareholder approval at the 
Annual General Meeting which is to be 
held on 18 September 2014, the Directors 
are proposing a final dividend of 1.00 
pence per share. This together with the 
interim dividend for 0.40 pence (paid on 
18 April 2014) brings the total of the year 
to 1.40 pence an increase of 75% on prior 
year (2013: 0.80p).
The final dividend will be paid on  
17 October 2014 to Shareholders on 
the Register at the close of business on 
27 June 2014. The Ordinary shares will 
become ex-dividend on 25 June 2014. 
PEOPLE
I would personally like to acknowledge the 
finance teams around the business who 
support and add value to the TR business 
teams by delivering timely information and 
analytics which assist them to improve 
their overall understanding of their 
performance. I look forward to working 
with them all over the coming year.

HOW THE BUSINESS MANAGES RISK
In common with all businesses the Group faces risks which may affect its performance. The Board recognises that the management 
of risk is required to enable the business objective in creating ‘stakeholder value’.
The Board and the Operational Management teams regularly monitor and develop a range of financial and non-ﬁnancial performance 
indicators to allow them to measure performance against expected targets – these can be analysed under various categories; the 
following represents a selection of these indicators.

TR’S KEY PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES REMAIN ONGOING:-
KEY RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES MITIGATION
PERSONNEL  
The Group’s employees are its key asset as their skills and commitment 
provide the solid foundation that is important in delivering our future 
plans and long term success.
Training forms a key part of an individuals’ personal development plan — 
with a clear HR strategy in place we operate an ongoing programme of 
rolling out new initiatives and modules to support both the Group’s business 
plans and the personal goals of all our staff.
The Group also has in place an ‘emergency plan’ to cover short term 
issues, however the Group has also developed its ‘Succession Planning 
Module’ which provides detailed plans in the event of, for example, loss 
of key personnel; including key officers who the Board consider to be ‘the 
next generation’ leaders. In circumstances where more specialist skills at 
a senior/operational or Board level are needed, learning programmes and 
development modules are instigated to assist with career development and 
learning pathways and added to personal development programmes which 
are undertaken internally or externally by suitably qualified personnel.
QUALITY AND MANUFACTURING  
The Group operates stringent ‘Total Quality Management’ (TQM) 
procedures and measures its performance.
TR manufactures around 30% of its inventory, the balance being sourced 
from strategic manufacturing partners. As with key customers, TR regularly 
visit manufacturing operations to ensure that high standard operating 
procedure guidelines which cover production, security, logistics and quality 
are being adhered to.
CURRENCY  
The business is exposed to currency movements relating to sales, 
purchases and cash borrowings particularly against the US Dollar and 
the Euro.
Currently, as far as practicable, TR hedges operationally but monitors 
exchange rates and will buy and sell currencies in order to minimise its 
exposure. It is also reviewing instruments available through its banking 
partners to reduce the Group’s open exposure to foreign exchange rates.
GLOBAL PROTECTIONISM  
Increasing evidence of growing trade protectionism around the world. Geographically spread our supply chain sources.

KEY RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES MITIGATION
WORKING CAPITAL AND INVENTORIES  
As the business continues to grow TR is required to carry additional 
inventory to meet its transactional and OEM business which could lead 
to an increased exposure to obsolete inventory.
From TR’s involvement at the R&D entry point through the production life of a 
product and customer underwrite forms, control of obsolete inventory risk is 
kept to a minimum. The ongoing tight control over inventory purchases has 
seen us once again report a reduction in inventory weeks.
CUSTOMER FAILURE AND DEBTOR EXPOSURE  
Serving over 5,000 customers in 50 countries bring complexity and 
inventory challenges.
The business operates very tight controls on debtors and working capital. 
Monitoring systems and reports in place assist in highlighting and managing 
debtor defaults and customers’ trading; the impact of these controls is 
reﬂected in the reported accounts which show less than 5% Group exposure 
in balances overdue.
MACRO ECONOMICS  
Currently Group revenue comes from across the UK (49%) and Asia 
(30%) with the balance from Europe and the Americas.
Traditionally, whilst the distribution/manufacturing sectors bear the affect 
of inventory reduction in tough and challenging economic periods, TR 
protects itself to some extent from this by differentiating itself through 
‘added value’ capabilities, such as, high levels of service, design & 
engineering support, customer partnerships and working practices.
The Global sales team and the Group’s purchasing strategy provides TR with 
the opportunity to secure a larger market share despite a possible repeated 
reduction in overall market size; as previously stated in earlier publications, 
should another economic downturn be experienced across the world and 
TR was to secure as much as 1% of the global market it would see £500 
million sales, so growth aspirations continue to be legitimate.
RAW MATERIAL PRICE INFLATION  
Industrial businesses have to contend with ﬂuctuating material prices, 
energy and freight costs, as well as ‘cost down’ pressures and inventory 
obsolescence.
The Group is exposed to raw material price increases in relation to steel, 
plastics and fuel. TR is able to monitor costs effectively and has the ability to 
pass on cost increases to customers, although in the current markets there 
can be a ‘lag’ as old inventories and contracts feed through and new supply 
prices take effect.
COMPETITOR PRESSURES  
TR benchmarks its operations and services against several leading logistics 
providers, both in and outside its sector to ensure it remains competitive in 
its service offering.
As part of TR’s business objectives it regularly addresses its logistics 
systems and focuses on reducing resource duplication where possible.
CYBER SECURITY  
The Group recognise there is an increased exposure to cyber risk. Group management has undertaken reviews and engaged the services 
of a third party company to review the Group’s cyber risk controls. 
Recommendations have been put in place where required.

CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
INTRODUCTION
The key objective of the Group’s Directors 
and Operational Management teams is to 
remain focused on delivering ‘Continuous 
Improvement’ in relation to the overall 
objectives and ‘performance measurables’ 
for the business units. We adhere to 
high standards laid down in policies that 
deliver the best outcome for individual 
business teams, locations and, indeed, 
our suppliers and customers. The same 
approach is applied to our corporate social 
and business sustainability policies.
Our key Group objectives embrace 
Health & Safety, energy consumption 
within our operations, fleet vehicle fuel 
consumption and emissions, wasteful 
packaging, personnel travel, flexibility for 
staff compassionate leave (combined with 
pastoral care), ethical sourcing and supply 
chain freight logistics.
As stakeholders are aware, an increasing 
number of multi-national customers now 
undertake audits when validating potential 
new suppliers, therefore, our responsibility 
to further develop our own corporate 
social and business sustainability activities 
continues to evolve and extends beyond 
business ethics, environmental and 
community to include essential major 
customer compliance.
At local level, we encourage ‘loaning’ of 
staff, or other relevant Company resources 
to, for example, local charities, youth 
organisations, and hospices in order 
to assist and support them with their 
community activities. We consider that this 
approach adds more value, appreciation 
and satisfaction to all involved wherever 
possible, rather than indulging in ‘cheque 
book charity’.
TR has developed close links with local 
educational facilities across the spectrum 
and actively promotes opportunities for 
work experience, classroom seminars, 
pupil and staff visits as we believe that 
this generally fosters a better level of 
understanding between TR as potential 
employers and the future providers of 
possible applicants for employment. 
For example, IMAGE our Apprenticeship 
scheme and NVQ Business studies 
programme at TR Uckfield has given 
opportunities to a group of young 
local people who wanted to enter the 
workplace rather than proceed to further 
education. Now in its fourth year, this 
successful module is to be rolled out to 
other locations and we are very pleased 
to say that from this scheme we have 
developed a group of young enthusiastic 
people who have acquired new skills and 
understanding, and who are now using 
these to add value throughout the Uckfield 
business unit. They have acted as TR 
ambassadors and visited local schools 
to support our programme, as part of 
their own career and life development 
programme. As a business, we fully 
endorse the UK Government in its aim 
to support and encourage businesses to 
offer apprenticeship schemes for young 
people, to ensure that we encourage a 
steady inflow of ‘new blood’ into industry 
and that they can be trained to learn and 
become the next generation of business 
leaders.
THE BUSINESS AND  
THE COMMUNITY
Trifast recognises the role local 
communities play in our businesses. 
We aspire to be a responsible partner 
in the communities in which we operate 
around the world. We encourage all our 
businesses to support the particular needs 
of their communities by contributing to 
local charities and community initiatives.
Most of our financial contributions 
to charities come from the effort and 
personal involvement of our staff around 
the Group, with tangible support from the 
Directors with regard to allowing flexible 
working, auctions, dressing up days and 
the use of our premises for fund raising. 
Not only does this provide real benefits 
to local communities but has the distinct 
advantage of further enhancing team spirit 
amongst our staff.

BUSINESS ETHICS
All of the Group’ s business activities are 
expected to be conducted in accordance 
with high standards of ethical conduct and 
full compliance with all applicable national 
and international laws. We apply these 
standards to all dealings with customers, 
suppliers, employees and all other 
stakeholders.
Our ‘Code of Business Ethics and 
Responsible Behaviour’ provides a guide 
to the way we achieve our business goals, 
helping us to behave in an open and 
ethical manner. This extends to provisions 
for ‘whistleblowing’ whereby employees 
may report suspected wrongdoings in 
confidence. Appropriate ethical behaviour is 
reviewed as part of the Group’ s performance 
appraisal process. We have extended this 
Code to our vendors/suppliers.
This requires our key strategic suppliers to 
work towards achieving, as a minimum, 
standards covering such issues as the 
environment, employee Health & Safety 
and the prohibition of child labour, which 
through business reviews and on-site 
visits, encourages compliance and good 
practice within our supply chain.
We will also do our utmost to contract 
only with sub-contractors or suppliers 
who themselves adhere to international 
human rights and environmental laws and 
practices. TR commits to monitor the 
ethical performance of its key suppliers 
and to taking immediate steps in cases 
where the ethical performance of its key 
suppliers comes into question. 
We are constantly improving our business impact on the environment
Appropriate ethical 
behaviour is reviewed 
as part of the Group’s 
performance appraisal 
process”

1.2 BUSINESS ETHICS
TR Fastenings expect all of our business activities to be carried out in accordance 
with high standards of ethical conduct and full compliance with all relevant 
national and international laws.
To achieve this we require suppliers to comply with all applicable legislative 
requirements in relation to labour and ethics. We expect suppliers to have a 
written policy, details of an implementation programme, and contact details for 
responsible persons available upon request.
1.3 HEALTH & SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
TR Fastenings runs a robust and well established system of Health & Safety 
and Environmental Management throughout the Company, which demands 
compliance with all laws and ISO14001 where applicable. 
TR Fastenings routinely audits, assesses, monitors and carries out training to 
ensure that our Policy and strategy are implemented effectively.
Our suppliers are required to comply with all relevant national and international 
laws. Suppliers must be able to provide evidence of policies, risk assessments, 
insurances, licences, contact details, accident/incident figures, and any other 
legally applicable documentation upon request.
1.4 COMMUNITY
As a global company TR Fastenings recognises the role that communities play in 
our business. We encourage all areas of our Company to support the needs of 
their local community by contributing to local charities and community initiatives.
We also encourage our suppliers to support their local communities, and expect 
that evidence of this is available upon request.
CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY continued
All key suppliers to the business are required 
to agree and sign our comprehensive 
‘Quality and Sustainability Agreement’ 
before entering into a trading relationship 
with TR. 
This agreement fully covers the suppliers 
Business Ethics, Health & Safety and 
Environmental Management with regard to 
national and international laws (including 
labour and ethics) along with submission 
of their written policy and contact details 
of the person(s) responsible within their 
organisation. 
We also encourage suppliers to support 
their local communities and expect 
evidence of this to be available on request, 
plus we require all suppliers to sign 
separate corporate social responsibility 
and business sustainability statements.

ENVIRONMENT
Good environmental practice and the 
impact that our operations have on the 
environment are of great importance to TR.
The main aim of the Group’s Environmental 
Policy is to comply with all relevant 
legislation in all areas in which we operate 
and to adopt responsible environmental 
practices. We have established a process 
for monitoring legislation and acting 
upon it where necessary. Business 
units are required to comply with Group 
policy and local statutory regulations, 
and are committed to setting their own 
environmental targets such as improving 
energy efficiency, reducing waste and 
increasing recycling in conjunction with 
Group objectives. 
•	 In respect of waste management 
specifically, we use the services of an 
external professional agency to manage 
and monitor activities using health check 
compliance audits and advice on data 
collection systems. Promoting recycling, 
we follow the agency’s recommendation 
for appropriate waste disposal
•	 Group performance and risk reviews 
are undertaken via Management 
Review on a regular basis and reported 
directly to Jim Barker, Chief Executive 
who has Main Board responsibility for 
the Group’s Environmental Risk Policy. 
TR will communicate any significant 
environmental impact with third parties 
on request
•	 Our Fleet Manager focuses on 
manufacturers who can supply vehicles 
with below average carbon emissions
•	 Our Logistics Managers continuously 
review the efficiency of our van delivery 
routes in conjunction with customers 
in order to examine opportunities 
to reduce delivery frequency, and 
where appropriate, to outsource ‘far 
flung isolated’ routes to daily delivery 
freight specialists. This has resulted 
in our van fleet being reduced by 
25% since March 2009 — this has 
delivered significantly reduced mileage, 
costs and carbon emissions. The TR 
Uckfield office and warehouse facility 
has begun to recoup the capital cost 
(first of four year target set last year) in 
energy savings and reduce the actual 
carbon footprint since the investment in 
replacement HVAC 
•	 The utilisation of video conferencing 
systems around the business continues 
to assist us to significantly reduce costs 
and ‘lost time’ from staff travel needed 
in a multi-site operation involving 31 
business teams located in 16 countries
ENVIRONMENTAL STATEMENT
TR seeks to prevent, mitigate and 
remediate any harmful effects its 
operations have on the environment. 
The aim of the TR Group Environmental 
Policy is to manage our impact on climate 
change. Our worldwide facilities are 
required to operate to the Group policy, 
global standards, and local statutory 
regulations. We promote environmental 
awareness throughout the business via 
these standards. 
The ISO4001 certification was renewed 
in a number of TR locations. TR locations 
that are not certified are stringently audited 
to the ISO14001 standard annually. TR 
had no environmental incidents reported in 
the 2013/ 2014 reporting period.
Our impact on the environment is minimal. 
Water usage is confined to workplace 
cleaning and hygiene, electricity usage in 
the distribution facilities is for lighting and 
office utilities and gas usage is primarily 
for warehouse and factory heating. Waste 
packaging and transport fuel consumption 
is a KPI of the business with measures, 
monitors, reviews and actions  
reported monthly.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPROVEMENTS
As per the TR ISO14001 register of 
significant impacts, the major impacts are 
the volume of packaging waste produced 
and the fuel used by our delivery vehicles.
•	 Through various recycling and reduction 
initiatives we have reduced our waste 
costs over the last three years from 
£6.00 per 100 product lines delivered 
in 2011 to £1.00 per 100 product lines 
delivered in 2013
•	 In 2011 a major project commenced to 
review the required number of delivery 
vehicles needed to run the business 
verses the impact on the environment 
that the vehicles have. Delivery vehicles 
are an intrinsic necessity of a successful 
distribution business therefore the 
strategy is to ensure that the minimum 
number of vehicles are utilised 
effectively
•	 In 2011 the TR delivery fleet consisted 
of 32 vehicles travelling 1.67 miles 
per product line picked, in 2013 we 
are now travelling 1.15 miles per line 
picked with 26 vehicles; this equates to 
a 19% reduction in the vehicle fleet. In 
the same period we have experienced 
a 66% increase of product lines picked 
per month
EMPLOYEES 
Our employees are our greatest asset 
and we recognise that the Company’s 
performance and its success within our 
market place is directly related to the 
effectiveness of our people, who deliver 
the high quality service, technical expertise 
and product quality across our 5,000+

attract, retain and motivate the highest 
calibre of employees within a structure that 
encourages their development and initiative.
Employees are provided with ongoing 
learning and development opportunities 
that are aligned to the Group’ s strategic 
and business units’ objectives, and formal 
personal development programmes operate 
where linked to the Group’ s objectives.
To retain and add to the skills of our 
dedicated and committed workforce, we 
continue to enhance our HR resources 
through professional managers and 
technology, so as to provide an 
all-encompassing HR tool for each staff 
member that identifies and meets their 
future training, personal development and 
support services.
All of these processes are reinforced with 
appropriate remuneration incentives and 
are on recognised systems.

CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY continued
During the year, the lead team at Trifast 
continued the ‘TQM Tour’, a highly 
successful communications module 
re-introduced in 2010. It involves visiting 
business locations at least once a year 
in order to interact with the staff and 
operational management teams so as 
to keep them updated on the Group’s 
progress and performance in some 
detail. This approach has encouraged 
interaction and open dialogue, questions 
and feedback on all aspects of the 
business and its plans, and we are always 
encouraged by the interest shown across 
all levels of the business — we have been 
able to work with our colleagues and 
ensure that as a team we create the right 
environment to develop our people and 
overall productivity.
Our Group marketing team works in 
partnership around the business, both 
at home and overseas, designing and 
distributing multilingual material to support 
local market activities as well as internal 
news publications that help to keep our 
people informed about, for example, 
new business wins, exhibitions plus job 
functions and profiles of colleagues around 
the globe.
In addition they work with the senior 
management and external agencies 
on projects that assist the profiling of 
the business both commercially and 
for all stakeholders. During the year, TR 
marketing supported colleagues at a 
number of trade events helping to underpin 
the strength of the TR brand and its global 
capabilities and offering.
The Group believes that utilising electronic 
communications (where appropriate to 
do so) delivers savings to the Company 
in terms of administration, printing and 
postage, as well as environmental benefits 
such as through a reduction in energy and 
paper and consumption of inks. The Board 
supports this ethos; Trifast is not proposing 
to bulk print future Financial Reports. 
Copies can however be specifically 
requested by individuals and shareholders; 
pdf copies will be available to view and 
download from the investor website in 
a timely manner following release to the 
market. The management team also 
consider that using this methodology 
speeds up the provision of information to 
existing and potential new institutional and 
private client shareholders.
HEALTH AND SAFETY
Trifast is committed to ensuring the health, 
safety and welfare of all employees and 
sub-contract activities within the Group, 
by complying with all relevant Health 
and Safety legislation, regulations and 
approved codes of practice.
We have detailed the Health and Safety 
responsibilities of all employees throughout 
the Group, and have appointed key 
individuals at every place of business, 
who are responsible for ensuring that 
the standards laid out by the Director of 
Quality in the Company Health and Safety 
Policy, are maintained at all times.
The Managing Directors and divisional 
General Managers are supported by 
the Business Process Manager, they 
work together to ensure regular risk 
assessments and internal audits are 
completed regularly, our audits are 
reinforced by the use of our British Safety 
Council membership. All business units 
provide their employees with relevant 
Health and Safety training. Risks identified, 
audit non-compliances discovered and 
accidents reported become a part of 
the Quality Management system and are 
investigated utilising root cause analysis 
methods. This has been set up to ensure 
that corrective and preventative actions are 
robust and effective.
Our Health and Safety Policy places 
responsibility for the management of 
Health and Safety on the individual 
business unit management, who are 
supported by the Business Process 
Manager and divisional Health and Safety 
representatives.
Monthly Health and Safety reports are 
submitted and discussed as a standard 
agenda point at all Main Board meetings.
We continue to work towards our target of 
1 million accident free working hours, and 
have so far achieved 479,655 hours. In the 
financial year 2013/2014 the accident rate 
per average head count was 0.02% hours 
lost due to reportable incidents.

OVERVIEW — ASIA
ROUND-UP OF THE ASIA BUSINESS
TR Asia has produced yet another year of 
creditable results. Operating profit grew by 
19.5% against the previous year as a result 
of emphasis being placed on improving 
profit margins. During the year we 
experienced strong growth coming from the 
automotive sector, as well as the recovery 
in the telecommunications sector powered 
by the global 4G infrastructure drive. The 
automotive sector now comprises the 
largest share of TR Asia’s total business, 
and this share is expected to increase 
substantially in the coming years. The 
sectors occupying the next biggest shares 
of TR Asia’s total business are the home 
appliance, information technology and 
contract manufacturing sectors. 
To date, TR Asia has seven legal entities 
in six Asian countries, namely Singapore, 
India, Thailand, Malaysia (two entities), 
Taiwan, and China, comprising six 
manufacturing sites plus numerous sales 
and distribution centres.
TR Singapore has continued to lead 
the Asian sites, with 31% of total 
sales revenue for the Asian region. 
It manufactures fasteners mainly for 
the home appliance and information 
technology sectors. The site also 
manufactures self-clinching fasteners 
which it sells through distributors. TR 
Singapore prides itself as a manufacturer 
of complicated high quality parts with 
zero-defect capabilities, thus being able 
to maintain its profitability in one of the 
highest cost countries in Asia.

TR PSEP in Malaysia has shown resilience 
in the face of declining business from 
its biggest customer, Proton, a national 
automotive manufacturer, which is steadily 
losing market share to imported cars. Our 
efforts in localising parts for Perodua (a 
Daihatsu joint venture) have paid off, as 
shown by a gradually increasing number 
of orders. Other projects in the pipeline 
will come on-stream in the new fiscal 
year. Automotive fasteners comprise 
74% of the business, with the other 26% 
being compressor fasteners for home 
appliances. 
TR SFE in Taiwan has performed 
exceptionally well, attaining record high 
sales, mainly due to the recovery in the 
automotive and general industrial sectors 
in Europe and North America. The order 
book has been very healthy throughout the 
year, and we expect the same in the new 
fiscal year. SFE sells mainly to distributors 
in both Europe and North America, with 
60% of demand for fasteners coming from 
the automotive industry. 
TR Shanghai in China has started to 
experience an uptick in business following 
the recovery in the telecommunications 
sector, where players have been rushing 
to fulfil 4G infrastructure demand 
globally. Strong growth also came from 
manufacturers of medical equipment and 
motor vehicles. Much work had been put 
into developing automotive customers 
during the year, and we are now beginning 
to see an increase in orders, which is 
expected to continue over the next two 
years.
TR Malaysia has yet to recover from the 
downturn in the audio-visual sector, where 
its main customer has been experiencing 
poor demand for its products. The TR 
Malaysia team is making encouraging 
progress in targeting other OEM 
customers in the region in order to reduce 
its specialisation within the audio-visual 
market.
TR India has done well with western 
owned operations, despite challenges 
from local manufacturers who have 
cost advantages, mainly with standard 
specification components. Additional 
manpower is in our forward plan for 
deployment to cover a larger area in this 
vast country.

TR Thailand was established during the 
year, operating using the same model as 
TR India. The recent political turmoil in 
Thailand has temporarily slowed down 
growth, but we are optimistic about 
future opportunities, especially with local 
government incentives for international 
OEMs to establish new factories in  
the region.
GOING FORWARD
During the year, each site in Asia has been 
pursuing individual business development 
opportunities. Many of these projects, 
especially those in the automotive sector, 
will take time to come on-stream. Strong 
growth is therefore expected over the 
coming two fiscal years. We will continue 
to sustain and grow existing businesses 
while developing new opportunities 
around Asia. The main focus will be on 
the automotive sector, where we have 
been successful in winning orders, often 
as a result of being specified on global 
platforms and sub-assemblies designed in 
Europe and the USA.
Due to the increasing demand for  
zero-defect parts, investment in  
state-of-the-art production and inspection 
equipment is absolutely essential in order 
to gain competitive advantage, and we 
are reassured by the support coming from 
the Trifast Board for our increasing capital 
expenditure requirements.
Investment in people continues to take 
top priority. I sincerely thank the loyal, hard 
working and capable Regional Managers 
and their staff, without whom we would 
not be able to grow TR Asia year after year 
as consistently as we have. 
Thomas Tan
We will continue to

Lancaster Fastener
Lancaster is an excellent barometer of 
industrial activity in both the UK and 
Europe because it only sells to fastener 
distributors and consequently sales 
volumes tend to be cyclical. Managing 
Director Sam Wilson, along with his key 
managers, maintains substantial stocks of 
a very wide range of catalogue parts and 
is therefore in an advantageous position to 
satisfy these swings in demand.
TR Norway
TR Norway’s traditional customer base has 
been in decline in recent years. However, 
under the leadership of Jan-Erik Storsve, 
the team is now developing new activities 
in the oil and gas industries, where we are

OVERVIEW — TR UK
LAST YEAR
Another set of positive results were 
delivered in 2013–14 from the TR UK 
locations with support from the other 
business teams. Sales neared double 
digit growth in the UK whilst the location 
heads managed to retain good overhead 
control. Net cash inflow for UK & Ireland 
was also up by 30% in the year. Inventory 
turn remained steady despite extended 
lead-times from Asia.
TR UK Manufacturing output forecasts 
remained optimistic during the year as 
our large OEM, distributor and TR Direct 
customer segments all enjoyed increased 
sales at varying levels across the Company. 
Our strategies with regard to the 
automotive and electronics sector, 
transactional sales and products have 
all been key contributing factors to our 
results. We have seen notable growth 
within all sectors associated with 
our launch of plastic fasteners, cable 
management and PCB hardware. Sales of 
TR Branded sheet metal products to our 
master distributor network across Europe 
have also increased significantly. Exports 
are up 30% since this time last year.
Low-cost sourcing projects coupled with 
efficiency gains achieved through our 
progressive ‘self-help’ initiative programme 
continue to drive improvements through 
our operations. These could be related 
to all aspects of our business e.g. 
reviewing obsolescence, high activity 
transactions, low-cost transactions, 
supplier and customer trends, customer 
and warehouse logistics picking or labour 
costs. By utilising the Pareto approach 
(integral in a world of multiple transactions, 
part numbers, suppliers and customers) 
we have been able to manage a large 
number of high impact projects with 
reduced effort, enabling us to manage 
resources effectively whilst still growing 
the business. 
Our location heads assess on a regular 
basis existing customer trends and new 
business opportunities via our logistical 
profit model TR UK developed between 
Operations and Finance.

The strength of knowledge, experience 
and commitment shown by our people 
in realising these opportunities has been 
a key contributor to our success in the

support, dedication and co-operation. 
An impressive set of results has been

happen on their own!
ORGANISATIONAL OBJECTIVES
As a UK Board, we have consolidated 
our management structure within the UK. 
In previous years the UK was split into 
regions with separate management teams. 
By simplifying the structure and working as 
one, we have found easier, more efficient 
ways of working between the locations, 
Group services and UK functional heads. 
The following objectives were started last 
year and are making good progress:
•	 Functional approach to streamlining 
processes and best practice within  
the UK
•	 Clearly defined responsibility, drivers  
& accountability
•	 Development of the UK business 
through the integration of central 
services and UK operations 
•	 Holistic approach to meeting corporate 
objectives and strategic KPI’s set by the  
plc Board
The Leadership programme implemented 
in 2013 has been the vehicle for change 
and co-operation as the location heads 
work with the relevant functional heads 
over a series of three-day workshops.
In this networking environment the team 
has been developing more cohesive 
ways of working, sharing best practice 
and experiences between sites, and 
supporting each other day-to-day as and 
when required. With a more integrated 
way of working, this has already helped to 
facilitate some exciting opportunities. 
INVESTING FOR THE FUTURE 
Last year we invested in sales, products 
and engineering resource. This year we 
have requirements within the commercial 
and quality side of the business linked to 
the success of automotive and electronics 
globally.
Additional investment is being looked at 
for our warehouses to further enhance 
our efficiencies and ability to grow without 
needing larger premises.
We plan to implement Inventory 
Management software across the UK later 
this year. This will be a ‘bolt on’ to our own 
existing system and will assist us greatly in 
optimising our demand planning, service 
levels and inventory management. 
We are looking for additional support 
within the IT team, the growing importance 
of cyber security being one of our priority 
projects this year. 
OUTLOOK
At the time of writing, the new financial 
year has got off to a good start. Enquiry 
levels are at the highest for over twelve 
months and our sales trends continue. 
Automotive build programmes continue to 
give us forward visibility. There are plenty 
of projects planned across the business  
as our drive for efficiency continues into 
other areas. 
We already have a significant value of 
secured business in the pipeline in what 
looks to be another exciting year ahead. 
An impressive set of 
results has been achieved 
which I know for a fact do 
not happen on their own!”

OVERVIEW — USA
This past financial year has been one of 
investment in more people and distribution 
capacity as we embrace the opportunities 
provided by our Group in Europe and Asia to 
serve sister plants of multi-national OEMs in 
the USA who are already specifying TR over 
there – particularly Tier 1 automotive.
Many US and European companies 
requiring high quality low cost assembly 
have established facilities in Mexico, which 
offers an obvious growth opportunity 
within the proximity of TR Houston, which 
in turn, necessitates the recruitment 
of Spanish speaking personnel in 
order to provide the high standard 
of communication required for the 
sophisticated supply chain management 
that we offer.
TR USA has spent the last year training 
and strengthening our team to take 
advantage of the global success of the 
automotive sector, a sector we are starting 
to tap into. With new business secured for 
the upcoming years, the automotive sector 
will be the fastest growing market for us 
over the next three years as we continue 
to leverage our global footprint with multi-
national automotive customers.
TR USA has also enjoyed similar success 
in the electronic/industrial sectors, but at a 
comparatively slower rate. While last year 
we focused on the automotive sector, with 
that strategy firmly in place, now we will 
switch our efforts this coming year to get 
the electronic/industrial sectors growing at 
the same pace.
What TR has learnt during the past 
year is that we had to forego short term 
continued profit growth in order to invest in 
further increasing our service resources. 
With that new strength and understanding 
we will push three steps forward this year, 
not two. TR USA understands that change 
is inevitable, both good and bad, and we 
aim to achieve our long term goals. 
I am looking forward to the next three 
years as TR USA switches from a 
company which has learnt to walk, to a 
company that will be running at the front  
of the pack.

ACQUISITION OF VITERIE ITALIA CENTRALE (VIC)
As was formally announced on Friday  
30 May 2014, Trifast received shareholder 
approval to purchase VIC, and now totally 
owns the business.
VIC is a major manufacturer of specialised 
screws for the domestic appliance sector, 
with most of the larger manufacturers (e.g. 
Electrolux, Bosch, Whirlpool) being their 
strategic customers across Europe. VIC 
has also just started to supply automotive 
lighting unit manufacturers.
They employ 75 staff based in Fossato 
di Vico (PG), a three hour drive from 
Rome, and have their own in-house heat 
treatment and zinc plating facilities.
VIC is managed by Carlo Perini (the son of 
the founder) who, with his entire team, will 
stay and continue to grow the business by 
working with TR. Carlo has ambitions to 
develop VIC not only in Europe, but also in 
the USA and Asia. 
The VIC strategy is identical to our PSEP 
strategy in Malaysia; self-managing but 
supported by sales, purchasing, marketing 
and finance colleagues from TR in order to 
help them grow globally.
Roberto Bedini Carlo Perini, VIC Managing Director
Working with Carlo and 
his enthusiastic team will 
accelerate our Group’s 
growth prospects”

WHY DID WE BUY VIC?
•	 To expand our white goods 
sales (unlike TVs, computers 
etc, washing machines, freezers, 
cookers and dryers, by their 
very function, cannot be made 
smaller and so fastener demand 
will stay quite constant within the

GLOBAL SALES & BUSINESS MANAGEMENT
‘It’s all about the opportunities ahead’ is 
our mantra, and in the last financial year 
we have, without a doubt, seized the 
moment. This, coupled with the improving 
macro activity, has ensured strong organic 
growth and produced the top line results 
this year.
Analysis of the industry sectors we supply 
indicate a very balanced portfolio with 
strong performances in automotive, 
electronics, domestic appliances and 
general industrial taking the lead across 
the Group. This is the culmination of five 
years of focus in developing business 
models to service the differing sector 
requirements on a global basis. New 
products have been added to the portfolio, 
and they have enhanced both the sales 
growth and margins. 
We are often asked ‘what is your USP?’, 
or ‘what do you offer that makes you 
different to your competitors?’ The answer 
has always been the TR global footprint, 
the range of product we supply, and 
having our own manufacturing facilities 
supporting us. These have been key 
differentiators as few of our competitors 
can match this offering. This, however, 
has subtly changed during this year as 
multi-national OEM’s require a more 
comprehensive approach, and we are 
fulfilling the role of a ‘full service provider’ – 
FSP . This encompasses early involvement 
in design and technical support, sampling 
and testing of product, and partnering 
right through to the start of production. 
The policy to recruit more application 
engineers continues, and is crucial to 
support the sales teams in the field. 
We have added years of fastener and 
technical experience through this process, 
built relationships with disciplines other 
than in purchasing, with decision makers 
in engineering and design centres. 
As the global economy recovered we 
have had to ensure that we have strong 
loyal supply partners supporting us. These 
approved vendors are vital to us, and 
we work closely with our colleagues in 
sourcing and purchasing to ensure there 
are no areas of risk of failure to supply. 
Involvement in capacity planning with 
our customers is vital to ensure that the 
supply chain is robust enough to meet the 
increased volumes and ramp-ups. This is 
particularly important in the supply to the 
Tier 1 automotive, where a platform build 
for a car model can last six years. Car 
production in the UK increased by 14% 
this year, exceeding expectations, and we 
had to be ready and poised to support  
this growth. 
Tier 1 automotive sector now accounts for 30% of Group revenue

Tier 1 automotive sector now accounts for 30% of Group revenue
Automotive was the fastest sector to 
recover from recession initially in the 
UK and latterly on a global basis. The 
automotive Tier 1 strategy that was put 
in place at that time has spearheaded 
our growth and produced strong results. 
The core accounts that we track in great 
detail now invoice £16 million more with 
us than five years ago. These accounts 
are also in our top 15 customers globally, 
and the opportunities within these are 
boundless. Consequently this is where 
we are focussing our sales efforts. These 
Tier1’s each have as many as 200 sites 
globally and our penetration is running at 
about 15% of the total. This is, however, 
significant enough to put us on their radar 
at senior level. All of these companies 
operate global IT systems with vendor 
portals where the minutiae of everything 
we do are recorded. This encompasses 
everything from our financial results, 
the Group footprint, CSR compliance, 
product supply capability, manufacturing 
and capacity, to our timely performance 
on quotations, deliveries and quality. 
Meeting these challenges is not optional, 
but once you are in their supply chain and 
performing to their criteria, the doors open 
wide for new business. 
We have earned our stripes in Europe, and 
as the platform builds for the same vehicle 
to go global, e.g. JLR, Ford, we have 
the capability to follow them to Asia and 
the USA. We have had some substantial 
new business wins this year on these 
continents and this puts us on the radar 
with the local teams, as well as winning 
local builds, e.g. Cherry in China. This has 
meant that we have had to recruit and 
train more skilled personnel in these areas, 
as the customer demand for our product 
and services in the ASEAN Region and in 
North America increases. 
The importance of our own manufacturing 
cannot be underestimated in this whole 
process as it is a key differentiator. Being 
able to take senior managers and directors 
from our client base to our facilities so that 
they can vendor assess us, and seeing 
product being produced has a real  
cachet value. 
Thomas Tan and his site managers in 
SFE, Formac Singapore and PSEP , have 
hosted a number of these visits this year, 
and PSEP particularly, has recognised the 
importance of these visits in a unique way. 
They have a dedicated dojo room featuring 
a complete engine teardown to show 
where product is used. This helps vendor 
engineers and specifiers understand and 
appreciate the quality and features of the 
components in situ. TR Formac Singapore 
has one of the most advanced cleanroom 
optical sorting facilities in Asia, which 
meets the zero-defect criteria that many 
of their customers require. This never 
fails to impress visitors to their facilities. 
Whilst they are time consuming and often 
challenging we recognise the value of 
hosting these visits and actively encourage 
them. We can track business wins that 
have been concluded following such 
activities. 
With the acquisition of VIC it will be 
beneficial for us having a manufacturing 
site in Europe to demonstrate our 
capabilities and facilities. As VIC also 
manufactures components for auto 
lighting clusters and wing mirrors, this 
adds another product offering to existing 
customers, and creates new opportunities. 
Our research data has confirmed that 
there are numerous companies in Europe 
to target initially.
‘It’s all about the 
opportunities ahead’ is 
our mantra, and in the last 
financial year we have, 
without a doubt, seized 
the moment”

GLOBAL SALES & BUSINESS MANAGEMENT continued 
Early design involvement and ongoing 
technical and engineering support is a 
given within our client base. This is an 
area where we are investing heavily and is 
a growing requirement across all industry 
sectors. Companies divested themselves 
of people during the recession, and 
often have not replaced these functions 
internally in sufficient numbers, and 
therefore they rely heavily on us to assist. 
This gives us a distinct advantage over 
competitors who do not have this ability 
in-house, and to be seen as a full service 
provider (FSP) sets us apart. 
The electronics, business machines, and 
telecoms industry appears to be back 
at the levels of production prior to the 
recession. Companies manufacturing 
ATM’s, ticketing machines, self-service 
shopping machines, etc., are producing 
record numbers of machines and we are 
servicing some of the biggest brands 
globally in Hungary, India, China and 
the USA. These products are fastener 
rich, and also use high volume plastic 
components which we are now able 
to support through the addition of the 
extensive Plastics commodity range that 
we fully launched last year. The major new 
growth that we are experiencing, however, 
has come from the telecoms industry with 
the emergence of the 4G rollout.

Ground equipment for mobile telephony
We are recognised as one of the 
key manufacturers and suppliers for 
the components used within the 3G 
microwave filters and on the antennas. 
We have been working with a growing 
number of companies, both existing and 
new start-ups, entering the very lucrative 
4G market. TR has the capability to supply 
virtually the entire product that makes up 
the complex and extensive network best 
illustrated in the diagram opposite. This 
is one of the most exciting new business 
plans that we have launched since the 
automotive strategy was put in place and 
will create a healthy balance between 
both sectors. Both the UK and China have 
already benefited from this resurgence 
and we are expecting this to accelerate 
globally. We are exhibiting at the 4G show 
in Las Vegas in September where over 
450 companies in this sector have stands. 
Early investigations show that a high 
percentage of these are producers and 
will therefore be targets for our team; the 
footfall should also include the great and 
the good in this industry.
General industrial sales and the domestic 
appliances sector have also produced 
good results on a global basis. Once again 
we are supplying the household named 
multi-nationals in these industries who too 
are becoming more demanding in terms 
of service and quality. They are embracing 
the automotive standards, in many cases, 
and this puts pressures on us that we 
are adjusting to. We recognise that this 
reduces their reliance on other companies 
who cannot support them or, are geared 
to, in their pursuit of excellence. Again 
design and technical support is a key 
factor and a differentiator, as is our  
global footprint. 
My project team have researched the 
domestic appliance market in Europe, 
Russia and Turkey and we are gearing up, 
with VIC’s involvement, to launch a robust 
plan to take a larger share of the market.
Sales to distributors, who occasionally 
are also our competitors, have been very 
buoyant this year. Lancaster Fasteners and 
TR UK Distribution have seen the recovery 
in Europe boost their sales. The extended 
range of our own branded products, 
coupled with good stock management and 
planning, has paid dividends and they have 
been able to capitalise on this opportunity.
The different business models that we 
have in place to support small and large 
companies work well. Unlike many 
competitors that have parted ways with 
their smaller customers we have taken the 
opposite approach. The TR transactional 
team in the UK increased their turnover 
by £900k this year confirming that many 
smaller businesses are doing well, and of 
course, they can be the acorns of the oak 
trees of tomorrow. 
The UK and mainland Europe sites have 
all performed well and we are set fair for 
this new financial year. Asia are enjoying 
the recovery of the electronics & telecoms 
sector and domestic appliances, as 
well as embracing the growth of the 
automotive sector in the ASEAN region. 
The USA has completed their restructure 
and is refocusing into the same sectors as 
Asia which will pay dividends in growth this 
year. We are in a strong position and are 
looking forward to a good new year.

that we have in place to 
support small and large

TECHNOLOGY & INNOVATION
The Trifast Group of companies work 
as a global network organised to 
provide supply solutions wherever our 
customers need us. Each business 
operates as an independent legal entity 
transacting at arm’s length, however, 
a unique combination of knowledge, 
communication and collective objectives 
enables activity on a global level.
In recent years Trifast has invested in a 
number of manufacturing licences including 
MAThread® which is a patented system 
to prevent cross threading — the unique 
first threads align with the bolts accurately 
ensuring optimum assembly time.
This feature has been incorporated in 
the design of the engine sump plug for 
a newly developed model. The clear 
advantage is that at both original assembly 
and subsequent servicing thread damage 
is avoided. TR Sweden worked with the 
customer on this occasion and Power 
Steel in Malaysia made the plugs to TR’s 
unique design and specification.
A significant part of the output of SFE 
Taiwan is expected to be for this system 
over the next year. The principal usage 
is in the automotive industry. It must be 
remembered that it can take many years 
for a design to be put into production, 
however, the life cycle is also quite 
extended, thus providing TR with a 
beneficial revenue stream for several years.
In last year’s Annual Report my colleague, 
Thomas Tan, explained that we had added 
all of the licences for the Phillips Screw 
Company to the Torx Drive System that we 
already have. 
This includes Mortorq®, which provides 
an enhanced drive capability and up 
to 25% material reduction to the head. 
This shallow head fastener has a good 
appearance and provides customers with 
the opportunity to reduce weight 
in vehicles.

Also a licence for Strux® was obtained. 
This is a self clinching fastener often used 
in automotive structures.
Mortorq® is also available in a tamper 
resistant style. TR UK received a specific 
customer request for this feature resulting 
in Phillips Screw in the US creating the 
design, and SFE Taiwan exclusively 
making the finished products.
The networking process also applies to 
items outside of Trifast’s manufacturing 
capability. To supplement our own 
production Trifast has a number of world 
class partners who supply globally. 
TR Holland received an enquiry for 
a particularly unique and technically 
challenging seat component; the customer 
also needed prototype samples to prove 
the design in pre-production trials. 
TR UK arranged these prototypes by 
water jet cutting and milling. The design 
was subsequently approved and bulk 
production commenced. TR Formac China 
made the initial deliveries to this global 
customer and Europe is soon set to follow.

of knowledge, 
communication and 
collective objectives

APPRENTICES
The apprenticeship programme goes from 
strength to strength with the introduction 
of two new apprentices within the year 
and the successful completion of three 
apprenticeships resulting in Graham 
Morrison securing a permanent position 
as a Sales Co-ordinator, Reilly Willis-
Gil becoming an Assistant Technician 
within our manufacturing facility and Jack 
Horscroft becoming a full-time  
Warehouse Operative. 
We are delighted to have been able to 
expand the apprenticeship programme 
to locations other than our Uckfield site. 
This year we have taken on a warehouse 
apprentice in our North East location (Ryan 
Hildyard) and a trade counter apprentice 
in our Poole location (Joe Crouch). A new 
business apprentice joins us in July (Alex 
Saunders) and we have plans to recruit an 
apprentice for our manufacturing plant in 
Uckfield as well as one for our location at 
Waterside Park.
It is a really exciting initiative to be able to 
bring young local people into the business 
through structured training programmes, 
not only giving them experience of the 
business world but also providing them 
with a nationally recognised qualification. 
We hope that all our apprentices go on to 
have successful and fulfilling careers with 
the Company. 
LEADERSHIP PROGRAMME
We are delighted with the success of our 
Leadership Programme, first reported last 
year. This programme enables the eight 
location heads from the UK and Ireland 
to come together at regular intervals to 
learn more about each of the functions 
within the business as well as to take 
part in leadership skills training. The 
programme has improved communication 
between the attendees themselves who 
now more regularly exchange information 
and provide support for each other. 
Other benefits of the programme include 
the improved relationships between 
the location heads and the functional 
heads and their teams, and the better 
understanding of the issues facing each 
part of the business. All attending the 
programme have expressed an interest 
in continuing the regular meetings and 
discussions and we are currently in the

process of developing the structure for 
this for the future. It is very satisfying to 
be able to say that the overall objective of 
the programme ‘to create a highly skilled 
and unified team to manage change and 
deliver business success across the UK 
and Ireland’ has been achieved. 
TRAINING
A healthy training budget has been 
secured for the coming year and through 
the new Training and Development Module 
of the HR self-service system we are able 
to offer a wider and more accessible range 
of training opportunities to cater for our 
employees’ training needs. 
Our training focus for the coming year 
is on the development of management 
and leadership skills to ensure that our 
managers are well equipped to deal with 
the varied challenges that arise as part of 
their day-to-day activities. It will also give 
all of our managers at all levels within the 
organisation a common language and 
allow them to gain a better understanding 
of team dynamics and the importance of 
clear and effective communication. 
Such has been the success of the 
leadership training provided through the 
Leadership Programme, we have devised 
a new management training programme 
comprising Foundation, Intermediate and 
Advanced levels to enhance the skills and 
behaviours of the managers and budding 
managers within the business across the 
UK. This is set to start in the summer of 
2014 and will be an ongoing programme. 
New training providers have been 
identified and we will be working with them 
to ensure that they understand our culture 
and can deliver training that is specific and 
targeted to our needs. 
HR SYSTEM
We continue to develop enhancements 
to our overall HR management system 
including the implementation of skills 
profiles for each role, the development 
of a knowledge database to assist all 
employees to access experts in particular 
fields throughout the business and a 
new system of recruitment that includes 
recruitment packs produced centrally 
to assist managers in the recruitment 
process.
Our training focus for 
the coming year is 
on the development 
of management and 
leadership skills”

TR MARKETING
A team of four supports the ever 
expanding needs of the Trifast Group. 
Their prime functions include growing 
the TR brand image, web content, and 
promotional and creative activity. The TR 
brand is truly global giving uniformity in 
how we showcase the Company, whilst 
still allowing for individuality, geography 
and differing cultures. This is important as 
we often trade with the same customers 
across four continents, and they become 
familiar with and recognise our style.
This team is a vital part of the sales 
process and integral to much of what 
we do, particularly when creating new 
business opportunities. From being 
able to create a bespoke personalised 
presentation for a client in-house, a 
brochure for a certain industry sector, 
promotional activity or managing a 
campaign, to driving social media 
coverage and opportunities, all of which 
are a distinct advantage and unique in 
our industry. This means we can act very 
swiftly and be responsive to the needs of 
the business.
Internal marketing is also an important part 
of their function. They create topical poster 
story boards for every site on a quarterly 
basis, and send regular marketing update 
emails, keeping TR personnel informed on 
interesting events, news, photographs and 
business wins. Sharing this information 
generates interest and motivation, and 
enables people to feel a part of the 
TR family.
Externally we punch above our weight, 
and through our PR agency, Aneela Rose, 
we have worked tirelessly to increase our 
PR coverage. We have targeted a core 
number of publications, where we either 
advertise or have product articles tailored 
to a current topic, from the launch of our 
plastics and cable management range 
and fasteners for sheet metal applications, 
through to educational papers on subjects 
such as hydrogen embrittlement. Social 
media activity has increased too and 
we have a growing list of followers on 
Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and LinkedIn. 
Marketing has in-house capability for 
filming and editing, and has produced 
some very diverse videos, ranging from 
case studies filmed inside our customers’ 
factories, to humorous videos designed to 
appeal to the YouTube audience. 
For example, ‘A world without fasteners’ 
achieved 18,000 hits, more recently 
and topical, the TR ‘World Cup’ video 
depicting a person from each site kicking 
a ball around the world of TR – hopefully 
another YouTube hit.
The team has supported 12 exhibitions 
this year for the sales operations in the UK, 
Europe and Asia, and, in September this 
year, we will host our first USA exhibition 
at the 4G show in Las Vegas. Having 
a creative, inventive and enthusiastic 
marketing team, supporting the sales 
and TR sites, is a key component in our 
continuing success.

this Directors’ Report confirm that, so far as they are each 
aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the 
Company’s Auditor is unaware; and each Director has taken 
all the steps that they ought to have taken as a Director to 
make themselves aware of any relevant audit information 
and to establish that the Company’s Auditor is aware of that 
information.

With exceptions as highlighted below, the Company complied 
with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
issued by the Financial Reporting Council in September 2012.
The Board acknowledges Malcolm Diamond is a non-
independent Executive Chairman which does not comply 
with the requirements of section C.3.1 of the Corporate 
Governance Code. However the Board believe that given Mr 
Diamond has sat as Chairman and is a non-executive in other 
companies, his experience from these appointments and his 
previous knowledge of Trifast is invaluable and can best be 
delivered through the position of Chairman.
The Company has applied the principles set out in the 
Code, including both the main principles and the supporting 
principles, by complying with the Code as reported above. 
Further explanation of how the principles and supporting 
principles have been applied is set out below and in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report.
The structure of the Board and its standing committees are  
as follows:
THE BOARD
Currently the Board consists of four Executive Directors, three 
Independent Non-Executive Directors and a Chairman. The 
Non-Executive Directors are considered to be independent of 
management and free from any business or other relationship 
which could interfere with the exercise of their independent 
judgement for the purposes of the Code. The Chairman who 
is an Executive Chairman is not considered by the Board to 
be independent.
The appointment, replacement and powers of the Directors 
are governed by the Company’s Articles of Association, the 
Corporate Governance Code, the Companies Act, prevailing 
legislation and resolutions passed at the Annual General 
Meeting (AGM) or other general meetings of the Company.
The Senior Independent Non-Executive Director is Neil 
Chapman who was chosen due to his executive board 
experience with other companies.
All Independent Non-Executive Directors have the authority to 
meet with shareholders without first seeking approval from the 
Chief Executive or the Chairman. 
The Board met 11 times during the period with attendance as 
follows:
MM Diamond 11
JC Barker 11
MR Belton 11
GP Budd 10
GC Roberts 10
NS Chapman 11
JPD Shearman 11
SW Mac Meekin 11
Upon appointment the Directors are required to seek election 
at the first AGM following appointment. All Directors are 
required to submit themselves for re-election at regular 
intervals and at least every three years.
The Directors retiring by rotation are Jim Barker, Mark Belton, 
Glenda Roberts and Neil Chapman who, being eligible, offer 
themselves for re-election at the forthcoming Annual  
General Meeting.
The Company has separate posts of Chairman and Chief 
Executive. The Chairman leads the Board and the Chief 
Executive is responsible for the management of the Company, 
implementing policies and strategies determined by  
the Board. 
On 8 May 2014 the Chairman took on another independent 
non-executive chairmanship role for a company called 
Flowtech. The fees have been fixed at £75,000 p.a.

The Independent Non-Executive Directors have full access 
to the external auditor and to management and there is 
a formal procedure for Directors to obtain independent 
professional advice in the furtherance of their duties should 
this be necessary. All Directors have access to the advice and 
services of the Company Secretary.
Appropriate and relevant training is provided to the Directors 
as and when required.
The Board meets a minimum of five times a year, and 
is supplied as early as practical with an agenda and 
appropriate papers. Directors are appointed by the Board 
on recommendation from the Nominations Committee. The 
Board monitors the financial performance of the Group, and 
approves and reviews major projects and acquisitions. The 
Board has formally adopted a schedule of matters which 
are reserved to the Board for decision, thus ensuring that 
it maintains control over appropriate strategic, financial, 
organisation and compliance issues.
The Board undertakes annual evaluation of its own 
performance and that of its committees using questionnaires 
and continues to train and evaluate senior managers below 
Board level in order to maintain its continuous succession 
policy.
The Board has delegated specific responsibilities to the Audit/
Nominations and Remuneration Committees. Details are 
described on pages 70 to 86.
SHAREHOLDER RELATIONS
The Group has a website www.trifast.com, which is regularly 
updated to ensure that shareholders are fully aware of the 
Group’s activities. The Group’s Registrar, Computershare, is 
also linked to the Trifast website and offers services for the 
shareholders.
The Group also works with City specialists to ensure all levels 
of Shareholders receive Trifast information. 
During the year being reported upon we engaged with:
  Arden Partners plc — Stockbroker to the Company-  
Institutional Fund Managers

GOING CONCERN
After making enquiries, the Directors have reasonable 
expectations that the Group has adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
Further information is given in the Basis of Preparation, note 
1. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the financial statements.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
I am pleased to present the Audit Committee Report for the 
year ended 31 March 2014, which has been prepared by the 
Committee and approved by the Board.
The Committee has focused on the integrity, completeness

KEY MATTERS CONSIDERED AND ACTIVITIES 
DURING THE YEAR
During the year, the Committee met to agree the audit 
strategy for the full year audit, review the results of the external 
audit for the financial year and review the external auditor’s 
half year review and the half year results. It also considered 
the results of the internal review process (‘Health Checks’) 
carried out as part of the cycle (more details of this process 
are given in the section — ‘Internal Audit’ below), and finally 
it reviewed the Annual Report and the financial statements 
contained within it.
The Committee’s prime areas of focus have been:
•	 the integrity, completeness and consistency of financial 
reporting and disclosures
•	 the areas where significant judgements and estimates are 
required in the financial statements
•	 the materiality level to apply to the audit
•	 whether the going concern basis of accounting should 
continue to apply in the preparation of the annual financial 
statements
•	 the appropriateness of transactions separately identified 
and disclosed as one-off in order to highlight the underlying 
performance for the periods presented in the  
financial statements
•	 the preparation of financial statements requires 
management to make assumptions, judgements and 
estimates which are detailed in note 31 to the financial 
statements 
•	 to review the Group’s cyber risk strategy to ensure controls 
and testing are in place to mitigate the Group’s exposure to 
this growing risk
FINANCIAL REPORTING AND SIGNIFICANT 
FINANCIAL RISKS
The Committee concluded that there were two significant 
financial risks arising from the financial statements which 
would require particular consideration during the year:
•	 CARRYING AMOUNT OF INVENTORY 
The Group has significant inventory holdings which fall into 
two broad categories — standard product ranges and 
those holdings which are customer specific. The Board 
recognises that as the business continues to grow the 
Group is required to carry additional inventory to meet its 
transactional and OEM business. This carries with it an 
increased exposure to obsolete inventory. The Committee 
is satisfied that sufficient focus is given to this whole area 
and in particular the adequacy of provisions made for 
slow moving and obsolete inventory. As part of their audit 
procedures KPMG perform detailed testing of customer 
inventory balances, in particular looking at inventory which 
is specific to individual customer requirements and the 
degree of estimation involved in arriving at the  
inventory provision.
•	 RECOVERABILITY OF SFE GOODWILL 
The Committee focused in particular on the carrying value 
of goodwill in relation to Special Fasteners Engineering 
Company Limited (‘SFE’) in Taiwan due to materiality. The 
determination of whether or not goodwill has been impaired 
requires a review of the value in use of the asset. The main 
judgements in relation to the review were considered to 
be the achievability of the long term business plan and the 
impact upon the plan of macroeconomic and regulatory 
issues. In addition, the Committee reviewed the discount 
rates used in projecting future cash flows to ensure they 
were within an acceptable range. The calculation of the 
value in use was undertaken and the Committee reviewed 
the conclusion, including sensitivity calculations, as part 
of their review. The Committee also held discussions with 
KPMG.The Committee concluded that SFE goodwill is not 
impaired.
INTERNAL AUDIT
The Committee formally considers the requirement for internal 
audit on an annual basis as part of its terms of reference.
A formalised internal review process called a ‘Health Check’ 
has been in operation for some years and all business units 
are the subject of a Health Check on a rotational basis. The 
reviews covering both operational and financial controls are 
carried out by senior finance personnel who are independent 
from the entity which is the subject of the review. All Health 
Checks are presented by the Group Finance Director to the 
Audit Committee and remedial actions agreed. Whilst the 
Board recognise that this process does not constitute a fully 
independent internal audit function, it believes that due to the 
size of the Group, this provides appropriate comfort as to the 
operational and financial controls in place.
INTERNAL CONTROL
The Board are ultimately responsible for the system of internal 
control and for reviewing its effectiveness. The system of 
internal controls is designed to manage rather than eliminate 
the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can 
only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against 
material misstatement or loss.
The Corporate Government Code requires that the Board 
review the effectiveness of the system of internal controls, 
in accordance with section C.2, including those of an 
operational and compliance nature, as well as internal 
financial controls. The Committee is of the view that there is 
an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing 
significant risks. Operating policies and controls are in place 
and have been in place throughout the year under review, 
and cover a wide range of issues including financial reporting 
capital expenditure, information technology, business 
continuity and management of employees. Detailed policies 
ensure the accuracy and reliability of financial reporting and 
the preparation of financial statements including the  
consolidation process. 
71
www.trifast.com 23401.04 28 July 2014 6:24 PM Proof 8
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT continued
The key elements of the Group’s ongoing processes are:
•	 full detailed review of the business risks undertaken as part 
of the ongoing day-to-day procedure of the business
•	 an organisational structure with clearly defined lines of 
responsibility and delegation for authority
•	 Group policies for financial reporting, accounting, financial 
risk management, information security, capital expenditure 
appraisal and Corporate Governance are well documented
•	 detailed annual budgets and rolling forecasts prepared 
for all operating units and reviewed and approved by the 
Board
•	 performance monitored closely against budget and material 
variances reported to the Board
•	 the Committee to deal with any significant control issues 
raised by the auditor
•	 a formal schedule of matters specifically reserved for 
decisions by the Board
•	 capital expenditure controlled by the budgetary process 
with authorisation levels in place. Any single capital 
expenditure over £50,000 goes to the Board for approval 
with detailed written proposals and financial analysis of 
expected returns
There were no significant control deficiencies identified during 
the year.
EXTERNAL AUDITOR
The external audit is a continuous process. At the start of 
the audit cycle, KPMG present their audit strategy identifying 
their assessment of the key risks for the purposes of the 
audit and the scope of their work. For 2014 these risks were: 
the carrying amount of inventory and recoverability of SFE 
goodwill. More detail is set out in KPMG’s report on pages 90 
to 92.
KPMG reports to the Committee at both the half and full 
year setting out their assessment of the Group’s judgements 
and estimates in respect of these risks and adequacy of the 
reporting. The Chairman of the Committee speaks to the lead 
audit partner before each meeting and the whole Committee 
meets with KPMG in private at least once a year without 
executive management present. The Committee reviews the 
external auditor’s performance and ongoing independence 
and concluded that the external audit process was operating 
effectively and KPMG continued to prove effective in its role as 
external auditor.
NON-AUDIT SERVICES PROVIDED BY KPMG
In order to ensure the independence and objectivity of the 
external auditor, the Committee has a policy which provides 
clear definitions of services that our external auditor can and 
cannot provide. Tax compliance and advisory services are 
currently provided by another professional services firm (PWC). 
The policy also establishes a formal authorisation process, 
including either the tendering for non-audit services or pre-
approval by the Committee for allowable non-audit work. 
The fees in relation to non-audit services are found in note 5 
of the Annual Report.
REAPPOINTMENT OF EXTERNAL AUDITOR
Following the completion of the audit, the Committee review 
the effectiveness and performance of KPMG with feedback 
from Committee members, senior executive management 
and finance personnel, covering overall quality, independence 
and objectivity, business understanding, technical knowledge, 
responsiveness and cost effectiveness.
The Committee acknowledges the new EU proposed rules in 
regards to auditor rotation and the requirement for companies 
to put audit services contracts out to tender at least every 
ten years. KPMG has been our auditor for over 20 years. The 
current lead audit partner at KPMG was appointed in 2014 
following a scheduled rotation and will be required to stand 
down no later than the Annual General Meeting in 2018. 
Accordingly, and in line with the transitional arrangements (set 
out by the EU), the Committee continues to recommend to 
the Board that the tendering of the external contract should 
be either at the next rotation of audit lead partner or earlier, 
if appropriate circumstances arise. The Committee and the 
Board have concluded that KPMG provides an effective audit 
and have recommended their reappointment at the  
2014 AGM.

NOMINATIONS COMMITTEE REPORT
ROLE
The Committee keeps under review and evaluates the 
composition of the Board and its Committees to maintain 
the appropriate balance of skills, knowledge, experience 
and independence to ensure their continued effectiveness. 
Appropriate succession plans for the Non-Executive Directors, 
the Executive Directors and the Group’s senior management 
are also kept under review. During the period, the Committee 
met on one occasion.
COMPOSITION
The Nominations Committee comprises two Independent 
Non-Executive Directors, Neil Chapman and Jonathan 
Shearman, the Executive Chairman, Malcolm Diamond and 
the CEO, Jim Barker. The Committee, which is chaired by Neil 
Chapman, meets on an ad hoc basis when required.
BOARDROOM DIVERSITY
Appointing the best people to the Board is critical to the 
success of the Company. The Committee has therefore 
concluded that while diversity, including gender diversity, is 
important when reviewing the composition of the Board and 
possible new appointees, the single most important factor 
is to identify and recruit people based on merit. Given our 
commitment to appointing the best people and ensuring 
that all employees have an equal chance of developing their 
careers with the Group, the Committee does not think it is 
appropriate to set targets for Board appointments.
Jim Barker, Jonathan Shearman, Malcolm Diamond, Neil Chapman
The Nominations Committee has an important 
role to play in ensuring the Board has the right 
balance of experience and skills to support  
our strategy”

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
Dear Shareholder
As Chairman of the Trifast Remuneration Committee (the 
Committee), I am pleased to introduce our Remuneration 
Report for 2014, which has been prepared by the Committee 
in accordance with the relevant legal and accounting 
regulations and approved by the Board.
This has been another busy year for the Company during 
which we have continued to generate increased  
profits through:
•	 delivering high quality service
•	 winning new business
•	 extending our product ranges
The remuneration policy at Trifast is to create a structure 
that can attract, incentivise and retain those key executives 
who are critical to executing our business strategy. Within 
this, any structure will aim to deliver an appropriate mix of 
fixed and variable compensation. This approach ensures that 
strong year-on-year corporate performance is rewarded and 
the interests of executives are aligned with the interests of 
shareholders over the longer term.
It is now five years since Malcolm Diamond and Jim Barker 
returned to the helm of the Trifast ship. Those years have seen 
a turnaround in fortunes, marked by continuous year-on-year 
profit increases, substantial share price outperformance (as 
illustrated in the Total Shareholders Return graph on page 84 
and the advancement of our strategic priorities. Much credit is 
due to them and the Executive team for these achievements.
We have now entered a new chapter of Trifast’s development; 
one during which we will seek to strengthen further our 
position organically within the global fastener industry. This 
alongside carefully chosen acquisitions, as typified by the 
recent announcement with regard to Viterie Italia Centrale Srl, 
should yield further profit growth. 
To reflect this, the Committee embarked on a Board-wide 
remuneration structure review. This was completed during the 
year to 31 March 2014. As part of the necessary changes, 
we have moved away from the historic policy of highly 
conservative levels of fixed remuneration underpinned by a 
grant of options. This has meant recent salary adjustments 
ahead of inflation; we would envisage more inflationary based 
increases in the  
coming years.
Following vesting of the 2009 options, the Committee was 
keen to ensure it still had the ability to retain management 
by way of equity involvement. Given a desire to maintain as 
simple, flexible and dynamic an approach as possible, we 
have achieved this by extending the existing bonus scheme, 
further details of which are included in the remainder of  
this Report.
Against this structure, and given a pre-tax profit significantly  
in excess of City forecasts (as at the beginning of the year), 
the Committee assessed that performance in the year to  
31 March 2014 justified a total annual bonus of 180%. This is 
for each Executive and is made up of an 80% cash bonus and 
a 100% equity award, the latter being deferred for three years.
In response to feedback from some shareholders reflecting 
a desire for increased transparency with regard to the bonus 
scheme performance hurdles and thresholds, we are, 
whilst retaining the same bonus structure, proposing some 
enhancements. The relevant details are contained on pages 
75 to 81.
This is our first year reporting under the UK Department for 
Business, Innovation & Skills’ new requirements. We welcome 
an appropriate amount of visibility and clarity, alongside 
remaining ever mindful of the opinions of our shareholders 
with regard to executive reward. The details behind the 
Committee’s policy are contained firstly in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy, followed by the Annual Report on 
Remuneration and will, we believe, show that we have taken 
these factors into account in our future planning.
In concluding, we have an excellent management team and 
it is appropriate that they feel motivated and rewarded. We 
believe that our approach will enable this and so look forward 
to your support in approving the relevant Remuneration 
Report resolutions at September’s AGM.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY
This section of the Remuneration Report contains details of the policy that will govern future remuneration. It has been 
developed to support the business strategy and will be applicable from the date of the AGM subject to approval by shareholders 
at that time.
The Remuneration Committee does not retain discretion with regard to any of the main components of the remuneration policy, 
unless otherwise indicated in the following table:
1) POLICY TABLES — EXECUTIVES
Base Salary
Objective
To provide a competitive level of salary recognising the market value of the role, an individual’s skills, experience and 
performance, as well as their contribution to leadership and company strategy.
As the primary component of fixed remuneration this enables the attraction and retention of talented Executive Directors to 
meet the requirements of the role.
Mechanism Maximum value
Set annually on 1 April.
The Committee’s desire is to establish and maintain broadly 
median levels of salary (derived from an appropriate basket of 
comparators) though not subjecting ourselves to  
mechanistic tracking.
Other factors taken into account in setting salaries include the 
experience and responsibilities of each individual Executive 
Director, pay and conditions for employees across the Group, 
the general performance of Trifast and pay conditions in the 
appropriate industry.
The previous column sets out the factors that will be taken into 
consideration in determining the salary.
The maximum annual salary increase will not normally exceed 
the average increase which applies across the wider employee 
population (typically inflation based). However, larger increases 
may be awarded if there is, for example, a substantial increase 
in the responsibilities of the role, following promotion or if the 
Director’s salary falls significantly below the market norm. 
The annual salaries for the Executive Directors are set out in the 
Annual Report on Remuneration on pages 82 and 85.
Conditions
N/A
Pension*
Objective
To provide competitive levels of retirement benefits as part of fixed remuneration in line with market practice.
Mechanism Maximum value
Facilitated via an HMRC approved defined contribution 
scheme. The rate of company contribution to this scheme is 
20% of basic salary.
N/A
Conditions
N/A
Taxable Benefits
Objective
To provide competitive employment benefits as part of fixed remuneration in line with market practice.
Mechanism Maximum value
Benefits are provided in the form of a company car (or car 
allowance), private medical insurance, permanent health 
insurance, critical illness cover and life cover.
Cost of said benefits
Conditions

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT continued
Annual Bonus Scheme
Objective
To reward individuals for the achievement of performance targets that are directly linked to the Company’s short and longer 
term financial and strategic objectives in as simple, flexible and dynamic a way as possible.
A portion of the bonus is deferred in shares to align the interests of Executive Directors with those of shareholders and to drive 
the retention of these individuals. 
Mechanism Maximum value
Executive Directors participate in a (non-pensionable) 
performance related scheme with a cash and deferred equity 
component where the performance period is one financial year.
For each Executive Director the mix between the cash bonus 
and deferred equity award is dependent on the level of 
performance:
•	 Below threshold performance will result in no bonus  
being paid
•	 Threshold performance will result in a 35% cash bonus and 
70% deferred equity award 
•	 On target performance will result in a 50% cash bonus and 
100% deferred equity award 
•	 Above target performance will result in a cash bonus varying 
between 50% and 100%, and a 100% deferred equity 
award. The maximum cash bonus will require significant out 
performance with regard to the threshold
The percentages referred to above have reference to  
base salary.
The deferred equity will be subject to a three year deferral 
period. No conditions other than continued employment will be 
applicable over the deferral period.
The maximum annual bonus is 200% of base salary which 
would be delivered equally in cash and shares.
Conditions
Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) hurdle of 200bps in 
excess of the Group’s Weighted Average Cost of Capital 
(WACC). No bonus will be paid if this initial hurdle is not met.
Once the ROCE hurdle is met, the bonus awarded will be 
determined based on annualised earnings per share (eps) 
performance. The threshold eps growth requirement is  
RPI + 5%.
Any bonus payment will be reduced by up to 15% should 
Personal Objectives not be achieved. These objectives are not 
disclosed due to them being commercially sensitive in nature.
The Company operates in a rapidly changing environment 
and therefore the Committee may change the weighting of the 
conditions, or use different conditions, for subsequent financial 
years, as appropriate, to reflect this.
The Remuneration Committee would consider clawback of 
the equity portion should eps growth on a rolling three year 
average turn negative.
The annual bonus scheme performance conditions were 
selected as the Committee believes they provide direct 
alignment with the short and longer term operational targets 
of the Company. The Committee considers the performance 
conditions suitably demanding considering the business 
strategy and shareholder expectations. There is no retesting  
of performance.
Save As You Earn (SAYE) Plan
Objective
Facilitate equity involvement for Executives and staff.
Mechanism Maximum value
The Trifast Savings Related Share Option Scheme is HMRC 
approved. The Scheme offers three and five year savings 
contracts which provide an option to purchase shares after 
maturity at a discount to the share price on the date the 
contract is taken out (the maximum discount is 20% of mid-
market price).

Shareholding Policy
Objective
To ensure Board members have their interests aligned with those of shareholders through having a sufficient shareholding  
in the Group.
Mechanism Maximum value
Requirement to build up a minimum holding of 250,000 Trifast 
shares over the next five years.

CHANGES TO EXECUTIVE REMUNERATION POLICY FROM PREVIOUS POLICY
Given vesting of the 2009 options, the Committee was keen to ensure management still have the opportunity to be retained by 
way of equity involvement. In doing so, we are mindful of the team approach taken by the Executives alongside a desire to retain 
as simple, flexible and dynamic an approach as possible.
The decision has been taken to focus on annual performance against metrics, which, if achieved on a year on year basis will, 
without encouraging excessive risk taking, grow shareholder value. The easiest way to facilitate this remains an extension of 
the bonus scheme to include a cash bonus (payable following the publication of the year’s results) and an equity award (with 
ownership deferred for three years). 
In response to feedback from shareholders we have introduced a formal Shareholding Policy (as detailed above). Other than that 
there have been no other changes to the Executive Director remuneration policy from the previous policy.
DIFFERENCES IN REMUNERATION POLICY FOR ALL EMPLOYEES
All employees are entitled to base salary, benefits and pension. Additionally, employees are eligible for bonuses and to participate in 
the SAYE Plan (UK only). The maximum opportunity available is based on the seniority and responsibility of the role. The Board has 
expressed its intention to consider how equity ownership can be broadened across the Group and the Committee is exploring this 
during the current financial year.
1) POLICY TABLES — NON-EXECUTIVES
Fees
Objective
To attract and retain individuals with the requisite skills and experience to perform the role.
Mechanism Maximum value
Set annually on 1 April and determined by the Board, following 
consultation between the Chairman and CEO.
Non-Executive Directors are paid a base fee and additional fees 
for Committee membership and chairmanship. An additional fee 
is also payable to the Senior Non-Executive Director.
Any increases in fees will be determined based on time 
commitment and take into consideration the level of 
responsibility. As for the Executives, our desire is to establish 
and maintain median level Non-Executive Director fees (based 
on an appropriate comparator group) though not subjecting 
ourselves to mechanistic tracking.
The previous column sets out the factors that will be taken into 
consideration in determining Non-Executive Director fees.
The Non-Executive Director fees are set out in the Annual 
Report on Remuneration on pages 83 & 85.
Conditions
N/A
Non-Executive Director remuneration is not performance related and is not pensionable. The only other payments made to them 
are mileage allowances at HMRC rates and expenses for items incurred during the fulfilment of their roles.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT continued
CHANGES TO NON-EXECUTIVE REMUNERATION POLICY FROM PREVIOUS POLICY
After three years during which Non-Executive fees were not reviewed and to align with the approach being taken with regard 
to Executive salaries, a benchmarking exercise was commissioned to establish a median level for fees. Alongside this, and to 
recognise the increasing importance and workload involved in chairing the Audit and Remuneration Committees, a fee has been 
introduced for undertaking this role.
2) RECRUITMENT REMUNERATION
The Committee’s approach to Executive Director recruitment remuneration is to pay no more than is necessary to attract 
candidates of the appropriate calibre and experience needed for the role. The remuneration package for any new recruit would 
be assessed following the same principles as for the current Executive Directors, as set out in the remuneration policy table.
The table below summarises our key policies with respect to Executive Director recruitment remuneration:
Element Policy
Base salary, retirement  
and other benefits
The salary level will be set taking into account a number of factors including market practice, 
the individual’s experience and responsibilities and other pay structures within Trifast, and will be 
consistent with the salary policy for existing Executive Directors.
The Executive Director shall be eligible to receive retirement and other benefits in line with 
Trifast’s policy.
Annual Bonus Scheme The Executive Director will be eligible to participate in the Annual Bonus Scheme as set out in 
the remuneration policy table. The maximum level of variable remuneration that may be offered is 
200% of base salary consistent with that of existing Executive Directors.
Share buy-outs or 
replacement awards
The Committee’s policy is not to provide replacement awards as a matter of course. However, 
should the Committee determine that the individual circumstances of recruitment justified the 
provision of a replacement award, the value of any incentives that will be forfeited on cessation of 
a Director’s previous employment will be calculated taking into account the following:
•	 the proportion of the performance period completed on the date of the director’s cessation 
of employment
•	 the performance conditions attached to the vesting of these incentives and the likelihood of 
them being satisfied
•	 any other terms and conditions having a material effect on their value (‘lapsed value’)
The Committee may then grant a replacement award up to the equivalent value of the lapsed 
value. The replacement award will be made in equity under 9.4.2(R) of the listing rules subject to a 
holding period during which cessation of employment will generally result in forfeiture and subject 
to the satisfaction of performance targets.
No other sign-on payments will be made without prior shareholder agreement.
Other The Company may meet certain mobility costs, including relocation support, expatriate 
allowances, temporary living and transportation expenses as appropriate in cases where the new 
Executive is relocated from one work-base to another.

3) CONTRACTS
During the year all Executive Directors had rolling service contracts, details of each Board member’s contract are as 
detailed below:
Executives Notice period Date of signing
MM Diamond 12 months 26 July 2012
JC Barker 12 months 26 July 2012
MR Belton 6 months* 26 July 2012
GP Budd 6 months* 26 July 2012
GC Roberts 6 months* 26 July 2012
Non-Executives Notice period Date of signing
NS Chapman 3 months* 26 July 2012
JPD Shearman 3 months* 26 July 2012
SW Mac Meekin 3 months* 25 April 2013
* 12 months in the event of a change in control
When setting notice periods, the Committee has regard for market practice and corporate governance best practice. For new 
appointments the notice period for Executive Directors will be set at six months and at three months for Non-Executive Directors.
The Director contracts are kept at the Company’s Registered office.
TERMINATION PAYMENTS
The following table shows how the Committee would expect to treat Executive Directors on termination of their employment:
Element Policy
Base salary, pension and 
other benefits
Base salary and all taxable benefits are paid in lieu of notice. Neither notice nor a payment in lieu 
of notice will be given in the event of gross misconduct.
Annual Bonus Scheme All aspects of the bonus scheme are dependent on the Executive being employed on the 
payment date of the bonus except for ‘good leavers’ defined as termination resulting from:  
a) injury, ill health or disability  
b) redundancy within the meaning of the Employment Rights Act 1996  
c) retirement or taking up alternative employment that is deemed by the Committee to pose no  
   competitive threat to any Group member  
d) dismissal for reasons other than those of gross misconduct 
For good leavers the bonus is determined by reference to performance on a quarterly pro-forma 
basis, e.g. termination in May would result in a pro-forma payment for one quarter based on the 
performance for that quarter. The cash element will be paid immediately. The deferred equity 
element will be subject to the normal three year deferral period. However, the Committee may 
grant transference for good leavers before the end of the three year deferral period for the  
pro-forma equity bonus award as well as prior deferred equity bonus awards which have not yet 
vested. In the case of a bad leaver, the leaver will forfeit all deferred equity rewards which have 
not yet vested.
In the event of a takeover, the bonus scheme would pay out 50% of pro-forma bonus expectation 
if the event takes place between April to September and 100% of pro-forma bonus expectation if 
the event takes place between October and March.

5) CONSIDERATION OF EMPLOYMENT CONDITIONS ELSEWHERE IN THE COMPANY
The remuneration policy throughout the Company is based on ensuring that we can attract and retain the most suitable people. 
This principle is consistent with that applied to the development of our remuneration policy for Executive Directors. Employee 
views are not specifically sought in determining this policy and no comparison metrics were used. 
Salary and benefit packages are linked to personal and business performance. All employees receive additional bonus payments 
(as business performance allows), this together with inflation based salary reviews should ensure we remain competitive within 
the employment market.
All UK employees are eligible to participate in the SAYE scheme. Furthermore, the Committee is currently working with the 
Executives to consider how senior management might also be motivated and retained by additional equity involvement.
6) CONSIDERATION OF SHAREHOLDERS VIEWS
The views of our shareholders remain important to us. As such, the Committee is happy to listen to feedback with regard to 
either our remuneration policy or structure and will endeavour to incorporate suitable suggestions within future arrangements.
At last year’s AGM the Remuneration Report received 99.93% of votes in favour. During the period under review and based on 
some verbal feedback from shareholders, the Committee has, as already detailed, made some enhancements to the proposed 
structure going forward. Future consultation with shareholders will be led by the Committee chair, Jonathan Shearman and, as 
usual, members of the Committee will be available at the AGM.

ADDITIONAL DETAILS FOR VARIABLE PAY ELEMENT OF REMUNERATION: ANNUAL BONUS
A portion of the annual bonus for the year ended 31 March 2014 has been paid in cash following the publication of the annual 
results and the remainder deferred in equity (for three years) in accordance with the Directors’ Remuneration Policy (see policy 
table on 75). Based on the performance for the year (as per table below) and in accordance with the policy, all five Executive 
Directors have been awarded a cash bonus and deferred equity bonus as a percentage of base salary of 80% and 100% 
respectively. 
The performance targets, actual performance achievement and resulting annual bonus as a percentage of the base salaries of 
the Executive Directors is summarised below for the year to 31 March 2014:

HISTORIC LONG TERM INCENTIVE AWARDS
The options that were agreed with shareholders and granted on the change of management in 2009, requiring a three-month 
average share price greater than 51p, combined with a ROCE in excess of 10% vested during the year ended 31 March 2013.
Following approval at the 2005 Annual General Meeting, the Company introduced a long term incentive arrangement known 
as the Trifast plc 2005 Long Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’). Awards under the LTIP were delivered in the form of conditional share 
awards which were to be released in three years dependent on continued employment and the satisfaction of demanding 
performance targets. All Company Directors who held LTIP’s waived their right to these rewards during 2011.

9) IMPLEMENTATION OF POLICY IN THE COMING YEAR
The remuneration policy and its implementation for the forthcoming year is summarised as follows:
Element Policy
Structure Following some shareholder feedback about insufficient visibility concerning the bonus scheme, the 
Committee is proposing to keep the same structure for the year to 31 March 2015 but with some 
enhancements as illustrated below and already explained in further detail within the Executive policy table 
(page 75).
The main elements of Executive remuneration effective from 18 September 2014 (being the date of the AGM 
at which shareholder approval for this report will be sought) are:
•	 Base salaries as follows
Malcolm Diamond (Executive Chairman) — £200,000
Jim Barker (Chief Executive Officer) — £250,000
Mark Belton (Group Finance Director) — £200,000
Geoff Budd (TR Europe Managing Director) — £190,000
Glenda Roberts (Group Sales Director) — £180,000
•	 Annual bonus scheme with maximum opportunity of 200% of base salary (100% cash; 100% equity 
deferred for three years) for each of the Executive Directors based on
Initial ROCE hurdle to be met before any bonus will be payable
Threshold of eps growth of RPI + 5% will be required as the minimum performance for any bonus to be 
paid
Any bonus awarded will be reduced by up to 15% should personal objectives not be achieved
•	 Fee increases for Non-Executive Directors to align them with an independently benchmarked median, 
coupled with additional fees for Committee membership, chairing and acting as Senior Non-Executive 
Director
Neil Chapman — £55,000
Jonathan Shearman — £50,000
Scott Mac Meekin — £45,000
Pay for 
performance
The key principle for incentives is to provide a strong link between reward and Group performance to align 
the interests of Executives with those of shareholders.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT continued
10) FUNCTIONING OF REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The objective of the Remuneration Committee is to develop a remuneration policy (for the Executive Directors and other key 
Executives) that attracts, incentivises and retains them. Within this, the Committee has and will attempt to reward exceptional 
performance, defined as significant outperformance against City forecasts. This policy is reviewed on an annual basis.
The Committee is composed entirely of Non-Executive Directors. Members have no day-to-day involvement in the running of the 
business. Jonathan Shearman (Chairman) and Scott Mac Meekin have no personal financial interest in the Company. Neil Chapman 
(Senior Non-Executive Director) was a participant in the 2009 option scheme. No Executive Director sits on the Committee. The 
Remuneration Committee is formally constituted with written Terms of Reference. A copy of the Terms of Reference is available to 
shareholders by writing to the Company Secretary whose details are set out on the inside back cover of this publication.
The Committee had five meetings during the year. All members of the Committee attended each of these meetings. On most 
occasions, the Executive Chairman and CEO were both invited to attend to ensure the Committee was in possession of all the relevant 
facts. During these meetings the Committee initially confirmed the remuneration structure for the year to 31 March 2014 and then 
considered any appropriate changes for the year to March 2015 and beyond, including reflecting on shareholder feedback.
Alongside this, the Committee had additional meetings with PWC in their role as independent external advisers to seek their 
guidance on remuneration matters, including best practice with regard to any changes being considered, a further benchmarking 
exercise and feedback from shareholders. The Committee continues to be pleased with the service offered by PWC which during 
the year cost the Group £0.03 million. The Group also retains PWC with regard to taxation services and consulting services in the 
ordinary course of business of Trifast; the Committee believes that this does not create a conflict of interest.
The Committee consults with the Company Secretary regarding issues on areas of remuneration and Corporate Governance. 
With regard to senior Executives in the Company (excluding Board Directors), the Committee also takes advice from the 
Executive Board.

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES 
IN RESPECT OF THE ANNUAL REPORT AND THE 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the Group and Parent Company financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and 
Parent Company financial statements for each financial 
year. Under that law they are required to prepare the Group 
financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by 
the EU and applicable law and have elected to prepare the 
Parent Company financial statements on the same basis.
Under company law the Directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and 
Parent Company and of their profit or loss for that period. In 
preparing each of the Group and Parent Company financial 
statements, the Directors are required to:
•	 select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently
•	 make judgements and estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent
•	 state whether they have been prepared in accordance with 
IFRSs as adopted by the EU
•	 prepare the financial statements on the going concern 
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group 
and the Parent Company will continue in business
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain 
the Parent Company’s transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the 
Parent Company and enable them to ensure that its financial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They have 
general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably 
open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to 
prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities. 
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are 
also responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, Directors’ 
Report, Directors’ Remuneration Report and Corporate 
Governance Statement that complies with that law and those 
regulations. The Directors are responsible for the maintenance 
and integrity of the corporate and financial information 
included on the Company’s website. Legislation in the UK 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
•	 the financial statements, prepared in accordance with 
IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable law, give a true 
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and 
profit or loss of the Company and its subsidiaries included 
in the consolidation taken as a whole
•	 the Directors’ Report includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business and the 
position of the Company and its subsidiaries included 
in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they 
face
•	 the Annual Report and Accounts taken as a whole is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s 
performance, business model and strategy

We have audited the financial statements of Trifast plc for the 
year ended 31 March 2014 set out on pages 93 to 131. In 
our opinion: 
•	 the financial statements give a true and fair view of the 
state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as 
at 31 March 2014 and of the Group’s profit for the year 
then ended
•	 the Group financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union 
(IFRSs as adopted by the EU)
•	 the Parent Company financial statements have been 
properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by 
the EU and as applied in accordance with the provisions of 
the Companies Act 2006
•	 the financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation
2 OUR ASSESSMENT OF RISKS OF MATERIAL 
MISSTATEMENT
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial 
statements the risks of material misstatement that had the 
greatest effect on our audit were as follows:
CARRYING AMOUNT OF INVENTORY (£30.6 million)
Refer to page 71 (Audit Committee Report), page 102 
(accounting policy) and page 116 (financial disclosures).
The risk — A significant proportion of the Group’s inventory is 
manufactured to meet specific customer requirements. There 
is a risk over the recoverability of these balances if a customer 
experiences financial stress or there is a demand issue with 
a customer’s product that includes a part manufactured by 
Trifast. This customer-specific inventory is one of the key 
areas our audit focused on.
Our response — In relation to customer-specific inventory, 
we performed the following:
•	 Analysed inventory balances by customer and obtained an 
understanding of the expected usage to assess the non-
recoverability risk
•	 Inspected a sample of service level agreements to consider 
the terms under which customers are obliged to purchase 
quantities of inventory
•	 Tested the adequacy of the Group’s provisions against 
inventory by assessing the Directors’ assumptions, 
taking account of externally available data on trade credit 
exposures, accuracy of the Directors’ previous estimates 
and our own knowledge of recent bad debt experience in 
the respective industries and post year-end events 
Our general audit procedures included, among others, 
performing a detailed analysis of the inventory ageing to 
challenge whether old and slow moving inventory is provided 
against in accordance with the Group accounting policy, 
considering the reasonableness of the provision policy and 
inspecting sales invoices to assess whether the inventory is 
being sold at a higher value than cost by comparing the sales 
price against the value at which it is held in inventory.
We also considered the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures 
about the degree of estimation involved in arriving at the 
inventory provision.
RECOVERABILITY OF TAIWAN GOODWILL (£9 million)
Refer to page 71 (Audit Committee Report), page 101 
(accounting policy) and pages 112 to 113 (financial 
disclosures).
The risk — There is a risk over the recoverability of the 
Group’s goodwill balance in relation to Special Fasteners 
Engineering Company Limited (Taiwan) due to the sensitivity of 
the underlying cash flow forecasts to projected improvements 
in business profitability. Furthermore there is an inherent 
uncertainty involved in forecasting and discounting future cash 
flows, which are the basis of the assessment of recoverability.
Our response — In this area our audit procedures included, 
among others, testing of the Group’s budgeting procedures 
upon which the forecasts are based and the principles and 
integrity of the Group’s discounted cash flow model. We 
compared the Group’s assumptions to externally derived data 
as well as our own assessments based on our knowledge of 
the client and experience of the industry in which it operates. 
Specifically we compared their assumptions with industry 
norms and external data sources in relation to key inputs such 
as projected economic growth, competition, cost inflation and 
discount rates, as well as performing break-even analysis on 
the assumptions. 
We also assessed whether the Group’s disclosures about the 
sensitivity of the outcome of the impairment assessment to 
changes in key assumptions reflected the risks inherent in the 
valuation of goodwill.

3 OUR APPLICATION OF MATERIALITY AND AN 
OVERVIEW OF THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT
The materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole 
was set at £810,000. This was determined with reference to a 
benchmark of Group profit before taxation, which we consider 
to be one of the principal considerations for members of the 
Company in assessing the financial performance of the Group. 
Materiality represents 9.1% of Group profit before tax and 
8.8% of Group profit before tax before separately disclosed 
items (including restructuring costs, intangible amortisation 
and the share option charge) as disclosed on the face of the 
Consolidated income statement.
We agreed with the audit committee to report to it all 
corrected and uncorrected misstatements we identified 
through our audit with a value in excess of £40,000, in 
addition to other audit misstatements below that threshold 
that we believe warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
Audits for Group reporting purposes were performed by 
component auditors and the Group audit team at the key 
reporting components including UK, Singapore, Malaysia, 
Shanghai, Taiwan, Sweden and Holland. Review procedures 
were performed by the Group audit team on the remaining 
locations. The audits undertaken for Group reporting 
purposes at the key reporting components of the Group were 
all performed to materiality levels set by, or agreed with, the 
Group audit team. These materiality levels were set individually 
for each component and ranged from £65,000 to £810,000.
The combined effect of this approach covered 100% of Group 
revenue, 100% of Group profit before tax, and 99% of 
Group assets. 
Detailed audit instructions were sent to all the auditors in 
these locations. These instructions covered the significant 
audit areas that should be covered by these audits (which 
included the relevant risks of material misstatement detailed 
above) and set out the information required to be reported 
back to the Group audit team. Clearance meetings were held 
by the local auditors with local management. The UK team 
had telephone conference calls with the component auditors 
to discuss the audit issues and conclusions reached.
4 OUR OPINION ON OTHER MATTERS PRESCRIBED BY 
THE COMPANIES ACT 2006 IS UNMODIFIED 
In our opinion: 
•	 the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be 
audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006 
•	 the information given in the Strategic Report and the 
Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the 
financial statements are prepared is consistent with the 
Group financial statements
5 WE HAVE NOTHING TO REPORT IN RESPECT OF 
THE MATTERS ON WHICH WE ARE REQUIRED TO 
REPORT BY EXCEPTION 
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required to report to you 
if, based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, 
we have identified other information in the annual report that 
contains a material inconsistency with either that knowledge 
or the financial statements, a material misstatement of fact, or 
that is otherwise misleading. 
In particular, we are required to report to you if: 
•	 we have identified material inconsistencies between the 
knowledge we acquired during our audit and the Directors’ 
statement that they consider that the annual report and 
financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, business 
model and strategy
•	 the Audit Committee Report does not appropriately 
address matters communicated by us to the audit 
committee

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT continued
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to 
you if, in our opinion: 
•	 adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not 
been received from branches not visited by us 
•	 the Parent Company financial statements and the part of 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns 
•	 certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law 
are not made 
•	 we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
•	 the Directors’ statement, set out on page 87, in relation to 
going concern
•	 the part of the Corporate Governance Statement on pages 
68 to 69 relating to the Company’ s compliance with the nine 
provisions of the 2010 UK Corporate Governance Code 
specified for our review 
We have nothing to report in respect of the above responsibilities.
SCOPE OF REPORT AND RESPONSIBILITIES
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement set out on page 87, the directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the Group financial statements and for 
being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.  
A description of the scope of an audit of financial statements 
is provided on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at 
www.frc.org.uk/auditscopeukprivate. This report is made 
solely to the Company’s members as a body and is subject 
to important explanations and disclaimers regarding our 
responsibilities, published on our website at www.kpmg.com/

report as if set out in full and should be read to provide an 
understanding of the purpose of this report, the work we have 
undertaken and the basis of our opinions.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(forming part of the Financial Statements) 
1 Accounting policies 
a) Significant accounting policies
Trifast plc (‘the Company’) is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom. The registered office details are on page IBC.
The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group). 
The Parent Company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about its 
Group. The profit after tax for the Company is £2.77 million (2013: loss £0.67m).
Statement of compliance
Both the Parent Company financial statements and the Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by 
the Directors in accordance with International Accounting Standards as adopted by the EU (‘Adopted IFRSs’) except as 
explained below:
On publishing the Parent Company financial statements here together with the Group financial statements, the Company 
is taking advantage of the exemption in s408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its individual Consolidated income 
statement and related notes that form a part of these approved financial statements.
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in 
these Group and Parent Company financial statements. 
IFRS not yet applied
At the date of approval of these financial statements, the following standards, interpretations and amendments were issued 
but not yet mandatory and early adoption has not been applied.
•	 Amendments to IFRS10, IFRS12 and IAS27 Investment Entities
•	 Amendments to IAS32 Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
•	 Amendments to IAS36 Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets
•	 IFRIC21 Levies
•	 Amendments to IAS39 Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting
•	 Amendments to IAS19 Defined Benefit Plans: Employee Contributions
•	 IFRS9 Financial Instruments
It is considered that the above standards, amendments and interpretations will not have a significant effect on the 
consolidated or Company results or net assets.
b) Basis of preparation
The financial statements are prepared in Sterling, rounded to the nearest thousand. They are prepared on the historical cost 
basis with the exception of certain items which are measured at fair value as disclosed in the accounting policies below.
The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that 
affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may 
differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are 
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision 
and future periods if the revision affects current and future periods.
Judgements made by management in the application of IFRS that have significant effect on the financial statements and 
estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year are discussed in note 31.
A review of the business activity and future prospects of the Group are covered in the Chairman’s and CEO’s Statement 
and the Directors’ Business Review. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing 
facilities are described in the Finance Review. Detailed information regarding the Group’s current facility levels, liquidity risk 
and maturity dates are provided in note 26.
Current trading and forecasts show that the Group will continue to be profitable and generate cash. The banking facilities 
and covenants that are in place provide appropriate headroom against our forecasts.
Considering the current forecasts, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of 
accounting in preparing the annual financial statements.

(forming part of the Financial Statements) 
1 Accounting policies continued
c) Basis of consolidation
i) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to 
govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing control, 
potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account. The financial statements of 
subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that 
control ceases.
ii) Transactions eliminated on consolidation
Intra-group balances, and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, 
are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
d) Foreign currency
i) Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to Sterling at the foreign 
exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the Consolidated 
income statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are 
translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. 
ii) Financial statements of foreign operations
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are 
translated to Sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. The revenues and expenses of foreign 
operations are translated to Sterling at average rates of exchange for the period, where this rate approximates to the 
foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange differences arising on retranslation are recognised directly in a separate component of equity, the 
translation reserve. They are released into the income statement upon disposal.
e) Hedge of net investment in foreign operations
The portion of the gain or loss on an instrument used to hedge a net investment in a foreign operation that is determined 
to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in equity in the translation reserve. The ineffective portion is recognised 
immediately in the income statement. The effective portion is recycled and recognised in the income statement upon 
disposal of the operation.
f) Property, plant and equipment 
i)  Owned assets
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost or deemed cost less accumulated depreciation (see below) and 
impairment losses (see accounting policy (l)).
Certain items of property, plant and equipment that had been revalued to fair value on or prior to 1 April 2004, the date of 
transition to Adopted IFRS, are measured on the basis of deemed cost, being the revalued amount at the date of transition.
ii) Depreciation
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an 
item of property, plant and equipment. Land is not depreciated. The depreciation rates are as follows:
Freehold and long leasehold buildings — 2% per annum on a straight-line basis or the period of the lease
Short leasehold properties — period of the lease
Motor vehicles — 20–25% on a straight-line basis
Plant and machinery — 10–20% per annum on a straight-line basis
Fixtures, fittings and office equipment — 10–25% per annum on a straight-line basis
When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, those components are accounted for as 
separate items of property, plant and equipment. Where relevant, residual values are reassessed annually.

iii) Leased assets
The rental charges on assets held under operating leases are taken to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis 
over the life of the lease.
Leases in which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased asset are classified 
as finance leases. Where land and buildings are held under leases the accounting treatment of the land is considered 
separately from that of the buildings. Leased assets acquired by way of finance lease are stated at an amount equal to the 
lower of their fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated 
depreciation and less accumulated impairment losses. Lease payments are accounted for as described in note (s).
iv) Subsequent costs
The Group recognises in the carrying amount of an item of property, plant and equipment the cost of replacing part of such 
an item when that cost is incurred, if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the item will flow to 
the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other costs are recognised in the income statement as an 
expense is incurred.
g) Intangible assets 
i) Goodwill
All business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method. In respect of business acquisitions that 
have occurred since 1 April 2004, goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value 
of the net identifiable assets acquired. Identifiable intangibles are those which can be sold separately or which arise from 
legal rights regardless of whether those rights are separable.
Positive goodwill arising on acquisitions is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to 
cash-generating units and is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment (see accounting policy l). 
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before 1 April 1998 was written off to reserves in the year of acquisition. Under IFRS1 and 
IFRS3, this goodwill will now remain eliminated against reserves. Goodwill arising on acquisitions after 1 April 1998 but 
before 31 March 2004 is included on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the amortised amount recorded under 
UK GAAP as at 31 March 2004. The classification and accounting treatment of business combinations that occurred prior 
to 1 April 2004 has not been reconsidered in preparing the Group’s year end balance sheets.
Decreases in goodwill resulting from the non payment of contingent consideration are recognised in the period when non 
payment occurs.
Negative goodwill arising on an acquisition is recognised directly in profit or loss.
ii) Other intangible assets
Intangible assets other than goodwill that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation (see 
below) and impairment losses (see accounting policy l). 
Expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands is recognised in profit or loss as an expense as incurred.
iii) Subsequent expenditure
Subsequent expenditure on capitalised intangible assets is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits 
embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure is expensed as incurred.
iv) Amortisation
Amortisation is charged to the Consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of 
intangible assets, unless such lives are indefinite. Goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are tested 
systematically for impairment at each annual balance sheet date.
The amortisation rates of other intangibles are as follows:
Customer relationships — 8.3% to 12.5% per annum
h) Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are held in the Company balance sheet at historic cost net of any impairment.
i) Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are stated at their fair value, and subsequently at cost less impairment losses (see accounting 
policy l).

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued
(forming part of the Financial Statements) 
1 Accounting policies continued
j) Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value with provision being made for obsolete and slow-moving 
items. In determining the cost of raw materials, consumable and goods purchased for resale, a first-in first-out purchase 
price is used and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their existing location and 
condition. For work in progress and finished goods manufactured by the Group, cost is taken as production cost, which 
includes an appropriate proportion of attributable overheads based on normal operating capacity.
k) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with an original maturity of three months or less. 
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group’s cash management are included as 
a component of cash and cash equivalents only for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
l) Impairment
The carrying amounts of the Group’s assets, other than inventories (see accounting policy j), and deferred tax assets (see 
accounting policy t), are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If 
any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated (see accounting policy L(l)). 
Financial assets are considered to be impaired if objective evidence indicates that one or more events has had a negative 
effect on the estimated future cash flows of that asset.
For goodwill and other intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life, the recoverable amount is estimated at each 
annual balance sheet date.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its 
recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the Consolidated income statement unless the asset is recorded 
at a revalued amount in which case it is treated as a revaluation decrease.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any 
goodwill allocated to cash-generating units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit on a  
pro rata basis. A cash generating unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely 
independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.
i) Calculation of recoverable amount
The recoverable amount is the greater of net selling price and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future 
cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of 
the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash 
inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.
ii) Reversals of impairment
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. An impairment loss on any other asset is reversed only to the 
extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of 
depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
m) Share capital — dividends
Dividends to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability and deducted from shareholders’ equity in the period 
in which the shareholders’ right to receive payment is established.
n) Interest-bearing borrowings
Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value. Where existing facilities are extinguished (rather than 
modified) arrangement fees and related costs are expensed in full in the income statement as incurred. Subsequent to initial 
recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost. 
i) Defined contribution plans
The Group operates Defined Contribution Pension Schemes which include stakeholder pension plans. The assets of these 
schemes are held separately from those of the Group in independently administered funds. The amount charged against 
profits represents the contributions payable to the schemes in respect of the accounting period.

ii) Share-based payment transactions
The share option programme allows Group employees to acquire shares of the Parent Company. The fair value of options 
granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at grant 
date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. The fair value 
of the options granted is measured using Black Scholes, Binomial lattice and Monte Carlo models, taking into account the 
terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect 
the actual number of share options that vest except where forfeiture is only due to share prices not achieving the threshold 
for vesting. IFRS2 has been applied, in accordance with IFRS1, to equity settled share options granted after 7 November 
2002 and not vested at 1 April 2005.
iii) Termination benefits
Termination benefits are recognised as an expense when the Group is demonstrably committed without realistic possibility 
of withdrawal, to a formal plan to terminate employment before the normal retirement date.
p) Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result 
of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect 
is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current 
market assessments of the time value of money and, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
i) Restructuring
A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan and the 
restructuring has either commenced or has been announced publicly. Future operating costs are not provided for.
ii) Dilapidations
A provision for dilapidations is recognised when expected costs become more likely than not and can be estimated reliably.
iii) Onerous contracts
A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract are 
lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract. The provision is measured at the present value 
of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract.
q) Trade and other payables 
Trade and other payables are stated at cost.
r) Revenue
Revenue from the sale of goods rendered is recognised net of VAT in the Consolidated income statement when the 
significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer. In accordance with normal practice, this will 
be on dispatch of goods.
s) Expenses
i)  Operating lease payments
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the Consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over 
the term of the lease. Lease incentives received are recognised in the Consolidated income statement as an integral part of 
the total lease expense.
ii)  Finance lease payments
Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability. The 
finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on  
the remaining balance of the liability.
iii)  Net financing costs
Net financing costs comprise interest payable on borrowings calculated using the effective interest rate method and interest 
receivable on funds invested. Interest income is recognised in the Consolidated income statement as it accrues, using 
the effective interest method. Net finance costs also include arrangement fees and related costs recognised in line with 
accounting policy (n).

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued

1 Accounting policies continued
t) Taxation
Tax on the profit or loss for the periods presented comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the 
Consolidated income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is 
recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following 
temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill not deductible for tax purposes, the initial 
recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit and differences relating to investments in 
subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided 
is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates 
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against 
which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related 
tax benefit will be realised.
Additional income taxes that arise from the distribution of dividends are recognised at the same time as the liability to pay 
the related dividend. Information as to the calculation of income tax on the profit or loss for the period presented is included 
in note 9.
u) Operating segment reporting
A segment is a distinguishable component of the Group that is engaged in providing products or services within a particular 
geographical economic environment whose operating results are reviewed regularly by the Group’s Chief Operating 
Decision Maker (the Board) in order to allocate resources and assess its performance and for which discrete financial 
information is available. 
The Group operates in a number of geographical economic environments. The Company only operates in one business 
segment being the manufacture and logistical supply of industrial fasteners and category ‘C’ components.
v) Financial guarantee contracts
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its 
Group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such. In this respect, the 
Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company 
will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
w) Earnings per share
The Group presents basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by 
dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary 
shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary 
shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the effects of all dilutive potential 
ordinary shares, which comprise share options granted to employees.
x) Underlying measure of profits and losses
The Group believes that underlying operating profit and underlying profit before tax provide additional guidance to statutory 
measures to help understand the underlying performance of the business during the financial period. The term underlying 
is not defined under International Financial Reporting Standards. It is a measure that is used by management to assess the 
underlying performance of the business internally and is not intended to be a substitute measure for Adopted IFRSs’ GAAP 
measures. The Group defines these underlying measures as follows:
Underlying operating profit is profit before taxation and separately disclosed items (see note 2).
Underlying earnings used in the calculation of underlying earnings per share is profit after tax excluding separately 
disclosed items.
Stock Code: TRI

It should be noted that the definitions of underlying items being used in these financial statements are those used by the 
Group and may not be comparable with the term ’underlying’ as defined by other companies within the same sector or 
elsewhere.
Separately disclosed items are included within the income statement caption to which they relate.
y) Separately disclosed items (see note 2)
Separately disclosed items are those significant items which in management’s judgement should be highlighted by virtue  
of their size or incidence to enable a full understanding of the Group’s financial performance.

Of the 2013 restructuring costs £0.19 million refers to redundancy payments and associated costs in relation to 
compensation for loss of office for Seamus Murphy following his departure from the Board on 31 January 2013. The 
remaining balance of £0.20 million were further redundancies within the UK to drive the ongoing efficiencies.
3 Operating segmental analysis
Segment information, as discussed in note 1, is presented in the Consolidated financial statements in respect of the 
Group’s geographical segments. This reflects the Group’s management and internal reporting structure, and the operating 
basis on which individual operations are reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (the Board).
Performance is measured based on segment underlying profit before finance costs and income tax as included in 
the internal management reports that are reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker. This is used to measure 
performance as management believes that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of certain 
segments relative to other entities that operate within the industry. 
Inter-segment pricing is determined on an arm’s length basis.
Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated 
on a reasonable basis. 
Segment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred during the period to acquire segment assets that are expected to be 
used for more than one period.
 Geographical operating segments
The Group is comprised of the following main geographical operating segments:
UK
Mainland Europe: includes Norway, Sweden, Hungary, Ireland, Holland, and Poland
USA: includes USA and Mexico
Asia: includes Malaysia, China, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and India

Other intangible assets are made up of customer relationships acquired as part of the acquisitions of Serco Ryan Ltd and 
Power Steel and Electro-Plating Works SDN Bhd (PSEP). During the year the assets of Serco Ryan became fully amortised, 
while the remaining amortisation period left on the assets of PSEP is 9.75 years.
The 2013 fair value adjustment relates to a PSEP deferred tax liability recognised upon revaluation of buildings performed 
prior to the acquisition in December 2011.
There were £nil impairments made during 2014 (2013: £nil).
The following cash generating units have significant carrying amounts of goodwill:
2014

The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment. The recoverable amount of cash generating units is determined from 
value in use calculations.
Value in use was determined by discounting the future cash flows generated from the continuing use of the unit. In this 
method, the free cash flows after funding internal needs of the subject company are forecast for a finite period of five years 
based on actual operating results, budgets and economic market research. Beyond the finite period, a terminal (residual) 
value is estimated using an assumed stable cash flow figure.

The values assigned to the key assumptions represent management’s assessment of future trends in the fastenings market 
and are based on both external and internal sources of historical data.
The table below highlights the key assumptions on our Taiwanese subsidiary:
 Taiwan
2014 2013
Discount rate 10% 13%
Long term growth rate 4% 4%
 Long term growth rate
Five year management plans are used for the Group’s value in use calculations. Long term growth rate into perpetuity has 
been determined as the lower of:
•	 the nominal GDP rates for the country of operation; and
•	 the long term compound annual growth rate in EBITDA in years six to ten estimated by management.
 Post-tax risk adjusted discount rate
The discount rate applied to the cash flows of each of the Group’s operations is based on the Weighted Average Cost of 
Capital (‘WACC’) (using post-tax numbers). The cost of equity element uses the risk free rate for ten year bonds issued 
by the Government in the respective market, adjusted for a risk premium to reflect both the increased risk of investing in 
equities and the systematic risk of the specific Group operating company. 
In making this adjustment, inputs required are the equity market risk premium (that is the increased return required over and 
above a risk free rate by an investor who is investing in the market as a whole) and the risk adjustment, beta, applied to 
reflect the risk of the specific Group operating company relative to the market as a whole.
In determining the risk adjusted discount rate, management has applied an adjustment for the systematic risk to each 
of the Group’s operations determined using an average of the betas of comparable listed fastener distribution and 
manufacturing companies and, where available and appropriate, across a specific territory. Management has used a 
forward-looking equity market risk premium that takes into consideration studies by independent economists, the average 
equity market risk premium over the past ten years and the market risk premiums typically used by investment banks in 
evaluating acquisition proposals.
The table above discloses the WACC on a post-tax basis. This takes into account certain components such as various 
discount rates reflecting different risk premiums and tax rates in the respective regions. Overall, the Board is confident that 
the discount rate adequately reflects the circumstances in Taiwan and is in accordance with IAS 36.
 SENSITIVITY TO CHANGES IN ASSUMPTIONS
Other than as disclosed below, management believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the above key 
assumptions would cause the carrying value of any cash generating unit to exceed its recoverable amount.
The estimated value in use at 31 March 2014 of the Group’s operations in Taiwan was £5.47 million above its carrying 
value. Any material adverse change in key assumptions could, in isolation, cause a significant reduction in the headroom 
against the carrying value.
The table below shows what the variables used in the ‘value in use’ calculation for Taiwan need to change to (in isolation) in 
order for the estimated recoverable amount to be equal to its carrying value.
Taiwan
Discount rate 13%
Budgeted reduction in EBIT 29%
Long term growth rate <0%
Other subsidiaries are not included in the calculation as their individual cash generating units show a significant headroom 
over the goodwill carrying value.
The £1.02 million and £0.09 million decrease in the goodwill of SFE and PSEP respectfully refer to foreign exchange losses 
as these investments are held in Singapore dollars within TR Asia Investment Holdings Pte Ltd.
There was no material difference between pre and post-tax discount rates.

 Pension plans
Defined contribution plans
The Group operates a number of defined contribution pension plans, which include stakeholder pension plans whose 
assets are held separately from those of the Group, in independently administered funds.
The total expense relating to these plans in the current year was £1.53 million (2013: £1.43m) and represents contributions 
payable by the Group to the funds.
At the end of the financial year, there were outstanding pensions contributions of £0.10 million (2013: £0.09m), which are 
included in creditors.
 Share-based payments
The Group Share Options and Share Matching Plans provide for a grant price equal to the average quoted market price 
of the Group shares on the date of grant. The vesting period is generally three years. The options expire if they remain 
unexercised after the exercise period has lapsed. Furthermore, options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group 
before the options vest, unless for retirement, redundancy or health reasons. The options are equity settled.
The number and weighted average exercise prices of share options are as follows:
2014 2013

Exercisable at the end of the year 5,811,466 0.09 6,047,782 0.09
The options outstanding at 31 March 2014 had a weighted average remaining contractual life of 4.5 years (2013: 5.2 years) 
and exercise prices ranging from £0.085 to £0.825 (2013: £0.085 to £0.825).
The fair value of services received in return for share options granted are measured by reference to the fair value of share 
options granted. The estimate of the fair value of the services received is measured based on Black Scholes, Binominal 
lattice and Monte Carlo models. The contractual life of the option is used as an input into this model.
Options granted before September 2004 (with the exception of SAYE) can only be exercised if the Company’s growth 
based on annualised earnings per share in the period or any three consecutive financial years after the grant exceeds RPI 
plus an average of 2% per annum. Options granted in September 2004 can only be exercisable where the Company’s 
earnings per share growth is at least RPI plus 4% over the three year period from date of grant.
The options granted in September 2009 are exercisable between September 2012 and September 2019 at an exercise 
price of £0.085 per share. They can only be exercised when the Company’s share price has reached a minimum of £0.51, 
maintained as an average over the three month period preceding the Notice of Exercise; and the Company has achieved a 
minimum of 10% Return on Capital Employed.

Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over one, two and three 
years back from the date of grant. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best 
estimate for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The Group recognised total charges of £0.07 million and £0.09 million in relation to equity-settled share-based payment 
transactions in 2014 and 2013 respectively.

26 Financial instruments
 (a) Fair values of financial instruments
There is no difference between the fair values and the carrying values shown in the balance sheet.
 (b) Financial instruments risks
Exposure to credit, interest rate and currency risks arises in the normal course of the Group’s business, and the Group 
continues to monitor and reduce any exposure accordingly. Information has been disclosed relating to the individual 
company only where a material risk exists. 
(i) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its 
contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group’s receivables from customers. 
Management has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis.
Credit evaluations are performed on all customers requiring credit over a predetermined amount. Bad debt insurance 
is taken out on all key accounts where the cost is appropriate given the risk covered. All overdue debts are monitored 
regularly and customers are put on credit hold if payments are not received on time. The carrying amount of trade 
receivables represents the maximum credit exposure for the Group. Therefore, the maximum exposure to credit risk at the 
balance sheet date was £26.33 million (2013: £25.87m), being the total carrying amount of trade receivables net of an 
allowance. Management do not consider there to be any significant unimpaired credit risk in the year-end balance sheet 
(2013: £nil).
At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk. 
The amount of trade receivables which are beyond 90 days from their due date is £0.40 million (2013: £0.69m). This 
represents 1% of the total gross receivable balance.
Impairment losses
The movement in the allowance for impairment in respect of loans and receivables during the year was as follows:
2014
£000
2013
£000
Balance at 1 April (640) (451)
Impairment movement 87 (189)
Balance at 31 March (553) (640)
There are no significant losses/bad debts provided for specific customers.
(ii) Liquidity and interest risk
The Group holds net debt and hence its interest and liquidity risks are associated with the maturity of its loans against cash 
inflows from around the Group. The Group’s objective is to maintain a balance of continuity of funding and flexibility through 
the use of loans and banking facilities as applicable. 
In May 2014, the Group agreed new banking facilities with HSBC, comprising:
•	 a term loan facility of up to €25.00 million (‘Facility A’) used to fund the acquisition of VIC
•	 a revolving multi-currency credit facility of up to £10.00 million (‘Facility B’), replacing the existing revolving credit facility 
of £5 million
The obligations of Trifast under Facility A and Facility B (the ‘Facilities’) are guaranteed by the UK non-dormant subsidiaries 
of the Company.
Facility A is repayable in semi-annual instalments of €1.25 million on 31 October 2014, 30 April 2015, 31 October 2015, 
30 April 2016 and 31 October 2016; then at the rate of €2.50 million payable on 30 April 2017, 31 October 2017, 30 April 
2018 and 31 October 2018, with the final balance being payable on the date five years after the date of the facility.
Interest on the Facilities is charged at the aggregate rate of LIBOR/EURIBOR plus a margin (initially 2.40 %.), ratcheted 
from six months after drawdown in accordance with a formula incorporating the ratio of consolidated net debt of the 
Enlarged Group against the consolidated EBITDA of the Enlarged Group.
The Facilities are secured by way of a charge over the Group’s premises at Uckfield; a first fixed and floating charge over all 
other UK assets of the enlarged Group; a share charge over TR Asia Investment Holdings Pte Ltd (Singapore); and a quota 
charge over VIC.

In addition the Group has an Asset Based Lending facility providing up to a maximum of £18.30 million secured over the 
receivables and inventory of the Group’s UK subsidiaries and the property of the Holding Company. 
In December 2011, to part fund the Power Steel & Electro-Plating Works SDN Bhd acquisition, TR Asia Investment 
Holdings Pte Ltd took out a five year Term Loan with the Singaporean bank, DBS at a fixed rate of 3.14% which is secured 
by Corporate Guarantees from the Company and TR Formac Pte Ltd. 
 Covenant headroom
The current term facilities are subject to quarterly covenant testing as follows:-
Interest cover: Underlying EBITDA to Net interest to exceed a ratio of three.
Debt Service cover: Adjusted EBITDA to Debt Service to exceed a ratio of one.
Net Debt cover: Total Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA not to exceed a ratio of 2.75.
With respect to the Asian loan facility, the covenant testing is as follows:-
Minimum Tangible Net worth (TR Asia Investment Holdings Pte Ltd) of S$20 million
Minimum Consolidated Tangible Net worth (Asia Group) of S$35 million
Maximum Asia Group Net Debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.0x
Minimum Asia Group Debt Service Cover (DSC) of 1.2x
These covenants currently provide sufficient headroom and forecasts indicate no breach is anticipated.
 Liquidity headroom
Trading forecasts show that the current facilities provide sufficient liquidity headroom. The Group continues to maintain 
positive relationships with a number of banks and the Directors believe that appropriate facilities will continue to be made 
available to the Group as and when they are required.
 Interest risk
The Group monitors closely all loans outstanding which currently incur interest at floating rates.
In respect of income-earning financial assets and interest-bearing financial liabilities, the following table indicates their 
effective interest rates at the balance sheet date and the periods in which they mature:

other assets and liabilities bear interest at a floating rate and therefore may change within one year.

Sensitivity analysis
A change of 1 point in interest rates at the balance sheet date would change equity and profit and loss by £0.10 million 
(2013: £0.10m). This calculation has been applied to risk exposures existing at the balance sheet date.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain consistent and considers the 
effect of financial instruments with variable interest rates. The analysis is performed on the same basis for the 
comparative period.
(iii) Foreign currency risk
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales, purchases and cash borrowings that are denominated in a 
currency other than local functional currency. The Group faces additional currency risks arising from monetary financial 
instruments held in non-functional local currencies.
Operational foreign exchange exposure
Where possible the Group tries to invoice in the local currency at the respective entity. If this is not possible, then to mitigate 
any exposure, the Group tries to buy from suppliers and sell to customers in the same currency.
Where possible the Group tries to hold the majority of its cash and cash equivalent balances in the local currency at the 
respective entity.
Monetary assets/liabilities
The Group continues to monitor exchange rates and buy or sell currencies in order to minimise open exposure to foreign 
exchange risk. The Group does not speculate on exchange rates.
The Group’s exposure to foreign currency risk is as follows (based on the carrying amount for monetary financial 
instruments held in non-functional currencies):

Sensitivity analysis
Group
A 1% change in the following currencies against local functional currency at 31 March would have changed equity and 
profit and loss by the amount shown below. This calculation assumes that the change occurred at the balance sheet date 
and had been applied to risk exposures existing at that date.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular other exchange rates and interest rates, remain constant. The 
analysis is performed on the same basis for the comparative period.

IV) Capital management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to ensure that all entities within the Group will be able to continue as 
going concerns, while maximising the return to shareholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. We 
regularly review and maintain or adjust the capital structure as appropriate in order to achieve these objectives and this is 
consistent with the management of capital for previous periods.
The Group has various borrowings and available facilities (see section (II) Liquidity & Interest Risk and note 20) that 
contain certain external capital requirements (‘covenants’) that are considered normal for these types of arrangements. As 
discussed above, we remain comfortably within all such covenants. 
Identification of the total funding requirement is achieved via a detailed cash flow forecast which is reviewed and updated 
on a monthly basis.
The capital structure of the Group is presented below:
2014
£000
2013

Cash and cash equivalents (note 19) 15,504 10,555

Net debt 2,030 (5,197)
Equity (61,667) (60,422)
Capital (59,637) (65,619)
There is a continuous process for identifying, evaluating and managing the key risks faced by the Group. Activities are  
co-ordinated by the Audit Committee. It has responsibility, on behalf of the Board, for ensuring the adequacy of systems  
for identifying and assessing significant risks, that appropriate control systems and other mitigating actions are in place, 
and that residual exposures are consistent with the Group’s strategy and objectives. Assessments are conducted for all 
material entities.

31 Accounting estimates and judgements
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with adopted IFRS’s requires management to make judgements, 
estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported annual amounts of assets and liabilities, 
income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other 
factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the 
judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results 
may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are 
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the 
revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
The Group believes the principal accounting estimates, assumptions and uncertainties employed in the preparation of 
these financial statements are:
•	 Recoverable amount of goodwill (note 12) 
The recoverable amount is the greater of net selling price and value in use, where value in use is determined by 
discounting the future cash flows generated from the continuing use of the unit. Further details are provided in note 13 
•	 Provisions (note 23) 
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet where the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a 
result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. 
Management have based their judgements on the latest available information, reflecting the expected outcome
In respect of onerous leases and dilapidation provisions, external advisors were used to provide estimates of potential 
costs and likelihood of sub-letting rental. The future cash flows were then discounted using risk free rates over the length 
of the leases
•	 Inventory valuation (note 17) 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value with provision being made for obsolete and slow 
moving items. Management have based their judgements on the classification of inventory and the item’s demand

32  Post balance sheet event
On 30 May 2014, the Group acquired the entire issued capital stock of Viterie Italia Centrale Srl (‘VIC’) for an aggregate 
consideration of €27 million (£22.5 million). 
The consideration for the acquisition comprised €24.15 million (£20.12 million) payable in cash on completion of the 
Acquisition and €2.85 million (£2.38 million) to be represented by the issue and allotment of 3,000,000 shares of 5 
pence each in Trifast plc, subject to adjustment in the event that the agreed level of working capital was not left in VIC at 
completion. Under Italian law, the capital stock of VIC is represented solely by ‘quotas’ rather than shares, and Trifast will 
be purchasing the entire issued capital stock of VIC.
In addition, it was agreed that a further payment may become due to the vendors of VIC (the ‘Vendors’) depending on the 
performance of VIC over the 12 month period ending on 31 December 2014. If VIC generates a post-tax profit (as defined 
in the Acquisition Agreement) for the year ending 31 December 2014 which exceeds €3,000,000, then for each €1 above 
this sum an additional €5 is payable to the Vendors, subject to a maximum amount of €5,000,000. This sum would be 
paid once the post-tax profit has been calculated in accordance with the Acquisition Agreement. Until such time as these 
additional monies have been paid in accordance with the Acquisition Agreement, any warranty or indemnity claims can be 
off-set (if proved or settled) against monies due to be paid, and if any claim is not settled or resolved an amount can be 
withheld from the monies paid until this matter is resolved.
The cash element of the consideration is funded from a new bank facility, details of which are shown in note 26.
The details for the rationale of the acquisition can be found in the Chairman’s & CEO’s Statement.
VIC had net assets and gross assets as at 31 December 2013 of €17.89 million and €31.88 million respectively. A summary 
of the trading results for VIC as extracted, without material adjustment, from the VIC historical financial information is 
set out below:
Year ended
31 December 
2013
Revenue €27.07m
Gross profit €7.90m
Profit before tax €5.42m
Total assets €31.88m
Net cash €2.30m
Total equity €17.89m
Note: Full details of the acquisition are contained in the Class 1 Circular issued to shareholders on 6 May 2014, a copy of 
which can be found on both our IR website and lodged at the National Storage Mechansim (‘NSM’).
Due to the short period between completing the acquisition and announcing our 2014 results it was not possible to 
disclose all of the information required by IFRS3.B64 such as goodwill and fair value adjustments of the assets acquired.

GLOSSARY OF TERMS
Assets
Anything owned by the company having a monetary value; e.g. fixed 
assets like buildings, plant and machinery, vehicles (these are not 
assets if rented and not owned) and potentially including intangibles 
like trademarks and brand names, and current assets, such as 
inventory, debtors and cash.
P/E ratio (price per earnings)
The P/E ratio is an important indicator as to how the investing market 
views the health, performance, prospects and investment risk of a 
PLC. The P/E ratio is arrived at by dividing the share price by the 
earnings per share (profit after tax and interest divided by the number 
of ordinary shares in issue). To calculate the P/E ratio:
•	 Find the total profit after tax and interest for the past year
•	 Divide this by the number of shares issued
•	 This gives you the earnings per share
•	 Divide the price of each share by the earnings per share
•	 This gives the Price/Earnings or P/E ratio
Profit and loss account (P&L)
The P&L shows how well the company has performed in its trading 
activities and would cover a trading account for a period.
The P&L shows profit performance and typically shows sales 
revenues, cost of sales/cost of goods sold, generally a gross profit 
margin, fixed overheads and/or operating expenses, and then a profit 
before tax figure (PBT). 
Balance sheet 
The balance sheet provides a ‘snapshot’ at a particular date in time 
of who owns what in the company, and what assets and debts 
represent the value of the company.
The balance sheet is where to look for information about short-term 
and long term debts, gearing (the ratio of debt to equity), reserves, 
inventory values (materials and finished goods), capital assets, cash, 
and the value of shareholders’ funds. The balance sheet equation is
Capital + Liabilities (where the money came from)  
= Assets (where the money is now)
CAGR
Compounded Annual Growth Rate.
Cash flow
The movement of cash in and out of a business from day-to-
day direct trading and other non-trading effects, such as capital 
expenditure, tax and dividend payments.
Cash flow statement
The Cash flow statement shows the movement and availability of cash 
through and to the business over a given period and it is fundamental 
that financial forecasting and reporting of cash movement and 
availability is accurate. For any business ‘cash is king’ and essential to 
meet payments for example to suppliers, staff and other creditors.
Current assets
Cash and anything that is expected to be converted into cash within  
12 months of the balance sheet date. For example debtors, inventory.
Current liabilities
Money owed by the business that is generally due for payment within  
12 months of balance sheet date. For example: creditors, bank 
overdraft, taxation.
Depreciation
The proportion of cost relating to a capital item, over an agreed 
period, (based on the useful life of the asset), for example, a piece 
of equipment costing £10,000 having a life of five years might be 
depreciated over five years at a cost of £2,000 per year.
This for example would be shown in the P&L as a depreciation cost 
of £2,000 per year; the balance sheet would show an asset value of 
£8,000 at the end of year one, reducing by £2,000 per year; and the 
cash flow statement would show all £10,000 being used to pay for it 
in year one.
Dividend
A dividend is a payment made per share, to a company’s 
shareholders and is based on the profits of the year, but not 
necessarily all of the profits; Normally a half year dividend is 
recommended by a company board whilst the final dividend for the 
year is proposed by the board of directors and shareholders consider 
this and vote at an Annual General Meeting.
Earnings before
There are several ‘Earnings before…..’ ratios. The key ones being:
•	 PBT Profit/earnings before taxes 
•	 EBIT Earnings before interest and taxes
•	 EBITDA  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and 
amortisation
Earnings relate to operating and non-operating profits e.g. interest, 
dividends received from other investments. Depreciation and 
amortisation are non-cash charges to the balance sheet which is 
made in writing-off an asset over a period.

Review of Operations
I am delighted to be reporting record results for the
sixth year in succession against the backdrop of a
challenging economic environment. Over the last six
years the group’s operating income has more than
doubled and pretax profits have risen almost fourfold.
This is a testament to our diversified strategy both
geographically and by marketing discipline. We have
invested in those sectors where there is above
average growth. We now have 24 offices overseas
and have developed in new areas such as sports
marketing which now represents 20% of group
operating income. International income has increased
from 30% of group operating income in 2005 to over
50%. Our focus on costs throughout that period has
improved margins by five basis points in five years.
In 2010 all of our divisions grew revenue; our Public
Relations Division maintained its position as the No 1
agency within the UK and is a leading global player
and our Sports Marketing business was No 1 in the
Sponsorship league table. VCCP , our advertising
business, won several awards on the back of its
comparethemarket.com and O2 campaigns and our
Research Division returned to profit.
The Group acted for 1,494 clients in 2010 compared
to 1,389 in 2009. 277 of these clients used more than
one of our businesses (230 in 2009) which represented
66% of total operating income (2009: 70%).
205 clients paid us over £100,000 in 2010, compared
to 150 in 2009. Our top 30 clients represented 49% of
total operating income (2009: 57%). 
Our two largest clients represented 21.0% of our
operating income (2009: 22.3%). Both clients have
been retained since 2003, are high margin and have
normal renewal terms. 
Average fee income per client in 2010 was £100,000
compared to £89,000 in 2009. Average income per
employee was £120,000 in 2010 compared to
£118,000 in 2009. In 2010, 51% of our income came
from overseas work compared to 46% in 2009. 
Chairman’s Statement
Notes:
1. Organic growth is calculated excluding all acquisitions in 2009 and 2010. 
2. Before taking account of amortisation of acquired intangible assets and
impairment of goodwill (£3.0 million, 2009: £0.3 million) and costs relating
to acquisitions and restructuring (£2.2 million, 2009: £0.2 million). In the
Income Statement this is referred to as Headline Operating Profit. Divisional Performance
In 2010 all four divisions showed growth in operating
profit (in total and organic). The performance of the
Public Relations Division was particularly strong. 
Public Relations continues to be our largest division
being 49% of operating income (2009: 55%),
Advertising and Marketing Services was 26% (2009:
26%), Sports Marketing was 20% (2009: 14%) and
Research 5% (2009: 5%).

Overall the division showed growth and very good
cost control which resulted in both improved profits
and margin. In 2010 nearly all businesses in the Group
performed ahead of the previous year and there were
particularly strong performances from Pelham Bell
Pottinger; Public Affairs; our geopolitical business;
Corporate Citizenship; property and international. 
2011 has started well for city and financial, corporate,
technology, the Middle East and corporate and social
responsibility.
Advertising and Marketing Services – VCCP
Group and Teamspirit
                                                  2010       2009           %   % Organic

Operating profit margin  10.6% 12.3%
Very strong growth in operating income was offset 
by investment in talent and new business pitches
resulting in a lower margin. In 2011 the focus will be
on improving the margin.
There was a strong performance from VCCP in the 
UK, Germany and the Czech Republic, as well as 
our search business. Teamspirit, our financial 
services marketing business, performed ahead 
of our expectations and well ahead of 2009. 
The first quarter has started well and we are already
ahead of 2010.
Sports Marketing – Fast Track and Essentially

Operating profit margin  18.9% 20.6%
2010 included a full year of the Essentially acquisition
(two months in 2009) and Essentially performed well
with good growth.
The Fast Track business had good revenue growth,
invested in new people and a start up in Hong Kong.
The margin therefore declined. It is expected that in 2011
the margin can return to the levels achieved in 2009.
This division has had a very strong start to 2011,
particularly in rights sales and the margin is already
improving.

Following the appointment of new management and
the acquisition of Tree in February 2010 this division
has returned to growth. The marketplace appears to
be growing once again and we believe the prospects
are improving for the division. 
Facts International performed particularly well in 2010.
Opinion Leader has been completely restructured
during the year.
The 2011 new business pipeline is stronger than this
time last year.
Corporate Activity
Our strategy is to expand the range of services 
and geographical reach of the services we can offer 
to clients. 
During 2010 we have:
� Acquired pmplegacy, a company specialising 
in countries’ and federations’ bids for major 
sporting events.
� Acquired the business of Presky Maves, a direct
marketing business.
� Completed the acquisitions and integration of
Essentially (sports marketing), Tree (data analytics)
and Pelham (financial public relations).
� Started ‘Open Health’ with David Rowley, the
former Chief Executive Officer of Huntsworth Health.
� Opened a sports marketing business in Hong Kong
which is already profitable.
We will continue to look at earnings enhancing
acquisitions.
Corporate and Social Responsibility
Our biggest CSR achievement in 2010 was becoming
the first marcoms group in the UK to be awarded the
Carbon Trust Standard. The Standard recognises year
on year carbon emissions reductions and in 2009 our
carbon footprint was reduced by 5%. This is further
progress since our programme began in 2007. We are
currently calculating our 2010 footprint and will publish
the results in our CSR report later this year. We expect
to make another reduction. The remaining emissions
we offset with qualified carbon offsets working with
the Carbon Neutral Company as our external
specialist advisor. In 2010 we were re-accredited with
a ‘Big Tick’ by Business in the Community for our
continuing efforts on environmental performance. 
Operational Highlights of the Year
� Bell Pottinger retained its position as No. 1 in the ‘PR Week’
League Table.
� Fast Track remains No.1 in ‘Marketing’ Sponsorship 
League Table.
� TPG acquisition of Republic.
� Richemont acquisition of Net-a-Porter.
� Korea National Oil Corporation successful hostile takeover
of Dana Petroleum.
� Launching Nintendo’s European preview of the ground
breaking 3DS console.
� Promoting TalkTalk’s sponsorship of the X Factor. 
� Winning the exclusive commercial agency rights for Rugby
World Cup’s 7’s contract for 2013 in Moscow.
� HSBC becoming the naming rights sponsor of the HSBC IRB
World 7’s series for the next 5 years.
� Investec taking naming rights to Super Rugby and 
Tri-Nations in NZ for 5 years from 2011.
� SFW’s launch of More Th>n Freeman campaign.
� Staging the Tri Yas – 1st full triathlon on a Formula 1 circuit
(Yas Marina Circuit in Abu Dhabi).
� Mubadala activity around 2010 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix and
Scuderia Ferrari relationship.
Note:
3. Research: Before taking account of amortisation of acquired intangible
assets (£0.1 million, 2009: £nil) and costs relating to acquisitions and
restructuring (£0.8 million, 2009: £nil). In the Income Statement this is
referred to as Headline Operating Profit. We are also making progress with our wider CSR
programme by requiring our Group companies to
evaluate themselves against a number of benchmarks
each year relating to the environment, suppliers,
clients, people and the community. This is driving
improved performance across the Group and embeds
our processes within each business. Our wider
performance on CSR issues has resulted in our
continued listing in the FTSE4Good Index.
Outlook
The outlook for 2011 continues to be very challenging
as it has for the last three or four years. The UK
continues its austerity programme and the global
economy continues to be buffeted by oil price and
commodity price fluctuations, but one thing is certain,
the need to communicate change and the growth in
impact of social media and internet campaigning
appears to be never ending. 
Reputation management and the communication of
real facts is more than ever essential. This is what we
do and our market is more vibrant than ever. 
Our strategy is to expand both organically and
through earnings enhancing acquisitions. 
� We have started a new healthcare business, 
a market that is more active than ever.
� Our sports business continues to grow as sport
becomes more and more of our daily lives and we
will expand our presence by sport and geography
as the year continues. 
� We have Sports Marketing offices in 11 countries,
the most recent being Hong Kong. 
� Our financial public relations business is growing
fast and our Singapore and Middle East branches
are doing well. 
� Our Advertising and Marketing Services businesses
continue to develop market leading campaigns, be
it for O2, comparethemarket.com and most recently
with More Th>n Freeman.
� Our Middle Eastern business has not been affected
by recent turbulence in the region. 
� Our research business is back in profit and 
growing again.
� Our costs are tightly controlled and our cash
position is strong. 
We are cautious about the future, but confident of
continued growth.

Annual Report and Accounts 2010 5 6 Chime Communications plc
In these post-credit crunch days we seem to
have lost the habit of talking about the UK’s
competitive advantages. In the introduction to
this year’s Chime Annual Report and Accounts,
I’d like to buck the trend.
This is a very strong set of results, which builds on 
the similarly strong set of results that we delivered 
last year. Our public relations and sports marketing
divisions have delivered strong performances, with
strong organic growth in both revenue and profitability;
in advertising, strong growth in revenue has supported
major investment ensuring that we will remain at the
forefront of delivering truly integrated advertising
communications in the UK; new management has
transformed the performance of our research division
and allowed this to make a contribution again to
Group profits this year.
Our success has been rooted in the coming of age of
reputation management, now a bona-fide descriptor
for any discussion of marketing and communications,
but a term and an idea that we have been building 
our strategy around for far longer – since the start of
the Millennium, as regular readers of this Report will
be aware. Investing in expertise and integration now
allows us to manage reputations across platforms and
disciplines in a manner that few others can match. 
We are feeling the benefits in the UK, but also in other
markets: over 50% of Chime’s revenues now come
from overseas markets.
The headline events of 2010 have fed the global
demand for reputation management: BP put it on the
agenda of every major corporate, at every significant
meeting by demonstrating that the only alternative to
managing issues in advance, is to manage them in
crisis. Wikileaks detonated shockwaves across the 
US and around the world, although noticeably to a far
lesser extent in the UK.
Chief Executive’s Statement This difference is significant: the UK enjoys (or suffers,
depending on your viewpoint) the most tooth-
endowed and competitive media marketplace in the
world, boasting fully 11 national newspapers to the
USA’s zero, and with a tradition of free speech and
tolerance of tabloid media that is matched in few other
places. In this environment, the sudden loss of control
over government secrets and politicians’ reputations 
is certainly less shocking than elsewhere. In the UK,
companies and individuals were scrutinised in
uncomfortable detail long before the advent of the
internet age. As a result the public relations and
communications skills that we have developed are
able to adjust far more rapidly to the communications
challenges that the age of ultra-transparency presents.
Facebook has proven tailor-made to the UK’s media
habits; dealing with social media and its impact has
proven tailor-made for our communications skills.
This is far from the only area in which the UK enjoys 
a significant competitive advantage. In an increasingly
fragmented global media landscape, sports marketing
provides one of the few truly international broadcast
channels, with the Barclays Premiership alone
reaching just under half of the world’s population. 
We are in the fortunate position that Britain has
created eight of the world’s 10 most valuable sports.
We may no longer win at all of them; but our expertise
at utilising, commercialising and selling them is second
to none. Chime’s Sports Marketing Group (CSM) 
sold more cricketers to the Indian Premier League 
this season than any other agency. With globally
recognised expertise, the award of the Olympic
games to Brazil in 2016, or of the FIFA World Cup 
to Qatar, represents as much an opportunity as the
Olympics of 2012 in London.
The export of world-leading skills in the disciplines 
that the world has an increased appetite for, have
underpinned our growth this year. They are not
restricted to reputation management and sports –
VCCP has delivered revenue growth partly through 
the export of integrated communications to Europe,
for example – but these are the areas where our
competitive advantage is most apparent.
It takes strategic expertise and investment to take
advantage of these opportunities. The careful
investments that we have made in high-quality people
for our public relations, research, sports marketing and
advertising divisions have already borne considerable
fruit over the past year. We will continue to invest
appropriately in people and technology, to ensure 
that we represent our competitive advantages to the
greatest possible extent in the global marketplace.

Annual Report and Accounts 2010 7 Public Relations Division
Bell Pottinger has again outperformed the
communications sector. Having delivered growth 
in a declining market in 2009, the Group further
increased revenue (by 8%) and improved profits 
(by 20%) in 2010. 
Most notably, it improved margins while continuing 
to invest in new skills and capabilities. 
This careful investment in skills was one of the factors
that have been key to the Group’s success. We have
continued to build our capabilities, particularly in digital
and social media, among other areas.
Our success in 2010 was recognised in February
2011 by the influential Holmes Report, which awarded
Bell Pottinger the accolade of EMEA Corporate
Consultancy of the Year.
Bell Pottinger has become a truly international public
relations business. Increased global demand for our
reputation management services means that 65% 
of Bell Pottinger’s revenues came from overseas
during the year. 
In today’s challenging economic and geo-political
environment, the market is looking for five things from
public relations providers: 
� committed, consistent and high-quality service 
and delivery; 
� senior and globally experienced strategic counsel; 
� a channel-neutral approach to solutions; 
� the intellectual horsepower and cultural flexibility
that translates plans into action and action into great
results, across diverse markets and cultures; and
� a wide range of skills with which the simplest or
most complex of reputation management
programmes or challenges can be executed.
A feature of our continued organic growth has been
the increasing number of clients shared, and
integrated campaigns delivered, across the Bell
Pottinger Group and the wider Chime Group.
This year our international operations included
services in, and for, Sri Lanka, several Middle Eastern
governments, and the African Union Mission to
Somalia – the latter a complex engagement in support
of national stability and socio-political transformation –
work of which we are especially proud and in which, 
in various spheres, we have built an advanced
competency. 
We have responded to increased demand with 
careful expansion: opening a new office in Singapore
and strengthening our operation in Washington D.C.
and linking it more directly to our offices in London
and Brussels in order to be able to offer clients
comprehensive advice in government policy and
regulation. This increasing international presence
builds on the existing strong performances of our
Middle East and US-based operations. 
The increasing strength of our Group-wide integrated,
international offering was accompanied by equally
strong contributions from individual agencies. 
Pelham Bell Pottinger, our financial PR business
formed in the previous year by the acquisition of
Pelham and its merger with Bell Pottinger Corporate
and Financial, performed very strongly in 2010.
Highlights included the successful representation of
the Korea National Oil Company during a major 
hostile takeover, work on the acquisition of Harrods 
by Qatar Holdings, and support for Newbank
Investments’ strategy of purchasing closed bank
branches to form a new retail banking chain.
Bell Pottinger Public Affairs capitalised on its
positioning as the consultancy best equipped to
interpret the politics of Britain’s coalition government
and had one of its strongest years to date. Bell
Pottinger Public Relations had a very strong year,
making significant strides in supporting the Group in
the building of its rapidly growing digital competency,
and working with Unilever (on global sustainability) and
Maersk (on global branding of its container business).
Good Relations delivered several excellent wins during
the year, picking up the prestigious Nintendo UK
account, renewing key accounts in the food sector,
and winning the PR account for comparethemarket.com 
8 Chime Communications plc
Divisional Review (launching the year’s most successful book ‘by’ the
world’s most famous meerkat, Aleksandr Orlov). Key
campaigns by Resonate included the Lighter Life
brand and the promotion of Mikhail Gorbachev’s 
80th birthday event.
Both Bell Pottinger North and Ptarmigan Bell Pottinger,
the Leeds-based agency we acquired in 2009,
delivered strong performances during the year,
reinforcing the value of a strong regional network to
our business – a capability we intend to strengthen in
2011. Harvard PR delivered a resilient performance in
a challenging technology sector.
Advertising and Marketing Services Division
Anticipating the integration of advertising and
marketing services has enabled VCCP Group to
outperform its sector over the past two years. In
2010-11 the Group again increased its revenues, whilst
profits remained flat due to continued investment in
securing a leadership position within the market.
Two forms of integration have driven the Group’s
strategy and performance over the past year: vertical
integration is the process that we believe will make an
endangered species of specialist digital and social
media agencies in the next two years. Developing in-
house expertise in all areas of digital communication 
is essential when conversations occur simultaneously
over a range of channels. VCCP has invested in
building platforms, in e-commerce, social media and
content capabilities with 40 people hired in the last 
12 months.
A number of valuable account wins and high-profile
campaigns attest to the appetite for such an
approach: the arrival of O2 Digital at VCCP represents
a significant win, as does the capture of the 
Molson Coors account. Increased work for Microsoft,
Omega Pharma and Coca-Cola (in the form of the
Oasis brand) provides further evidence of the strength
of the Group’s position. VCCP Health has shown
promising performance in its first 18 months and
represents a significant extension of the VCCP
approach to a new sector, with good potential 
for growth.
Geographical integration is the other major trend
helping to drive the Group’s growth. Cultural
globalisation gives creative ideas and media strategies
the opportunity to cross borders like never before. In
the age of the virtual network, it is no longer necessary
for an agency group to establish headquarters in every
territory where it seeks to work; but that’s not to say
that sensible investment in key market hubs doesn’t
bring opportunities of its own. For VCCP , a particularly
significant growth area is the export of experiential
marketing, which has become a cornerstone of O2’s
brand positioning in the UK. The strategy built around
London’s O2 (once known as the Millennium Dome
and now the world’s busiest music venue) has been
brilliantly replicated in Berlin, Prague and Dublin over
the past 12 months. Delivering such rich brand
experiences requires people on the ground – and 
has led the development and growth of the Group’s
Prague and Berlin offices.
It goes without saying that the financial services
market has experienced tough conditions over the
two to three years since the financial crisis began.
However the performance of the Group’s specialist
financial services marketing agency, Teamspirit, proves
that there remains scope for growth for the right
combination of integrated marketing services. Over
the period of the economic downturn, the agency has
increased revenue by 23% whilst expanding its
number of employees. In the last year, Teamspirit
worked with 57 financial services clients, including
significant account wins such as Barclays, KPMG 
and Age UK, formed last year by the merger of 
Age Concern and Help the Aged.
The agency’s integrated offer has been the key 
to its ability to defy market conditions: Teamspirit’s
consultancy services in particular have been highly
valued by clients looking to negotiate exceptional
market conditions at the same time as a broad range
of regulatory changes such as those affecting retail
distribution and capital adequacy. The growing
demand for Teamspirit’s services shows the value 
of a sector specialist that is able to leverage its
expertise over a full range of media platforms and
communication services.
Annual Report and Accounts 2010 9 Sports Marketing Division
Sports marketing has grown up very quickly over 
the past two to three years: in a time of austerity 
for marketing budgets, brands have quite rightly
demanded greater rigour and accountability from the
discipline. The consistent organic growth delivered by
Chime’s Sports Marketing Division during this period
is evidence of the value that our work adds for clients
– and the demonstrable results that it delivers.
Our sports marketing offer is a full-service one: the
Division incorporates both the global sports marketing
and sponsorship agency Fast Track and the rights
management and representation business, Essentially,
which we acquired in 2009 and integrated into the
Division this year. We also include three other
specialist agencies in our Group network, Stuart
Higgins Communications, The Sports Business, and
pmplegacy. The opening of our new offices in London
Victoria in April 2011, which will bring all of our sports
marketing agencies together under one roof, will
complete this integration process.
Such a breadth of services ensures insight and
awareness of opportunities across the global sporting
landscape. Whether consulting with brands or rights
owners, we are focused on delivering deeper
connections with audiences through strategic
understanding and innovation – and the Division’s
performance during 2010-11 shows our success 
in doing so.
We secured new work on a number of major projects,
including HSBC’s sponsorship of the IRB’s World
Sevens Rugby and Emirates’ sponsorship of the FIFA
World Cup and Ryder Cup. GE’s sponsorship of the
British Triathlon series and Revlon’s partnership with
UK Athletics were among the deals negotiated by the
rights management business.
Fast Track delivered highly effective work for a number
of existing clients during the year: the World Cup
campaign built around Lucozade’s sponsorship of
Steven Gerrard delivered in-store awareness of 36%;
for Land Rover, a groundbreaking iPhone App
engaged Premiership Rugby fans, delivering 40,879
downloads, ranking second in all UK sports
applications and generating 438 test drives; a global
sports programme for G4S, the world’s second
largest employer, mentors talented young athletes
from 13 countries and helps them to achieve their goal
of qualifying for the London 2012 Olympics. 
Public relations continued to play a key role in the
Division’s sponsorship activation campaigns, in
particular the support of BT’s London 2012
sponsorship through activity based around Dame
Kelly Holmes, Oscar Pistorius, and the BT Paralympic
World Cup. Lifestyle PR, live event management, 
and crisis management also played a key role 
in the growth of the business in 2010 and was
predominantly handled by one of our Group 
agencies, Stuart Higgins Communications.
Sports marketing’s coming of age brings with it
opportunities for greater growth. Competitions such
as the Champions League, Premier League and F1
Championship provide brands with powerful global
properties and channels in an age when traditional
media are increasingly fragmented. Sport is an
international business – and our prospects reflect this:
our Hong Kong office, opened this year on the back of
our HSBC work, is already helping to generate new
business; our Middle East office has delivered strong
growth on the back of innovative deals such as the
launch of the Yas Marina Triathlon at Abu Dhabi’s F1
circuit. Meanwhile, our investments in digital marketing
expertise give us a distinct point of difference when it
comes to activating sponsorships in the social media
space and protecting rights in the digital environment.
To reflect this growth in international business we
acquired a specialist bidding and planning company,
pmplegacy, in 2010. Their success in helping
countries and national federations bid, win, and 
deliver major sporting events, positions us well in 
this growing industry sector.
Divisional Review 
(continued)
10 Chime Communications plc Research Division
The introduction of the new management team has
helped Chime’s Research and Engagement Division
return to profit behind a full-service research offer.
Under CEO Crispin Beale, who took the reins at the
start of the year, the Research and Engagement
Division now offers clients end-to-end solutions,
operating as a single division. This strategic shift
builds on the successful transformation during 
2009-10 of Facts International, the Division’s
quantitative research business.
The last year has seen a number of additional
investments at the Division, all focused on creating 
the UK’s most compelling and complete research
proposition: the acquisition of acefieldwork has
transformed capabilities in face-to-face interviewing
with the Division now able to offer capabilities that
include 3,000 interviewers and 1,000 mystery
shoppers, an increase of over 30%; the number of
call-centre researchers has trebled in the last year;
and investment in new technology including the
Confirmit Horizons platform has confirmed a leadership
position in cutting-edge engagement techniques.
Investment in Opinion Leader has taken the form of
aggressive courting of industry faces from across the
research sector to take up research director roles at
the agency; this has allowed us to expand the client
base of Opinion Leader from its traditional strengths in
health and the public sector, and develop a compelling
proposition around delivering actionable insight for 
a broader range of brands and organisations. The
combination of Opinion Leader’s strategic insight with
Facts International’s full-service fieldwork allows the
Division to deliver wholly tailored solutions for clients
rather than focusing on particular specialist techniques,
as is the case with many competitors.
This strategic shift has delivered extremely
encouraging results in the last year: strong work for
major consumer brands such as O2 and Thomas
Cook, as well as best-in-class solutions for the public
sector clients amongst which the Division has been
most successful in the past. The year has seen new
projects for Bupa, as well as Ofcom and Ofgem. 
The Division has also made strides into new sectors
with the addition of clients such as G4S. Meanwhile
the Confirmit Horizons platform helped the Division to
deliver several of the most accurate opinion polls in
the run-up to the 2010 general election.
This performance has been reflected in the bottom
line: the Division returned a profit in 2010-11 after
showing a loss in the previous year. Facts International
more than doubled profits to £1.25 million, whilst
Opinion Leader vastly reduced its losses year-to-year.
In extremely difficult market conditions, delivering
significant organic growth represents a notable
achievement. The strength of the Division’s full-service
strategy, as shown in this year’s performance,
positions us very strongly to deliver sustained growth
in the future.

Chairman’s Introduction 
The Directors’ Statement on Corporate Governance 
is prepared in order to give guidance to both investors
and our wider stakeholders on how Chime is managed.
The corporate governance regime is developing and
the Board will continue to provide investors with 
a clear picture of the steps we take to operate
appropriately and effectively. In the report we attempt
to convey our attitude to the principles of the
Combined Code in addition to our application of good
management using the Code as our minimum standard. 
We wish to avoid delivering information on compliance
with the Code on a tick-box basis only, believing this
alone to be an inadequate way of reporting to our
shareholders. We believe disclosure of our wider view
is a fairer reflection of the governance of the Company
and of equal relevance to shareholders.
One area which has been under scrutiny has been the
question of the independence of our Non-Executive
Directors who have been on the Board for more 
than nine years; those who own a small number of
shares in the Company; and where they represent a
substantial shareholder. 
Annual appraisals by investor research analysts have,
in the past, recommended that shareholders vote
against or abstain from any re-election of those
Directors at our AGM. The Code requires companies
to ‘Comply or Explain’. We believe we have met this
requirement consistently and whilst any votes against
such re-elections have been a small proportion 
of the votes cast, clearly we need to explain our
position better. 
We believe long term knowledge of our business
brings our Directors the benefit of informed
consideration of the issues. The holding of shares
(within certain limits) or representation of a substantial
shareholder by a non-executive director, is evidence of
that director’s belief and commitment to the business
and further aligns them directly with the requirements
of our shareholders.
Our analysis of our Directors’ performance during the
year evaluates their value in consideration of the
matters before the Board and addresses the question
of their independence in each case. We have a strong
Board, a helpful and questioning Board and, we
believe, one that serves both the Company and its
investors well. 
I appreciate that our explanation and the contents of
the following statement may not necessarily satisfy the
needs of some shareholders and therefore we shall,
from 2011, adopt the process of each director
standing for re-election on an annual basis in
accordance with guidance from the FRC for FTSE 350
companies. We believe good process should be
applied irrespective of size.
Hopefully the following statement will convey that we
continue to take a robust approach to matters of
governance. We will continue to monitor and report on
performance against recommended practice and
welcome comments from shareholders on current or
additional disclosures. 
Lord Bell

Directors’ Statement on Corporate Governance 20 Chime Communications plc
The Company is committed to the principles of
Corporate Governance contained in the Combined
Code on Corporate Governance that was issued in
2008 by the Financial Reporting Council (‘the Code’)
for which the Board is accountable to shareholders.
A narrative statement on how the Company has
applied the Principles throughout the year ended
31 December 2010 and a statement of compliance
appears at the end of this report on page 27.
Directors and the Board
Board Balance
The Company is controlled through the Board of eight
Directors which, on 31 December 2010 comprised
four Executive and four Non-Executive Directors, one of 
whom is the Chairman and all of whom were Directors
throughout the year. The biographies of the current
Directors are shown on pages 14 and 15 of this report. 
Board Effectiveness
The Board meets quarterly and additionally as necessary 
and is responsible for overall Group strategy, acquisitions 
and the consideration of significant financial matters
and major areas of risk. It reviews the strategic direction 
of the Group’s trading companies, their annual budgets 
and their progress towards achievement of those
budgets. The Board is responsible for ensuring the
integrity of financial information and that the financial
controls and systems of risk management, both
financial and non-financial are robust and appropriate.
The Board has delegated the following activities to the
Executive Directors:
� the development and recommendation of strategic
plans for consideration by the Board that reflect the
longer-term objectives and priorities established by
the Board;
� implementation of the strategies and policies of the
Group as determined by the Board;
� monitoring of the operating and financial results
against plans and budgets;
� monitoring the performance of acquisitions and
investments against plans and objectives;
� prioritising the allocation of capital, technical and
human resources; and
� developing and implementing risk management
systems.
New Directors receive a full, formal and tailored
induction on joining the Board in order to further
inform them of the Group’s activities and structure. 
All Directors are able to take independent professional
advice, at the Group’s expense, in the furtherance of
their duties, if necessary. The Company also makes
appropriate training available to all existing Directors. 
When absence from meetings is unavoidable the
views of the Director concerned are sought in
advance then put to the meeting in order to facilitate a
comprehensive discussion. Each Director continues to
make themselves available to their fellow Directors
and ensures he/she contributes to the major decisions
before the Board.
Executive Directors are entitled to accept external
appointments outside the Company and retain the fees 
from such appointments provided that the Chairman’s
permission is sought and confirmed by the Board.
Chairman, Chief Executive and Senior
Independent Director
The Chairman, Lord Bell, is responsible for the running
of the Board and he ensures that all Directors receive
sufficient, accurate and timely information on financial,
business and corporate issues prior to meetings. 
He also ensures that the Non-Executive Directors have 
access to any further supplementary information they
may require should they request it.
The Chief Executive’s (Christopher Satterthwaite)
responsibilities focus on co-ordinating the Group’s
business and implementing its strategy. He is also a
member of the Executive Management Team as
detailed on page 16.
Rodger Hughes is the Senior Non-Executive Director
and is also Chairman of each of the standing
committees.
Non-Executive Directors
The individual Non-Executive Directors have different
skills, experience and qualifications from working
presently or previously in varied sectors of the
economy and as such they are able to bring informed
and independent judgement to bear on matters for
consideration by the Board.
The Board considers its current Non-Executive
Directors to be of sufficient calibre and number that
their views be of sufficient weight that no individual or
small group can dominate the Board’s decision-
making process. Their qualifications and experience is
relevant to their directorships and in their appointments 
to the Committees where relevant (see page 14).
The Non-Executive Directors’ terms and conditions of
appointment are available for inspection at the
Company’s registered office on request and will be
available, together with the Executive Directors’
service contracts, at the forthcoming AGM.
Rodger Hughes was appointed as a Director by the
Board in July 2007 and elected by shareholders in
May 2008. He is the Senior Independent Director 
and Chairman of the Audit, Remuneration and
Nomination Committees.
Directors’ Statement on Corporate Governance
(continued) Annual Report and Accounts 2010 21
Independence of Non-Executive Directors
The Code states that it is for the Board to determine
whether a Director is independent in character and
judgement and consider whether there are any
relationships or circumstances that are likely to affect
a Director’s judgement.
In applying the Code, the Board has considered a
number of factors in determining the independence of
each Non-Executive Director. 
Length of Service
The length of service of each Non-Executive Director
has been considered in determining their
independence (see chart below).
The Board has considered whether the length of service
of Paul Richardson (13 years) has compromised his
independence. He is experienced and accomplished in
his fields of expertise. In his association with the Group
he has acquired an understanding of the Group’s
operations, its markets and the issues determining its
success. He has shown commitment to the Company
in both time and effort. The Board does not consider
his long service as a Director to be detrimental or to
have eroded his objectivity and it should not raise any
concerns about his ability to perform his duties to the
benefit of the Company’s shareholders.
The Board has also considered the length of service of
Catherine Biner Bradley. Catherine is a lawyer
specialising in business law and international tax
matters and additionally has experience from
membership of Boards and Audit Committees of
major companies. Her knowledge and experience of
legal and risk management issues continues to be
exercised in the performance of her duties and this is
complemented by her knowledge of the Group gained
during her service. The Board does not consider her
long service as a Director to be detrimental or to have
eroded her objectivity and it should not raise concerns
about her ability to perform her duties to the benefit of
the Company’s shareholders. 
Non-Executive Directors’ Shareholdings
The question of Non-Executive Directors’ shareholdings 
should also be considered when assessing
independence. Rodger Hughes and Catherine Biner
Bradley each hold a small number of shares in the
Company as disclosed on page 37. The Board
considers that these holdings are not significant
and believes this should not raise questions regarding
their independence. The Board considers that
Directors owning shares in the Company directly
aligns them with the interests of the shareholders.
Non-Executive Directors’ Representing 
a Shareholder
Shareholder representation by a director is a criteria
on which under the Code independence is also
assessed. Paul Richardson is WPP’s representative
on the Board as provided by the subscription
agreement approved by shareholders in 1997. Paul is
Group Finance Director of WPP Group, a company
operating in similar markets to Chime, and he therefore
has relevant and current knowledge and skills that are
beneficial to the Board. 
Following the assessments, each Director is considered 
by the Board to be independent in both character and
judgement and there are no circumstances that give
rise to question their respective judgements when
considering matters before the Board. 
Performance Evaluation 
The Board in 2010
The Board met on four occasions during the year.
Piers Pottinger and Catherine Biner Bradley were
absent from one meeting but their views were sought
on the agenda matters in advance then put to the
meeting in order to facilitate a comprehensive discussion.
The Executive Directors – 
Performance Evaluation 
The performance evaluation of the individual Executive
Directors for 2010 took place in early 2011. The
Remuneration Committee, led by Rodger Hughes, the
Senior Independent Non-Executive Director, evaluated
the performance of the Executive Directors.
At the start of each year the Committee agrees
personal key performance indicators for each Director.
(Further details are included in the Directors’
Remuneration Report on page 31.) Performance
against these forms part of the evaluation by the
Committee at year end. Individual application and
developments during the year are also taken into
account when judging overall performance. 
The performance evaluations of the individual
Executive Directors for 2010 did not identify any areas
of concern.

Non-Executive Directors – 
Performance Evaluation
The Executive Directors, led by the Chairman, are
responsible for the assessment of the performance of
the Non-Executive Directors.
The process of performance evaluation is designed to
consider all elements of performance including any
perceived shortcomings, training or development
needs and unforeseen tasks and responsibilities that
have arisen during the year. 
Whilst no KPIs are set for individual Non-Executive
Directors, the time, effort and application applied in
the performance of their duties for the Board and,
where applicable, Committees is taken into account.
Performance evaluations of the Non-Executive
Directors have shown a continued good record of
involvement in Board discussions and each
contributes additional help in furthering the
development and delivery of the Group’s strategies.
The evaluations assessed both performance of duties
and whether each director should be considered
independent.
Retirement and Proposed Re-Election of Directors 
In previous years and in line with the provisions of 
the Code, Directors have been required to submit to
the shareholders for re-election every three years. 
The Company had additionally supplemented this with
the good practice of one third of the total number of
Directors standing for re-election at each AGM. 
In order to keep pace with current best practice, the
Company will from the forthcoming AGM adopt the
process of re-election of all directors annually. This is
in line with the 2010 Code provisions for FTSE 350
companies and the Board believes governance is best
served by doing so.
Biographies of each Director are shown on page 14.
The appointment and subsequent re-election of
directors by shareholders is shown on page 14.
The Board, the Committees and the
Management Process – Performance Evaluation
In line with the requirements of the Code, the
Company additionally carries out annual performance
evaluations of the Board, the Committees and the
processes utilised by each forum. The aim of the
evaluation is to recognise the strengths and address
any weaknesses and consider improvements to the
management process. The evaluation is designed to
ensure that the Board meets its objectives and that
effectiveness is maximised.
This evaluation addresses such issues as:
� the frequency of meetings and the business
transacted;
� the workload of each forum; 
� the timing, level of detail and appropriateness of
information put before meetings; 
� the reporting process from Committees to the
Board and delegation process itself;
� the levels of expertise available within the
membership of the Committees and the need for,
selection and use of external consultants.
The performance evaluations of the Board and
Committees did not identify any issues of concern or
failure or incapacity to perform the duties for which
they are convened or in meeting the duties as
summarised above.
Standing Committees
Membership of the three standing Committees is
restricted to those Non-Executive Directors deemed
to be independent by the Board and is shown on
page 14.
Audit Committee
Summary of the Role of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee’s terms of reference include all
matters indicated by Disclosure and Transparency
Rule 7.1 and the Code.
The Audit Committee is responsible for:
� monitoring the integrity of the financial statements
of the Group and any formal announcements
relating to the Group’s financial performance
together with reviewing significant financial
reporting judgements contained therein;
� reviewing the Group’s internal financial controls
and, unless expressly addressed by the Board
itself, the Group’s internal control and systems of
risk management;
� monitoring and reviewing the resourcing and
effectiveness of the Group’s internal audit function
and allied processes;
� making recommendations to the Board for a
resolution to be put to the shareholders for their
approval in general meeting, for the appointment
of the external auditors and the approval of their
remuneration and terms of engagement;
� reviewing and monitoring the external auditors’
independence and objectivity and the
effectiveness of the audit process, taking into
consideration relevant UK professional and
regulatory requirements; and
Directors’ Statement on Corporate Governance
(continued) Annual Report and Accounts 2010 23
� monitoring and, where appropriate, approving the
parameters for the engagement of the external
auditors to supply non-audit services taking into
account relevant guidance regarding the provision
of non-audit services by the external audit firm.
The Audit Committee reports its findings to the Board,
identifying any matters on which it considers that
action or improvement is required, and makes
recommendations on the steps to be taken.
The Committee and the External Auditors
The Audit Committee is responsible for the
development, implementation and monitoring of the
Group’s dealings with its external auditors. Oversight
and responsibility for monitoring the independence,
objectivity and compliance by the external auditors
with ethical and regulatory requirements lies with the
Committee, and day to day responsibility is delegated
to the Group Finance Director.
The external auditors are jointly responsible to the
Board and the Audit Committee but the Committee is
the primary contact. The Committee monitors and,
where appropriate, approves the parameters for the
engagement of the external auditors to supply non-
audit services.
Membership of the Committee
Membership of the Committee is reviewed by the
Chairman of the Committee and the Group Chairman
(who is not a member of the Audit Committee) at
regular intervals and where appropriate they
recommend new appointments to the Nominations
Committee for assessment and onward
recommendation to the Board. The Committee is
comprised of three independent non-executive
directors, which is the minimum membership required
under the Terms of Reference. Two members
constitute a quorum.
The Audit Committee is required to include one
financially qualified member (as recognised by the
Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies).
Currently the Audit Committee Chairman, Rodger
Hughes, and Paul Richardson both meet that
requirement.
The Audit Committee in 2010
The Committee met on four occasions during the year.
Catherine Biner Bradley was absent for one meeting.
The external auditors are represented at three of the
meetings during the year and may request a meeting
of the Committee without management being present
if necessary.
In 2010 the Audit Committee discharged its
responsibilities by performing the standing duties
summarised above and the following activities:
� considered a review of the risk management
systems including the resources required;
� reviewed the internal audit plan and the results of
internal audit reviews;
� considered and agreed the company’s response to
the Bribery Act 2010;
� monitored the continuing development of the
Company’s contingency plans;
� considered the response to new and revised
legislation and regulatory requirements;
� reviewed the Group’s draft preliminary and interim
results statements prior to Board approval and
reviewed the external auditors’ detailed reports
thereon;
� reviewed the Group’s interim management
statements and pre-close period updates prior to
their release;
� reviewed the appropriateness of the Group’s
accounting policies;
� reviewed regularly the impact on the Group’s
financial statements of matters such as the
adoption of new International Financial Reporting
Standards;
� recommended to the full Board, which adopted the
recommendation, the reappointment of Deloitte LLP
as the Group’s external auditors and reviewed the
external auditors’ plan for the audit of the Group’s
accounts, which included key areas of scope of
work and key risks on the accounts;
� confirmed auditor independence and the proposed
audit fee and approved the terms of engagement
for the audit.
The Audit Committee has considered reports made to
it by the executive management of the Group, which
assesses the major business risks and the control
environment against the criteria for assessing internal
financial controls which are set out in the guidance for
Directors on reporting on internal control. The Audit
Committee has reported to the Board that it has been
able to review the effectiveness of the Group’s system
of internal financial control for the accounting year and
the period to the date of approval of the financial
statements. 24 Chime Communications plc
The Committee and the External Auditors in 2010
To fulfil its responsibility regarding the independence of
the external auditors in 2010, the Audit Committee
reviewed:
� the external auditors’ plan for the current year,
noting the role of the Senior Statutory Audit Partner,
who signs the audit report and who, in accordance
with professional rules, has not held office for more
than five years, and any changes in the key audit staff;
� the arrangements for day-to-day management of
the audit relationship;
� a report from the external auditors describing their
arrangements to identify, report and manage any
conflicts of interest; and
� the overall extent of non-audit services provided by
the external auditors in addition to its case-by-case
approval of the provision of non-audit services by
the external auditors within previously set criteria.
The Group has a policy for the employment of the
auditors for non-audit work. The auditors work on tax
issues and other matters closely related to their role 
as the Company’s auditors but any increase in fees is
strictly controlled by the Audit Committee. Any other
non-audit assignments can be awarded to the auditors
during the year but only where fees and the scope of
work remains within Audit Committee approved limits.
To assess the effectiveness of the external auditors,
the Audit Committee reviewed:
� the arrangements for ensuring the external auditors’
independence and objectivity;
� the external auditors’ fulfilment of the agreed audit
plan and any variations from the plan;
� the robustness and perceptiveness of the auditors
in their handling of the key accounting and audit
judgements; and
� the content of the external auditors’ reporting on
internal control.
Following the above, the Audit Committee has
recommended to the Board that Deloitte LLP is
re-appointed.
Remuneration Committee
Summary of the Role of the Remuneration
Committee
The Committee measures the performance of the
Executive Directors and of key members of senior
management as a prelude to recommending their
annual remuneration. The Committee is also
responsible for overseeing grants under the
Company’s Co-Investment Plan, Executive Share
Option Scheme, the Savings-Related Share Option
Scheme, the Deferred Share Plan and the VCCP Key
Players Incentive Scheme to employees of the Group.
The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is
recommended by the Chairman and Finance Director
and takes account of the time spent on Board and
Committee matters. Final decisions are made by the
Board but no Director takes part in any discussion
regarding his or her own remuneration.
Membership of the Committee 
Rodger Hughes is chairman of the Remuneration
Committee. The membership of the Committee
throughout 2010 is shown on page 14. When required
the Chairman, Lord Bell, attends the meetings but is
not actually a member. In December 2010 the Board
appointed Richard Alston to the Committee from 
1 January 2011. 
Catherine Biner Bradley retired from membership on
31 December 2010. 
The Remuneration Committee in 2010
The Committee met on four occasions during the year.
Catherine Biner Bradley was absent on one occasion.

Nominations Committee
Summary of the Role of the Nominations
Committee
The Committee leads the process of appointments to
the Board by evaluation of the skills, knowledge and
experience required for a particular appointment. 
The Code requires the Company to have a formalised
process for the selection and appointment of new
Directors. The Board considers that a prescriptive
procedure is inappropriate and could prove restrictive
and costly both in terms of identifying potential
candidates and the selection process itself. The
Company does not believe that it should commit to
the exclusive use of external recruitment consultants,
although there may be occasions where this method
is employed.
The Nominations Committee in 2010
The Nominations Committee met on one occasion
during the year to consider the proposed amendment
to Lord Bell’s service agreement. All Members 
were present. 
Membership of the Committee
Rodger Hughes is Chairman of the Nominations
Committee. The membership of the Committee
throughout 2010 is shown on page 14. The Board
appointed Richard Alston to the Committee from 
1 January 2011 and Catherine Biner Bradley retired
from membership on 31 December 2010. 
Relations with Shareholders
The Company is keen to promote two-way
communications with its institutional and private
investors and responds quickly to queries received.
Lord Bell, Chairman; Christopher Satterthwaite, 
Chief Executive; and Mark Smith, Chief Operating
Officer, are the Company’s principal spokespersons
with investors, analysts, the press and other 
interested parties.
All shareholders are sent copies of the Company’s
Annual and Interim Reports and, where appropriate,
circulars and prospectuses either electronically 
or in hard copy form. The Annual and Interim 
Reports are also published on the Group website,
www.chime.plc.uk, together with announcements,
press releases and other Company information. 
This enables investors worldwide to keep informed of
the Company’s progress. Shareholders are given at
least 21 days’ notice of the Annual General Meeting at
which all Directors are generally present and at which
questions are both invited and encouraged.
Electronic Communications
At the AGM in 2008 shareholders passed a resolution
authorising the Company to utilise electronic means of
communication with its members. In February 2010
shareholders were given the option to receive
shareholder communications by electronic means. 
To date 76% of our shareholders have opted for
delivery in this way. The Company believes this
equates with the advice it gives to its clients regarding
utilising all channels of communication and also further
illustrates our commitment to the environment by
reducing the carbon emissions associated with the
production and delivery of printed matter.
Accountability and Audit
Financial Reporting
A review of the businesses in the Group is included in
the Chief Executive’s Review. The Board uses this,
together with the Chairman’s Statement and the
Directors’ report on pages 38 to 43 to present a
balanced and understandable assessment of the
Company’s position and prospects. The Directors’
responsibilities for the financial statements are
described on page 44 of the Report and Financial
Statements.
Internal Control
The Board has established a process for identifying,
evaluating and managing significant risks faced by the
Group. The Board regularly reviews the process,
which has been in place from the start of the year to
the date of approval of this report and which is in
accordance with revised guidance on internal control
published in October 2005 (the Turnbull Guidance).
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of
internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness.
The control and risk management procedures are
designed to highlight any weaknesses and/or failures
in the systems to the Board at the earliest opportunity
together with action taken and/or proposed. Such a
system is designed to manage rather than eliminate
the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and
can only provide reasonable and not absolute
assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Information on the Group’s significant risks, together
with the relevant control and monitoring procedures, 
is reviewed on a monthly basis by the heads of the
business units under the guidance of a nominated
Executive Director and the Company Secretary. 
This information is presented to the Executive
Directors to assess any identified risks and the overall
effectiveness of the system of internal control. An
update on all significant risk management issues is
made to the Board at each quarterly meeting.
Additionally, companies annually complete a review of
specified risk areas and their local risk management
processes under the supervision of divisional
management, the Group Internal Auditor and the
Company Secretary. The Company also has a
subcommittee of the Audit Committee, the Risk 26 Chime Communications plc
Management Committee, that monitors and investigates
potential areas of risk raised by the trading companies
and by the Group’s centralised administrative functions
such as Legal, Human Resources and IT.
The Board recognises the need to ensure that
established risk management procedures and
standards are integrated into all acquired businesses
and accordingly potential areas of non-compliance are
identified during the due diligence process and
addressed post-completion.
A review of the Internal Audit function has been
conducted and reported to the Board within the
annual review of the system of internal controls.
Recommended changes to the scope and application
of internal audit procedures have been adopted. The
internal audit programme for the year has been
presented to and approved by the Audit Committee.
The Group has businesses in Europe, USA, the Middle
East, the Far East, Australia and New Zealand. The
Executive Directors continue to review the opportunities
in other territories. The Audit Committee has broadened
the scope of work of both the internal audit functions
and the systems of risk management in order to ensure
standards of control are maintained throughout the
enlarged Group. Control of the overseas businesses is
currently effected by designated senior executives
reporting directly to the Board.
Given the nature of the Group’s activities, the Board
recognises the risks associated with its ability to
attract, motivate and retain talented employees.
Accordingly, a significant part of the Group’s risk
management procedures are focused in this area and
the Group continues to utilise employee benefits
schemes shown on pages 31 and 33 to help meet 
this requirement.
The Group has material investments in a small number
of associated companies that are not managed by the
Group. Accordingly, the Group can only influence, not
control, their management practices and therefore the
review of internal controls for these operations is less
comprehensive than that for the Group’s managed
operations.
Financial Control
The financial control procedures are described under
the following five headings:
1. Financial reporting – The Group has a
comprehensive system for reporting financial results
to the Board; each trading company prepares
monthly results with a comparison against budget.
The Board reviews these for the Group as a whole 
and by operating segment and determines
appropriate action. Towards the end of each
financial year the operating units prepare detailed
budgets for the following year. Budgets and plans
are reviewed and necessary changes made by the
Board before being adopted formally.
2. Quality and integrity of personnel – One of the
Group’s core values is integrity; this is regarded as
vital to the maintenance of the Group’s system of
internal financial control and is reflected in the
quality and experience of the Group’s financial staff.
3. Operating unit financial controls – Key controls over
major business risks include reviews against
performance indicators and exception reporting.
The trading companies regularly assess their
exposure to major business risks and appropriate
action is taken both at operating and Group level 
in order to ensure that risk is minimised as far 
as possible.
4. Electronic Data Systems – The Group’s financial
and management information is processed by and
stored on data systems. Accordingly, the Group
has established controls and procedures over the
security of data held. The Group has put in place
arrangements for processing to continue and data
to be retained in the event of complete failure of 
any system.
5. Controls over central functions – A number of the
Group’s key functions, including treasury, taxation,
acquisitions and insurance, are dealt with centrally.
Each of these functions has clear and detailed
procedures and is required to report to the Board
on a regular basis; the treasury details are reported
daily to the Finance Director.
Going Concern Basis
The Group’s business activities, together with the
factors likely to affect its future development,
performance and position are set out in the
Chairman’s Statement on pages 2 to 5. The financial
position of the Group, its cash flows and borrowing
facilities are described in the Finance Director’s Report
on pages 38 and 43. In addition, note 34 of the
financial statements includes the Group’s objectives,
policies and processes for managing its capital; its
financial risk management objectives and details of its
financial instruments; and its exposure to credit risk
and liquidity risk.
As highlighted in note 34 to the financial statements,
the Group meets its day to day working capital
requirements through an overdraft facility and a
committed facility which matures in June 2013. 
These facilities are subject to banking covenants as
disclosed in note 34.
In preparing forecasts the directors have taken into
account the following key factors:
� The rate of growth of the UK and global economy
on the Group’s business during the economic
recovery;
� Key client account renewals;
Directors’ Statement on Corporate Governance 
(continued) Annual Report and Accounts 2010 27
� The level of committed and variable costs; and
� Current new business targets compared to levels
achieved in previous years.
The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking account
of reasonably possible changes in trading performance,
show that the Group should be able to operate within
the level of its current facility and banking covenants.
The directors have a reasonable expectation that the
Company and the Group have adequate resources to
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable
future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern
basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial
statements.
More detail on the Group’s cash position and facilities
at 31 December 2010, as well as maturities of the
financial liabilities, can be found in note 34 to the
financial statements. The principal risks and
uncertainties faced by the Group are included in the
Directors’ Report. Details of potential contingent
liabilities and potential cash outflows in relation to
these liabilities can be found in note 30.
Ethics and Integrity
Overview
Chime is a group of companies with a diverse range of
cultures within its subsidiary businesses. The Group
sets standards of behaviour which it expects the
companies to meet irrespective of their market, their
communication discipline, or their culture. Our core
values are the foundation of our standards.
Our values are expressed and find meaning through
the way we behave and the responsibilities we accept
towards our shareholders, customers, colleagues, and
the communities we serve.
� Mutual Respect – for each other as colleagues, and
between ourselves and our client. 
� Mutual Interest – we are a service business. We
know that our own success is intimately linked to
the success we help our client build. 
� Accountable – our job is to deliver results for our
clients and to quantify those results as best we can. 
� Open-Minded – we are open-minded to each other
and to new ideas. We know the enduring qualities
of good business and best practice and yet we
embrace change and new and better ways of 
doing things. 
� Actively Diverse – in our employment practices as
much as our thinking, because diversity is the soul
of creativity.
� Network Savvy – because as modern communicators
we rely on networks as never before, and so each of
us builds our own and leverages it to the advantages
of all our audiences – shareholders, colleagues,
customers and community.
� Tenacious – we don’t give up.
� Collaborative – groups can only work where
collaboration is second nature. Collaboration works
only where there is mutual understanding, mutual
respect and trust. 
Ethics
The Group meets all relevant laws, regulations and
codes of practice issued by any relevant government
or appropriate regulator. We ensure that all our people
are aware and comply with such standards. In
addition, we recognise that integrity is essential to the
maintenance of our reputation in the marketplace. As
part of our regular review process, issues of conduct
are identified, reviewed and the Board is alerted as
appropriate. We utilise our published Code of Conduct
(see below) which formalises the values, behaviour
and ethical standards expected of Chime employees.
This area remains under review. 
Bribery Act 2010
The government has published revised guidance on
the Bribery Act and implementation will now take place
on 1 July 2011. Chime has developed its response to
the statutory requirements building on our existing
standards. The Board acknowledges its responsibility
for developing and maintaining procedures to prevent
corruption within Chime’s operations and will design
and implement a clear response to the requirements of
the Act, taking into account the existing and revised
government guidance. The Board will use the Act as its
minimum benchmark for ethical trading with clients and
partners. Where additional measures are required, by
virtue of working in new markets, for clients who have
specific requirements or, due to our operations moving
into new territories, the Company will adapt the
chosen procedures to meet those needs as they arise.
The Executive Directors will continue to promote the
new measures and make staff aware of the
consequences of non-compliance.
Compliance with Group Standards
Chime has a Code of Conduct which applies to all
staff covering:
� Client and company confidentiality.
� Equal opportunities and the promotion of a
meritocracy.
� A safe and civilised workplace.
� Proper consideration of the sensitivities of potential
audiences when publishing materials. 
� Honest business practice and integrity; and
� Compliance with all laws and regulations. The Code of Conduct remains under review and will
be adapted as market forces and legal requirements
demand or as additional risks are identified. The 
risk management process includes testing of these
areas and encompasses induction of new staff and
suitability of training and reporting.
The Group has a clear, written whistleblowing 
policy and procedure available to all staff regarding
concerns of employees about ethical behaviour and
noncompliance with regulatory requirements and/or
the law. In March 2011 the Group set up a confidential
helpline, to be run by an external third party, in order
that staff can report any perceived shortcomings
within our operations.
Social Responsibility
We are in the business of managing brand and
corporate reputation on behalf of clients and the Board
acknowledges that being socially responsible is an
important factor in the management of our business.
The Board believes that corporate responsibility
should underpin everything that we do. The Group is
therefore committed to demonstrating the importance
of this, not only in our work for clients, but in our own
working practices.
We now have a continuing and embedded
programme of process to induct, brief and train our
staff to ensure our efforts permeate throughout our
Group. Our process design will always include
assessment of our impacts but also our opportunities
in socially responsible deployment.
The Board and Audit Committee receive regular
updates on our corporate responsibility initiatives and
performance. The Chief Executive, Chris Satterthwaite,
personally oversees our continuing efforts in this
important area of our business. Regular consideration
is given to the significance of social, environmental and
ethical (SEE) issues (as defined by the Association of
British Insurers), and as part of our wider operational
risk framework, identifies significant risks arising from
these areas to short-term and long-term value.
The Group also considers corporate responsibility to
be an area of business opportunity. Our subsidiary,
Corporate Citizenship, provides not only a focus for
our investment in this field but provides the Group with
specialist expertise.
The Company measures the performance of each of
its businesses against a benchmark list of minimum
corporate responsibility standards. These cover:
� Promoting good environmental practices – both in
our own operations and to our wider stakeholders;
� Empowering community work – the promotion of
volunteering and charity work by our staff and
companies alike;
� Young people – via our internship, work experience
and graduate schemes.
The standards are designed to be stretching and, as
such, encourage continual improvement in these
important areas. The minimum standards will be
developed in future to encompass other areas of
corporate responsibility.
Performance against the standards is measured
annually and the results are communicated to each
operating business unit. Areas of potential improvement
are addressed and successful best practice is identified
and communicated across the Group. 
We continue to report our corporate responsibility
performance to our stakeholders via our website.
These detail not only the principles of our approach,
our targets and our performance but also give
examples of the initiatives undertaken.
The Company continues to be listed on the FTSE4Good
Index, which evaluates companies’ performance on a
number of corporate responsibility criteria. Business in
the Community awarded the Group a third ‘Big Tick’
award during 2010 for continued progress in
enhancing our environmental performance.
Environment
Whilst the business of Chime Communications has
expanded to a number of worldwide locations, our
operations remain predominantly in the UK. We deliver
services to clients based on image, ideas, research
and content. As such, our direct and indirect impact
on the environment is minimal and considered low-risk.
Our international expansion will obviously increase the
need for air travel and we have continued to deploy
video conferencing facilities and a revised travel policy
to ensure that increases in carbon emissions from our
international growth are kept to a minimum. 
We do acknowledge that our customers, staff and
other stakeholders have an interest in our impact
on the environment and as such we have committed
to monitor and improve our environmental
performance where possible. The Group has
continually reduced its carbon footprint since
becoming Carbon Neutral in 2007. In 2010 we
assessed that our carbon emissions had reduced by
8% per full time employee during 2009. We are
currently assessing our 2010 emissions reductions
and expect to meet our target of a further reduction of
at least 5%. We continue to consider and enhance the
environmental impact of our businesses and are
working closely with our major suppliers to ensure
best practice is embedded in our wider operations. We
regularly incorporate our environmental performance
in business presentations as we believe this is an
important consideration when evaluating reputation
both for our companies and our clients alike.
28 Chime Communications plc
Directors’ Statement on Corporate Governance 
(continued) In 2010 we became the first marketing communications
group to be awarded the Carbon Trust Standard which
recognises companies with a continuing commitment
to improving environmental performance. Chime is the
400th company to receive this accreditation.
Employee Issues
As a people business, our reputation depends on the
skills, knowledge and integrity of our people. Chime
has fostered an entrepreneurial culture and each of
our businesses is encouraged to create a stimulating,
rewarding and inspiring work environment for our
people. Chime’s role is to provide a framework of
standards which each company must meet in its own
way within its own culture.
We do recognise that central oversight on human
resources issues is beneficial and continually review
the employment standards across the Group as part
of the general management and risk identification
processes.
In order to attract and retain talented staff we continue
to operate our Savings-Related Share Option
Schemes together with our Co-Investment Plan, and
Deferred Share Plan. We also continue to review our
incentive schemes on an ongoing basis to ensure they
are fit for purpose. We continue to encourage staff
involvement in a number of initiatives including our
work on our environmental performance and staff
volunteering. We run a graduate scheme across
Chime and encourage involvement in a number of
semi-formal groups in order to develop ideas and to
foster inter-company relationships.
Health and Safety
The Board believes that our people are our most
important asset. Our businesses do not include any
industrial or manufacturing processes and our staff are
mainly office-based. As such, risk of accidents is low.
We do acknowledge that we may expose our staff to
additional areas of risk which, whilst not unique to
Chime (for example, business travel, event
organisation and lone or remote working), do require
further scrutiny, mitigation and procedural guidance in
order to maximise the wellbeing of our people and
those we interact with.
This is an ongoing process and risk assessment of
new developments or increases in activities with a
higher level of risk, is embedded into our review
process.
We take our duty of care seriously and have retained
consultants, Safety Exchange Ltd, who provide not
only guidance on identification and assessment of
hazards but also practical support such as carrying
out risk assessments for events and other activities.

Group Policy on the Remuneration of Directors
and Employees
This Report sets out the Group’s Remuneration
policies for the Directors for the year ended 
31 December 2010. Except where noted, these
policies are likely to continue to apply in future years,
unless there are specific reasons for change. It has
been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 to 
the Accounting regulations under the Companies 
Act 2006. The Report also meets the relevant
requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial
Services Authority and describes how the Board 
has applied the principles relating to Directors’
remuneration in the Combined Code. As required by
the Act, resolutions to approve this Report and the
company’s financial statements will be proposed at
the Annual General Meeting.
The Act requires the auditors to report to the
Company’s members on certain parts of the Directors’
Remuneration Report and to state whether in their
opinion those parts of the Report have been properly
prepared in accordance with the Accounting
Regulations. The Report has therefore been divided
into separate sections for audited and unaudited
information.
Unaudited Information
Remuneration Committee
The composition, chairmanship and activities of the
Remuneration Committee are set out on pages 14
and 24. The members of the Committee receive
remuneration as set out in this report. They abstain
from participating where their own interests are
concerned and have no involvement in the day-to-day
management of the Group’s operations. Other
Directors attend meetings by invitation only but this
would not include when matters relating to their own
remuneration arrangements are discussed. In addition
to the current members of the Committee, Julian
Seymour (resigned 31 December 2007) was a
member when the 2006 Co-Investment Plan, as
detailed later, was approved by the Committee. A
summary of the role, key responsibilities and the work
carried out by the Committee are outlined within the
Corporate Governance Report on page 24. 
During the financial period under review, the
Remuneration Committee sought the assistance of
the Chairman and Finance Director relating to
Directors’ performance and remuneration. The
Committee used Towers Watson to provide specialist
third party advice primarily on competitive market
levels, on the performance-related elements of the
Executive Directors’ remuneration and formulation 
of a new long-term incentive scheme. Towers Watson
were not contracted to supply any other services
during 2010. The Remuneration Committee also
approved the grant of share options under the
Savings-Related Share Option Scheme, the grant 
of shares under the VCCP Key Players Incentive
Scheme, the grant of shares under the Deferred 
Share Plan and the grant of awards under the 2010
Co-Investment Plan.
The Committee’s terms of reference are available on
request from the Company Secretary, via the Chime
website www.chime.plc.uk and, will be available for
inspection at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. 
Remuneration Policy
The Group is committed to attracting and retaining
high quality staff. Remuneration is set at levels
commensurate with competing firms in the same
industry and is monitored on a regular basis. The
performance measurement of the Executive Directors
and key senior management and the determination of
their annual remuneration packages are undertaken
by the Committee. More generally, the Committee
reviews executive remuneration arrangements
regularly to ensure that they remain effective,
competitive and appropriate to the Group’s
circumstances and prospects, and monitors incentive
award levels and consequent company liabilities. 
It also reviews the awards of shares made under the
various Savings Related, Deferred, VCCP Key Players
Incentive Scheme and Co-Investment Plan in terms of
their effect on dilution limits. 
Three of the four Executive Directors spend a large
proportion of their time on fee earning client work.
Their remuneration packages are therefore based on
the appropriate market rate for two different functions.
One is the management of the Group in the executive
roles of Chairman, Deputy Chairman and Chief
Executive and the other is as client handlers and new
business winners. Looked at in those terms their
remuneration is considered to be in line with market
rates. The Committee places considerable emphasis
on the performance linked elements of their
remuneration i.e. Annual Bonus, Deferred Share
Incentives and Long-Term Incentives.
Non-Executive Directors Remuneration
The fees paid to the Non-Executive Directors during
2010 are set out on page 35. These had remained
unchanged since 2008. In 2010 the level of fees
payable to Rodger Hughes, the Senior Independent
Director, was increased to reflect the increased
commitment required to fulfil his duties and his
appointment as a Non-Executive Director of a
subsidiary company.
The Non-Executive Directors do not participate in the
Company’s pension or share option or other incentive
plans. The Board considers that the Non-Executive
Directors’ remuneration conforms with the
requirements of the Code.
Directors’ Remuneration Report Annual Report and Accounts 2010 31
Executive Director Remuneration
In 2010 there were five main elements of the
remuneration packages for Executive Directors:
� basic annual salary and benefits;
� annual bonus payments which cannot exceed 
50% of salary;
� deferred share incentives;
� long-term incentive plans; and
� pension arrangements.
Basic Annual Salary and Benefits
In setting salary levels, the Remuneration Committee
considers the experience and responsibility of the
Executive Directors and their personal performance
during the previous year. The Committee also takes
account of salary levels within other companies of a
similar size and nature, as well as the rates of
increases for other employees within the Group. The
Remuneration Committee reviews salaries with effect
from January each year. 
Since January 2001 there have been only two salary
increases to Executive Directors: firstly, to Mark Smith,
Group Finance Director, in 2006 and secondly to
Christopher Satterthwaite, Chief Executive, in 2009.
The Committee has only awarded salary increases 
for a Director assuming additional responsibilities
provided that amounts paid remain at market levels.
The benefits provided by the Group to the Executive
Directors consist principally of pension allowance, a
car or car allowance and private medical insurance.
Annual Bonus
The Executive Directors’ annual bonus arrangements
are focused on the achievement of the Group’s short-
term objectives. The annual bonus allocation is
capped at a maximum of 50% of salary for the
Executive Directors; of this up to 25% of the relevant
Director’s salary may be payable if the Company
meets the profit targets set by the Board. A further
maximum of 25% may be paid to each Executive
Director, based on performance against personal key
performance indicators linked to the Group’s stated
strategy and tailored to their individual roles. Some of
these are non-financial. The Remuneration Committee
reviews the specific key performance indicators for
each Director and assesses their overall performance
both against those indicators and generally. Based on
this assessment the Committee determines what, if
any, further bonus is payable. The Committee believes
the performance metrics chosen align with shareholder 
value creation. Bonus payments are not pensionable.
For 2010, the key performance indicators included:
� Growth in operating profit margin
� Growth in income from international work
� Growth in number and value of shared clients
� Growth in average fee per client
� Revenue generation
� Client retention
� Cash management and conversion
� Quality of internal control
� Management of Chime’s reputation
� Retention of senior executives 
� Management of debtors
The Committee considered the performance of the
Directors in March 2011. The profit targets set by 
the Committee have been met in a challenging
environment and performance again compares
favourably with that of competitors. The Committee has
also assessed each Directors’ achievements against
their individual key performance indicators. Bonus
awards averaging 44% of salary have been approved by
the Committee reflecting generally excellent performance.
The resultant bonuses for each Director for 2010 are
shown in the remuneration table on page 35.
Deferred Share Plan
During 2006 the Company introduced a Deferred
Share Plan (the Plan). Under the Plan restricted rights
over existing Chime Communications shares are
granted to Executive Board Directors, subsidiary
Board Directors and senior employees of the Group. 
A participant of the Plan must remain employed by 
the Group for a fixed period as determined by the
Remuneration Committee at the date of grant after the
date of grant for the shares to vest with the employee.
There are no other performance criteria attached to
the restricted shares. The Plan aims to encourage the
retention of key employees. All grants under the Plan
are approved by the Remuneration Committee. The
grants under the Plan to date have been relatively
modest. The Deferred Share Plan replaced the
Executive Share Option Scheme. There are presently
Deferred Share Plans that have vesting periods of one,
two, and three years.
The Executive Directors received grants under the
Plan in 2006 but were excluded from participation in
any other incentive scheme for the duration of the
2006 Co-Investment Plan.
The rules of the Plan as approved by shareholders in
2006 authorised the Remuneration Committee to use
its discretion to “get or keep favourable tax, exchange
control or regulatory treatment” for participants. 
As such the Committee authorised the earlier maturity
date of March 2010 (previously July 2010) in order to
benefit the participants of the grant in 2007. This
change was at no additional cost to the shareholders.
The grant comprised 34 participants and 151,000
shares and did not include the Executive Directors.  32 Chime Communications plc
Directors’ Remuneration Report

2006 Co-Investment Plan
In 2006 shareholder approval was granted to
introduce a Co-Investment Plan (CIP). The CIP was
established to align the interests of the Company’s
most senior executives to the three year business plan
put in place during 2006. Participation in the Plan was
dependent upon the commitment by the executive to
maintain an investment in the Company’s shares until
the end of the performance period in return for an
award over a maximum of five times as many
matching shares. The number of matching shares that
vest was dependent upon the achievement of
performance targets measured over a four year
performance period.
Assessment of Peformance
50% of the matching shares were tied to the aggregate 
reported earnings per share (EPS) and 50% tied to
total shareholder return (TSR) relative to a peer group
of other media companies. No further awards were
made after 2007.
The maximum award would have been for achieving
EPS growth the equivalent to 26% per annum
compounded and a TSR ranking in the top 15% of the
peer group. In addition to the above requirements, the
Remuneration Committee had to be satisfied as to the
underlying financial performance of the Company.
The Company’s financial performance over the four
year performance period resulted in EPS growth of
15.91% translating to a payout against the EPS target
of 49.53%. Against the peer group of companies, the
Company’s annualised TSR placed it above the first
ranking peer company, giving a 100% payout against
the TSR target. In total 74.77% of the maximum
possible award shares vested. This totalled 1,816,650
shares. The shares had been purchased previously,
and held by the Chime Communications plc Employee
Trust during the life of the CIP for this purpose and, in
accordance with the approval by shareholders of the
CIP in 2006. 
The table on page 36 shows the shares that vested to
the Executive Directors.
Vesting Date
The rules of the CIP approved by shareholders in
2006 provide that the Committee may:
(i) change the CIP to take account of changes to
the ICTA 1988 or other relevant law and:
(ii) may change the CIP to get or keep favourable
tax, exchange control or regulatory treatment
for participants or any member of the Group
The CIP provided the Company with an element of
executive retention in that the participants would
forfeit their right to matching shares if they left the
Company after the performance period ended but prior 
to the original Vesting Date of 13 September 2010.
The Committee considered and resolved that the
participants of the CIP would be given the option to
elect to have their matching shares (either in total or in
part) vest at the earlier date of 19 March. However,
participants choosing the earlier vesting date agreed
to forfeit the vested matching shares if they left the
Company’s employment in the period prior to the
original Vesting Date of 13 September 2010.
The table on page 36 shows the vesting dates
applicable to each Executive Director.
2010 Co-Investment Plan
As the 2006 CIP matured in 2010 the Committee
developed a replacement long term investment plan in
order to continue to incentivise the Executive Directors
and senior management and to increase alignment
with the requirements of shareholders. Shareholder
approval of the 2010 CIP was granted at the AGM in
May 2010 and awards were made under the scheme
to 14 senior employees during 2010.
The 2010 CIP shares many features with the 2006 CIP
with some changes intended to improve effectiveness.
The 2010 CIP is an annual ‘rolling’ plan with
discretionary share awards made to participants
subject to the approval of the Committee. Participation
is intended to be limited to up to 20 senior employees
(including the Executive Directors) of the Company
and its subsidiaries. Participants receive an award of
shares which will vest after a three-year performance
period, dependent on the achievement of demanding
performance conditions to be set by the Committee
for each award. Participation will be dependent upon
the participant maintaining an investment in the
Company throughout the period between award and
vesting. For Executive Directors, this investment will
be 25% of each award under the CIP . The maximum
award of shares to a participant in a year will be set by
the Committee but will normally be no more than
100% of annual salary. 
Performance Conditions 
The Committee considers that the primary engine for
the creation of long-term shareholder value is
sustained growth in profitability, for which the primary
and most complete measure is earnings per share
(EPS). However, the Committee is keen for the plan to
reward the delivery of shareholder return. For the 2010
awards, 50% of the award will be subject to relative
total shareholder return (TSR) (growth in share price
plus reinvested dividends) and 50% subject to 
EPS growth.  Annual Report and Accounts 2010 33
Whilst the Committee has discretion to determine how
EPS will be calculated for each annual grant, it is
intended that EPS performance for the 2010 awards
will be measured using the method included in the
Notice of Meeting of the 2010 AGM.
If the Company’s position in relation to the peer group
places it at or above the 75th percentile then 100% of
the shares tied to TSR will vest. If the Company’s
position in relation to the peer group is between the
50th and the 75th percentile the number of award
shares that will vest will vary on a straight line basis
between 30% and 100%. For a position below the
50th percentile no award shares tied to TSR will vest.
The Notice of Meeting which proposed approval by
shareholders of the 2010 CIP included details of the
peer group of media companies to be used in the
assessment of performance. In early 2011 Chrysalis
Group plc was acquired and is no longer listed and
therefore comparative results will not be available.
During 2011 the Committee will consider if Chrysalis
will be replaced in the peer group and, if so, by 
which company. 
VCCP Key Players Incentive Scheme
During 2008 the Company introduced an incentive
scheme for key individuals within the VCCP Group.
Under the Scheme a bonus pool is calculated with
reference to growth in profits of the VCCP Group, the
bonus pool is payable 50% in cash and 50% in
restricted rights over existing Chime Communications
shares. The distribution of the pool is restricted to
senior employees of the VCCP Group. The Scheme
covers the period 1 January 2008 to 31 December
2012. A participant of the Scheme must remain
employed by the Group for a fixed period as
determined by the Committee at the date of grant after
the date of grant for the cash and shares to vest with
the employee. The Scheme allows for a claw-back
facility if the profits of the VCCP Group fall below a
base level of profits. There are no other performance
criteria attached to the cash or restricted shares. 
The Scheme aims to encourage the retention of key
employees within the VCCP Group. All grants under
the Scheme are approved by the Remuneration
Committee. The grants under the Scheme to date
have been relatively modest.
In December 2010 the Committee resolved to grant 
no further awards under the Scheme. From 2011
VCCP executives and staff will be incentivised via the
Company’s Deferred Share Plan. 
Share Option Schemes
Previously the Company has operated an Executive
Share Option Scheme for Executive Directors,
subsidiary Board Directors and senior employees.
All executive options granted from November 1997
(other than special executive options) are subject to 
the Group achieving, during the period of grant, an
average total shareholder return on the shares for the
preceding three years which exceeds the average
FTSE 100 total shareholder return for the same period
and a percentage growth in earnings per share which
is at least equal to the percentage growth in the Retail
Price Index plus 6% over three years. The exercise
price of the options granted under the above scheme
is equal to the market value of the Company’s shares
at the time when the options were granted. There have
been no grants of Executive Share Options since 2005.
Executive share options are only expected to be
granted in future if there is a contractual commitment
or in exceptional circumstances.
The Company also operates a Savings-Related Share
Option Scheme which is open to all employees after an
initial qualifying period of employment.
Pensions
Pension contributions on behalf of the Executive
Directors are paid by the Company to the Group’s
money purchase pension scheme for a personal
pension arrangement up to the value of 20% of their 
basic salary. 
Directors’ Interests in Contracts and Other
Transactions with Group Companies
No Director has a material interest in any contract with
any Group company other than a service contract.
Directors’ Contracts
The Company’s policy is that Executive Directors
should normally be employed on rolling contracts
which may be terminated by the Company giving no
more than 12 months’ notice and which otherwise
expires on retirement, currently at age 65 and this is
the case in respect of three of the four Executive
Directors. The Company acknowledges that in October
2011 the default retirement age will be removed and
confirms that alternative arrangements in this respect
will be put in place. In December 2010 the Company
agreed to make an amendment to the service contract
of Lord Bell in order that he may continue as a Director
on a rolling contract without retirement date but
including the 12 month notice of termination provision. 
Any compensation payable on early termination of
employment contracts for the Executive Directors or
any employee would be in line with contractual and
statutory requirements. 34 Chime Communications plc

At the forthcoming Annual General Meeting each of
the Directors will resign and offer themselves for 
re-election.
Other than described in the Report of the Board to the
Shareholders on Directors’ Remuneration no Director
of the Company has, or had during the year, any
interests in the shares of other Group companies or in
any transactions which were unusual in their nature or
were significant to the Company’s business.
Directors’ Indemnities
As at the date of this report, indemnities are in force
under which the Company has agreed to indemnify
the Directors, to the extent permitted by law and
Company’s Articles of Association, in respect of all
losses arising out of, or in connection with, the
execution of their powers, duties and responsibilities,
as Directors of the Company or any of its subsidiaries.
There is no agreement in place between the Company
and its Directors and employees providing for
compensation for loss of office of employment
(whether through resignation, purported redundancy
or otherwise) that occurs because of a takeover bid.
The Company has purchased and maintains Directors’
and Officers’ insurance cover against legal liabilities
and costs for claims in connection with any act or
omission by its Directors or Officers in the execution 
of their duties.
Donations
During the year the Group donated £58,000 (2009:
£19,000) for charitable purposes.
The Group’s policy is not to make direct donations to
support political parties. However, the nature of the
Group’s work is such that to support its commercial
activities, certain companies within the Group may
need to attend or sponsor events which are organised
by political parties or other political organisations, for
which a charge is made. In addition, the Group may
invite clients and prospective clients to attend events
which fall within the meaning of the Companies Act
2006 provisions. The Companies Act 2006 defines
‘political party’, ‘political organisations’, ‘political
donation’ and ‘political expenditure’ widely and as a
result, it is possible that political organisations may
include bodies concerned with matters such as policy
review and law reform, or the representation of the
business community or sections of it, or the representation 
of other communities or special interest groups.
During the year and adopting this wider definition, the
Group made payments that might be deemed to be
political donations totalling £27,000 (2009: £39,000)
to various organisations, including £15,000 connected
with the Conservative Party, £6,000 connected with
the Liberal Democrats and £6,000 connected with the
Labour Party.
In line with recommendations made by the
Association of British Insurers, the Board intends to
seek an annual authority to make donations or incur
expenditure of a political nature.
Employee Involvement
The Group places considerable value on the
involvement of its employees and has continued to
keep them informed on matters affecting them as
employees and on the various factors affecting the
performance of the Group. This is achieved principally
via the Group’s intranet site, e-mails and formal and
informal functions. In addition, the Group’s Savings-
Related Share Option Scheme, Performance Related
Pay and bonus schemes encourage employees at all
levels to contribute to the achievement of the Group’s
short and long-term goals.
The Group believes in an equality of opportunity for all
employees based on merit and that no employee or
job applicant should receive less favourable treatment
on the grounds of: age, sex, marital status, disability,
colour, race, religion, nationality or ethnic origin.
Employment of Disabled Persons
The Group gives full and fair consideration to all
applications for employment made by disabled
persons, having regard to their particular aptitudes
and abilities. Opportunities for training, career
development and promotion do not disadvantage
these employees.
Creditor Payment Terms
The Group’s policy on suppliers is that they will be
paid in accordance with agreed terms and conditions
of trade on a regular basis.
The number of days outstanding between receipt of
invoices and date of payment, calculated by reference
to the amount owed to trade creditors at the year-end
as a proportion of the amounts invoiced by suppliers
during the year, is disclosed in note 22.

Rights and Obligations Attaching to Shares
The rights attaching to the Company’s ordinary shares,
being the only share class of the company, are set out
in the Articles. Subject to the Companies Acts and
applicable law, shares may be issued with such rights
and restrictions as the Company may by ordinary
resolution decide, or if no such resolution is in effect or
such resolution does not make specific provision as
the Board may determine. There is currently no such
applicable resolution in effect. 
Voting Rights
Holders of ordinary shares are entitled to attend and
speak at general meetings of the Company. On a
show of hands every holder of ordinary shares who is
present in person shall have one vote. On a poll every
holder of ordinary shares present in person shall have
one vote for every share of which he is the holder.
Votes may be exercised in person or by proxy. Every
notice of general meeting of the Company shall
specify the deadlines in relation to the exercise of
voting rights in respect of each resolution proposed 
at such meeting. Electronic and paper proxy
appointments must be received not later than 48
hours before the general meeting, provided that at an
adjournment of a meeting the proxy form must be
received not later than 24 hours before the date of the
adjourned meeting. 
No holder of ordinary shares may attend or vote
(whether in person or by proxy) nor exercise any other
right conferred by being a holder of ordinary shares,
unless all calls or other sums presently payable by 
the holder of such ordinary shares have been paid. 
A holder of ordinary shares may lose the entitlement 
to vote at a general meeting where that holder has
failed to respond to a disclosure notice made by the
Company under the Companies Acts with information
concerning interests held in those shares. 
Variation of Rights
The Company may resolve by the consent of not less
than 75% in nominal value of the issued shares of the
Company, and subject to the Companies Acts, to 
vary all or any of the rights attaching to the shares of
the Company. 
Restriction on Transfer of Shares
The Directors may refuse, provided such refusal does
not prevent dealings in the shares of the Company
from taking place in an open and proper manner or
where the Company has a lien over such shares, to
register a transfer of certificated shares which are not
fully paid, or where the instrument of transfer has not
been correctly stamped and lodged at the place
designated by the Board accompanied by the
certificate of shares and such other evidence of title as
may be reasonably required to show the right of the
transferor to make the transfer. The Directors may also
refuse to register a transfer unless it is to a person
who is: (i) not a minor; (ii) a bankrupt; (iii) is subject to
an order made on the grounds of some mental or
other incapacity that prevents management of their
own affairs; (iv) the transfer is in favour of not more
than four transferees; and (v) the instrument of transfer
is in respect of one class of shares only.
Transfers of uncertificated shares of the Company
may be made using the CREST system and the
Directors may refuse a transfer of shares in
accordance with the rules governing the operation 
of the CREST system. 
Significant Direct or Indirect Holdings of
Securities and Special Rights
The holdings of shares of the Company by the
Directors are notified on page 37. Significant holdings
in the shares of the Company are notified on page 41.
Under the subscription Agreement between the
Company and WPP plc of 1997, WPP plc has the
right to appoint two non-executive directors of the
Company provided it holds not less than 20% of the
shares of the Company and the right to appoint one
non-executive director provided it holds not less than
12.5% of the shares of the Company. There are no
other holdings of shares of the Company in which
there are special rights. 
Dividends and Other Payments
The Company may by ordinary resolution from time to
time declare dividends in accordance with the rights of
the members subject to the provisions of the
Companies Acts and provided that the dividend does
not exceed the amount recommended by the Board
of Directors. The Board may pay interim dividends in
such amount as the Board considers justified by the
financial position of the Company.
Appointment and Replacement of Directors
Directors may be appointed by ordinary resolution of
the Company in general meeting or by the Board
upon the recommendation of the Nominations
Committee. Directors may be removed by ordinary
resolution of the Company in general meeting upon

other Directors of the Company being not fewer than
three in number.  Annual Report and Accounts 2010 41
Powers of the Directors
The Directors of the Company may exercise all the
powers of the Company as set out in the Articles
including the power to borrow money, to mortgage or
charge the assets and property of the Company, to
issue securities and to give securities for any debt or
liability of the Company or any third party. The Board
of Directors exercising such powers shall manage the
business of the Company. The Company may also
authorise the Directors to issue, increase, consolidate,
sub-divide and cancel shares by ordinary resolution
and in accordance with the relevant Articles and
legislation. 
Amendment to the Articles
Amendment to the Articles of Association may be
made by special resolution of the Company in general
meeting in accordance with the Companies Acts. 
Employee Share Trust
The Company operates a number of schemes in order
to incentivise the employees of the Company. Shares
are held by a trustee in order to satisfy the
entitlements of employees under the Group’s share
schemes other than those that are satisfied by the
issue of new shares. The shares held by the trustee
do not have any special rights with regard to the control
of the Company. The rights attaching to the shares
held by the trustee are generally not exercisable by the
relevant employees except where the interest is held
beneficially by them. Further details on the share
schemes may be found on pages 32 and 33.
Acquisition of the Company’s own Shares
The Company may purchase its own shares in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the
Companies Acts, subject to the resolution of the
shareholders. Shares purchased by the Company may
be held in treasury or should, if not held in treasury, be
cancelled immediately thus reducing the issued share
capital of the Company. 
At the end of the year, the Directors had authority,
under the shareholders’ resolution issued on 12 May
2010, to purchase through the market 7,336,762 of
the Company’s own ordinary shares at prices not less
than 25p per ordinary share and not more than five
per cent above the average of the middle market
quotations as derived from the London Stock
Exchange Daily Official List. This authority will last until
the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting.
Significant Agreements
The following significant agreement contains
provisions entitling the counterparties to exercise
termination or other rights in the event of a change of
control of the Company:
Under the £32 million committed banking facility
agreement dated 18 August 2008 between the
Company and The Royal Bank of Scotland Plc, upon
a change of control of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries, without the consent of the bank, the
bank may by written notice declare the loan, all
interest accrued and all other sums payable under 
the agreement to be immediately due and payable
and/or terminate the obligations of the bank under 
the agreement.
The Directors confirm there are no contractual or other
arrangements between the Group and any person
which are essential to the business of the company.

affecting the Group as at 31 December 2010 and

The following are considered to be the principal risks
impacting the Group. These risks are regularly
assessed and monitored by the senior management
team in each division and by the Executive
Management Team.
� The Group receives a significant portion of its
revenues from a limited number of large clients, and
the loss of those clients would adversely impact the
Group’s prospects, business, financial condition
and result of operations.
A relatively small number of clients contribute a
significant percentage of the Group’s operating
income. The Group’s two largest clients accounted
for approximately 21% of operating income in the
year ended 31 December 2010 (2009: 22%) and
the Group’s 30 largest clients accounted for
approximately 49% of operating income in the year
ended 31 December 2009 (2009: 57%).
� The Group is dependent on key personnel and its
relationships with clients.
The Group’s future success is substantially
dependent on the continued services and
continuing contributions of its Directors, senior
management and other key personnel. The loss of
the services of any of the Group’s executive officers
or other key employees could have a material
adverse effect on the Group’s business. 
� The marketing communications industry is highly
competitive.
The Group may face significant competition, both
actual and potential, including competition from
global competitors which have large capital
resources in the provision of similar services to
those provided by the Group. Competition in the
industry is based upon: range and quality of
services offered; geographical reach; reputation;
and client relationships. 
� The Group has a large amount of deferred
contingent consideration pursuant to previous
acquisitions that may become payable.
The Group has deferred contingent consideration
payable in the upcoming years pursuant to the
terms of previous acquisitions of businesses. 
The fulfilment of these payment obligations may
detrimentally impact cash available to the Group 
to manage and grow its business efficiently.
� Fluctuations of revenues, expenses and operating
results may affect the Group’s results.
The Group’s revenues, expenses and operating
results could vary significantly from period to period
as a result of a variety of factors, some of which are
outside the Group’s control. These factors include
general economic conditions, recessionary cycles,
conditions specific to the market, seasonal trends in
revenues, capital expenditure, other costs and the
introduction of new products or services by the
Group or its competitors. In response to a changing
competitive environment, the Group may elect from
time to time to make certain pricing, service or
marketing decisions that could have a material
adverse effect on the Group’s revenues, results of
operations and financial condition. 
Other risks which impact the Group are as follows:
� Exposure to liabilities in respect of advertising
claims.
The Group may be exposed to liabilities from
allegations that certain of its clients’ advertising
claims may be false or misleading or that its clients’
products may be defective. The Group has
insurance against such claims.
� Goodwill and other acquired intangible assets
recorded on the Group’s balance sheet with respect
to acquired companies may become impaired. 
The Group has a significant amount of goodwill and
other acquired intangible assets recorded on its
balance sheet with respect to acquired companies.
The Group annually tests the carrying value of
goodwill for impairment. The estimates and
assumptions about results of operations and cash
flows made in connection with impairment testing
could differ from future actual results of operations
and cash flows. In addition, future events could
cause the Group to conclude that the asset 
values associated with a given operation have
become impaired. 
� The Group is subject to currency rate risk.
The Group operates globally, as explained in note 3
to the financial statements. Fluctuations in
exchange rates between currencies in which the
Group operates, relative to pounds sterling, may
cause fluctuations in its financial results. The main
currencies which impact the Group’s operations are
the US dollar and the Euro.
Directors’ Report
(continued) Annual Report and Accounts 2010 43
� The Group may be subject to certain regulations
that could restrict the Group’s activities.
From time to time, governments, government
agencies and industry self-regulatory bodies in 
the countries in which the Group operates have
adopted statutes, regulations and rulings that
directly or indirectly affect the form, content and
scheduling of advertising, public relations and public
affairs and market research, or otherwise affect the
activities of the Group and its clients. 
Auditors
Each of the persons who is a Director at the date of
approval of this report confirms that:
� so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant
audit information of which the Group’s auditors are
unaware; and
� the Director has taken all the steps that he/she
ought to have taken as a Director in order to make
himself/herself aware of any relevant audit
information and to establish that the company’s
auditors are aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in
accordance with the provisions of s418 of the
Companies Act 2006.
Deloitte LLP have expressed their willingness to
continue in office as auditors and a resolution to
reappoint them will be proposed at the forthcoming
Annual General Meeting.

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual
Report and the financial statements in accordance
with applicable laws and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare such
financial statements for each financial year. Under that
law the Directors are required to prepare Group
financial statements in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted 
by the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS
Regulation and have also chosen to prepare the
parent company financial statements in accordance
with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and
applicable law). Under company law the Directors
must not approve the accounts unless they are
satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state
of affairs of the company and of the profit or loss of
the company for that period. In preparing these
financial statements, the Directors are required to:
� select suitable accounting policies and then apply
them consistently;
� make judgments and accounting estimates that are
reasonable and prudent; and
� prepare the financial statements on the going
concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume
that the company will continue in business.
In preparing the Group financial statements, International
Accounting Standard 1 requires that directors:
� properly select and apply accounting policies;
� present information, including accounting policies,
in a manner that provides relevant, reliable,
comparable and understandable information; and
� provide additional disclosures when compliance
with the specific requirements in IFRSs are
insufficient to enable users to understand the
impact of particular transactions, other events and
conditions on the entity’s financial position and
financial performance; and
� make an assessment of the company’s ability to
continue as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper
accounting records that are sufficient to show and
explain the Group’s transactions and disclose with
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position
of the Group and enable them to ensure that the
financial statements comply with the Companies 
Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding
the assets of the Group and hence for taking
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection 
of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and
integrity of the corporate and financial information
included on the Group’s website. Legislation in the
United Kingdom governing the preparation and
dissemination of financial statements may differ from
legislation in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ Responsibility Statement
We confirm to the best of our knowledge:
� the financial statements, prepared in accordance
with International Financial Reporting Standards as
adopted by the EU, give a true and fair view of the
assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss
of the company and the undertakings included in
the consolidation taken as a whole; and
� the Directors’ report includes a fair review of the
development and performance of the business and
the position of the company and the undertakings
included in the consolidation taken as a whole,
together with a description of the principal risks and
uncertainties that they face.

This report is made solely to the company’s members,

undertaken so that we might state to the company’s
members those matters we are required to state to
them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose.
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than
the company and the company’s members as a body,
for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions
we have formed.
Respective Responsibilities of Directors 
and Auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement, the Directors are responsible for the
preparation of the group financial statements and for
being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our
responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on 
the group financial statements in accordance with
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing
(UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to
comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical
Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the Audit of the Financial Statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements
sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the
financial statements are free from material
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This
includes an assessment of: whether the accounting
policies are appropriate to the group’s circumstances
and have been consistently applied and adequately
disclosed; the reasonableness of significant
accounting estimates made by the directors; and the
overall presentation of the financial statements.
Opinion on Financial Statements
In our opinion the group financial statements:
� give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s
affairs as at 31 December 2010 and of its profit for
the year then ended;
� have been properly prepared in accordance with
IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and
� have been prepared in accordance with the
requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Separate Opinion in Relation to IFRSs as Issued
by the IASB
As explained in note 2 to the group financial
statements, the group in addition to complying with its
legal obligation to apply IFRSs as adopted by the
European Union, has also applied IFRSs as issued by
the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
In our opinion the group financial statements comply
with IFRSs as issued by the IASB.
Opinion on Other Matter Prescribed by the
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’
Report for the financial year for which the group
financial statements are prepared is consistent with
the group financial statements.
Matters on Which We are Required to Report 
by Exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to
report to you if, in our opinion:
� certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration
specified by law are not made; or
� we have not received all the information and
explanations we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
� the Directors’ statement in relation to going
concern;
� the part of the Corporate Governance Statement
relating to the company’s compliance with the nine
provisions of the June 2008 Combined Code
specified for our review; and
� certain elements of the report to shareholders by
the Board on Directors’ remuneration.
Other Matter
We have reported separately on the parent company
financial statements of Chime Communications plc 
for the year ended 31 December 2010 and on the
information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that
is described as having been audited.

2. Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Accounting
The financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards. The financial statements have also been
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as issued by the
International Accounting Standards Board (IASB)
adopted for use in the European Union and therefore
comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The financial statements have been prepared on the
historical cost basis except for certain financial
instruments that are carried at fair value in accordance
with the accounting policies set out below. 
Accounting policies have been applied consistently
between years with the exception of the new
standards or amendments adopted in the year.
The 2009 balance sheet has been restated in
accordance with IFRS 3 to reflect changes in the fair
value of net assets acquired relating to acquisitions
completed during the prior year. The adjustments to
fair value are detailed in note 13, and have a
corresponding impact on goodwill.
In addition, Branded Moments of Truth is now
reported as part of Public Relations (previously part of
Advertising and Marketing Services). This has been
reflected in the 2009 segmental analysis.
Critical Accounting Judgments and Key Sources
of Estimation Uncertainty
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting
policies, Management is required to make judgments,
estimates and assumptions that may affect the
financial statements. Management believes that the
judgments made in the preparation of the financial
statements are reasonable. However, actual outcomes
may differ from those anticipated.
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other
key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance
sheet date, that have a significant risk of causing a
material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets
and liabilities within the next financial year, are
discussed below:
Valuation and Asset Lives of Separately Identifiable
Intangible Assets
In order to determine the value of the separately
identifiable assets on the acquisition of a business
combination, management are required to make
estimates when utilising the Group’s valuation
methodologies. These methodologies include the use
of discounted cash flows, revenue and profit before
tax multiples. Asset lives are estimated based on the
nature of the intangible asset acquired and range
between 4 and 8 years and indefinite lives.
Impairment of Goodwill and Other 
Intangible Assets
There are a number of assumptions Management has
considered in performing impairment reviews of
goodwill and intangible assets, as determining
whether goodwill or intangible assets are impaired
requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash
generating units to which goodwill has been allocated.
The value in use calculation requires Directors to
estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from
the cash generating unit and a suitable discount rate
in order to calculate net present value. Note 13 details
the assumptions that have been applied.
Contingent Consideration and Valuation 
of Put Option
Contingent consideration relating to acquisitions has
been included based on management estimates of
the most likely outcome (notes 25 & 30). Annual Report and Accounts 2010 53
Headline Results
Management believes that headline operating profit
(note 4) and headline earnings per share (note 12)
provide additional useful information on underlying
trends to shareholders. These measures are used 
for internal performance analysis and incentive
compensation arrangements for employees. The term
headline is not a defined term under IFRS and may
not therefore be comparable with similarly titled profit
measurements reported by other companies. It is not
intended to be a substitute for, or superior to IFRS
measurements of profits. The principal adjustments
made are in respect of:
� Restructuring costs – the costs incurred by the
Group in reorganising and integrating acquired
businesses, non-recurring business restructuring,
closure or disposal of businesses and costs
associated with senior management level changes;
� Finance income and costs – the costs incurred by
the Group in reorganising financing arrangements;
� Amortisation and impairment of acquired intangible
fixed assets and goodwill – the Group continues to
amortise these intangible fixed assets and test for
impairment of these assets but does not see these
charges as integral to underlying trading; and
� Costs of business combinations – IFRS 3 (revised)
which was effective from 1 January 2010 and is
therefore applied for the first time in these financial
statements, requires transaction costs, changes in
the value of contingent consideration, settlement of
pre-existing contracts and share-based payments
to be expensed, management do not see these
charges as integral to the underlying trading.
Basis of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the
financial statements of the Company and entities
controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries) made up
to 31 December each year. Control is achieved where
the Company has the power to govern the financial
and operating policies of an investee entity so as to
obtain benefits from its activities.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and
contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at
their fair values at the date of acquisition. Any excess
of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the
identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as
goodwill. Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition
below the fair values of the identifiable net assets
acquired (i.e. discount on acquisition) is credited to the
income statement in the period of acquisition. The
interest of non-controlling shareholders is stated at the
non-controlling shareholder’s proportion of the fair
values of the assets and liabilities recognised.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of
during the year are included in the consolidated
income statement from the effective date of
acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as
appropriate. Following the adoption of IAS 27 during
the year, transactions to acquire non-controlling
shareholders’ interests in a subsidiary are recorded 
in equity.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial
statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting
policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and
expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Going Concern
The Directors have, at the time of approving the
financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the
Company and the Group have adequate resources to
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable
future. They continue to adopt the going concern
basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements. 
Further detail is contained in the Corporate
Governance Report on page 26.
Investments in Associates
An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a
position to exercise significant influence, but not
control or joint control, through participation in the
financial and operating policy decisions of the investee.
The results, assets and liabilities of associates are
incorporated in these financial statements using the
equity method of accounting except when classified
as held for sale. Investments in associates are carried
in the balance sheet at cost as adjusted by post-
acquisition changes in the Group’s share of the net
assets of the associate, less any impairment in the
value of individual investments. Losses of the
associates in excess of the Group’s interest in those
associates are not recognised, unless the Group has
incurred a legal or constructive obligation or made
payments on behalf of the associate.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s
share of the fair values of the identifiable net assets of
the associate at the date of acquisition is recognised
as goodwill and is included in the carrying value of the
investment. Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition
below the Group’s share of the fair values of the
identifiable net assets of the associate at the date of
acquisition (i.e. discount on acquisition) is credited in
the income statement in the period of acquisition.
Where a group company transacts with an associate
of the Group, unrealised profits and losses are
eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the
relevant associate. 54 Chime Communications plc
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
Year ended 31 December 2010
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the
excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s
interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets,
liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised. Goodwill
is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment
at least annually. Any impairment is recognised in the
income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of
transition to IFRSs has been retained at the previous
UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for
impairment at that date. Goodwill written off to
reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been
reinstated and is not included in determining any
subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
For acquisitions accounted for under IFRS 3 the
consideration used in the calculation of goodwill
includes third party costs incurred to effect the
acquisition. Following the adoption of IFRS 3 (revised)
(acquisitions from 1 January 2010) these costs are
expensed through the income statement and included
in costs of acquisitions.
On disposal of a subsidiary or associate, the
attributable amount of goodwill is included in the
determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
For acquisitions accounted for under IFRS 3, future
anticipated payments to vendors in respect of
earnouts are based on the Directors’ best estimates of
future obligations, which are dependent on future
performance of the interests acquired and assume the
operating companies improve profits in line with
Directors’ estimates and are included in liabilities
greater or less than one year as appropriate. Following
the adoption of IFRS 3 (revised), changes to earnouts
are recorded in the income statement through costs of
acquisitions. In both instances, when earnouts are to
be settled in cash or share consideration, the fair value
of the consideration is obtained by discounting to
present value the amounts expected to be payable in
the future. The resulting interest charge is included
within finance costs of deferred consideration.
In accordance with IFRS an impairment charge is
required for both goodwill and other indefinite lived
assets when the carrying amount exceeds the
‘recoverable amount’, defined as the higher of fair
value less costs to sell and value in use. Our approach
in determining the recoverable amount utilises a
discounted cash flow methodology, which necessarily
involves making numerous estimates and
assumptions regarding revenue growth, operating
margins, tax rates, appropriate discount rates and
working capital requirements. These estimates will
likely differ from future actual results of operations and
cash flows, and it is possible that these differences
could be material. In addition, judgments are applied
in determining the level of cash-generating unit we
identify for impairment testing and the criteria we use
to determine which assets should be aggregated.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the
consideration received or receivable and comprises
the gross amounts billed to clients in respect of fees
earned, expenses recharged and commission-based
income. Revenue is recognised in the income
statement when the economic benefits arising from an
arrangement are probable.
Operating income is revenue less amounts payable on
behalf of clients to external suppliers where they are
retained to perform part of a specific client project 
or service, and represents fees, commissions and
mark-ups on rechargeable expenses and marketing
products.
Contractual arrangements are reviewed to ascertain
whether the group acts as principal or agent with
regards to third party costs. If the relationship is that of
agent then the recharge of third party costs is not
recognised through revenue or cost of sales.
Revenue and operating income are stated exclusive of
VAT, sales taxes and trade discounts.
Public Relations
Revenue is typically derived from retainer fees and
services performed subject to specific agreement.
Revenue is recognised when the service is performed
in accordance with the contractual arrangement.
Revenue is recognised on long-term contracts
through an assessment of the time incurred to date
compared to the total hours required to complete the
contract, and an assessment of the value delivered to
the client compared to the total value of the contract.
If the outcome of these can be assessed with
reasonable certainty, revenue and related costs are
recognised in the income statement.
Advertising and Marketing Services, Sports Marketing
and Research
Apart from where it is derived from retainer contracts
(as above), operating income is recognised on each
contract in proportion to the level of services
performed. Costs relating to contracts in progress at
the balance sheet date are carried forward in work in
progress. Losses are recognised as soon as they 
are foreseen.
The Group receives volume rebates from certain
suppliers for transactions entered into on behalf of
clients. Based on the terms of the relevant contracts
and local law these are either remitted to clients or
retained by the Group. If amounts are passed on to Annual Report and Accounts 2010 55
clients they are recorded as liabilities until settled or, 
if retained by the Group, are recorded as revenue
when earned.
Leasing
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the
terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks
and rewards of ownership to the lessee. All other
leases are classified as operating leases. Assets held
under finance leases and the related lease obligations
are recorded in the balance sheet at the fair value of
the leased assets at the inception of the leases or, if
lower, the present value of minimum lease payments.
The excess of the lease payments over the recorded
lease obligations is treated as finance charges which
are amortised over each lease term to give a constant
rate of charge on the remaining balance of the obligation.
Rental costs under operating leases are charged to
the income statement in equal annual amounts over
the periods of the leases.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to
enter into an operating lease are also spread on a
straight-line basis over the lease term.
Foreign Currencies 
Transactions in UK companies denominated in
currencies other than pounds sterling are recorded at
the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the
transactions. At each balance sheet date, monetary
assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign
currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on
the balance sheet date. Gains and losses arising on
retranslation are included in net profit or loss for the
period. Non-monetary items that are measured in
terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are 
not retranslated.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the
Group’s overseas operations are translated at the
exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expenses are translated at the average
exchange rates for the period unless exchange rates
fluctuate significantly. Exchange differences arising, if
any, are classified as equity and transferred to the
Group’s translation reserve. Such translation reserve
differences are recognised as income or as expenses
in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Translation differences on non-monetary financial
assets and liabilities are reported as part of the fair
value gain or loss. Translation differences on non-
monetary financial assets, such as investments in
equity securities classified as available for sale, are
included in the fair value reserve in equity.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the
acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and
liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the
closing rate. 
Finance Costs
Finance costs, which include interest and bank
charges, are recognised in the income statement in
the year in which they are incurred.
Operating Profit
Operating profit is stated before the share of results of
associate, investment income and finance costs. 
Retirement Benefit Costs 
The pension cost is the amount of contributions
payable by the Group to the defined contribution
pension scheme and to personal pension schemes of
certain employees during the accounting period.
These are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax
currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit 
for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as
reported in the income statement because it excludes
items of income or expense that are taxable or
deductible in other years and it further excludes items
that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s
liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that
have been enacted or substantively enacted by the
balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or
recoverable on differences between the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial
statements and the corresponding tax bases used in
the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted 
for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred
tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable
temporary differences and deferred tax assets are
recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable
profits will be available against which deductible
temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets
and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary
difference arises from goodwill or from the initial
recognition (other than in a business combination) of
other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects
neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable
temporary differences arising on investments in
subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint
ventures, except where the Group is able to control
the reversal of the temporary difference and it is
probable that the temporary difference will not reverse
in the foreseeable future. 56 Chime Communications plc
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
Year ended 31 December 2010
Taxation (continued)
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is
reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to
the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient
taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of
the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are
expected to apply in the period when the liability is
settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax is charged
or credited in the income statement, except when it
relates to items charged or credited directly to equity,
in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in
equity.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost net
of depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is provided in equal instalments to write
off the cost less residual value over the estimated
useful economic lives of asset type as follows:
Short-term leasehold improvements 5 years
Motor vehicles 6 years
Fixtures, fittings and equipment 4 years
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over
their expected useful lives on the same basis as
owned assets or, where shorter, the term of the
relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal of an asset is
determined as the difference between the sales
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is
recognised in the income statement.
Other Intangible Assets
Other intangible assets comprise acquired customer
relationships and contracts, brands and computer
software. Customer relationships and corporate brand
names acquired as part of acquisitions of business are
capitalised separately from goodwill as an intangible 
if their value can be measured reliably on initial
recognition and it is probable that the expected future
economic benefit that are attributable to the asset will
flow to the Group. Corporate brands are considered
to have indefinite economic life and are therefore
tested annually for impairment. Computer software is
capitalised based on the cost incurred to acquire and
bring to use the specific software. Intangible assets
are stated at cost net of amortisation and any
provision for impairment. The costs are amortised over
their estimated useful lives using the following rates:
Computer software 4 years
Customer relationships 4 – 8 years
Brand names Indefinite life
Impairment of Property, Plant and Equipment and
Intangible Assets Excluding Goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the
carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets
to determine whether there is any indication that those
assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such
indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset
is estimated in order to determine the extent of the
impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not
generate cash flows that are independent from other
assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount
of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is
tested for impairment annually or whenever there is an
indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less
costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in
use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to
their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that
reflects current market assessments of the time value
of money and the risks specific to the asset for which
estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-
generating unit) is estimated to be less than its
carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset
(cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable
amount. An impairment loss is immediately recognised
as an expense in the income statement.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the
carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is
increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable
amount, but so that the increased carrying amount
does not exceed the carrying amount that would 
have been determined had no impairment loss been
recognised for the asset (cash-generating unit) in 
prior years.
Work in Progress
Work in progress is stated at the lower of invoiced
cost and net realisable value, net of payments
received on account. Cost represents work supplied
from outside the Group awaiting billing to clients at 
the year-end and directly attributable overhead costs.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a
present obligation as a result of a past event and it is
probable that the Group will be required to settle that
obligation, and are discounted to present value where
the effect is material.
Financial Instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised
on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group
becomes a party to the contractual provisions of 
the instrument. Annual Report and Accounts 2010 57
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash comprises cash, overdrafts and cash held on
short-term deposit (up to three months). Cash
equivalents are cash deposits held on three months
deposit at the Royal Bank of Scotland plc. The
deposits guarantee the loan note creditors. Interest
accruing on the deposits are payable to the holders 
of the loan notes less any costs arising.
Trade Receivables
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are
stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate
allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts. 
Investments
Investments are recognised and derecognised on a
trade date where a purchase or sale of an investment
is under contract whose terms require the delivery of
the investment within the timeframe established by the
market concerned, and are initially measured at cost,
including transaction costs. Investments are classified
either as available for sale, and are measured at
subsequent reporting dates at fair value, or at amortised
cost, where no fair value is readily determinable. Gains
and losses on available for sale financial assets arising
from changes in fair value are recognised directly in
equity, until the security is disposed of or is determined
to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or
loss previously recognised in equity is included in the
net profit or loss for the period.
Bank Borrowings
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are
recorded at the fair value of proceeds received, net of
direct issue costs.
Trade Payables
Trade payables are not interest-bearing and are stated
at their nominal value.
Equity Instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are
recorded at the fair value of proceeds received, net of
direct issue costs.
Put Options over Equity
Put options over equity are held on the balance sheet
at fair value, with movements in fair value being taken
to the income statement.
Share-Based Payments
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2
Share-based Payments. IFRS 2 has been applied to
all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002
that were invested as of 1 January 2005.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based
payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-
based payments are measured at fair value at the date
of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of
the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed
on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based
on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually
vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market based
vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured for all schemes with market-
based conditions by use of the Monte Carlo model.
For all other schemes, fair value is measured by use of
the Black-Scholes model. The expected life used in
the model has been adjusted, based on
management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-
transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural
considerations.
A liability equal to the portion of the goods or services
received is recognised at the current fair value
determined at each balance sheet date for cash-
settled share-based payments.
The Group also provides employees with the ability to
purchase the Group’s ordinary shares at 80% of the
current market value. The Group records an expense,
based on its estimate of the 20% discount related to
shares expected to vest on a straight-line basis over
the vesting period. Further details are included in note
38 to the accounts.

10. Deferred Tax
Losses of £0.7 million in the UK (2009: £0.8 million) and $6.5 million in the US (2009: $5.4 million) have not been
recognised in deferred taxation due to insufficient certainty that there will be appropriate profits available in the
future to utilise them.
Finance (No 2) Act 2010 was substantively enacted on 27 July 2010 and included legislation to reduce the main
rate of corporation tax from 28% to 27% from 1 April 2011. Further reductions to the main rate are proposed to
reduce the rate by 1% per annum to 24% by 1 April 2014 and are expected to be enacted separately each year.

12. Earnings per Share (continued)
Diluted earnings per share is calculated on the profit for the year attributable to parent company shareholders
divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year adjusted for the
potentially dilutive impact of employee share incentive schemes and shares to be issued as part of deferred or
contingent consideration on acquisitions of subsidiaries.
Some share options that had a higher purchase price than the average market price of the shares for the year
ended 31 December 2010 were outstanding. These options have been excluded from the calculation of diluted
earnings per share as they would have been antidilutive.
Headline earnings per share has been presented to allow shareholders a further understanding of the trading
performance of the Company. The denominators used are the same as those detailed above for both basic and
diluted earnings per share.

The impairment of goodwill of £1,500,000 relates to goodwill arising on a previous acquisition which is
undergoing a strategic restructuring following deterioration in the results of the business. The impairment arises 
in the Public Relations division.
An additional impairment of £183,000 was recognised in relation to Branded Moments of Truth, which ceased to
be a subsidiary during the year.
The cumulative impairment against goodwill is £1,683,000.
The adjustment arising on prior year acquisitions relates to the reassessment of contingent consideration arising
on previous acquisitions.
The fair value adjustments in respect of prior year acquisitions arise as follows. These adjustments give rise to 
a corresponding increase in goodwill which has been recorded as a prior year adjustment in accordance with
IFRS 3. There is no impact on the prior year income statement as a result of this restatement. 70 Chime Communications plc

In accordance with the Group’s accounting policy, the carrying values of goodwill and other intangible assets are
reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset
might be impaired. The 2010 impairment review was undertaken as at 31 December 2010. The review assessed
whether the carrying value of goodwill was supported by the net present value of future cash flows derived from
assets using a projection period of up to five years for each cash-generating unit.  The basis for this is the 2011
budget with growth rates of between 2% and 10%. The 2011 budgets are based on management’s best
estimates taking into account prior period results and industry knowledge. After the projection period, steady
growth has been assumed at rates not exceeding long-term average growth rates for the industry for each cash-
generating unit, with no improvements in operating margin being assumed.  An annual growth rate of 2.0%
(2009: 2.0%) and a pre-tax discount rate of 11% (2009: 12.5%) have been assumed.
The Board has considered reasonable possible sensitivities. No impairment would be recognised if discount 
rates were increased by 1% and operating income reduced by 10% in each period. Annual Report and Accounts 2010 71
14. Acquisition of Subsidiaries
Tree (London) Limited
On 9 March 2010, the Group completed the acquisition of 100% of the share capital of Tree (London) Limited, 
a research and data analytics company. Also acquired was A Good Listener Limited, a fellow subsidiary of the
same group which no longer trades. The consideration given for the acquisition was £2,000,000, subject to 
a working capital adjustment resulting in additional consideration of £8,000. The acquisition of Tree will provide
additional opportunities for growth. 
The goodwill calculation for the acquisition is as follows.

The adjustment to intangible assets arises from the write-off of goodwill held by Tree (London) Limited
(£2,000,000) offset by the recognition of an intangible asset relating to a customer contract (£406,000). 
This resulted in the recognition of a deferred tax liability (£114,000).
The adjustment to trade and other payables relates to a payment made in respect of tax losses not recognised 
by the company surrendered to former group companies. An additional adjustment of £3,000 relates to 
deferred tax not previously recognised by the company.
Costs amounting to £103,000 have been recognised as an expense during the year and are included in costs 
of acquisitions.
Goodwill represents the assembled workforce and specialist skills held by Tree (London) Limited.
Tree (London) Limited contributed revenue of £948,000 and operating profit of £131,000 to the results of 
the Group since acquisition. If the acquisition had been completed at the beginning of the year, Management
estimate that Group revenue for the year would have been £311.8m and Group operating profit would 
have been £22.8m. 72 Chime Communications plc

14. Acquisition of Subsidiaries (continued)
Other Acquisitions
PMPLegacy Limited
On 10 July 2010 the Group acquired PMPLegacy Limited for total consideration of £100,000. The acquisition
develops the major event bidding and planning expertise of the Group. There were no identifiable net assets
acquired with the company and this has therefore given rise to goodwill of £100,000 during the year. Costs of
£7,000 were incurred in respect of the acquisition, and these have been included in costs of acquisitions.
Goodwill represents the specialist workforce and pipeline of opportunities.
acefieldwork
On 24 September 2010 the Group acquired the business of acefieldwork for a total consideration of £1. 
Costs of £20,000 relating to the acquisition have been included in costs of acquisitions.
Cash flow on acquisitions
Other deferred consideration of £3,393,000 (2009: £222,000) was settled in cash during the year in respect of
acquisitions made in previous years.

20. Trade and Other Receivables (continued)
The average credit period at year end is 54 days (2009: 50 days). The Group’s trade receivables are stated after
allowances for bad and doubtful debts. This allowance has been determined by considering specific doubtful
balances and by reference to past default experience, an analysis of which is as follows.

The provision for irrecoverable trade receivables relates to debts that are past due and impaired.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value. Trade
and other receivables are predominantly non-interest bearing. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade
receivables are limited due to the Group’s customer base being large, unrelated and largely billed in advance. Due
to this, the Directors believe there is no further credit risk provision required in excess of the allowance for bad
and doubtful debts.
21. Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and equivalents include £58,000 (2009: £58,000) of cash held as security for cash backed loan notes.
These are held at Royal Bank of Scotland and are redeemable on demand by the loan note holders.

The average credit period taken for trade purchases at year end is 41 days (2009: 40 days). The Directors
consider that the carrying amount of trade payables approximates to their fair value. The Group has financial risk
management policies in place to ensure that all payables are paid within the credit time frame.
The loan notes are guaranteed against the loan note deposits of the same amount included within cash and 
cash equivalents. Loan notes totalling £58,000 are outstanding as part of the initial and contingent consideration
on the acquisition of HHCL Group Limited and VCCP Limited. The loan notes are guaranteed by Royal Bank of
Scotland plc, unless otherwise stated, who hold a deposit of £58,000 against them. 78 Chime Communications plc

Cash deposits and bank loans are held at either variable rates of interest or at rates fixed for periods of no 
longer than three months.
The principal features of the Group’s borrowings with the Royal Bank of Scotland are as follows:
(i) The Group has a rolling overdraft facility of £2 million. The overdraft facility is repayable on demand.
(ii) The Group has a committed facility. The facility is £30 million. The term of the facility is until 30 June 2013.
(iii) The bank loan bears interest at 1.3% above LIBOR; the overdraft bears interest at 2% above base rate.
(iv) A cross-guarantee exists between the majority of wholly-owned subsidiaries and the parent company. Royal
Bank of Scotland plc holds debentures over the assets of the Company and the subsidiaries in respect of 
the bank loans.
(v) The weighted average interest rate applied in the year is 1.89% (2009: 1.89%).
During 2010 the committed facility of £400,000 with HSBC was repaid in full.
At 31 December 2010 the Group had drawn down £3.3 million of the borrowing facility and had available 
£26.7 million (2009: £30 million) of undrawn committed borrowing facilities in respect of which all conditions
precedent had been met. The Group had not utilised the overdraft facility at year end.
The fair values of bank overdrafts and loans are determined by considering the maturity dates. Annual Report and Accounts 2010 79

Deferred/Contingent Consideration
Contingent consideration relates to acquisitions made in current and previous years. The amounts payable are
dependent on the future profits of the companies acquired. Further details of the deferred considerations arising
from current year acquisitions are shown in note 30. Timing of payments of deferred consideration is set out in
the relevant Sale and Purchase Agreements.
At 31 December 2010 approximately £6,862,000 (2009: £8,596,000) of the deferred consideration is expected 
to be settled in cash and £5,002,000 (2009: £8,596,000) in shares. The number of shares to be issued in all
instances is based on the market value prior to the issue of the shares. Chime retains the right to satisfy a higher
proportion in cash.
Gross Obligation under Put Option
The Gross obligation under put option has arisen as a result of a shareholders’ agreement with a non-controlling
interest. The value of the option has been estimated with regards to future profitability of the operation based on
multiples of earnings. 80 Chime Communications plc

25. Provisions (continued)
Vacant Property
The vacant property provision remaining at 31 December 2010 relates to four buildings, one near Heathrow, two
in Central London and one in Boston, USA. The provisions are an estimate of the difference between anticipated
future income and costs relating to the properties.
The Heathrow building is approximately 12,000 sq ft and the Group has a lease which runs to September 2016.
The current rental cost is £350,000 per annum with an upward only rent review due in September 2015. The
Group has sublet 7,000 sq ft, the remaining 5,000 sq ft is occupied by Group companies. The rental income
achieved on the sub-let space is lower than the rent currently being paid under the lease.
One of the Central London buildings has a lease that expires in September 2011. The space is currently being
utilised but the Group has signed an agreement for a new building commencing in March 2011. Provision has
been made for costs in respect of the old lease after the commencement of the new lease. As this relates to the
integration of recently acquired companies, the cost relating to the provision of £409,000 has been included in
costs of acquisitions.
The other Central London building has a lease that expired in June 2010, acquired on the acquisition of Pelham
Public Relations. Provision has been made for costs relating to the exit of the building.
The Boston, USA building is approximately 3,900 sq ft and the Group has a lease which runs to November 2013.
The lease can be terminated in August 2011. The current rental cost is $141,000 per annum with upward only
rental reviews. The Group has sub-let the space, however the rental income achieved on the sub-let space is
lower than the rent currently being paid under the lease.

The Company has one class of ordinary shares which carry no right to fixed income.
The acquisition of Tree (London) Limited, together with that of Pelham Public Relations Limited (agreed on 
21 December 2009) was financed by the placing of 2,250,000 shares for £4,500,000 by way of a vendor 
placing of £1,800,000 and a cash placing of £2,700,000 million fully underwritten by Numis Securities Limited, 
as announced on 15 January 2010. This gave rise to additional share capital of £562,000 and share premium 
of £3,938,000. The costs relating to the placing amounted to £136,000 and have been recorded in equity.
156,395 shares with a fair value of £320,000 were issued on 19 February 2010 in relation to the acquisition 
of Essentially Group Limited.
99,994 shares with a fair value of £200,000 were issued on 20 January 2010 in relation to the acquisition of
Pelham Public Relations Limited. Annual Report and Accounts 2010 81
26. Share Capital (continued)
3,519,578 shares with a fair value of £7,172,000 were issued on 23 March 2010 to satisfy deferred contingent
consideration relating to the acquisition of Fast Track.
162,795 shares were issued to staff in relation to share schemes at prices between £0.675 and £1.975.
The Companies Act 2006 abolished the requirement for a company to have an authorised share capital and 
the Articles of Association were amended in May 2010 to reflect this.
27. Share Premium and Other Reserves
Share Premium
Share premium arises from capital raised in an issue of shares, net of costs, to the extent that exceeds the
nominal value of the shares.
Own Shares
The own shares reserve represents the cost of shares in Chime Communications Plc purchased in the market
and held by the Chime Communications Employee Trust to satisfy options under the Group’s share options
schemes, deferred shares and Co-Investment plans (see note 32).
The Chime Communications Employee Trust (‘The Trust’) was established in 1997 in Jersey. The trustee is
Computershare Plan Managers Ltd. The beneficiaries of the Trust are employees and former employees of 
the Company and the Group (including any Director) and the spouses and children or stepchildren of such
employees or former employees. The purpose of the Trust is to facilitate and encourage the ownership of shares
by employees. Distributions from the Trust are agreed by the trustee on recommendations from the Board of
Directors of Chime Communications plc.
The Trust currently holds 1,692,828 (2009: 2,213,000) ordinary shares which have a nominal value of £648,000
(2009: £528,000) and over which options were granted in April 2003, deferred shares in May 2008, October
2008, June 2009, December 2009, June 2010 and December 2010 and Co Investment Plan shares in May 2010. 
1,654,000 (2009: 861,000) shares were purchased in 2010 at a nominal value of £414,000, representing 2.25%
(2009: 1.28%) of the called up share capital at 31 December. Cost associated with these shares amounted to
£nil (2009: £6,000). All costs of the Trust are borne by Chime Communications plc and expensed through the
income statement.
The Trust has opted to waive all dividends with the exception of those shares allocated under the deferred share
scheme (see note 32). The market value of the shares in the Trust at 31 December 2010 was £3,809,000 
(2009: £4,809,000).
Capital Reduction Reserve
The Capital reduction reserve relates to the capital reduction undertaken in October 2003. The reserve will not
be treated as realised profits of the Company until any debt or claim outstanding as at 1 July 2013 has been
repaid or remedied. If on 1 July 2013 there remain only liabilities outstanding in relation to property leases, the
amount outstanding to the reserve may be released and the undertaking discharged or replaced by new share
issues.
Translation Reserve
The translation reserve relates to exchange differences arising on consolidation of overseas operations. 82 Chime Communications plc

29. Disposals
The Group previously held 80% of the share capital of Branded Moments of Truth Limited. On 23 December
2010 the Group disposed of 50% of the share capital, leaving it with a 40% stake. As a result, the company
ceased to be a subsidiary and is treated as an investment in associate from that date. The loss recognised 
on disposal is £56,000.
In addition, on 13 August 2010 the Group disposed of its shareholding in Ledbury Research Limited for
proceeds of £94,800. This gave rise to a profit on disposal of £20,000.
The profit and loss on disposal has been included in operating profit for the year. Annual Report and Accounts 2010 83
30. Contingent Liabilities and Commitments
In addition to the potential deferred and contingent
consideration as disclosed in note 25 of £11,864,000
at 31 December 2010 there was a maximum financial
commitment of £13,287,000 (2009: £18,826,000) in
respect of unprovided deferred contingent
consideration payable in respect of acquisitions of
subsidiary undertakings. This relates to the acquisition
of Fast Track Sales Limited (£10,301,000), The
Corporate Citizenship Company Limited (£426,000)
and Stuart Higgins Communications Limited
(£460,000) in 2007, and Bankbrae Holdings Limited
(£2,100,000) in 2008.
Fast Track Sales Limited
The maximum contingent consideration payable is
£20,133,000. However provision has only been made
of £9,833,000 in the accounts to date (before
discounting). The contingent consideration is based
on a multiple of seven times earnings before interest
and tax for the average of the three years 2010 to
2012 inclusive. The contingent consideration would be
satisfied by the issue of new shares until the amount
of total consideration paid has been satisfied 50% in
cash and 50% in new shares. Chime has the right to
pay a higher percentage in cash if it so wishes.
The Corporate Citizenship Company Limited
The maximum contingent consideration payable is
£2,299,000. However provision has only been made
for £1,873,000 in the accounts to date (before
discounting). The contingent consideration is based
on a multiple of 4.75 times the average earnings of the
two years 2010 to 2011 inclusive. The contingent
consideration would be satisfied entirely in loan notes
or cash.
Stuart Higgins Communications Limited 
The maximum contingent consideration payable is
£1,750,000. However provision has only been made
for £1,290,000 in the accounts to date (before
discounting). The contingent consideration is based
on a multiple of 4.5 times the average earnings before
interest and tax for the three years 2008 to 2010
inclusive and so the final amount has crystallised at 31
December 2010. The contingent consideration is
payable 50% in cash and 50% by the issue of new
shares. Chime has the right to pay a higher
percentage in cash if it so wishes.
Bankbrae Holdings Limited
The maximum contingent consideration payable is
£2,205,000. However provision has only been made
for £105,000 in the accounts to date (before
discounting). The contingent consideration is based
on a multiple of 4.5 times the average profits for the
two years 2010 to 2011 inclusive. The contingent
consideration would be satisfied 50% in cash and
50% by the issue of new shares. Chime has the right
to pay a higher percentage in cash if it so wishes. 84 Chime Communications plc

32. Share-Based Payments
The Group operates various share plans relating to shares in the parent company including an executive share
option scheme, an employee savings related share option scheme (SAYE), a deferred share scheme, the VCCP
Partners Scheme and a Co-Investment Plan.
The Group recognised total expenses in 2010 of £1,170,000 (2009: £1,448,000) related to equity-settled share-
based payment transactions.
Share Options (Executive Options and SAYE)
The exercise price of the options granted under the executive share option scheme is equal to the market value
of the Group’s shares at the time when the options are granted. The vesting period is generally three years but 
if they are special options it is five years. If the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the 
date of grant, the options expire. Furthermore, options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the
options vest. All executive options granted from November 1997 (other than special executive options) are
subject to performance criteria as set out in the report to the shareholders on Directors’ remuneration.
The exercise price of the options granted under the employee savings related scheme is 80% of the market value
at the date of offer. The vesting period is five years, if the options remain unexercised six months after this date,
the options expire. Furthermore, the options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest. Annual Report and Accounts 2010 85

Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over the
previous two years. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best
estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
In addition, during the year, options over up to 36,000 shares in Pelham Bell Pottinger Limited, a subsidiary
company, were granted giving rise to a charge of £8,000. The options vest over four years. Upon vesting 18,000
shares will be satisfied from the holding of Chime Communications plc, representing 2% of the issued share
capital, and will have an exercise price of £2.50. The remaining shares will be satisfied from the holding of the
non-controlling shareholder and will have an exercise price of £0.10, and will be issued in such a number in order
to provide a maximum gain to the option holders of £86,000. 86 Chime Communications plc

32. Share-Based Payments (continued)
Co-Investment Plan 2006
The matching shares awarded under the 2006 Co-Investment Plan were awarded to employees at nil cost. The
matching shares awarded were subject to performance criteria as set out in the report to the shareholders on
Directors’ remuneration. The vesting period ended during 2010 and assessment against the performance
conditions led to the vesting of 74.8% of the award. The fair value of the matching shares allocated to the market
based performance criteria was previously calculated using the Monte Carlo model.
The fair value of the matching shares allocated to the non market based performance criteria was made with
reference to the share price at the date of award discounted for expected dividends.

34. Financial Instruments
The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise bank loans, bank overdrafts, finance leases, cash and
short-term deposits. The main purpose of the financial instruments is to provide finance for the Group’s
operations. The Group has various other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade
payables, which arise directly from operations. During the year the Group has financed its business through an
overdraft facility and revolving committed facility arranged with the Royal Bank of Scotland plc.
The Group uses financial instruments to manage its bank borrowings: this is done by the use of foreign
exchange rate swaps. The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for financial trading
purposes but derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for as trading instruments. Derivative
financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value at the contract date and continue to be stated at fair
value at the balance sheet date with gains and losses on revaluation being recognised immediately to the
income statement. 
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign
currency risk. The policy for managing these risks is reviewed and agreed with the Board.
Interest Rate Risk
The Group holds variable rate financial debt. Fixed interest rates are for periods of up to three months at a time.
The interest rate margins paid by the Group on financial debt are disclosed in note 24. The Group assesses its
borrowing requirements monitors and interest rates and assess the risks through sensitivity analysis.
If interest rates had been 1% higher/lower during the year the impact to profit before tax would have been an
increase/decrease of £113,000 (2009: increase/decrease of £57,000). The impact on shareholders’ equity
would have been a decrease/increase of £82,000 (2009: decrease/increase of £41,000).
Liquidity Risk
The Group has an agreed committed facility of £30 million with the Royal Bank of Scotland. The facility matures
in June 2013. There is also an uncommitted facility available of £2 million, which is reviewed on a rolling basis.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves and banking facilities and by continuously
monitoring forecast and actual cash flows. At 31 December 2010 the Group had net cash of £6,880,000, which
is after deducting an amount drawn down against the facility of £3,300,000. The undrawn committed facility was
therefore £26,700,000.
All other financial liabilities are considered current except the financial liability relating to the put option.
Externally Imposed Capital Requirement
Under the terms of the Group’s banking covenants the Group must meet certain criteria based on interest and
dividend cover and net debt to EBITDA. There have been no breaches of the banking covenants in the current
or prior year.
Foreign Currency Risk
The Group has 24 overseas operations (branches and subsidiaries) which trade in Europe, the USA, the Far East,
the Middle East, Australasia and Africa. The sterling value of the net monetary assets held in the principal foreign
currencies held by the group are as follows:
                                                                                                                                                                   2010                     2009

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
Year ended 31 December 2010
34. Financial Instruments (continued)
The Group does on occasion agree to bill clients in a currency other than the local currency; it also makes some
purchases overseas where the supplier bills in their local currency. The Group does not hedge the translation
exposure on the fees due. The Group converts any fees received in foreign currency on receipt on funds. In some
instances where it is viewed appropriate, the proceeds from the client are kept in currency so as to minimise the
foreign exchange exposure on the transaction if there are third party costs to be paid out of the funds in that
currency. In this instance the Group uses short-term foreign exchange swaps to manage the Group’s borrowings.
The fair value of the swaps entered into at 31 December 2010 is estimated as a liability of £8,000 (2009: £6,000).
There were two swaps open over the year end. This amount is based on the market values of equivalent
instruments at the balance sheet date.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to reasonably possible changes in the US Dollar and Euro
exchange rates, with all other variables held constant, of the group’s equity:

Market Price Risk
The Group’s exposure to market price risk comprises interest rate risk and currency rate risk. The Group
regularly monitors these exposures which, setting aside the interrelationships between such rates and their
wider impact on the economy, are not considered to have a significant impact on the Group.

The Group trades only with recognised, creditworthy third parties. Customers who wish to trade on credit terms
are generally subject to credit verification procedures. In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an
ongoing basis with the result that the Group’s exposure to bad debts has not been significant.
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the Group’s customer base 
being large and unrelated.
With respect to credit risk arising from other financial assets of the Group, which comprises cash and cash
equivalents, the Group’s exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty, with a maximum amount
of exposure equal to the carrying amount of these instruments.
Gross obligations under put options: The Gross obligation under put option has arisen as a result of a
shareholders’ agreement with a non-controlling interest. The fair value of the option is a level 3 fair value
measurement, and has been estimated with regards to future profitability of the operation based on multiples of
earnings. If growth rates used are sensitised by +/-10% the impact on the Group’s profit before tax would be a
decrease of £153,000 / increase of £156,000 (2009: decrease if £159,000 / increase of £235,000).
There were no transfers between fair value levels during 2010 or 2009.

amounts and disclosures in the financial statements
sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the
financial statements are free from material
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This
includes an assessment of: whether the accounting
policies are appropriate to the parent company’s
circumstances and have been consistently applied
and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness 
of significant accounting estimates made by the
directors; and the overall presentation of the 
financial statements.

statements:
� give a true and fair view of the state of the
company’s affairs as at 31 December 2010;
� have been properly prepared in accordance with
United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice; and
� have been prepared in accordance with the
requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on Other Matters Prescribed by the
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
� the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
to be audited has been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
� the information given in the Directors’ Report for the
financial year for which the financial statements are
prepared is consistent with the parent company
financial statements.
Matters on Which We are Required to Report 
by Exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following
matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to

Notes to the Company Financial Statements
Year ended 31 December 2010
1. Accounting Policies
Basis of Preparation
The separate financial statements of the Company are
drawn up in accordance with the Companies Act
2006 and United Kingdom generally accepted
accounting principles (‘UK GAAP’). The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenue and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions
are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to
accounting estimates are recognised in the period in
which the estimate is revised if the revision affects 
only that period or in the period of the revision and
future periods if the revision affects both current and
future periods.
The particular accounting policies adopted are
described below. They have all been applied
consistently throughout the year and the prior year. 
The financial statements are prepared on a going
concern basis as explained in the Directors’ Report.
Cash Flow
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption
contained in FRS 1 ‘Cash flow statements’ and has
not produced a cash flow statement.
Financial Instruments
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption
contained in FRS 29 ‘Financial Instruments:
Disclosures’ and has not produced any disclosures
required by that standard, as full disclosures are
available in Chime Communications Plc Annual Report
for the year ended 31 December 2010.
Related Parties
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption
contained in FRS 8 ‘Related party disclosures’ and
has not reported transactions with fellow Group
undertakings.
Accounting Convention
The financial statements are prepared under the
historical cost convention.
Investments
In the Company’s accounts, investments in subsidiary
and associate undertakings are stated at cost less
provision for any impairment in value.
Deferred Consideration
When earnouts are to be settled in cash or shares
with a fixed monetary value, the fair value of the
consideration is obtained by discounting to present
value the amounts expected to be payable in the
future. The resulting interest charge is included within
finance costs of deferred consideration.
Financial Instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities, in respect of
financial instruments, are recognised on the balance
sheet when the Company becomes a party to the
contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial Liabilities and Equity Instruments
Financial liabilities and equity instruments issued by
the Company are classified according to the
substance of the contractual arrangements entered
into and the definitions of a financial liability and an
equity instrument. An equity instrument is any contract
that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the
Company after deducting all of its liabilities and
includes no obligation to deliver cash or other financial
assets. Equity instruments issued by the Company 
are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct
issue costs.
Share-Based Payments
The Group operates a number of equity settled share
based compensation plans for the employees of
subsidiary undertakings, using the Company’s equity
instruments. The fair value of the compensation given
in respect of these share-based compensation plans
is recognised as a capital contribution to the
Company’s subsidiary undertakings, over the vesting
period. The capital contribution is reduced by any
payments received from subsidiary undertakings in
respect of these share-based payments. 
Dividends Paid or Received
Dividends paid and received are included in the
financial statements in the period in which the related
dividends are actually paid or received or, in respect of
the Company’s final dividend for the year, approved by
shareholders.
Going Concern
The Group’s business activities, which include these
of the Company, together with the factors likely to
affect its future development, performance and
position are set out in The Chairman’s Statement 
on pages 2 to 5. The financial position of the Group,
its cash flows and borrowing facilities are described 
in the Finance Director’s Report on pages 12 to 13. 
In addition, note 34 of the consolidated financial
statements include the Group’s objectives, policies
and processes for managing its capital; its financial
risk management objectives and details of its financial
instruments; and its exposure to credit risk and
liquidity risk. 96 Chime Communications plc
As highlighted in note 34 to the consolidated financial
statements, the Group meets its day to day working
capital requirements through an uncommitted
overdraft facility and a committed facility which
matures in June 2013. These facilities are subject to
banking covenants as disclosed in note 34 to the
consolidated financial statements.
In preparing forecasts the directors have taken into
account the following key factors:
� The rate of growth of the UK and global economy
on the Group’s business during the economic
recovery;
� Key client account renewals;
� The level of committed and variable costs; and
� Current new business targets compared to levels
achieved in previous years.
The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking 
account of reasonably possible changes in trading
performance, show that the Group should be able to
operate within the level of its current facility and
banking covenants. 
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the
Company and the Group have adequate resources to
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable
future. Thus they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual
financial statements.
More detail on the Group’s cash position and facilities
at 31 December 2010, as well as maturities of the
financial liabilities, can be found in note 34 to the
consolidated financial statements. The principal risks
and uncertainties faced by the Group are included in
the Directors Report. Details of potential contingent
liabilities and potential cash outflows in relation 
to these liabilities can be found in note 30 to the
consolidated financial statements. 
Profit of Parent Company
As permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act
2006, the income statement of the parent company is
not presented as part of these accounts. The parent
company’s profit for the financial year amounted to
£14,491,000 (2009: £9,982,000).

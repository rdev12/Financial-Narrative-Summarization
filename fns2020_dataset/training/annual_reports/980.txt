During the period under review Anglo Asian 
made excellent progress as a significant 
gold/copper/silver producer in Caucasia. 
With a solid production profile and low 
operating costs at our flagship Gedabek 
gold/copper/silver mine (‘Gedabek’) located 
in western Azerbaijan, as well as favourable 
commodity prices, we have enjoyed a period 
of increasing profitability for the year to 
3104December 2011 (‘FY 2011’). To this end, 
I am delighted to report that the Company 
recorded a 60% increase in profit before tax 
of US$31.6 million (2010: US$19.8 million) 
and a 37% increase in gross profit of 
US$43.0 million (2010: US$31.4 million). 
In addition, in line with our strategy to build 
a multiple gold mine company and unlock 
our intrinsic value, we have implemented 
defined exploration and development 
programmes across our 1,962 sq km 
portfolio of prospective copper and gold 
assets in Azerbaijan. At Gedabek, we 
accomplished a milestone post-period end, 
announcing a 50% upgrade in our JORC 
resource to over 1 million ounces of gold in 
the Measured and Indicated classifications; 
at our 300 sq km Gosha Contract located 50 
km away from Gedabek, we announced that 
the Government of Azerbaijan had approved 
a development and production programme 
and we are now continuing with exploration 
with a view to establishing our second 
mining project in Azerbaijan; and at our 
Ordubad Contract Area we announced 
a Notice of Discovery in April 2012. 
In terms of gold and silver production from 
Gedabek’s open pit, heap leach operation in 
FY 2011, the mine produced 57,068 ounces 
of gold at an average cash operating cost of 
US$448 per ounce. This positions Gedabek 
as a low cost producer. Additionally, the 
Company produced 39,086 ounces of silver. 
During the year we sold 49,304 ounces of 
gold at an average price of US$1,573 per 
ounce and 34,593 ounces of silver at an 
average price of US$35 per ounce. The 
difference between gold sold and gold 
produced is for two reasons. Firstly, the 
Government of Azerbaijan takes title to 
12.75% of all produced metals and secondly, 
there is usually a timing difference between 
gold production and gold sales.
We also enjoyed strong copper production 
at Gedabek from our Sulphidisation, 
Acidification, Recycling and Thickening 
(‘SART’) plant. In FY 2011 we exceeded our 
target of 525 tonnes of copper and produced 
611 tonnes of copper, 134,240 ounces silver 
and 200 ounces of gold. Total sales of copper 
concentrate of US$5.0 million were recorded 
in FY 2011 (2010: US$ nil). The Company’s 
copper concentrate stockpiles currently total 
743 tonnes copper, 200 ounces gold and 
162,000 ounces of silver. Anglo Asian is in 
detailed discussions with various parties 
regarding finding a long-term sales partner 
and will update on this progress in due course. 
Production was restricted to 9,925 ounces 
of gold post period end for Q1 2012, due to 
an unusually harsh winter. However, we still 
expect that the reduced level of production 
for Q1 2012 will be compensated for during 
the course of the year and that our internal 
target of 54,000 ounces of gold for 2012 will 
be achieved. Silver production from our heap 
leach operation remained on track totalling 
7,670 ounces for the quarter. Copper, silver 
and gold production from our SART operations 
totalled 148 tonnes of copper concentrate, 
34,666 ounces of silver and 27 ounces 
of gold for the first quarter. 
To ensure the long-term success of Gedabek 
as a producing entity and obtain the best 
return for shareholders, we are looking to 
improve gold recovery rates and in turn to 
extend the life of mine. In May 2012, following 
a pre-feasibility study carried out by Arcadis 
Chile, the Company announced that it intends 
to construct an agitation leaching plant at 
“ I am delighted to report that the Company 
recorded a 60% increase in profit before tax 
of US$31.6 million (2010: US$19.8 million).”

Gedabek. The plant will have the capacity 
to treat 100 tph of ore and has an expected 
capital cost of US$52 million including 
construction of the tailings dam and all 
related infrastructure. The Company is in 
the process of seeking approval from the 
Government of Azerbaijan for construction 
of the agitation leaching plant.
Gedabek is an open pit mining operation, which 
currently utilises a conventional heap leach 
process and a resin adsorption recovery plant. 
The heap leach process required less capital 
than the proposed agitation leaching plant 
to establish. However, heap leaching has 
limitations with regards to the size of ore 
being leached (-25mm), which results in gold 
recoveries of circa 70% with leaching cycles 
extending up to typically a year depending on 
the ore mineralogy. In comparison, agitation 
leaching of milled ore can deliver higher 
recoveries with the immediate production 
of gold.
The agitation leaching plant will process 
high grade ore and additional resources that 
are not suitable for Gedabek’s current heap 
leaching processing operation, together with 
spent ore from the leach heaps to further 
improve total gold recoveries. Agitation 
leaching recovery rates have been initially 
estimated at 85% for oxide material and 69% 
for sulphide material although the Company 
is carrying out further tests to see if these 
recovery rates can be improved. In May 2012 
the International Bank of Azerbaijan (‘IBA’) 
provided a US$7.5 million loan at an annual 
interest rate of 12% as part of the finance required 
for this project. The Company is in advanced 
discussions regarding additional debt funding 
and will update shareholders in due course. 
As I mentioned briefly, in April 2012, we were 
delighted to announce a resource upgrade 
to 48,138,979 tonnes at 0.825 g/t gold for 
1,276,422 ounces of gold in the Measured, 
Indicated and Inferred categories (a 61% 
increase from the previous JORC resource 
estimate dated October 2010); 0.197 % 
copper for 94,890 tonnes (a 93% increase); 
and 6.66 g/t silver for 10,305,653 ounces 
(a 36% increase) at a cut-off grade of 0.3 g/t 
gold. Recent drilling completed since the 
resource estimate indicates the significant 
potential to continue upgrading and increasing 
the size of the Gedabek deposit. Consequently, 
we are planning to conduct a further 24,567 
metre drilling programme and complete a 
JORC compliant ore reserves estimate in 
Q2 2012. 
On the corporate front, we continue to work 
closely with the Government of Azerbaijan. 
We are grateful for the level of support it 
gives us as we continue to develop Gedabek, 
the first gold mine in Azerbaijan in modern 
times, and to advance our other Contract 
Areas, Gosha and Ordubad, with the vision of 
commissioning future mining operations and 
building a mid-tier gold and base metal 
mining company in the country. 
In terms of financing, we have a strong 
relationship with the IBA, which is majority 
owned by the Government of Azerbaijan. With 
our increasing profitability in FY 2011 we 
significantly reduced our debt (which peaked 
at US$43.7 million in March 2010 following 
Gedabek’s mine development in 2008–2009) 
to US$13.1 million as at 31 December 2011 
(2010: US$30.6 million). Net debt, being 
interest-bearing loans and borrowings less 
cash and cash equivalents, reduced to US$3.2 
million at 31 December 2011 (2010: US$25.5 
million) and cash in the bank stood at US$9.9 
million (2010: US$5.1 million). In addition, 
during 2011, the Company repaid its US$1.0 
million loan from the Company’s CEO Reza 
Vaziri bringing the outstanding loan balance 
to US$ nil. 
It must be noted that we have a Production 
Sharing Agreement in place with the 
Government of Azerbaijan based on the 
established Azeri oil industry model. Up until 
the time we have recovered all of our carried 
forward, unrecovered costs, the Government 
of Azerbaijan effectively takes 12.75% of 
commercial products of any mine we bring 
into production, with Anglo Asian taking 
87.25%. We expect to continue retaining 
87.25% of the commercial products until at 
least the end of 2012 based on costs incurred 
to date and, with the construction of the 
agitation leaching plant, this level of recovery 
is expected to continue beyond 2012.
In 2011 Anglo Asian generated revenues of 
US$83.8 million (2010: US$72.0 million) as a 
result of gold, silver and copper concentrate 
sales from the Gedabek mine. US$78.8 million 
of the revenue (2010: US$72.0 million) was 
generated from the sale of Anglo Asian’s 
share of the production of dore bars for the 
year which comprised 49,304 ounces of gold 
and 34,593 ounces of silver (2010: 57,398 
ounces of gold and 35,922 ounces of silver) 
at an average price of US$1,573 per ounce 
and US$35 per ounce respectively (2010: 
US$1,241 per ounce and US$22 per ounce). 
In addition, Anglo Asian generated revenue 
from the sale of copper concentrate of 
US$5.0 million (2010: US$ nil). 
The Company incurred mining cost of sales of 
US$40.7 million (2010: US$40.6 million) and 
therefore reported a gross profit of US$43.0 
million for 2011 (2010: US$31.4 million). 
Maintaining good health, safety, social and 
environmental standards is a top priority for 
the Company and accordingly we have a 
Health, Safety, Environment and Technology 
Committee (‘HSET’) at Board level, under the 
chairmanship of Professor John Monhemius, 
a Non-executive Director of the Company. 
This committee, which meets at least twice 
a year, has the responsibility to oversee all 
aspects of the HSET performance of the 
Company and to make recommendations 
to the Board. We have approximately 500 
personnel working in the Company. 
The local community remains an important 
focus for us. Our main project in 2011 was to 
fund and construct a school for 300 students 
in Arixdam, the closest village to the Gedabek 
mine. This is now up and running successfully. 
Additionally, we continue to finance and train 
beekeepers, run a free internet café, and 
provide computer training courses to the 
local population. The Company has also 
financed and arranged the improvement of 
sections of roads in Arixdam and Duzyurd as 
well as the construction of a bridge and the 
building of a new pipeline to provide a potable 
water supply to the households residing 
within the vicinity of the Gedabek mine.
In summary, the past financial year has seen 
Anglo Asian cement its footprint in Caucasia 
as a significant gold producer in the region. 
Both solid production and a favourable gold/ 
copper price has resulted in a strong financial 
performance for your Company, which enabled 
us to accelerate the repayment of loans, 
reduce debt ahead of schedule and build 
a strong cash position, which stood at 
US$9.9 million at 31 December 2011. With 
significant stockpiles of copper concentrate 
carried forward into the new financial year, 
this opens up potential further cash flow 
for FY 2012 when sale contracts have 
been secured. 
Looking ahead to 2012 and beyond, whilst 
we remain committed to improving the 
operational efficiency and gold recovery rates 
at Gedabek, we expect to see continued solid 
gold, silver and copper production for the year .
We are also focused on producing a JORC 
compliant reserve estimate at Gedabek in 
Q2 2012 and will continue exploration and infill 
drilling throughout the remainder of the year 
to improve and upgrade the resource base. 
Furthermore, we remain committed to 
establishing a second mining project in 
Azerbaijan, Gosha, which will be another 
significant step for Anglo Asian as we focus 
on delivering exploration upside to become 
a leading mid-tier gold producer in Caucasia. 
We look forward to reporting on these 
developments in due course.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank 
our Anglo Asian employees, our partners, 
the Government of Azerbaijan, my fellow 
Directors, advisers and shareholders for 
their continued support and I look forward 
to updating shareholders regularly on our 
progress as we continue to build ourselves 
as a highly profitable, significant gold/
copper/silver producer in Azerbaijan.

During the course of 2011 we continued to 
focus on the development of our flagship 
Gedabek mine. Our first aim was to realise 
our internal management target of circa 
60,000 ounces of gold for the year. Our 
second aim was to continue exploring 
the greater Gedabek area to re-classify 
the mineral resource and ore reserves 
categories, and our third aim was to consider 
future mineral processing options such as 
agitation leaching to optimise gold recovery 
at the mine. 
Additionally, in line with our strategy to 
establish other mining operations within 
Azerbaijan, we conducted exploration work 
at our other two Contract Areas, Gosha, 
which is located 50 km away from Gedabek, 
and Ordubad, which is located in the 
autonomous Nakhchivan Republic of Azerbaijan. 
Mining operations
Gedabek
Gedabek is an open pit heap leach gold/
copper/silver mining operation located on a 
300 sq km Contract Area in western Azerbaijan 
across the Tethyan Tectonic Belt, one of 
the world’s significant copper and gold 
bearing areas. 
We were pleased to announce that for FY 2011 
we produced 57,068 ounces of gold with an 
average cash operating cost of US$448 per 
ounce. With regards to gold and silver sales 
for the year, we sold 49,304 ounces of gold 
at an average of US$1,573 per ounce for the 
year and 34,593 ounces of silver at an 
average of US$35 per ounce. 
Table 1 highlights the quarter-on-quarter 
gold production at Gedabek over the past 
year with average gold sale price achieved. 
In terms of processing, during 2011 the 
volume of dry ore being transferred onto the 
leach pad totalled 842,751 tonnes with an 
average gold content of 3.29 g/t (2010: 821,176 
tonnes of dry ore with an average gold content 
of 4.33 g/t). Table 2 summarises levels of dry 
ore that have been transferred to the leach 
pad on a quarterly basis from 1 January 2011 
to 31 December 2011.
The reduced grade in 2011 was a result of 
treating transitional ore and was in line with 
our mine plan. A change in the physical 
characteristics of the ore, whereby a 
significant change in density and structure 
associated more with the transitional ore zone, 
affected the leaching rate and in turn the gold 
recovery and production. Channelling also 
occurred during the second half of the year in 
one of the cells as a result of the harsh winter, 
which affected leaching efficiencies. 
Due to this, we implemented an initiative in 
Q3 2011 to accelerate waste removal to open 
“ In May 2012, following a pre-feasibility study 
carried out by consultants, Arcadis Chile, the 
Company announced that it intends to construct 
an agitation leaching plant at Gedabek to further 
improve gold recoveries.”

up areas of oxide ore which has leaching 
characteristics more suitable to the heap 
leach process. Additionally, we crushed the 
ore more finely to make it more accessible 
to cyanide leaching.
As previously stated, Gedabek is currently 
an open pit heap leach operation. To ensure 
its long-term success as a leading gold/
copper/silver mine in the Caucasian region 
we are continually looking at ways to 
improve operational efficiencies and 
production. Accordingly, in May 2012, 
following a pre-feasibility study carried out 
by consultants, Arcadis Chile, the Company 
announced that it intends to construct an 
agitation leaching plant at Gedabek. The 
plant will have the capacity to treat 100 tph 
of ore and has an expected capital cost of 
US$52 million, including construction of the 
tailings dam and all related infrastructure. 
The Company is now in the process of 
seeking approval from the Government of 
Azerbaijan for construction of this new plant.
For the recovery of copper concentrate 
at Gedabek we use a SART process, which 
facilitates the recovery of the copper 
dissolved in the leaching solution. The 
copper is recovered in the form of a 
precipitated copper sulphide concentrate 
by-product, which also contains silver with 
commercial value. Recovery of copper and 
silver from solution is in the region of 90% 
and 96% respectively. The SART process has 
the added economic benefit that substantial 
amounts of cyanide are recovered from the 
leach solutions.
Using this process, for the year 31 December 
2011 we produced 611 tonnes of copper, 
134,240 ounces of silver and 200 ounces of 
gold, which exceeded our internal target of 
525 tonnes of copper for the year. A full 
quarterly breakdown of copper concentrate 
production can be reviewed in table 3.
We expect copper production in FY 2012 to total 
in the region of 833 tonnes of dry concentrate 
containing 500 tonnes of copper, 102,000 
ounces of silver and 134 ounces of gold.
Exploration
Gedabek
During the period, exploration remained 
an important part of our focus at Gedabek 
to increase the resource base, which at 
the beginning of the year stood at 791,000 
ounces of gold, 49,300 tonnes of copper and 
7,597,000 ounces of silver for all categories, 
and in turn increase the life of mine at Gedabek, 
which currently stands at approximately 
323,000 ounces of gold over a six year period. 
During the course of 2010/2011 we 
undertook an advanced exploration 
programme comprising of a two phase 
drilling programme. Phase 1 drilling, which 
was completed February 2011, comprised 60 
holes concentrated within the boundaries of 
the existing pit at Gedabek, totalling 5,452 
metres across a 90,000 square metre area 
with 4,626 samples prepared and assayed. 
Best intersections from the Phase 1 drilling 
programme at Gedabek included:

The second objective of the 2010 – 2011 
exploration programme was to look at the 
mineral resources around the current 
economic open pit limit with a view to its 
possible future expansion. This was achieved 
by the Phase 2 exploration drilling campaign 
that consisted of 56 drill holes with 9,058.48 
metres drilled and 4,080 samples prepared 
and assayed.
The results for Phase 1 and 2 drilling 
programmes demonstrated consistent gold, 
silver and copper grades and continuity of 
mineralisation at Gedabek. Importantly, it 
also increased the geological knowledge and 
confidence in the quantity and quality of the 
mineral resources and ore reserves within 
the current economic open pit limit at 
Gedabek, and also enabled us to gain a 
better understanding of the metallurgy of 
the ore body to help assess future mineral 
processing options such as agitation 
leaching. As previously mentioned in this 
report, agitation leaching could potentially 
enable an increase in Gedabek’s mine life 
and improve its economic fundamentals.

Exploration continued
Gedabek continued
The Gedabek mineral deposit has the style 
of mineralisation typical of porphyry gold 
deposits (Robert, Poulsen and Dube, 1997), 
which is confirmed by the extensive analysis, 
interpretation and processing of the previous 
and recent sources of geological and chemical 
information. This is also supported by the 
geological and structural geology cross 
sections, which show that the spatial 
distribution of the gold, copper and silver 
mineralisation is located under, or immediate 
to, the geological contact between the 
andesitic and dacitic lavas and volcaniclastic 
tuffs and the dacitic quartz porphyry.
The updated mineral resources estimation 
was completed by mining consultants, CAE 
Mining, taking into account surface and open 
pit structural geology mapping and the 
information from the 2010-2011 exploration 
drilling campaigns, which together with 
earlier campaigns totalled 34,936 metres 
of drilling at Gedabek. 
As a result, in April 2012 we were delighted 
to be able to announce a 50%* increase in 
the JORC-compliant gold resource at Gedabek 
to 37,111,577 tonnes at 0.884 g/t of gold for 
1,054,382 ounces; 0.220% copper for 81,765 
tonnes; and 7.215 g/t of silver for 8,608,551 
ounces in the Measured and Indicated 
classifications at a cut-off grade of 0.3 g/t 
of gold. Including the Inferred category, the 
total JORC mineral resource is now 
48,138,979 tonnes at 0.825 g/t gold for 
1,276,422 ounces of gold (a 61% increase); 
0.197 % copper for 94,890 tonnes (a 93% 
increase); and 6.66 g/t silver for 10,305,653 
ounces (a 36% increase) at a cut-off grade 
of 0.3 g/t of gold. 
The updated Measured, Indicated and Inferred 
mineral resources of both the oxide and 
sulphide mineralisation based on a cut-off 
grade of 0.3 g/t of gold is described in table 4. 
In Q1 2012, we commenced a further 24,567 
metre drilling programme with the aim of 
increasing the mineral resources of the 
Gedabek deposit and completing a JORC 
compliant ore reserves estimate in Q2 2012.
Gosha
The 300 sq km Gosha Contract Area is 
located in western Azerbaijan, 50 km 
north-west of Gedabek and contains three 
prospects: Gosha, Itkirlan and Munduglu. 
Following the Government of Azerbaijan’s 
approval of the Development and Production 
Programme, it is our intention to develop a 
small, profitable, high grade underground 
gold mine at Gosha. 
An exploration programme was undertaken 
at Gosha in 2010, which included 3,000 
metres of drilling and 300 metres of adit 
and sample work. Gosha has more than 6 km 
of exploration adits from the Soviet era and 
this programme highlighted that one of its 
Chief Executive’s review continued
Improving gold recoveries
A pre-feasibility study was completed in 
January 2012 aimed at looking at ways to 
improve gold recoveries at Gedabek. The 
study suggests that the current conventional 
heap leach process, which results in gold 
recoveries of circa 70% with leaching cycles 
extending up to a year, could be improved 
with an agitation leaching plant. This would 
see the production of gold with recovery 
rates for oxide and sulphide materials rising 
to 85% and 69% respectively. The plant, with 
an estimated capex of US$52 million, would 
be designed to treat 100 tonnes of ore per 
hour and is planned to be commissioned 
during H2 2013.

mineralisation zones, designated during 
Soviet times as ‘Zone 13’, has the potential 
to become a small narrow vein gold mining 
operation. In addition to this zone, there are 
several other vein type mineralisation zones. 
At present no JORC compliant information 
on Gosha’s resource is available. 
Having assessed the results of our exploration 
programme, in February 2011 we submitted 
a Notice of Discovery at Gosha to the 
Government of Azerbaijan, and later in 
November 2011 we submitted a Development 
and Production Programme in accordance 
with our PSA which was subsequently approved 
in April 2012. An update on our progress and 
summary of the proposed work programme 
at Gosha will be published in due course. 
Ordubad
Our 462 sq km Ordubad Contract Area 
is located in the Nakhchivan region of 
Azerbaijan and contains numerous targets 
including Shakardara, Piyazbashi, Misdag, 
Agyurt, Shalala and Diakchay, which are all 
located within a 5 km radius of each other.
Post period end, in April 2012, we submitted 
a Notice of Discovery following exploration 
work performed by Anglo Asian at its 
Piyazbashi and Agyurt targets during 2010 
and 2011, building on work performed in 
Soviet times. This exploration work included 
surface trenching and sampling, re-sampling 
of 3,000 metres of adits, 2,500 metres of surface 
drilling and 1,400 metres of underground 
drilling at the Agyurt target. 
As with Gosha, under the terms of the PSA, 
following the submission of the Notice of 
Discovery, we have a six month period to 
submit a Development and Production 
Programme to the Government of 
Azerbaijan for approval.
Further information concerning the results 
of the studies and exploration work at Ordubad 
will be announced in due course and further 
exploration work is now planned with a view 
to confirming a small gold deposit with 
production potential. 
Outlook
2011 has been a successful year for Anglo 
Asian in terms of solid gold and copper 
production and increasing profitability. 
The year ahead looks very promising as 
we advance our flagship mining operation 
Gedabek, continuing exploration to increase 
the resource base and define reserves and in 
turn increasing the life of mine. In addition 
the gold production target is 54,000 ounces 
for FY 2012 and the decision to build an 
agitation leaching plant to further improve 
gold recoveries marks an exciting time in 
Gedabek’s development and its future 
success as the first gold mine in Azerbaijan 
in modern times. In addition, we remain 
committed to developing Gosha and 
enhancing our production profile by 
commencing development of a second 
mining operation in the second half of 2013. 
I therefore believe that we are in a strong 
position to generate value for shareholders 
during the coming year and look forward 
to updating shareholders regularly on 
our progress.

*  The 50% increase in the Updated Mineral Resources Report does not take in to account the ore that has been 
mined at Gedabek from the date of the first report October 2010 to now and ore that is currently in the leach 
pad process, or contained in ore stock piles. 10 Anglo Asian Mining PLC Annual report and accounts 2011 www.angloasianmining.com
Introduction
I am pleased to report that in 2011 Anglo 
Asian generated revenues of US$83,753,311 
(2010: US$72,012,543) as a result of gold, 
silver and copper concentrate sales from 
the Gedabek mine. 
US$78,756,649 of the revenues (2010: 
US$72,012,543) were generated from the sale 
of Anglo Asian’s share of the production 
of dore bars for the year which comprised 
49,304 ounces of gold and 34,593 ounces 
of silver (2010: 57,398 ounces of gold and 
35,922 ounces of silver) at an average price 
of US$1,573 per ounce and US$35 per ounce 
respectively (2010: US$1,241 per ounce and 
US$22 per ounce). In addition, Anglo Asian 
generated revenue from the sale of copper 
concentrate of US$4,996,662 (2010: US$ nil). 
The Group incurred mining cost of sales 
of US$40,717,112 (2010: US$40,639,430) 
and therefore reported a gross profit of 
US$43,036,199 for 2011 (2010: US$31,373,113). 
The Group incurred administration expenses 
of US$6,021,274 (2010: US$5,126,926) and 
finance costs for the year of US$3,270,909 
(2010: US$6,314,522). The Group recorded 
profit before tax for the year of US$31,623,383 
(2010: US$19,798,377). The finance costs for 
the year comprise interest on the credit 
facilities and loans, interest on letters 
of credit and accretion expenses on the 
rehabilitation provision. 
During 2011, the Group reduced its 
outstanding loan with IBA from US$29,627,007 
to US$13,041,000. In October 2011, Anglo 
Asian negotiated a reduction in the annual 
interest rate from 15% to 12%.
The table 5 below shows the schedule 
of repayments for the IBA loan. 
During 2011, Anglo Asian repaid all of the 
outstanding balance of US$998,663 of the 
loan owed to the Company’s CEO Reza Vaziri. 
Remaining debt at 31 December 2011 stands 
at US$13,041,000 (2010: US$30,625,670), all 
due to IBA. 
The Group held cash balances at 
31 December 2011 of US$9,938,594 
(2010: US$5,110,851) and inventories at cost 
of US$27,301,183 (2010: US$16,354,968). 
Net assets of the Group were US$76,867,936 
(2010: US$58,018,453).
During the year, exploration and evaluation 
expenditure of US$4,956,336 (2010: 
US$3,449,470) was incurred and capitalised. 
The Group was charged corporation tax during 
the year of US$4,950,289 (2010: US$ nil). 
At 31 December 2011, R.V. Investment 
Group Services LLC, the Group entity party 
to the PSA, had utilised all its cumulative 
carried forward tax losses (2010: cumulative 
carried forward loss of US$13,394,919). The 
Company has booked a deferred tax liability 
of US$7,900,635 in 2011 (2010: US$4,560,934), 
bringing the total deferred tax liability 
provision to US$12,461,569 
(2010: US$4,560,934).

PSA
Under the terms of the PSA in place with 
the Government of Azerbaijan, the Company 
and the Government of Azerbaijan share 
commercial products of each mine. Until 
the time that Anglo Asian has recovered all 
its carried forward, unrecovered costs, the 
Government of Azerbaijan effectively takes 
12.75% of commercial products of each 
mine, with the Company taking 87.25% 
(being 75% for capital and operating costs 
plus 49% of the remaining 25% balance). 
The Company expects that it will not have 
recovered all its costs by the end of 2012 and 
that the ratio of sharing commercial products 
for the Gedabek mine of 87.25% to Anglo 
Asian and 12.75% to the Government of 
Azerbaijan will continue throughout the year. 
Once all prior year costs are recovered, 
the Company can continue with cost recovery 
of up to 75% of the value of commercial 
products, before the remaining product 
revenues are shared between the Company 
and the Government of Azerbaijan in a 49% 
to 51% ratio. The Company can recover the 
following costs:
 > all direct operating expenses of 
Gedabek mine;
 > all exploration expenses incurred on the 
Gedabek Contract Area;
 > all capital expenditure incurred on the 
Gedabek mine;
 > an allocation of corporate overheads 
- currently, overheads are apportioned to 
Gedabek according to the ratio of direct 
capital and operating expenditure at 
Gedabek Contract Area compared with 
direct capital and operational expenditure 
at Gosha and Ordubad Contract Areas; and
 > an imputed interest rate of USD LIBOR + 
4% per annum on any unrecovered costs.
Going concern
The Directors have prepared the consolidated 
financial statements on a going concern basis 
after reviewing the Group’s forecast cash 
position for the period ending 30 June 2013 
and satisfying themselves that the Group will 
have sufficient funds on hand to realise its 
assets and meet its obligations as and when 
they fall due. 
Depreciation/amortisation
As described in note 3 of the annual report, 
the accumulated mine development costs 
within producing mines are depreciated/
amortised on a unit-of-production basis over 
the economically recoverable reserves of the 
mine concerned, except in the case of assets 
whose useful life is shorter than the life of 
the mine, in which case the straight line 
method is applied. The unit of account for 
run of mines (‘ROM’) costs and for post-ROM 
costs are recoverable ounces of gold. An 
amount of 323,000 ounces of recoverable 
gold has been used to determine depreciation/ 
amortisation on accumulated mine 
development costs. It is expected that as a 
result of the JORC compliant reserve report 
that is expected to be published in Q2 2012, 
the Group will revise its estimate of recoverable 
gold which it uses to determine depreciation/ 
amortisation on accumulated mine 
development costs.
Commodity price risk
The Group’s revenues are exposed to 
fluctuations in the price of gold, silver 
and copper. Anglo Asian currently does not 
hold any financial instruments to hedge the 
commodity price risk on its expected future 
production; however, the Board will review 
this exposure and the requirement for 
hedging activities on an ongoing basis.
Foreign currency risk
The Group reports in US dollars and a large 
proportion of its business is conducted in 
US dollars. It also conducts business in 
Australian dollars, Azerbaijan manats and 
UK sterling. The Group does not currently 
hedge its exposure to other currencies 
although it will review this periodically if 
the volume of non-US Dollar transactions 
increases significantly.
Liquidity and interest rate risk
The Group has not used any interest rate 
swaps or other instruments to manage its 
interest rate profile during 2011 but will 
review this requirement on a periodic basis. 
Interest rates on current loans are fixed and 
there is no floating rate debt.
Board approval is required for all new 
borrowing facilities. At the year end the 
Group’s only interest rate exposure was 
on cash held in the bank. During the year 
it had entered into short-term deposits 
which included overnight, weekly and 
monthly up to 12 months; however, it held 
no short-term deposits as at the year end.
Market risk
Exposure to interest rate fluctuations is 
minimal as the Group currently has no 
floating rate debt. Interest rates on UK 
Sterling and US Dollar deposits have been 
at historic lows during the current year. 
The levels of deposits held by the Group 
have also been low; therefore, any impact 
of changing rates is minimal. The Group is 
exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices 
now that production has commenced.
Operational risk
There is exposure to levels of production as 
a result of unforeseen operational problems 
or machinery malfunction and therefore 
operating costs for commercial production 
may remain subject to variation from those 
forecast by the Directors. The Group will 
monitor progress on delays and costs on 
a regular basis.

Approval to build second gold mine 
Having gained approval in May 2012 from the 
Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources for 
a Development and Production Programme, 
the Company is focussed on developing the 
Gosha Gold Deposit into a small, profitable, 
high grade underground gold mine producing 
gold at an average rate of 10,000 to 15,000 
ounces per annum for a period of up to five 
years.  Gosha, located 50km away from 
Gedabek, will be the Company’s second gold 
mine and is expected to go into development 
H2 2013. It is also anticipated that further 
drilling campaigns at Gosha will be 
undertaken to increase the economics of the 
proposed mine.  12 Anglo Asian Mining PLC Annual report and accounts 2011 www.angloasianmining.com

Directors’ indemnities
The Group has made qualifying third party indemnity provision for the benefit of its Directors which were made during the year and remain 
in force at the date of this report. 14 Anglo Asian Mining PLC Annual report and accounts 2011 www.angloasianmining.com
Directors’ report continued
Going concern
The Directors have prepared the consolidated financial statements on a going concern basis after reviewing the Group’s cash position for 
the period to 30 June 2013 and satisfying themselves that the Group will have sufficient funds on hand to realise its assets and meet its 
obligations as and when they fall due. 
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position, can be found in 
the Chairman’s Statement on pages 4 and 5 and the Chief Executive’s Review on pages 6 to 9. The financial position of the Group, its cash 
flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the Finance Review on pages 10 and 11. In addition, note 23 to the financial 
statements includes the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital, its financial risk management objectives, details 
of its financial instruments and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group is currently operating in favourable market conditions for its main product with the gold spot price achieving record nominal high 
prices in 2011 and believes that the spot price of gold will remain high compared to historical prices. The Group is able to produce gold at a 
comparatively low unit cost, ensuring a large margin is achieved on production. Loans have been paid ahead of their scheduled repayment 
date in 2011. As a consequence, the Directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully under the 
current uncertain economic outlook.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the Group continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual 
report and accounts.
Charitable and political contributions
There were no charitable or political contributions made during the year (2010: US$ nil).

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Directors’ Report and the consolidated financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations. Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year . Under that law the Directors 
have, as required by the AIM Rules of the London Stock Exchange, elected to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as adopted by the European Union and have elected to prepare the financial statements 
of the Company (the parent company) in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (‘UK GAAP’).
In the case of the Group’s IFRS financial statements, the Directors are required to prepare Group financial statements for each financial 
year which present fairly the financial position of the Group and the financial performance and cash flows of the Group for that period. 
In preparing the Group financial statements the Directors are required to: 
 > select suitable accounting policies in accordance with International Accounting Standard (IAS) 8 ‘Accounting Policies, Changes in 
Accounting Estimates and Errors’ and then apply them consistently; 
 > present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information; 
 > provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRS is insufficient to enable users to understand 
the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial performance;
 > state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRS; 
 > prepare the accounts on a going concern basis unless, having assessed the ability of the Group to continue as a going concern, 
management either intends to liquidate the entity or to cease trading, or have no realistic alternative but to do so; and
 > make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent.
In the case of the Company’s UK GAAP financial statements, the Directors are required to prepare financial statements for each financial year 
which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company. In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to: 
 > select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 > make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
 > state whether they have been prepared in accordance with UK GAAP; and 
 > prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of the financial statements and other information 
included in annual reports may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
 > the financial statements, prepared in accordance with IFRS, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit 
or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and
 > the management report, which is incorporated into the Directors’ Report, includes a fair review of the development and performance 
of the business and the position of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with 
a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.

Introduction
Although the rules of AIM do not require the Company to comply with the Combined Code on Corporate Governance (the ‘Code’), the 
Company fully supports the principles set out in the Code and will attempt to comply wherever possible, given both the size and resources 
available to the Company. Details are provided below of how the Company applies the Code. 
The Board
The Board of Directors currently comprises one Executive Director and four Non-executive Directors, one of whom is the Chairman. 
The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive are split in line with the recommended policy.
The Board meets regularly throughout the year and receives a Board pack comprising individual reports from the Executive Director together 
with any other material deemed necessary for the Board to discharge its duties. The Board also conducts telephone Board meetings as 
issues arise which require Board attention. It is the Board’s responsibility to formulate, review and approve the Group’s strategy, budgets 
and major items of expenditure. The Board sets the Group’s objectives and policies and monitors the implementation by the Executive team.
The Board considers two of the Non-executive Directors other than the Chairman to be independent.
Audit Committee
The Board has an Audit Committee which comprises Mr. Richard Round and Mr. John Sununu and is scheduled to meet at least twice a year. 
The external auditors attend the meetings and the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer attend by invitation. It is the Audit Committee’s 
role to provide formal and transparent arrangements for considering how to apply the financial reporting and internal control requirements 
of the Code, whilst maintaining an appropriate relationship with the independent auditors of the Group.
Remuneration Committee
The Board has a Remuneration Committee which comprises Mr. Khosrow Zamani and Mr. John Sununu and meets as required. It is the 
Remuneration Committee’s role to establish a formal and transparent policy on Executive remuneration and to set remuneration packages 
for individual Directors.
Nomination Committee
The Board has a Nomination Committee which comprises Mr. Khosrow Zamani and Mr. John Sununu. It is the role of the Nomination 
Committee to review and consider the Board structure and composition and it meets as required to consider and make recommendations 
on the appointment of Directors to the Board.
Health, Safety, Environment and Technology Committee
The Board has a Health, Safety, Environment and Technology Committee which comprises Mr. John Monhemius and Mr. Reza Vaziri 
and meets as required. The Committee’s primary function is to assist the Board of Directors of the Company in fulfilling its oversight 
responsibilities in the following areas:
 > the health, safety, environmental and technological issues relating to the Company; 
 > the Company’s compliance with corporate policies that provide processes, procedures and standards to follow in accomplishing the 
Company’s goals and objectives relating to health, safety and environmental issues, to ensure that the Company’s operations and work 
practices comply as far as is practicable with the best international standards; and 
 > the management of risk related to health, safety, environmental and technological issues.
Shareholder relations
The Company meets with its institutional shareholders and analysts as appropriate and encourages communication with private 
shareholders via the Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’). In addition, the Company uses the annual report and accounts, interim statement 
and website (www.angloasianmining.com) to provide further information to shareholders.
Internal control and risk management
The Board is responsible for the system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. Such systems are designed to manage rather 
than eliminate risks and can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. For each year, on 
behalf of the Board, the Audit Committee reviews the effectiveness of these systems. This is achieved primarily by considering the risks 
potentially affecting the Group and discussions with the external auditors.
The Group does not currently have an internal audit function due to the small size of the Group and limited resources available.
A comprehensive budgeting process is completed once a year and is reviewed by the Board and where appropriate revised forecasts are 
prepared and also reviewed by the Board. The Group’s results, as compared against budget, are reported to the Board on a monthly basis 
and discussed in detail at each meeting of the Board.
The Group maintains appropriate insurance cover in respect of legal actions against the Directors as well as against material loss or claims 
against the Group and the Board reviews the adequacy of the cover regularly.
Corporate governance  www.angloasianmining.com Anglo Asian Mining PLC Annual report and accounts 2011 17
We have audited the Group financial statements of Anglo Asian Mining PLC for the year ended 31 December 2011 which comprise the 
consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2011, and the consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity, consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended and the 
related notes 1 to 29. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International 
Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 15, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of 
the Group financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion 
on the Group financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those 
standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance 
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; 
the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Directors’ Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited 
financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the Group financial statements:
 > give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2011 and of its profit for the year then ended;
 > have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and
 > have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the Group financial statements are prepared 
is consistent with the Group financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
 > certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
 > we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the parent company financial statements of Anglo Asian Mining PLC for the year ended 31 December 2011.

1.  The maintenance and integrity of the Anglo Asian Mining PLC website is the responsibility of the Directors; the work carried out by the auditors does not involve 
consideration of these matters and, accordingly, the auditors accept no responsibility for any changes that may have occurred to the financial statements since they 
were initially presented on the website.
2. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention unless described otherwise in the accounting 
policy below.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Group made up to 31 December each year. Control is 
achieved where the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation. 
The financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the parent company, using consistent accounting policies.
Changes in accounting policies, new standards and interpretations  
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year except for the following new amendments to the 
standards adopted by the Group on 1 January 2011:
IAS 24 ‘Related Party Disclosures’ (Amendment)
The IASB issued an amendment to IAS 24 that clarifies the definitions of a related party. The new definitions emphasise a symmetrical 
view of related party relationships and clarify the circumstances in which persons and key management personnel affect related party 
relationships of an entity. In addition, the amendment introduces an exemption from the general related party disclosure requirements for 
transactions with government and entities that are controlled, jointly controlled or significantly influenced by the same government as the 
reporting entity. The adoption of this interpretation had no effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.
IAS 32 ‘Financial Instruments: Presentation – Classification of Rights Issues’ (Amendment)
The amendment to IAS 32 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 February 2010 and amended the definition of a financial 
liability in order to classify rights issues (and certain options or warrants) as equity instruments in cases where such rights are given pro rata 
to all of the existing owners of the same class of an entity’s non-derivative equity instruments, or to acquire a fixed number of the entity’s 
own equity instruments for a fixed amount in any currency. The adoption of this interpretation had no effect on the consolidated financial 
statements of the Group.
IFRIC 19 ‘Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments’
IFRIC 19 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2010. The interpretation clarifies that equity instruments issued to a creditor 
to extinguish a financial liability qualify as consideration paid. The equity instruments issued are measured at their fair value. In case that this 
cannot be reliably measured, the instruments are measured at the fair value of the liability extinguished. Any gain or loss is recognised 
immediately in profit or loss. The adoption of this interpretation had no effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.
Improvements to IFRSs
In May 2010, the IASB issued its third omnibus of amendments to its standards, primarily with a view to removing inconsistencies and 
clarifying wording. There are separate transitional provisions for each standard. The adoption of the following amendments resulted 
in changes to accounting policies, but had no impact on the financial position or performance of the Group:
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments — Disclosures: The amendment was intended to simplify the disclosures provided by reducing the volume of 
disclosures around collateral held and improving disclosures by requiring qualitative information to put the quantitative information in context. 
IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: The amendment clarifies that an entity may present an analysis of each component of other 
comprehensive income either in the statement of changes in equity or in the notes to the financial statements.
Other amendments resulting from improvements to IFRSs to the following standards did not have any impact on the accounting policies, 
financial position or performance of the Group:
 > IFRS 3 Business Combinations (Measurement options available for non-controlling interest);
 > IFRS 3 Business Combinations (Contingent consideration arising from business combination prior to adoption of IFRS 3 (as revised in 2008));
 > IFRS 3 Business Combinations (Un-replaced and voluntarily replaced share-based payment awards);  www.angloasianmining.com Anglo Asian Mining PLC Annual report and accounts 2011 23
3. Significant accounting policies continued
Improvements to IFRSs continued
 > IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements;
 > IAS 34 Interim Financial Statements;
 > International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (‘IFRIC’) 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes (determining the fair value 
of award credits); and
 > IFRIC 14 Prepayments of a Minimum Funding Requirement (Amendment).
New standards and amendments issued, but not yet effective
Standards issued, but not yet effective up to the date of issuance of the Group’s financial statements are listed below. This listing of 
standards and interpretations issued are those that the Group reasonably expects to have an impact on disclosures, financial position 
or performance when applied at a future date. The Group intends to adopt these standards when they become effective.
IAS 1 Financial Statement Presentation — Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income
The amendments to IAS 1 change the grouping of items presented in Other Comprehensive Income. Items that could be reclassified (or 
‘recycled’) to profit or loss at a future point in time (for example, upon derecognition or settlement) would be presented separately from items 
that will never be reclassified. The amendment affects presentation only and has no impact on the Group’s financial position or performance. 
The amendment becomes effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2012.
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures — Enhanced Derecognition Disclosure Requirements
The amendment requires additional disclosure about financial assets that have been transferred, but not derecognised to enable the user 
of the Group’s financial statements to understand the relationship with those assets that have not been derecognised and their associated 
liabilities. In addition, the amendment requires disclosures about continuing involvement in derecognised assets to enable the user to 
evaluate the nature of, and risks associated with, the entity’s continuing involvement in those derecognised assets. The amendment becomes 
effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2011. The amendment affects disclosure only and has no impact on the Group’s 
financial position or performance.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: Classification and Measurement
IFRS 9 as issued reflects the first phase of the IASBs work on the replacement of IAS 39 and applies to classification and measurement of 
financial assets and financial liabilities as defined in IAS 39. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013, 
although this effective date is tentative as the standard has not yet been adopted by European Union. In subsequent phases, the IASB will 
address hedge accounting and impairment of financial assets. The completion of this project is expected over the first half of 2012. The 
adoption of the first phase of IFRS 9 will have an effect on the classification and measurement of the Group’s financial assets, but will 
potentially have no impact on classification and measurements of financial liabilities. The Group will quantify the effect in conjunction 
with the other phases, when issued, to present a comprehensive picture.
IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements
IFRS 10 replaces the portion of IAS 27 that addresses the accounting for consolidated financial statements. IAS 27, as revised, is limited 
to the accounting for investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures, and associates in separate financial statements. IFRS 10 does not change 
consolidation procedures (i.e., how to consolidate an entity). Rather, IFRS 10 changes whether an entity is consolidated by revising the definition 
of control. The new standards shall be applied retrospectively in accordance with the requirements of IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in 
Accounting Estimates and Errors for changes in accounting policy, with some modifications and is effective for annual periods beginning on 
or after 1 January 2013. The Group is currently assessing the impact that this standard will have on the financial position and performance. 
IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements, IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures
IFRS 11 replaces IAS 31 Interests in Joint Ventures and SIC-13 Jointly-controlled Entities — Non-monetary Contributions by Venturers. 
IFRS 11 changes the accounting for joint arrangements by moving the old three categories to two new categories: joint venture and joint 
operations. Under this new classification, the structure of the joint arrangement is not the only factor considered when classifying the joint 
arrangement as either a joint operation or a joint venture, which is a change from IAS 31. The parties are required to considered whether 
a separate vehicle exists, and, if so, the legal form of the separate vehicle, the contractual terms and conditions, and other facts and 
circumstances. In addition, IAS 28 was amended to include the application of the equity method to investments in joint ventures. The new 
standards will be applied using a modified retrospective approach and will be effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013. 
The adoption of new standards does not have significant impact on the Group’s financial position or performance. 
IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities 
IFRS 12 applies to an entity that has an interest in subsidiaries, joint arrangements, associates and/or structured entities. The objective of 
the new disclosure requirements is to help the users of financial statements understand the effects of an entity’s interests in other entities 
on its financial position, financial performance and cash flows, as well as the nature of, and the risks associated with, the entity’s interest in 
other entities. IFRS 12 will be applied retrospectively in accordance with requirements of IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting 
Estimates and Errors for changes in accounting policy, with comparative disclosures required effective for annual periods beginning on or 
after 1 January 2013. The Group is currently assessing the impact that this standard will have on the financial position and performance. 
IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement
IFRS 13 establishes a single source of guidance under IFRS for all fair value measurements. IFRS 13 does not change when an entity is 
required to use fair value, but rather provides guidance on how to measure fair value under IFRS when fair value is required or permitted. 
The Group is currently assessing the impact that this standard will have on the financial position and performance. This standard becomes 
effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013. 24 Anglo Asian Mining PLC Annual report and accounts 2011 www.angloasianmining.com
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
for the year ended 31 December 2011
3. Significant accounting policies continued
Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
The preparation of the Group’s consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, 
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated 
financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates and assumptions are 
continuously evaluated and are based on management’s experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are 
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. However, actual outcomes can differ from these estimates. In particular, information 
about significant areas of estimation uncertainty considered by management in preparing the consolidated financial statements is described below.
Ore reserves and resources
Ore reserves are estimates of the amount of ore that can be economically and legally extracted from the Group’s mining properties. 
The Group estimates its ore reserves and mineral resources, based on information compiled by appropriately qualified persons relating 
to the geological data on the size, depth and shape of the ore body and requires complex geological judgements to interpret the data. 
The estimation of recoverable reserves is based upon factors such as estimates of foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, future capital 
requirements, and production costs along with geological assumptions and judgements made in estimating the size and grade of the ore 
body. Changes in the reserve or resource estimates may impact upon the carrying value of exploration and evaluation assets, mine 
properties, property, plant and equipment, provision for rehabilitation, and depreciation and amortisation charges.
Exploration and evaluation expenditure (note 13)
The application of the Group’s accounting policy for exploration and evaluation expenditure requires judgement in determining whether it 
is likely that future economic benefits are likely either from future exploitation or sale or where activities have not reached a stage which 
permits a reasonable assessment of the existence of reserves. The determination of a Joint Ore Reserves Committee (‘JORC’) resource is 
itself an estimation process that requires varying degrees of uncertainty depending on sub-classification and these estimates directly impact 
the point of deferral of exploration and evaluation expenditure. The deferral policy requires management to make certain estimates and 
assumptions about future events or circumstances, in particular whether an economically viable extraction operation can be established. 
Estimates and assumptions made may change if new information becomes available. If, after expenditure is capitalised, information 
becomes available suggesting that the recovery of expenditure is unlikely, the amount capitalised is written off in the consolidated income 
statement in the period when the new information becomes available.
Inventories (note 18)
Net realisable value tests are performed at least annually and represent the estimated future sales price of the product based on prevailing 
spot metals prices at the reporting date, less estimated costs to complete production and bring the product to sale.
Stockpiles are measured by estimating the number of tonnes added and removed from the stockpile, the number of contained gold ounces 
based on assay data, and the estimated recovery percentage based on the expected processing method.
Stockpile tonnages are verified by periodic surveys.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets (note 13 and 14)
The assessment of tangible and intangible assets for any internal and external indications of impairment involves judgement. Each reporting 
period, a formal estimate of recoverable amount is performed and an impairment loss recognised to the extent that the carrying amount 
exceeds recoverable amount. Recoverable amount is determined as the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. Determining 
whether the projects are impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the individual areas to which value has been ascribed. The 
value in use calculation requires the entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the projects and a suitable discount rate 
in order to calculate present value. 
Production start date 
The Group assesses the stage of each mine under construction to determine when a mine moves into the production stage. The criteria used 
to assess the start date are determined based on the unique nature of each mine construction project, such as the complexity of a plant and 
its location. The Group considers various relevant criteria to assess when the mine is substantially complete, ready for its intended use and is 
reclassified from ’Assets under construction’ to ’Producing mines’ and ’Property, plant and equipment’. Some of the criteria will include, but 
are not limited to, the following: 
 > the level of capital expenditure compared to the construction cost estimates; 
 > completion of a reasonable period of testing of the mine plant and equipment; 
 > ability to produce metal in saleable form within specifications; and 
 > ability to sustain ongoing production of metal.
When a mine construction project moves into the production stage, the capitalisation of certain mine construction costs ceases and 
costs are either regarded as inventory or expensed, except for costs that qualify for capitalisation relating to mining asset additions 
or improvements, underground mine development or mineable reserve development. This is also the point at which the depreciation/
amortisation recognition commences. 
Contingencies 
By their nature, contingencies will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The assessment of contingencies 
inherently involves the exercise of significant judgement and estimates of the outcome of future events.   www.angloasianmining.com Anglo Asian Mining PLC Annual report and accounts 2011 25
3. Significant accounting policies continued
Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions continued
Mine rehabilitation provision (note 22) 
The Group assesses its mine rehabilitation provision annually. Significant estimates and assumptions are made in determining the provision 
for mine rehabilitation as there are numerous factors that will affect the ultimate liability payable. These factors include estimates of the 
extent and costs of rehabilitation activities, technological changes, regulatory changes, and changes in discount rates. Those uncertainties 
may result in future actual expenditure differing from the amounts currently provided. The provision at the consolidated statement of 
financial position date represents management’s best estimate of the present value of the future rehabilitation costs required. Changes to 
estimated future costs are recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position by either increasing or decreasing the rehabilitation 
liability and rehabilitation asset if the initial estimate was originally recognised as part of an asset measured in accordance with IAS 16 
‘Property, Plant and Equipment’. Any reduction in the rehabilitation liability and therefore any deduction from the rehabilitation asset may not 
exceed the carrying amount of that asset. If it does, any excess over the carrying value is taken immediately to the consolidated income statement. 
If the change in estimate results in an increase in the rehabilitation liability and therefore an addition to the carrying value of the asset, 
the entity is required to consider whether this is an indication of impairment of the asset as a whole and test for impairment in accordance 
with IAS 36. If, for mature mines, the revised mine assets net of rehabilitation provisions exceeds the recoverable value, that portion of the 
increase is charged directly to expense. For closed sites, changes to estimated costs are recognised immediately in the consolidated income 
statement. Also, rehabilitation obligations that arose as a result of the production phase of a mine should be expensed as incurred. 
Recovery of deferred tax assets (note 11)
Judgement is required in determining whether deferred tax assets are recognised on the consolidated statement of financial position. Deferred 
tax assets, including those arising from unutilised tax losses, require management to assess the likelihood that the Group will generate taxable 
earnings in future periods, in order to utilise recognised deferred tax assets. Estimates of future taxable income are based on forecast cash 
flows from operations and the application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction. To the extent that future cash flows and taxable income differ 
significantly from estimates, the ability of the Group to realise the net deferred tax assets recorded at the reporting date could be impacted.
Revenue recognition 
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably 
measured. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received, excluding discounts, rebates, and sales taxes or duty. 
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred, which is 
considered to occur when title passes to the customer. This generally occurs when product is physically transferred to the buyer. 
The following criteria are also met in specific revenue transactions: 
Gold bullion sales 
Revenue from gold bullion sales is brought to account when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the buyer 
and selling prices and assay results are known or can be reasonably estimated. Assay results determine content of metal in doré (gold and 
silver), the price of which is determined based on market quotations of each metal. Silver in doré bullions is treated as a by-product and is 
produced together with gold, which is the intended product and is recognised in sales revenue.
Copper concentrate sales
Contract terms for the Group’s sale of gold, silver and copper in concentrate (metal in concentrate) allow for a price adjustment based on 
final assay results of the metal in concentrate to determine the final content. Recognition of sales revenue for these commodities is based 
on the most recently determined estimate of metal in concentrate (based on initial assay results) and the spot price at the date of shipment, 
with a subsequent adjustment made upon final determination and presented as part of “Other Income”.
The terms of metal in concentrate sales contracts with third parties contain provisional pricing arrangements whereby the selling price for 
metal in concentrate is based on average prevailing spot prices during a specified future period after shipment to the customer (the 
‘quotation period’). 
The provisionally priced sales of metal in concentrate contain an embedded derivative, which is required to be separated from the host 
contract for accounting purposes. The host contract is the sale of metals in concentrate and the embedded derivative is the forward contract 
for which the provisional sale is subsequently adjusted. Accordingly the embedded derivative, which does not qualify for hedge accounting, 
is recognised at fair value, with subsequent changes in the fair value recognised in profit or loss each period until final settlement, and 
presented as ‘Other Income’. Changes in fair value over the quotation period and up until final settlement are estimated by reference to 
forward market prices for gold and copper.
Interest revenue 
Interest revenue is recognised as it accrues, using the effective interest rate method. 
Leases
The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at inception date: whether 
fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets or the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset. 
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the consolidated income statement on a straight line basis over the lease term. 
Finance leases, which transfer to the Company substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item, are 
capitalised at the commencement of the lease at the fair value of the leased property or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease 
payments. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of 
interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are recognised in the consolidated income statement. Leased assets are 
depreciated over the useful life of the asset. However, if there is no reasonable certainty that the Company will obtain ownership by the end 
of the lease term, the asset is depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset and the lease term.
The Group had no significant finance leases during 2011 and 2010. 26 Anglo Asian Mining PLC Annual report and accounts 2011 www.angloasianmining.com

Foreign currencies
The individual financial statements of each Group company are maintained in the currency of the primary economic environment in which 
it operates its functional currency. For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each 
Group Company are expressed in US Dollars, the functional currency of the Company and the presentation currency for the consolidated 
financial statements.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency 
(foreign currencies) are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each consolidated statement of 
financial position date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on 
the consolidated statement of financial position date. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency 
are not retranslated.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items and on the retranslation of monetary items are included in the 
consolidated income statement for the period. 
Taxation
Current and deferred income taxes
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the 
consolidated financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the 
balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets 
are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses. Deferred tax assets are 
recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences and the carry 
forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised. 
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised, based 
on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the consolidated statement of financial position date. Deferred 
tax is charged or credited in the Consolidated Income Statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, 
in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets are not recognised in respect of temporary differences relating to tax losses where there is insufficient evidence that the 
asset will be recovered. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each consolidated statement of financial position date and are 
recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
The Group recognises neither the deferred tax asset regarding the temporary difference on the rehabilitation liability, nor the corresponding 
deferred tax liability regarding the temporary difference on the rehabilitation asset.
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the consolidated income 
statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are 
never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted 
at the consolidated statement of financial position date.
Value-added taxes (‘VAT’)
The Group pays VAT on purchases made in both the Republic of Azerbaijan and the UK. Under both jurisdictions, VAT paid is refundable. 
Azerbaijani jurisdiction permits offset of Azerbaijani VAT credit against other taxes payable to the state budget.
Transactions with related parties
For the purposes of these financial statements, parties are considered to be related if one party has the ability to control the other party or 
exercise significant influence over the other party in making financial or operational decisions. In considering each possible related party 
relationship, attention is directed to the substance of the relationship, not merely the legal form.
Related parties may enter into transactions which unrelated parties might not, and transactions between related parties may not be effected 
on the same terms, conditions and amounts as transactions between unrelated parties.
It is the nature of transactions with related parties that they cannot be presumed to be carried out on an arm’s length basis.
Borrowing costs 
Borrowing costs directly relating to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying capital project under construction are 
capitalised and added to the project cost during construction until such time the assets are considered substantially ready for their intended 
use i.e. when they are capable of commercial production. Where funds are borrowed specifically to finance a project, the amount capitalised 
represents the actual borrowing costs incurred. Where surplus funds are available for a short term out of money borrowed specifically to 
finance a project, the income generated from the temporary investment of such amounts is also capitalised and deducted from the total 
capitalised borrowing cost. Where the funds used to finance a project form part of general borrowings, the amount capitalised is calculated 
using a weighted average of rates applicable to relevant general borrowings of the Group during the period. All other borrowing costs are 
recognised in the consolidated income statement in the period in which they are incurred. 
Even though exploration and evaluation assets can be qualifying assets, they generally do not meet the ‘probable economic benefits’ test. 
Any related borrowing costs are therefore generally recognised in the consolidated income statement in the period they are incurred.   www.angloasianmining.com Anglo Asian Mining PLC Annual report and accounts 2011 27
3. Significant accounting policies continued
Intangible assets 
Exploration and evaluation assets
The costs of exploration properties and leases, which include the cost of acquiring prospective properties and exploration rights and costs 
incurred in exploration and evaluation activities, are capitalised as intangible assets as part of exploration and evaluation assets.
Exploration and evaluation assets are carried forward during the exploration and evaluation stage and are assessed for impairment 
in accordance with the indicators of impairment as set out in IFRS 6 ‘Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources’. 
In circumstances where a property is abandoned, the cumulative capitalised costs relating to the property are written off in the period. 
No amortisation is charged prior to the commencement of production. 
Once commercially viable reserves are established and development is sanctioned, exploration and evaluation assets are tested for 
impairment and transferred to ‘Assets under construction’.
Upon transfer of ‘Exploration and evaluation costs’ into ‘Assets under construction’, all subsequent expenditure on the construction, 
installation or completion of infrastructure facilities is capitalised within ‘Assets under construction’. 
When commercial production commences, exploration, evaluation and development costs previously capitalised are amortised over the 
commercial reserves of the mining property on a units-of-production basis.
‘Exploration and evaluation costs’ incurred after commercial production start date in relation to evaluation of potential mineral reserves and 
resources that is expected to result in increase of reserves are capitalised as ’Evaluation and exploration assets’ within ‘intangible assets’. 
Once there is evidence that reserves are increased, such costs are tested for impairment and transferred to ‘Producing mines’. 
Mining rights
Mining rights are carried at cost to the Group less any provisions for impairments which result from evaluations and assessments of 
potential mineral recoveries and accumulated depletion. Mining rights are depleted on the units-of-production basis over the total reserves 
of the relevant area.
Other intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business 
combination is its fair value as at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any 
accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. Internally generated intangible assets, excluding capitalised 
development costs, are not capitalised and expenditure is reflected in the consolidated income statement in the year in which the 
expenditure is incurred.
The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as either finite or indefinite.
Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over the useful economic life and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication 
that the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite useful 
life is reviewed at least at each financial year end. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future 
economic benefits embodied in the asset is accounted for by changing the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as 
changes in accounting estimates. The amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognised in the consolidated income 
statement in the expense category consistent with the function of the intangible asset.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortised, but are tested for impairment annually, either individually or at the cash 
generating unit level. The assessment of indefinite life is reviewed annually to determine whether the indefinite life continues to be 
supportable. If not, the change in useful life from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis. 
Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the 
carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the consolidated income statement when the asset is derecognised.
Property, plant and equipment and mine properties 
Development expenditure is net of proceeds from all but the incidental sale of ore extracted during the development phase. 
Upon completion of mine construction, the assets initially charged to Assets in course of construction are transferred into ‘Plant and 
equipment’ or ‘Producing mines’. Items of ‘Plant and equipment’ and ‘Producing mines’ are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation 
and accumulated impairment losses. 
During the production period expenditures directly attributable to the construction of each individual asset are capitalised as ‘Assets’ in 
course of construction up to the period when asset is ready to be put into operation. When an asset is put into operation it is transferred to 
‘Plant and equipment’ or ‘Producing mines’. Additional capitalised costs performed subsequent to the date of commencement of operation 
of the asset are charged directly to ‘Plant and equipment’ or ‘Producing mines’ i.e. where the asset itself was transferred.
The initial cost of an asset comprises its purchase price or construction cost, any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset into 
operation, the initial estimate of the rehabilitation obligation, and for qualifying assets, borrowing costs. The purchase price or construction 
cost is the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset. 
When a mine construction project moves into the production stage, the capitalisation of certain mine construction costs ceases and costs are 
either regarded as inventory or expensed, except for costs which qualify for capitalisation relating to mining asset additions or improvements, 
underground mine development or mineable reserve development.  28 Anglo Asian Mining PLC Annual report and accounts 2011 www.angloasianmining.com

Depreciation/amortisation 
Accumulated mine development costs within producing mines are depreciated/amortised on a units-of-production basis over the 
economically recoverable reserves of the mine concerned, except in the case of assets whose useful life is shorter than the life of the mine, 
in which case the straight line method is applied. The unit of account for run of mines (‘ROM’) costs and for post-ROM costs are recoverable 
ounces of gold. The units-of-production rate for the depreciation/amortisation of mine development costs takes into account expenditures 
incurred to date. 
The premium paid in excess of the intrinsic value of land to gain access is amortised over the life of mine. 
Other plant and equipment such as mobile mine equipment is generally depreciated on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
as follows: 
 > Temporary buildings –  eight years 
 > Plant and equipment –  eight years 
 > Motor vehicles – four years 
 > Office equipment –  four years 
 > Leasehold improvements –  eight years 
An item of property, plant and equipment, and any significant part initially recognised, is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic 
benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net 
disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the consolidated income statement when the asset is derecognised. 
The asset’s residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation/amortisation are reviewed at each reporting period and adjusted 
prospectively if appropriate. 
Major maintenance and repairs 
Expenditure on major maintenance refits or repairs comprises the cost of replacement assets or parts of assets and overhaul costs. 
Where an asset or part of an asset that was separately depreciated and is now written off is replaced, and it is probable that future economic 
benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group through an extended life, the expenditure is capitalised. 
Where part of the asset was not separately considered as a component, the replacement value is used to estimate the carrying amount 
of the replaced assets which is immediately written off. All other day-to-day maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets 
The Group conducts annual internal assessments of the carrying values of tangible and intangible assets. The carrying values of capitalised 
exploration and evaluation expenditure, mine properties and property, plant and equipment are assessed for impairment when indicators 
of such impairment exist or at least annually. In such cases an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount is calculated. The recoverable 
amount is determined as the higher of the fair value less costs to sell for the asset and the asset’s value in use. This is determined for an 
individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. 
If this is the case, the individual assets are grouped together into cash-generating units (‘CGUs’) for impairment purposes. Such CGUs 
represent the lowest level for which there are separately identifiable cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash flows from other 
assets or other groups of assets. This generally results in the Group evaluating its non-financial assets on a geographical or licence basis. 
If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is impaired and an impairment loss is charged to the 
consolidated income statement so as to reduce the carrying amount to its recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of fair value less cost 
to sell and value in use). 
Impairment losses related to continuing operations are recognised in the consolidated income statement in those expense categories 
consistent with the function of the impaired asset. 
For assets excluding the intangibles referred to above, an assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication 
that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such indication exists, the Group makes an 
estimate of the recoverable amount. 
A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable 
amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. If this is the case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable 
amount. The increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, 
had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. 
Impairment losses recognised in relation to indefinite life intangibles are not reversed for subsequent increases in its recoverable amount. 
Provisions
General
Provisions are recognised when (a) the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, and (b) it is probable 
that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of 
the amount of the obligation. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that 
reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage 
of time is recognised as a finance cost.  www.angloasianmining.com Anglo Asian Mining PLC Annual report and accounts 2011 29

Provisions continued
Rehabilitation provision
The Group records the present value of estimated costs of legal and constructive obligations required to restore operating locations 
in the period in which the obligation is incurred. The nature of these restoration activities includes dismantling and removing structures, 
rehabilitating mines and tailings dams, dismantling operating facilities, closure of plant and waste sites, and restoration, reclamation 
and re-vegetation of affected areas. 
The obligation generally arises when the asset is installed or the ground/environment is disturbed at the production location. When the 
liability is initially recognised, the present value of the estimated cost is capitalised by increasing the carrying amount of the related mining 
assets to the extent that it was incurred prior to the production of related ore. Over time, the discounted liability is increased for the change 
in present value based on the discount rates that reflect current market assessments and the risks specific to the liability. 
The periodic unwinding of the discount is recognised in the consolidated income statement as a finance cost. Additional disturbances or changes 
in rehabilitation costs will be recognised as additions or charges to the corresponding assets and rehabilitation liability when they occur . 
For closed sites, changes to estimated costs are recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement. 
Financial assets
Initial recognition and measurement
Financial assets within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, 
held-to-maturity investments, available-for-sale financial assets, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, 
as appropriate. The Group determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition. All financial assets are recognised initially 
at fair value.
Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or convention in the 
marketplace (regular way trades) are recognised on the trade date, i.e. the date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.
The Group’s financial assets include cash and short-term deposits as well as trade and other receivables.
Subsequent measurement
The subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their classification:
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. 
After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less 
impairment. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fee or costs that are an integral 
part of the effective interest rate method. The effective interest rate method amortisation is included in finance income in the consolidated 
income statement. The losses arising from impairment are recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Derecognition
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset) is derecognised when:
 > the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired; or
 > the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows 
in full without material delay to a third party under a “pass-through” arrangement; and either (a) the Group has transferred substantially 
all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the 
asset, but has transferred control of the asset.
Impairment of financial assets
The Group assesses at each consolidated statement of financial position date whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset 
or a group of financial assets is impaired. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is deemed to be impaired if, and only if, there is 
objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that have occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (an incurred 
‘loss event’) and that loss event has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or the group of financial assets that 
can be reliably estimated. Evidence of impairment may include indications that the debtors or a group of debtors is experiencing significant 
financial difficulty, default or delinquency in interest or principal payments, the probability that they will enter bankruptcy or other financial 
reorganisation and where observable data indicate that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows, such as changes 
in arrears or economic conditions that correlate with defaults.
Financial assets carried at amortised cost
For financial assets carried at amortised cost, the Group first assesses individually whether objective evidence of impairment exists 
individually for financial assets that are individually significant, or collectively for financial assets that are not individually significant. If the 
Group determines that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, whether significant or not, 
it includes the asset in a group of financial assets with similar credit risk characteristics and collectively assesses them for impairment. 
Assets that are individually assessed for impairment and for which an impairment loss is, or continues to be, recognised are not included 
in a collective assessment of impairment.
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s 
carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future expected credit losses that have not yet been 
incurred). The present value of the estimated future cash flows is discounted at the financial assets original effective interest rate. 30 Anglo Asian Mining PLC Annual report and accounts 2011 www.angloasianmining.com

Financial liabilities
Initial recognition and measurement
Financial liabilities within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, loans and borrowings, 
or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate. The Group determines the classification of its 
financial liabilities at initial recognition. All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and in the case of loans and borrowings, 
plus directly attributable transaction costs. The Group’s financial liabilities include trade and other payables, contractual provisions and 
loans and borrowings.
Subsequent measurement
The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification as follows:
Trade and other payables and contractual provisions
Trade and other payables are initially measured at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
rate method.
Loans and borrowings
Interest-bearing loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct transaction costs. Finance charges, including 
premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accrual basis and charged to the 
consolidated income statement using the effective interest method. They are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent 
that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
After initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate 
method. Gains and losses are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through 
the effective interest rate method amortisation process. 
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fee or costs that are an integral part of the 
effective interest rate method. The effective interest rate method amortisation is included in finance cost in the consolidated income statement.
Derecognition
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.
When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing 
liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition 
of a new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Non-current prepayments
Advances made to suppliers for fixed asset purchases are recognised as non-current prepayments until the time when fixed assets are supplied. 
Inventories 
Metal in circuit consists of in-circuit material at properties with milling or processing operations and doré awaiting refinement, all valued at 
the lower of average cost and net realisable value. In-process inventory costs consist of direct production costs, including mining, crushing 
and processing; site administration costs; and allocated indirect costs, including depreciation, depletion and amortisation of producing mines 
and mining interests. 
Ore stockpiles consist of stockpiled ore, ore on surface and crushed ore, all valued at the lower of average cost and net realisable value. 
Ore stockpile costs consist of direct costs including mining, crushing, site administration costs; and allocated indirect costs, including 
depreciation, depletion and amortisation of producing mines and mining interests.
Inventory costs are charged to operations on the basis of ounces of gold sold. The Group regularly evaluates and refines estimates used 
in determining the costs charged to operations and costs absorbed into inventory carrying values based upon actual gold recoveries and 
operating plans. 
Finished goods consists of doré bars and metal in concentrate that have been refined and assayed and are in a form that allows them to be 
sold on international bullion markets. Finished goods are valued at the lower of average cost and net realisable value. Finished goods costs 
consist of direct production costs, including mining, crushing and processing; site administration costs; and allocated indirect costs, 
including depreciation, depletion and amortisation of producing mines and mining interests. 
Spare parts and consumables consists of consumables used in operations, such as fuel, chemicals, reagents and spare parts, valued at the 
lower of average cost and replacement cost and, where appropriate, less a provision for obsolescence. 
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs, or value of services received net 
of any issue costs.   www.angloasianmining.com Anglo Asian Mining PLC Annual report and accounts 2011 31
3. Significant accounting policies continued
Deferred stripping costs 
Stripping costs incurred in the development of a mine before production commences are capitalised as part of the cost of constructing the 
mine and subsequently amortised over the life of the mine on a units-of-production basis. 
Stripping costs incurred subsequently during the production stage of its operation are deferred for those operations where this is the most 
appropriate basis for matching the cost against the related economic benefits and the effect is material. This is generally the case where 
there are fluctuations in stripping costs over the life of the mine. The amount of stripping costs deferred is based on the strip ratio obtained 
by dividing the tonnage of waste mined either by the quantity of ore mined or by the quantity of minerals contained in the ore. Stripping costs 
incurred in the period are deferred to the extent that the current period ratio exceeds the life of the mine strip ratio. Such deferred costs are 
then charged to the consolidated income statement to the extent that, in subsequent periods, the current period ratio falls short of the life of 
mine (or pit) ratio. The life of mine (or pit) ratio is based on economically recoverable reserves of the mine (or pit). Changes are accounted for 
prospectively, from the date of the change. 
Deferred stripping costs are included as part of ‘Producing mines’. These form part of the total investment in the relevant cash-generating 
units, which are reviewed for impairment if events or changes of circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. 
Employee leave benefits
Liabilities for wages and salaries, including non-monetary benefits and accrued but unused annual leave are recognised in respect of 
employees’ services up to the reporting date. They are measured at the amounts expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled. 
Retirement benefit costs
The Group does not operate a pension scheme for the benefit of its employees but instead makes contributions to their personal pension 
policies. The contributions due for the period are charged to the consolidated income statement.
Share-based payments
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payment’. IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair 
value (excluding the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the 
equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares 
that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured by use of the Black-Scholes model. The expected life used in the model has been applied based on management’s 
best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations. The vesting conditions assumptions 
are reviewed during each reporting period to ensure they reflect current expectations. 
Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications have been made to the amounts disclosed in prior year consolidated financial statements. There was no impact 
on the Group’s financial position, results of operations and equity as a result of these reclassifications.
4. Segment information
The operations of the Group are all located within the Republic of Azerbaijan. The Group has one producing asset: its gold and copper mine 
in Gedabek. All sales of gold and silver bullions are made to one customer, the Group’s gold refinery, MKS Finance SA, based in Switzerland. 
Copper concentrate is sold to two customers – Seagate Minerals and Metals Inc and Glencore International AG. Management of the Group 
does not segment the business when evaluating its performance.
5. Revenue
The Group’s revenue consists of bullion and copper concentrate sold to third-party customers. Revenue from sales of gold and silver bullion 
was US$77,561,807 and US$1,194,842 respectively (2010: US$71,236,994 and US$775,549). Revenue from sales of copper concentrate was 
US$4,996,662 (2010: US$ nil). 
Finance income of US$51,000 in 2011 represents cash deposit interest received during the year (2010: US$ nil).
6. Other operating expenses and income
Other operating expenses consist of metal processing costs, profit/loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment, depreciation 
of rehabilitation cost, foreign currency exchange net loss and miscellaneous operating expenses.
Other operating income relates to the income generated as a result of unwinding of a provision during 2011 and 2010. 32 Anglo Asian Mining PLC Annual report and accounts 2011 www.angloasianmining.com

Interest on interest-bearing loans and borrowings represents charges incurred on credit facilities with the International Bank of Azerbaijan 
(‘IBA’) and a loan from Mr. Reza Vaziri, a Director and CEO of the Group. 
Effective 1 October 2011 the interest rate on credit facilities obtained from IBA was revised from 15% per annum to 12% per annum.
Interest on the loan from Mr. Reza Vaziri was 8% per annum (2010: 8%). The loan from Mr. Reza Vaziri has been fully repaid during 2011.
The credit facilities were provided for the purpose of constructing and developing the Gedabek gold mine, additions in working capital and 
paying for interest on loans. 
Where a portion of the loans has been used to finance the construction and purchase of assets of the Group, the interest on that portion 
of the loans has been capitalised up until the time the assets were substantially ready for use (note 14).
11. Taxation
Corporation tax is calculated at 32% (as stipulated in the PSA for RVIG in the Republic of Azerbaijan, the entity that contributes most significant 
portion of profit before tax in the Group consolidated financial statements) of the estimated assessable profit for the year . Taxation for other 
jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions. Deferred income taxes arising in RVIG are recognised and fully 
disclosed in these consolidated financial statements. The Group has fully utilised tax losses available in RVIG during 2011.

Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset for deferred taxes recognised for RVIG since there is a legally enforceable right to set off 
current tax assets against current tax liabilities and they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends 
to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis in the Republic of Azerbaijan.
At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of US$6,813,064 (2010: US$20,053,271) available for offset against future profits. 
Unused tax losses in the Republic of Azerbaijan brought forward from prior years were fully utilised during 2011. No deferred tax assets have 
been recognised in respect of jurisdictions other than the Republic of Azerbaijan due to the uncertainty of future profit streams. 
12. Earnings per share
The basic earnings per share of 16.91 cents (2010: 13.88 cents) has been based on a weighted average number of shares in issue of 
110,993,882 (2010: 109,765,126) and a net income of US$18,772,459 (2010: US$15,237,443).
Dilutive earnings per share is 16.47 cents for 2011 (2010: 13.37 cents). Dilutive earnings per share has been based on 113,970,224, the 
weighted average number of shares determined based on the dilutive effects of 2,826,684 share options exercisable as of 31 December 2011 
and 275,000 share options not vested by 31 December 2011.

work including reclamation costs, close down and pollution control are made on an ongoing basis, based on the estimated life of the mine. 
This represents the net present value of the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation to rehabilitate environmental 
disturbances caused by mining operations (US$4,043,836 undiscounted liability for 2011 and US$2,110,669 undiscounted liability for 2010, 
discounted using a risk-free rate of 6.83% for 2011 and 5.00% for 2010).
Expenditure on restoration and rehabilitation is expected to commence in 2018. 
23. Financial instruments
Financial risk management objectives and policies
The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise cash and cash equivalents, loans and letters of credit. The main purpose of these 
financial instruments is to finance the Group operations. The Group has other financial instruments, such as trade and other receivables 
and trade and other payables, which arise directly from its operations. Surplus cash within the Group is put on deposit, the objective being 
to maximise returns on such funds whilst ensuring that the short-term cash flow requirements of the Group are met.
The main risks that could adversely affect the Group’s financial assets, liabilities or future cash flows are commodity price risk, cash flow 
interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. Management reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these 
risks which are summarised below.
The following discussion also includes a sensitivity analysis that is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in market variables on the 
Group’s financial instruments and show the impact on profit or loss and shareholders’ equity, where applicable. Financial instruments 
affected by market risk include bank loans and overdrafts, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities.
The sensitivity has been prepared for the years ended 31 December 2011 and 2010 using the amounts of debt and other financial assets and 
liabilities held as at those reporting dates.
Capital risk management
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 21, cash and cash equivalents and equity 
attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued share capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the consolidated 
statement of changes in equity. The Group has sufficient capital to fund ongoing production and exploration activities, with capital 
requirements reviewed by the Board on a regular basis. Capital has been sourced through share issues on AIM, part of the London Stock 
Exchange, and loans from the IBA, other Azerbaijani banks and its CEO, Mr. Reza Vaziri. In managing its capital, the Group’s primary 
objective once production has commenced is to ensure its continued ability to provide a consistent return for its equity shareholders through 
capital growth. In order to achieve this objective the Group seeks to maintain a gearing ratio that balances risk and returns at an acceptable 
level and also to maintain a sufficient funding base to enable the Group to meet its working capital and strategic investment needs. 
The Group is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements. The Group monitors capital using a gearing ratio, which is net debt 
divided by total capital plus net debt. The Group’s policy is to keep the gearing ratio below 70%. The Group includes within net debt 
interest-bearing loans and borrowings, trade and other payables, less cash and cash equivalents. 38 Anglo Asian Mining PLC Annual report and accounts 2011 www.angloasianmining.com

Gearing ratio      4% 31%
Interest rate risk management
The Group’s cash and cash equivalents are not subject to interest. All letters of credit, borrowings and interest-bearing loans of the Group 
are at a fixed rate of interest. The Group manages the risk by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings, 
with approval from the Directors required for all new borrowing facilities.
The Group has not used any interest rate swaps or other instruments to manage its interest rate profile during 2011.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for financial instruments at the consolidated 
statement of financial position date. A 50 basis point increase or decrease is used when reporting interest rate risk internally to key 
management personnel and represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates.
The increase/decrease in the discount rate by 50 points results in an increase in the rehabilitation provision by US$88,361 and a decrease 
of US$92,368, respectively.
All borrowings have been made at fixed interest rates through the entirety of the repayment period.
Liquidity risk management
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board, which has built an appropriate liquidity risk management 
framework for the management of the Group’s short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements. The Group 
manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities by continuously monitoring 
forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial liabilities. Included in note 21 is a description of additional 
undrawn facilities that the Group has at its disposal to further reduce liquidity risk. 
The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted payments.

Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. 
The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets is represented by their carrying value as at the consolidated statement 
of financial position date. 
The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy banks. Trade receivables consist of amounts due to the Group from sales 
of gold and silver. All sales of gold-silver bullions are made to MKS Finance SA, a Switzerland-based gold refinery and copper concentrates 
to Seagate Minerals and Metals and Glencore International AG. Due to the nature of the customers, the Board does not feel that a significant 
credit risk exists for receipt of revenues. The Board continually reviews the possibilities of selling gold to alternative customers and also the 
requirement for additional measures to mitigate any potential credit risk.   www.angloasianmining.com Anglo Asian Mining PLC Annual report and accounts 2011 39
23. Financial instruments continued
Foreign currency risk management
The presentational currency of the Group is US Dollars. The Group is exposed to currency risk due to movements in foreign currencies 
relative to the US Dollar affecting foreign currency transactions and balances.
The carrying amounts of the Group’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date are as follows:
    Liabilities  Assets

Other    154,226 41,278 8,126 39,473
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
The Group is mainly exposed to the currency of the United Kingdom (UK Sterling) and the currency of the Republic of Azerbaijan 
(Azerbaijan Manats).
The following table details the Group’s sensitivity to a 12.50% and 5.09% (2010: 20.00%) increase and decrease in the US Dollar against 
UK sterling and Azerbaijan Manat, respectively. These are the sensitivity rates used when reporting foreign currency risk internally to key 
management personnel and represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates. The 
sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end 
for respective change in foreign currency rates. A positive number below indicates an increase in profit and other equity where the US Dollar 
strengthens by mentioned rates against the relevant currency. Weakening of the US Dollar against the relevant currency, would have an 
equal and opposite impact on the profit and other equity, and the balances below would be reversed.

Effect on profit before tax    2,871  15,513 178,233 563,559
Market risk
The Group’s activities primarily expose it to the financial risks of changes in gold, silver and copper prices which have a direct impact on 
revenues. The Board monitors both the spot and forward price of these regularly and now that production is becoming more reliable will 
review the possibility of using forward contracts and derivative financial instruments to manage this risk. 
A 10% decrease in gold price would result in a reduction in revenue of US$7,837,462 and a 10% increase in gold prices would result in an 
increase in revenue of US$7,837,462. A 10% decrease in silver price would result in a reduction in revenue of US$366,452 and a 10% increase 
in silver prices would result in an increase in revenue of US$366,452. A 10% decrease in copper price would result in a reduction in revenue 
of US$171,417 and a 10% increase in copper prices would result in an increase in revenue of US$171,417.

Merger reserve
The merger reserve was created in accordance with the merger relief provisions under Section 612 of the Companies Act 2006 (as amended) 
relating to accounting for Group reconstructions involving the issue of shares at a premium. In preparing Group consolidated financial 
statements, the amount by which the base value of the consideration for the shares allotted exceeded the aggregate nominal value of those 
shares was recorded within a merger reserve on consolidation, rather than in the share premium account.
Accumulated loss
Accumulated loss represents the cumulative loss of the Group attributable to the equity shareholders.

Equity-settled share options
The Group operates a share option scheme for Directors and senior employees of the Group. Options are granted at a price agreed at 
the time of the grant. The vesting periods are up to three years. Options are exercisable at a price equal to the closing quoted market price 
of the Group’s shares on the date of the Board approval to grant options. Options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group and the 
options are not exercised within three months from leaving date. Details of the share options outstanding during the year are as follows:

Independent auditor’s report
to the members of Anglo Asian Mining PLC
We have audited the parent company financial statements of for the year ended 31 December 2011 which comprise the Company Balance 
Sheet and the related notes 1 to 14. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our 
audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an 
auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other 
than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 15, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of 
the parent company financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express 
an opinion on the parent company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance 
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the parent company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial 
statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Directors’ Report to identify material inconsistencies 
with the audited financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the parent company financial statements:
 > give a true and fair view of the state of the company’s affairs as at 31 December 2011;
 > have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
 > have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared 
is consistent with the parent company financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
 > adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or
 > the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
 > certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
 > we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements of Anglo Asian Mining plc for the year ended 31 December 2011.

Notes to the Company financial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2011
1. Significant accounting policies and going concern
Going concern
The Directors have formed a judgement which assumes at the time of approving these financial statements that the amounts owed by the 
subsidiary undertakings will be recoverable and that it is appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis.
Significant accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The parent company financial statements of Anglo Asian Mining PLC (the ‘Company’) are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006 
and were approved for issue on 22 May 2012.
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention and are prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice.
No profit and loss account is presented by the Company as permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 and the Company has taken 
the exemption under FRS 1 not to present a cash flow statement.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in paragraph 2D of FRS 29 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ and has not disclosed 
information required by that standard, as the Group’s consolidated financial statements, in which the Company is included, provide 
equivalent disclosures for the Group under IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption under FRS 8 not to disclose transactions with wholly owned subsidiaries.
Tangible assets
Tangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Such cost included costs directly 
attributable to making the asset capable of operating as intended. 
Depreciation is provided on cost in annual instalments over the estimated useful lives of assets which are reviewed annually. The tangible 
assets mainly represented by office and computer equipment are depreciated on a straight line basis over four years.
The carrying values of tangible fixed assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying 
amount may not be recoverable.
Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less, where appropriate, provisions for impairment. Impairment is tested annually by 
comparing the net assets of the underlying subsidiary to the carrying value of the investment, with any short fall provided for during 
the period. 
Leased assets
Rentals where substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership remain with the lessor are charged to the profit and loss account 
on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Debtors
Debtors are recognised and carried at the lower of their original invoiced value and recoverable amount. Provision is made when there 
is objective evidence that the Company will not be able to recover the balances in full.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax assets are not recognised in respect of timing differences relating to tax losses where there is insufficient evidence that the 
asset will be recovered.
Share-based payments
The Company has applied the requirements of FRS 20 ‘Share-based Payment’ from 1 January 2006. In accordance with the transitional 
provisions, FRS 20 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2006. 
Application of this standard has been applied retrospectively.
The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair 
value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight line 
basis over the vesting period, based on the Company’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of the Black-Scholes pricing model. The expected lives used in the model have been adjusted, based on 
management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
2. Loss attributable to members of the parent company
The loss dealt with in the financial statements of the parent company is US$1,064,083 (2010: US$716,472). 46 Anglo Asian Mining PLC Annual report and accounts 2011 www.angloasianmining.com

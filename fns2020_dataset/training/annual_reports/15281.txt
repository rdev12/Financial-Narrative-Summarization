Dividend
The Board has recommended an 
increased ﬁnal dividend of 3.6p per 
share, making a total dividend for the 
year of 6.0p. The full year dividend of 
6.0p represents an increase of 9.1% 
over the previous year, and a dividend 
cover of 3.5 times, on track with  
the Board’s commitment to reduce  
dividend cover to three times by 2015.
Safety, health and environment
The Group is committed to the 
continuous improvement of its 
performance in respect of safety,  
health and the environment. I am 
pleased that almost all of the metrics 
that we measure in this area showed 
good improvement over the prior year. 
People
The Group has achieved a great deal 
in recent years with its transformation 
to a focused specialty aqueous polymers 
business. None of this could have been 
achieved without the hard work and 
dedication of the Group’s employees 
and I thank all of them for their support 
and hard work during this period.
Board composition
I am delighted that Brendan Connolly 
joined the Board as an Independent 
Non-executive Director on 20 January 
2014. Brendan was, until June 2013, 
a senior executive at Intertek Group PLC 
and had previously been Chief Executive 
Ofﬁcer of Moody International (which 
was acquired by Intertek in 2011).  
Prior to Intertek, Brendan spent more 
than 25 years of his career with 
Schlumberger in senior international 
roles over three continents.
Outlook
Whilst European macroeconomic 
indicators have started to show some 
more positive trends, we still see limited 
evidence of a sustained improvement 
in trading conditions in Europe. We have 
seen some signs of modest demand 
improvement in our European 
Construction & Coatings, Functional 
Polymers and Performance Polymers 
Overview
The Group experienced another 
challenging year in 2013. The economic 
environment in Europe continued  
to impact our trading performance, 
leading to a modest decline in  
earnings for the year. While this is a 
disappointment after several years of 
continuous improvement, the Board 
believes the overall result demonstrates 
the Group’s resilience in the context of 
the economic conditions. The underlying 
performance reﬂects the beneﬁts of 
Synthomer’s transition over the last 
5 years into a major player in specialty 
aqueous polymers.
Full year performance
Underlying Group sales declined  
5.1% to £1,054.9 million (2012  
£1 , 1 11 .8 million) with Group volumes 
slightly up, despite a 2.5% decline 
in Europe due to the effect of the 
challenging trading environment. 
Underlying Group operating proﬁt for  
the year was £104.8 million (2012 
£111.2 million), a 5.8% decline on 2012. 
This was due principally to operating 
proﬁt in our European & North American 
(ENA) business being 10% down on the 
prior year at £89.8 million, where, for the 
ﬁrst time in 6 years we saw our average 
cash margins decline. Encouragingly, 
Asia and ROW business (ARW) proﬁts 
rose by 21% to £23.1 million, as the 
market conditions we experienced in 
our nitrile business in 2012 recovered 
ahead of our initial expectations.
Underlying Group proﬁt before tax  
was £90.1 million (2012 £94.6 million), 
a decline of 4.8%, whilst earnings  
per share at 20.7p (2012 20.9p)  
was down by 1.0%. After deducting 
special items IFRS proﬁt before tax  
was £59.1 million (2012 £58.8 million).
Strategy
Our strategy remains unchanged, 
focusing on delivering growth through 
geographic expansion in emerging 
markets, where mega-trends such  
as population growth, urbanisation  
and increasing wealth are driving 
demand for our products across the 
region. In these high-growth regions,  
we are able to leverage the leading 
technologies, R&D and manufacturing 
capabilities which we have developed 
in European markets to give us a strong 
competitive advantage. We have worked 
hard to optimise our business in Europe 
since the PolymerLatex acquisition  
and ongoing cost management remains 
a key focus of the Group, particularly  
in the current economic environment.
Given the economic situation in Europe, 
we are taking some self-help actions in 
our European business. We have set in 
progress a programme to reduce costs 
by ¤10 million. This programme will have 
a cash cost of some ¤15 million, of which 
¤5 million will be capital expenditure.
Despite the weaker trading conditions 
in Europe, our business remains  
highly cash generative, allowing us to 
continue to invest in emerging market 
opportunities. During the year we 
commissioned our new 70,000 tonne 
nitrile latex capacity expansion in Pasir 
Gudang, Malaysia and also established 
SBR manufacturing capability on the 
site. We expanded our Middle East 
facilities, and will further expand them 
during 2014, along with bringing new 
capacity in Vietnam on stream. 
Additionally, we continue to look  
for further investment opportunities  
to expand our footprint in Asia.
Balance sheet
Net debt, at £133.6 million, was 
£22.2 million lower than the start  
of the year. This represents a net 
borrowing to EBITDA ratio of 1.1,  
which the Board considers to be 
a prudent leverage position.
Chairman’s statement Overview
Synthomer plc Annual Report 2013  03  
segments in recent months. However, 
we have entered 2014 with unit cash 
margins across the ENA business slightly 
below the 2013 average, and weakening 
of the Euro through the second half of 
2013 will create a year-on-year drag.
We expect some further improvement 
in Asia as the supply demand position 
in Nitrile tightens and Synthomer 
continues to beneﬁt from additional 
capacity and investment.
The Board remains conﬁdent that 
Synthomer is well placed for the future 
despite the European trading conditions.

Developing greener products
The trend to make products more 
sustainable by using renewable raw 
materials is irreversible and applies to 
almost all industrial markets, no matter 
how mature they are. Synthomer has 
developed a new range of SBR/bio-polymer 
hybrids that not only provide improved 
environmental aspects, but also give the 
opportunity of optimising the cost-
performance balance in the use of the 
emulsion products. The technology is 
applicable to a wide range of application 
areas and, working with suppliers of bio-
polymers and our customers, we have 
an active R&D programme looking at 
the commercial exploitation of the 
new materials.
During 2013, the ﬁrst two new products 
using this technology have been launched 
for use in the paper market. The grades in 
the Litex PX range have been developed 
as pre-coat and top coat binder systems 
for coated paper and board applications. 
These products demonstrate excellent 
stability and runnability on high speed paper 
coating lines, whilst maintaining print 
performance of the ﬁnal paper.
Investment in our Oulu, Finland facility 
has been completed to allow the consistent 
and efﬁcient production of the bio-polymer 
hybrids, with full production starting in 
October 2013. The second phase of 
investment is now underway in our Marl, 
Germany facility to allow the transfer of 
technology for the production of the  
emulsions in the second half of 2014  
for both the paper market and other 
applications segments.

Divisional performance
We manage the Group as two 
businesses: ‘Europe & North America’ 
(ENA) and ‘Asia & Rest of World’  
(ARW). The reported results are on  
an ‘origination basis’, meaning the 
business sales and operating proﬁts are 
reported based on where the product is 
manufactured; ENA accounted for 71% 
of Group sales and ARW for 29% of 
Group sales. We export many specialty 
products from Europe to Asia. Looking 
at sales on a destination basis, ENA 
comprises 63% of Group sales with 
ARW accounting for 37%. Within the 
two businesses, we approach the 
market through six strategic business 
unit segments, “Paper” , “Carpet, 
Compounds and Foam” (CCF), 
“Construction and Coatings” (CC), 
“Functional Polymers” (FP), 
“Performance Polymers” (PP) and 
“Health and Protection” (HP) – which 
includes our Asian nitrile Latex business.
Europe & North America (ENA)
Operating proﬁt in our ENA business 
was down by 10.4%, with aggregate 
volumes 2.5% lower.
The economic situation in Europe 
continued to impact demand, 
particularly in our Construction related 
segments, which was most pronounced 
early in the year, when poor weather 
resulted in soft demand in what is 
normally a seasonally strong period.  
We have also seen a reduction in 
average unit cash margins.
This margin impact has been most 
pronounced in our Paper and CCF 
segments, whilst declines in CC, 
PP and FP were very modest.
Volumes for the year were lower across 
the construction related segments  
of CC, PP , FP and CCF . Despite the 
overall decline in the European paper 
market, we saw some volume 
improvement in our Paper segment, 
increasing our share overall, albeit  
on generally lower unit cash margins.
Overview
2013 was a challenging year for the 
Group, with underlying Group operating 
proﬁt of £104.8 million, 5.8% below 
prior year.
The general economic situation in 
Europe, with lower demand led to 
a lower ENA operating proﬁt. As we 
entered 2014 the operating environment  
in Europe remained challenging. 
Encouragingly, we saw recovery  
in our Asian Nitrile business come 
through ahead of our expectations  
in 2013, and overall operating proﬁt  
in Asia and ROW was ahead.
Net of interest, and a reduced tax rate, 
earnings were down slightly on 2012.
This was the ﬁrst year that underlying 
earnings have declined since 2006, 
when we started the process of 
transforming the Company into a 
focused specialty aqueous polymers 
business. Whilst this was disappointing, 
we continued to make good overall 
progress during the year in improving 
the capability of the business to deliver 
future growth and maintain a tight 
control on costs. 
The acquisition of PolymerLatex three 
years ago was an important part of  
the transformation of the Group into  
a focused specialty aqueous polymer 
group. We have now effectively 
completed the work on delivering  
the integration synergies from the 
acquisition with the closure of the  
Batley site in the UK.
During the year we further strengthened 
the Group’s Executive Management 
team with the recruitment of new 
regional VP’s for both Asia and Europe.
I believe we are well placed for the 
future, focused on aqueous polymers, 
with a stronger management team  
and enhanced capability in the areas  
of product development and process 
know-how, combined with a more 
modern and cost effective asset base 
and state-of-the-art R&D facilities.
We saw clear evidence that our rate of 
innovation is improving, with a number 
of patent ﬁlings during the year. The new 
product launches from 2012, including 
new Lithene
®
 Ultra, grew well during 
2013. We also launched two new nitrile 
grades during the year. Looking forward, 
the quality of our innovation pipeline  
is encouraging, and we believe we  
are well set for future growth. We expect 
several new product launches during 
the coming year across our business, 
including new products in nitrile latex.
New products launched in the last 
5 years contributed over 12% of 2013 
Group revenues. We are conﬁdent of 
being able to improve this percentage, 
and have a mid-term target of sales 
from new products, deﬁned as products 
launched in the preceding 5 years, 
increasing to a level where they contribute 
20% of annual group revenues.
On the investment front, we 
commissioned two new nitrile latex  
lines in Malaysia at the beginning of 
2013. Our Dispersion expansion in 
Stallingborough, to allow the closure  
of Batley, was completed. In paper,  
we completed the investment in 
bio-polymer hybrid latex in Finland,  
and commenced investment in 
Germany for the same and similar 
products. We continued to invest  
in many smaller projects to improve  
the overall capability of our plants  
to drive our commercial and cost 
effectiveness in servicing our customer 
base. We will be expanding our 
Vietnamese and Saudi Arabian 
dispersions capacity during 2014, and 
are currently developing plans to further 
expand our nitrile latex capacity in Asia.
Raw material price volatility was 
relatively low during the year, compared 
to recent years, albeit with a modest 
decline over the year. This modest 
decline in input prices has lowered 
working capital requirements slightly  
and helped in the reduction of net debt 
to £133.6 million.

Strategic report
“ We are well placed for the future, focused on aqueous 
polymers, with a stronger management team and enhanced 
capability in the areas of product development and process 
know-how, combined with a more modern and cost effective 
asset base and state-of-the-art R&D facilities.”
Adrian Whitﬁeld
Chief Executive Ofﬁcer
A further key part of the Group’s 
strategy is to add value through our 
technology and know-how by deploying 
it into Asia and other emerging markets. 
We had several new product launches 
in the region in 2013. We have launched 
a new product range for chopped 
strand glass ﬁbre mat applications, 
where our knowledge of textile binders 
has been effectively used in a new 
application area. Our new nitrile grade 
for examination gloves was launched to 
the market, which offered a signiﬁcant 
improvement in ﬁlm strength to support 
the market trend of lower glove weights. 
This was combined with a versatile 
performance on the glove dipping line, 
giving our customers process and 
formulation ﬂexibility. Market acceptance 
was extremely positive and by the end 
of the year, the new grade was the 
biggest selling product in the Synthomer 
range. Further development work to 
extend the product line is ongoing.

After reporting ENA volumes down 
5.1% in the ﬁrst half of the year, demand 
generally remained soft in the second 
half of the year, as the difﬁcult economic 
conditions in Europe continued to affect 
performance. Overall volumes in the 
second half of the year were similar 
to prior year with the volume declines 
in the construction related segments 
predominantly occurring in the ﬁrst half 
of the year.
There were multiple product launches 
in ENA during the year. Two new 
bio-polymer hybrid products were 
launched to the coated paper market, 
based on our new technology platform 
to optimise performance and cost. 
A new Lithene
®
 Ultra grade was 
introduced to the market in a niche 
encapsulation area, which was enabled 
by our improved low VOC capability. 
Market introductions for High-Solids 
SBR have been made for the US asphalt 
market and for foam applications that 
meet the speciﬁc demands in China. 
A number of other products are in the 
initial commercialisation phase, for 
example, in wood coatings, pressure 
sensitive adhesives and ﬂooring 
adhesive segments, where we expect 
to see full market launch next year.
ENA is our platform for cash generation 
to drive future global growth. We have 
worked hard since the PolymerLatex 
acquisition to create an optimised 
business in Europe, with the closure 
of three plants, and the delivery of 
substantial cost reductions, which have 
positioned us well to deal with the 
economic situation. However, ongoing 
cost management remains a key focus  
of the Group, and we have launched  
a programme comprising a broad range 
of further improvements which will help 
support performance during 2014 and 
2015. The programme will reduce costs 
in the business by ¤10 million per 
annum by the end of 2015. Critical 
elements in delivering this will be 
increased process and energy efﬁciency, 
productivity improvements and 
optimised systems across all functions. 
We anticipate cash cost of circa 
¤15 million for the implementation of 
this programme, of which ¤5 million 
will be capex.
Asia & Rest of World (ARW) 
Operating proﬁt in our ARW segment was 
higher by 20.9% on 8.2% higher volumes.
Since we reported on the turbulence in 
the nitrile market half way through 2012, 
the business, having stabilised in the 
second half of 2012, developed ahead 
of our expectations during 2013. We 
expect to see supply demand tighten 
during 2014, with a further improvement 
in proﬁtability.
The non-nitrile business has seen  
good demand. As we exited the year, 
we experienced a slight deterioration  
in the competitive environment in 
South-east Asia as a competitor 
prepared to bring new Dispersion 
capacity in Malaysia on line to service 
the region.
Overall, we continue to see good 
prospects for the non-nitrile business 
in Asia. Expansion in the region is a core 
part of our strategy, and we will bring  
on further capacity in Middle East and 
Vietnam in 2014. We also continue to 
pursue opportunities for growth in the 
region through acquisition.

Operating efﬁciently
Synthomer was one of the ﬁrst companies to 
sign the UK Chemical Industries Association’s 
sustainable development principles. As part 
of this commitment we strive to improve our 
environmental performance year on year.
To help the Company achieve this objective 
a comprehensive performance monitoring 
structure has been in place for over 10 years 
and resulted in a steady improvement of  
our environmental performance. To continue 
this trend and reduce speciﬁc energy 
consumption (consumption per ton) 
Synthomer has begun implementing 
a comprehensive energy management 
system (EMS).
Since 2011, Synthomer has undertaken 
a scheme to establish EMS to meet  
the ISO50001 standard at a number  
of its European sites. As a result, our 
site in Langelsheim, Germany acquired 
the ISO50001 accreditation in 2012.  
This success has led the way for our three 
production sites, labs and ofﬁces in Marl  
to work towards achieving the standard.
The Marl site began work on achieving  
the ISO50001 accreditation in 2012, 
implementing a number of projects designed 
to improve efﬁciency. One of the key projects 
involved the installation and optimisation  
of a new stripper for the puriﬁcation of SBR 
latex as a key part of the energy savings. 
The new stripping process is much more 
efﬁcient and allows signiﬁcant savings in 
steam and electrical energy (e.g. to run 
pumps). The steam consumption of the  
plant using the new stripper has reduced  
by over 23%. This has resulted in annual 
savings of 16,000 MWh, enough energy to 
heat 800 terraced houses for an entire year. 
This initiative is one of many which focus  
on improving operational efﬁciency and have 
a positive impact on Synthomer’s operational 
and ﬁnancial performance.

Strategic report
Income statement
Sales, operating proﬁt and proﬁt before tax – 
underlying performance
Total sales decreased by 5.1% to £1,054.9 million (2012 
£1,111.8 million) with Group operating proﬁt also 5.8% lower 
at £104.8 million (2012 £111.2 million). This was due to the 
difﬁcult trading conditions that persisted in Europe throughout 
the year. As a result, proﬁt before tax also declined by 4.8% 
to £90.1 million.
Tax and EPS – underlying performance
The Group’ s underlying tax rate of 20% (2012 22%) remains low, 
reﬂecting the beneﬁts of pioneer status (extended tax holiday) on 
our nitrile business in Malaysia, and a zero rate in the UK. The 
Group does not expect to pay tax in the UK for the foreseeable 
future due to brought forward losses and deﬁcit contributions 
to the UK pension scheme, which are tax deductible.
Proﬁt attributable to minority interests was £1.8 million  
(2012 £1.8 million).
As a result, overall, the underlying earnings per share for 2013 
was 20.7p, compared to 20.9p per share for 2012, a slight 
decrease of 1%.
Special items and IFRS
The Group reports its ﬁnancial results according to 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). However, 
to provide a clearer indication of the Group’s underlying 
performance, a number of special items are split out and 
shown in a separate column of the consolidated income 
statement due to their one-off or non-economic nature, and 
are excluded from the comments on underlying performance 
above and throughout the Chief Executive’s review of 
business performance. Special items comprise:
• Restructuring costs associated with delivering the synergy 
targets for the PolymerLatex acquisition of £1.4 million 
(2012 £6.7 million of which £6.0 million were cash costs 
and £0.7 million non-cash costs). These are the ﬁnal costs 
associated with the integration programme.
• Various cross-currency and interest rate swaps for hedging 
purposes, which involve maturities of up to three years. 
IFRS requires that where the strict requirements of IAS 39 
are not met, changes in the market value should be 
recognised annually in the income statement. However, 
such ﬁnancial instruments are maintained by the Group for 
the length of the contract and over their lifetime have a fair 
value of nil. Hence the notional annual adjustment, a loss  
of £1.2 million (2012 loss £1.7 million) is segregated from 
the underlying performance.
• Amortisation of intangibles of £28.4 million (comprising 
£26.7 million in the Company and subsidiaries and 
£1.7 million in share of joint ventures). IFRS acquisition 
accounting requires an explicit number to be placed on 
certain intangibles and amortised through the consolidated 
income statement, with the balance of the excess of the 
purchase price over the physical assets being carried as 
goodwill, which is subject to annual impairment testing. 
The amortisation expense arising from this has been 
treated as a special item and will continue to be so until  
the associated intangible assets are fully amortised.
After deducting special items from underlying performance the 
IFRS proﬁt before tax was £59.1 million (2012 £58.8 million) 
and earnings per share were 14.2p (2012 15.6p).
Restatement for adopting IAS 19 (revised)
The Group adopted IAS 19 (revised) from 1 January 2013 and 
has applied this retrospectively to comparator periods. The 
effect of adoption on the Group’s proﬁt in 2012 was to reduce 
both underlying and total reported proﬁt after tax in 2012 by 
£3.5 million. In addition, £2.2 million of expenses relating to 
the expected return on plan assets and interest expense on 
the pension liability, previously reported within operating 
expenses have been classiﬁed to ﬁnance costs in 2012. 
Dividend
The Board has proposed an increased ﬁnal dividend of  
3.6p which with the interim dividend of 2.4p, brings the total 
dividend for the year to 6.0p per share. This is 3.5 times 
covered (2012 3.8 times), and in line with the Board’s 
commitment to reduce the dividend cover to three times 
by 2015.
Balance sheet
Goodwill increased to £241.1 million at the end of 2013  
from £240.9 million at the end of 2012 due to foreign 
currency translation.
Acquired intangible assets which arose as a result of the 
PolymerLatex acquisition decreased to £109.5 million at 
31 December 2013 from £135.6 million in the prior year.  
This movement reﬂects regular annual amortisation of 
£26.7 million reported in special items, and currency translation.
Property, plant and equipment increased to £203.1 million 
at 31 December 2013 compared to £199.6 million at 
31 December 2012. Additions during the year comprised 
£34.9 million of capital expenditure.
The net deferred tax liability has decreased to £43.8 million 
from £50.9 million during the year. 
Assets held for sale relate to approximately 1,600 acres of 
agricultural land in Malaysia which is currently used to operate 
a palm oil and natural rubber plantation. During the year the 
Board decided to dispose of this land and to cease the 
plantation operations. Land value at a cost of £1.1 million 
relating to 1,600 acres is included in assets held for sale as  
at 31 December 2013. As at 31 December 2013 the 70% 
owned Malaysian subsidiary Revertex (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd  
had through its wholly owned subsidiary Kind Action Sdn Bhd 
exchanged conditional contracts with 6 purchasers for the 
sale of approximately 700 acres of plantation land for a price 
of approximately £27 million.
Financial review 16  Synthomer plc Annual Report 2013  
Completion of the sales is conditional on obtaining approval 
from the Malaysian Estate Land Board and other local 
approvals as the land is being sold for re-development. 
It is anticipated that it will take up to 2 years for the 
approvals to be obtained. We are actively continuing 
to seek purchasers for the remaining 900 acres.
Pensions 
In the main UK deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme the majority 
of investments are in equities. All asset classes performed  
well over the course of 2013, with a total return on assets 
(excluding cash) of 12.4%. The yield on high-quality corporate 
bonds decreased slightly during the year, which increased 
liabilities. The Company made cash contributions to the fund 
in the year of £8 million, which was a prepayment of 2014 
contributions. The overall effect of these changes was that 
there was a decrease in the deﬁcit of the scheme, which 
stood at £60.3 million at the end of 2013 (2012 £69.5 million). 
Due to the prepayment, cash contributions in 2014 are 
expected to be of the order of £8 million.
The UK scheme was closed to future accrual during 2009  
and there are no active members in the scheme.
Overseas net pension liabilities increased to £52.6 million 
(2012 £50.2 million). The non-UK schemes are primarily 
traditional German unfunded ‘on balance sheet’ arrangements.

Emerging market growth
Synthomer has a long history of working with 
our customers to develop new products and 
dedicated formulations that meet the ever 
changing needs of the market.
Utilising a combination of our vinyl acetate 
emulsion polymerisation technology and 
extensive experience in textile binding 
applications we commissioned project 
‘Dreamliner’ a new product line for chopped 
strand glass ﬁbre mats (CSM).
The technology behind project ‘Dreamliner’ 
gave birth to our new Emultex 9500 series  
of waterborne plasticised vinyl acetate 
products that are used for the bonding of 
CSM. These products are designed to provide 
good mouldability and clarity in the processing 
stage whilst offering a low odour and 
yellowing effect on the ﬁnished product. 
The Emultex 9500 series have a number of 
key uses in the boat, automotive components, 
windmills and water tank markets. 
Designed as a modular system, the new 
Emultex series allows customisation to adjust 
the handle of the material from soft to hard 
and gives a wide range of formulating options. 
The initial range has been put into production 
at our Dammam site in Saudi Arabia and 
commercial supply has commenced to 
selected customers in the region and further 
target markets in India and China have 
been approached. 
The Emultex 9500 product line will be 
supported through the expansion of our 
Dammam site, which will provide the 
opportunity to develop speciality dispersion 
products for manufacture in reactors 
previously used in producing high volume 
binders for the coatings market. These 
binders will now be produced by a new 
reactor on the site which will bring total 
Dammam production capacity up to  
 100,000 tons.

Strategic risks Strategy for mitigation
Conditions in the global economy, economic 
ﬂuctuations in customer industries and volatility  
and cyclicality of the global chemicals and polymers 
markets may adversely affect the results of the Group.
The Group maintains a balanced portfolio of products 
serving a wide range of end markets around the globe. 
Business performance at geographical level and 
business unit is closely monitored and corrective  
actions are taken as necessary.
The markets in which the Group operates are  
highly competitive and the Group may lose market 
share to other producers of water-based polymers 
or to other products that can be substituted for the 
products of the Group.
The Group continues to invest in existing and new

continues to invest in new facilities to allow the Group  
to maintain its key market positions. As part of the 
Group’s strategic planning process it identiﬁes and 
converts acquisition targets to enhance market 
positions and provide new technologies.
The ability of the Group to compete is highly 
dependent on its ability to develop technological 
innovations, to introduce new products and to protect 
its intellectual property, trade secrets and know-how. 
Failure to do so could have an adverse affect on 
the Group.

Strategic report
Operational risks continued Strategy for mitigation
Compliance with extensive environmental, health  
and safety laws and regulations could require material 
expenditure, changes in the operations of the Group  
or site remediation.
The manufacture, storage and transportation of 
chemicals is inherently dangerous and any incidents 
relating to the hazards which the Group faces may 
adversely affect its ﬁnancial condition, results of 
operations and reputation.
Detailed safety, health and environmental (SHE)
processes are documented in operating guidance 
which is updated and communicated to staff on 
a regular basis. 
Robust maintenance programmes are undertaken  
in order to ensure that our facilities meet up to Group 
and local legal requirements.
The Group operates a central internal audit function 
dedicated to SHE issues and programmes for 
continuous improvement across all major SHE areas 
are in place Group-wide.
The ongoing success of the Group is dependent  
on attracting and retaining high quality senior 
management and staff who can effectively manage  
the Group’s operations.
The Group offers competitive compensation  
packages with annual bonus and long-term incentive 
arrangements for key employees. Appropriate notice 
periods and non-compete clauses are used to mitigate 
short-term risk for key employees. The Group is also 
developing a succession plan for key positions.
Financial risks
As a signiﬁcant proportion of the Group’s turnover  
and assets are in currencies other than pounds  
sterling ﬂuctuations in currency exchange rates may 
signiﬁcantly impact the results of the operations of the 
Group and may signiﬁcantly affect the comparability  
of ﬁnancial results between ﬁnancial periods.
The Group has a policy of hedging all signiﬁcant 
foreign exchange transactional exposure at operating 
company level and also hold debt facilities in key 
currencies to offset ﬂuctuations in overseas 
asset values.
The Group’s balance sheet and cash ﬂow or credit 
market conditions and credit ratings may restrict the 
ability of the Group to obtain credit facilities or to 
reﬁnance its existing debt facilities in the longer term. 
In addition, interest rate ﬂuctuations and increases  
in bank lending margins may increase the Group’s 
costs of borrowing.
The Group closely monitors cash ﬂow and working 
capital performance on a monthly basis and regularly 
reviews covenant compliance. The Group has a policy 
on leverage limits and has adequate headroom on 
a twelve month forecast basis through a range of 
facilities with varying expiry dates. Interest rate risk 
is managed through the use of interest rate hedging, 
as required.
The Group has funding risks relating to deﬁned beneﬁt 
pension schemes and any deterioration in the value  
of assets in which the pension scheme has invested  
as against the ﬁnancial obligations to make payments 
to members of the schemes could have an adverse 
effect on the Group.
The UK scheme was closed to future accrual during 
2009. The risks are mitigated by paying appropriate 
contributions into the funds and through balanced 
investment strategies which are designed to avoid  
a material impact to the fund assets. 20  Synthomer plc Annual Report 2013  
Commitment to safety, health and  
environmental (SHE) performance
The Board and the Group Executive Committee are fully 
committed to improving SHE performance and to the 
involvement of staff at all sites and at all levels in our SHE 
programmes. SHE performance is always a primary duty  
for management at all levels in the Group and all are aligned  
to our three long-term goals which are:
1.  to minimise any environmental burden created by 
our activities;
2.  to have no accidents or incidents; and
3.  to have no adverse impact on the health of those who 
work in, or live near our operations, nor on the health 
of those who use our products.
The Group adopts the following SHE management practices 
with the aim of continuously improving SHE performance:
• SHE performance is discussed in all management 
meetings, as the ﬁrst agenda item;
• Synthomer conduct regular, in-depth SHE audits of all  
sites to assess performance and identify opportunities 
for improvement; 
• The Group Accident and Incident Management System 
(AIMS) is used to collect and analyse data on all accidents, 
incidents and “near misses” on our sites; 
• Sites implement the Group’s SHE Management System 
(SHEMS) or implement an equivalent system which works 
to the same or higher standards; 
• Sites provide training for staff to ensure that they 
understand Group and site systems, both in SHE and 
more generally; 
• Key measures (leading and lagging indicators) of SHE 
performance are collected monthly or quarterly as 
appropriate and reported to the Group Executive and 
to the Board; 
• Key leading performance indicators, covering items such 
as inspections and engineering performance, are collected 
and reported to senior management to assess both 
equipment and management performance; 
• Senior managers have SHE targets as part of their annual 
objectives. These SHE targets are cascaded to give all 
employees supporting objectives, either on an individual 
or a site basis; and
• Central SHE staff regularly visit sites to carry out training 
and development of key staff, to ensure all sites are aware 
of their legal obligations and current good practice, and  
to monitor and guide current SHE performance.

the same as it was in 2012 with 12 such accidents and 
a consequent frequency rate of 0.23 per 100,000 hours 
worked. In common with many other chemical companies, 
we have started to collect data on a wider range of accidents, 
essentially all those involving more than ﬁrst aid treatment.  
Our frequency rate for this type of accident is similar to, 
or better than, those reported by similar chemical companies 
and shows a falling trend.

Environmental performance
Since 2000 we have reported signiﬁcant reductions, year- 
on-year, in our global warming burden: emissions per tonne 
reduced by a third between 2000 and 2006, and calculated 
on the same basis have reduced by a further 25% since then. 
With the introduction of mandatory Greenhouse Gas (GHG) 
reporting, we have re-examined the calculation our emissions 
to comply with the most recent guidance, which should give 
a better reﬂection of the actual effects of the Company’s 
Corporate social responsibility report Synthomer plc Annual Report 2013  21  
Strategic report
operations. We have also identiﬁed previously unreported 
releases of refrigerant gases which though small in volume 
have a large global warming impact. These changes have 
the effect of increasing our reported releases so it is good 
to report that 2012 and 2013 have seen the lowest global 
warming burden per tonne of production in the Group’s 
history. Even on the new basis, releases have reduced by 
well over 40% since 2000.
Energy
Overall, speciﬁc energy consumption across the Synthomer 
Group fell by 1.8% compared with 2012, and was 5.1%  
lower than in 2011. The long-term trend shows the Group 
used less than half the energy per tonne that was used in 
2001. Consumption in 2013 was 39% better than the 
extrapolated 2013 target, calculated using 2000 as the base 
line and applying the Chemical Industry Association (CIAs) 
Sustainable Development (SD) targets which the Group 
signed up to in 2005.

Water use
Synthomer Group companies used nearly 300,000 m

 less 
water in 2013 than in 2012 and reduced their water usage  
by 8.3% on a per production tonne basis. This excellent 
performance more than reversed the slight increase seen in 
2012 and means that water consumption per tonne of the 
Group is less than half of the ﬁgure seen as recently as 2005 
and roundly a third of what it was in 2000.

Greenhouse gas emissions
The Company has reported environmental KPIs in the format 
recommended by DEFRA which since 2008, have included 
Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. The overall format for 
quantitative data has been retained and includes DEFRA’s 
other recommended KPIs, reporting trends on a 3-year rolling 
basis. It has been revised to comply with DEFRA’s 2013 
guidance. Internal data collection has also been revised for 
ﬁnancial year 2013 to give improved compliance with the 
revised guidance.
Reporting parameters
The 2013 ﬁnancial year reporting includes all manufacturing 
operations but does not cover all ofﬁce locations where these 
are not co-located with manufacturing. These locations will 
have no material effect on the Group’s overall GHG emissions, 
being estimated at less than 0.1% of the Group total.
All known emissions from manufacturing process have been 
included, including energy directly used and the indirect energy 
costs of heating, cooling and other site services where these 
are provided by a third party. They include estimates for the 
effects of the release of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) 
and refrigerant gases. The only known emissions which have 
not been included are direct emissions of CO
2
 from on-site 
waste treatment; this has not currently been quantiﬁed.
The Group have no known uses or releases of perﬂuorocarbons 
or sulphur hexaﬂuoride. All releases of nitrous oxide or 
methane are associated with energy production and are not 
separately quantiﬁed.
The Group continues to report Scope 1 & 2 emissions.
No estimate has been made of Scope 3 emissions.
The Group continues to use emissions per production tonne 
as its intensity ratio. The data source for all emissions factors 
(CO
2
e) is DEFRA: May 2013. 22  Synthomer plc Annual Report 2013  
Calculation methodologies
All direct energy production from fossil fuels has been 
aggregated on a Group wide basis and converted to CO
2
e by 
using the appropriate DEFRA emissions factors. No allowance 
has been made for possible country to country variation.
Electricity has been converted to CO
2
e on a country by 
country basis, using the conversion factors given by 
DEFRA for 2013 and previous years. (It should be noted 
that these generally refer to actual country performance  
2 years earlier than the quoted date, ie 2013 factors relate 
to 2011 performance.)
Synthomer’s Stallingborough site takes all its electricity on an 
exclusive contract from an adjacent waste incinerator. This 
electricity is certiﬁed as “Green” by the UK government but 
no credit has been taken for this. 
VOCs have been aggregated on a Group basis and converted 
to CO
2
e using a factor of 11. This ﬁgure has been used by UK 
CIA member companies since 2005 and is at the upper end 
of the range for VOCs.
Information on the release of refrigerant gases has been 
collected for 2011-2013. The releases for each individual gas 
has been aggregated in each year to give a Group release 
and then converted to CO
2
e using the equivalence factors 
given by DEFRA for each gas.
Performance in 2013
The inclusion of refrigerant gases and the calculation of CO
2
e 
for electricity on a country by country basis have had a 
signiﬁcant impact on the Group’s calculated Greenhouse Gas 
emissions. Two unforeseen releases of refrigerant – due to 
equipment failure – have shown that these releases are more 
signiﬁcant than previously estimated. They add some 7% to 
the Group’s total Global Warming burden in 2013. Known 
and estimated usage in 2011 and 2012 add 3% & 6% to 
the Group’s GHG releases in those years.
Achieving a signiﬁcant reduction in the actual losses from  
our operations will be an urgent target in 2014.
The Group hoped to achieve signiﬁcant reductions in VOC 
releases in 2013. Unfortunately, commissioning problems  
with the BD recovery system at Kluang mean that the hoped 
reductions there were not realised in 2013. Work continued 
throughout the year to bring the plant on-line and the unit  
was operating at the year end. A new boiler which will burn 
residual VOC from the Kluang NBR plant with full heat 
recovery was installed late in 2013 and is currently 
commissioning. Better measurement of releases from the 
Kluang NBR plant showed a reduction of some 350 tonnes 
compared to the estimates for previous years.
In Harlow, a new cryogenic VOC recovery unit came on-line 
towards the year end but too late to have any signiﬁcant effect 
on the VOC releases from the site in 2013. Releases from the 
Harlow site increased broadly in line with production. T aken 
together with the releases, known and estimated, from other 
Synthomer plant, the Group reduced its releases of VOCs in 
2013 by 250 tonnes.
Despite a 1.8% improvement in energy efﬁciency in 2013, 
changing to using country speciﬁc ﬁgures for the CO
2
 
equivalent for electricity has a very marked effect on the 
Group’s performance. In each year from 2011-2013 there  
is an increase in GHG emissions due to the higher CO
2
e  
for electricity generation in countries such as South Africa  
and Saudi Arabia.
This effect is particularly strong in 2013 as Malaysia’s CO
2
e 
increased to ~65% above the UK. Due to the 2 year delay  
in ﬁgures this actually refers to Malaysia’s CO
2
e performance 
in 2011. In that year there was a shortage of the natural gas 
which normally generates ~60% of Malaysia’s electricity due 
to problems in their off-shore gas ﬁelds. Well over half of 
the country’s electricity came from burning coal, with 
consequently much higher CO
2
 emissions. This change 
increased the Group’s CO
2
 releases by 11%. 
Despite these adverse effects the overall picture of the 
Group’s performance remains good. The last 3 years are 
the best in the Group’s history with emissions per tonne 
lower than they have ever been.

Notes
1  Data relates to site usage of all fuels, excluding transport.
2  Emissions to air have been calculated from the usage of all fuels, excluding transport fuel. They therefore include both direct emissions and indirect emissions 
related to bought-in electricity, steam, compressed air, cooling water etc., with the exception of transmission and distribution losses for electricity 
(These losses are in Scope 3, this report is for Scope 1 & 2). 
3  CO

2
O associated with combustion.
4  NOx emissions are predominantly those from combustion processes. The CO
2
 equivalent Global Warming Potential contribution from these releases  
is already included in the CO
2
 from energy ﬁgure above.
5  Data on refrigerant gas losses has been collected for 2013 and has been collected for 2011 and 2012 wherever possible. Where site data is not available  
for 2011 & 2012, losses have been assumed to be the same as in 2013. Annual losses of refrigerant have been converted to the CO
2
 equivalent ﬁgures  
using the substance by substance ﬁgures published by DEFRA, based on the materials consumed within the Group.
6  The total CO

e ﬁgure is the total of the CO
2
 equivalent from energy + the VOC contribution (assuming an average factor of 1 1 kg CO
2

Governance
Report from the Chairman
Dear Shareholder
Corporate governance was a primary focus for your 
Board throughout 2013 as a result of the requirement 
to comply with and report on the new Directors’ 
Remuneration Report regulations and the September 
2012 UK Corporate Governance Code for the ﬁrst time 
in this annual report. A project was initiated in the ﬁrst 
quarter of the year to meet the requirements for 
reporting on Directors’ remuneration and a full report 
on the work undertaken by the Remuneration 
Committee in this regard is given in the Remuneration 
Committee Report.
The Nomination Committee was tasked with the 
process of identifying candidates for ﬁlling the 
independent non-executive Director position left vacant 
by the departure of Ishbel Macpherson in May 2013. 
I was very pleased to announce the appointment of 
Brendan Connolly at the start of 2014 who has agreed 
to take over from me as Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee next month.
The Audit Committee expanded the scope of its remit 
in 2013 and will return to full compliance with the 
composition requirements of the Code from March 2014.
Your Board continues to review and develop its 
governance policies and processes and to seek to report 
to shareholders in a meaningful and clear manner. I am 
pleased to present our full statements on compliance 
and application of the Code in 2013 in the rest of this 
report which I hope you ﬁnd informative.
Neil Johnson
Chairman
Statement of compliance
The Company considers that it has complied throughout the 
ﬁnancial year ended 31 December 2013 with the provisions 
set out in the Code except in relation to the composition of 
the Board and its Committees in that:
• the Board lacked one independent non-executive Director 
in order to be balanced;
• the Audit and Remuneration Committees each comprised 
two independent non-executive Directors instead of three;
• the Nomination Committee was not composed of a 
majority of independent non-executive Directors.
Further details on these matters and how they have been 
addressed are set out in this report.
Application of the Code
The main principles of the Code were applied as follows:
Leadership and effectiveness
Operation of the Board
The activities of the Company are controlled by the Board 
which, during 2013, comprised two executive Directors and 
seven non-executive Directors until the 2013 Annual General 
Meeting after which the number of non-executive Directors 
reduced to six. The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive 
Ofﬁcer are clearly divided between Mr Johnson who heads 
the Board in his capacity as non-executive Chairman and 
Mr A M Whitﬁeld who has responsibility for the running of the 
Company’s business as Chief Executive Ofﬁcer . The non-
executive Directors all have wide business and boardroom 
experience gained in a broad range of business sectors.
The Board has reserved to itself a schedule of matters which 
includes setting long-term objectives for the Group and the 
strategies to be employed in achieving them, setting policies 
in the areas of safety, health and the environment, recruitment 
and employment, risk management and treasury and, subject 
to materiality thresholds, decisions on the raising of capital, 
ﬁnancial commitments, capital expenditure, acquisitions and 
disposals and the prosecution, defence and settlement 
of litigation.
During 2013 the Board held eight scheduled meetings to 
review current and projected performance and to determine 
strategic issues with a half day dedicated to an annual 
strategy development review. The Directors receive in advance 
full information on all matters to be discussed at Board 
meetings as well as a detailed review of performance prepared 
by the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer. The Board has established 
Audit, Nomination and Remuneration committees which are 
discussed below.
In addition arrangements are made each year for the Board  
to visit up to two of the Group’s operational sites and meet 
local management. Ad hoc site visits are facilitated for 
individual non-executive Directors on request. During 2013  
the Board held a meeting in Marl, Germany and in Filago, 
Italy at the ofﬁces of its businesses. In conjunction with those 
Board meetings presentations were given by local senior 
management and the Directors were given the opportunity 
to visit the Group’s plants.
The Board has delegated to the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer 
responsibility for the development and preparation of the 
business plan for the Group and the annual Group budget  
for recommendation to the Board. As the senior executive 
Director, the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer is responsible for all 
aspects of day-to-day operational control of the Group and 
execution of the Group strategy. The Chief Executive Ofﬁcer 
has established and chairs an Executive Committee (whose 
other members are the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer, the Chief 
Operating Ofﬁcer, the Chief Counsel and Company Secretary, 
the Vice President – Human Resources, the Vice President – 
Europe, Middle East & Africa, the Vice President – South-east 
Corporate governance 26  Synthomer plc Annual Report 2013  
Asia, the Vice President – Finance and the Vice President –
Operational Excellence & Engineering) to assist him in the 
performance of his duties and which meets once a month. 
The Chairman has available to him the minutes of the 
Executive Committee and all Directors receive a monthly 
trading summary and commentary from the Chief Financial 
Ofﬁcer and an update report from the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer.
Board membership and balance
The Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and Senior 
Independent Director are identiﬁed on page 24. The Chairmen 
and members of the Audit, Nomination and Remuneration 
Committees are identiﬁed below. The Board considers 
Mr J K Maiden, Dr J J C Jansz, Mr J Chen and  
Mr B W D Connolly are independent in accordance  
with the provisions of the Code.
For some seven months of 2013 the Company was not in 
compliance with the requirement of Code provision B.1.2  
for half the Board, excluding the Chairman, to comprise 
independent non-executive Directors. Following completion  
of a recruitment exercise in 2013 which culminated with the 
appointment of Mr B W D Connolly in January 2014 the  
Board has returned to compliance with this requirement.
The Board held a total of eight meetings in 2013. In addition 
the Chairman held one separate meeting with the non-
executive Directors without the executive Directors being 
present to appraise the performance of the executive 
management. The non-executive Directors also met once 
without the Chairman to appraise his performance.
The table below shows the number of meetings  
of the Board, Audit, Remuneration and Nomination 
Committees held during the year and the number of meetings

Induction and training
Induction arrangements are in place in order to ensure  
new Directors receive a full formal and tailored induction on 
appointment. The Chairman reviews and agrees the training 
and development needs of the Directors and the skills and 
knowledge of the Board as a whole are updated by brieﬁngs 
provided by the Company’s internal resources and materials 
and seminars offered by external advisers.
Performance evaluation
Performance evaluations of the Board, its committees and  
its Directors were carried out in the last year by the following 
internal processes:
• an assessment of the performance of individual non-
executive Directors is carried out by the Chairman through 
a rolling programme of one-to-one discussions using 
performance evaluation questions as the centrepiece for 
those discussions. Every non-executive Director is 
assessed in this way once a year;
• the performance of the executive Directors was reviewed  
in August 2013 at a meeting of the non-executive Directors 
chaired by the Chairman;
• a meeting of the non-executive Directors (in the absence 
of the Chairman) chaired by the Senior Independent 
Director was held in September 2013 to evaluate the 
performance of the Chairman, taking into account the 
views of the executive Directors; and
• the Board and its Committees carry out an annual 
self-assessment of performance led by the Chairman and 
the Chairman of each committee respectively. The results 
of assessment questionnaires completed by those 
Chairmen were reviewed by the relevant committees and 
the Board and were shared with and discussed by the 
Board as a whole at its meeting in November 2013.
The Board has not introduced an externally facilitated Board 
evaluation process during 2013 but continues to keep the 
beneﬁts of doing so under review.
Non-executive Directors are appointed for three-year terms.  
All Directors submit themselves for annual election at each 
Annual General Meeting.
Board committees
The Board has formally established Nomination, Audit,  
and Remuneration Committees, each with their own terms  
of reference which set out their respective roles and the 
authority delegated to them by the Board. Copies of the  
terms of reference are available upon request from the 
Company Secretary and can also be downloaded from  
the Company’s website. All non-executive Directors have  
a standing invitation to attend Committee meetings unless 
they are notiﬁed otherwise.

The role of the Audit Committee
Throughout 2013 the Audit Committee was chaired by 
Mr J K Maiden and comprised at least two independent 
non-executive Directors together with one non-independent 
non-executive Director. Following the appointment of 
Mr B W D Connolly to the Committee with effect from 
March 2014, the Committee will revert to comprising three 
independent non-executive Directors. Mr Maiden is 
considered by the Board to have ‘recent and relevant ﬁnancial 
experience’ for the purposes of Provision C.3.1 of the Code 
due to his current ﬁnancial role outside the Group. 
The Committee has established a detailed remit regarding the 
application of ﬁnancial reporting and internal control principles, 
which covers:
• monitoring the integrity of the ﬁnancial statements 
of the Group and any formal announcements relating 
to the Group’s ﬁnancial performance and reviewing 
signiﬁcant ﬁnancial reporting judgements contained 
in them;
• reviewing the Group’s internal ﬁnancial controls and 
the Group’s internal control and risk management 
systems;
• monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the 
Group’s internal audit function;
• making recommendations to the Board regarding 
the selection and appointment of the external auditor 
and approving their remuneration and terms of 
engagement;
• reviewing and monitoring the external auditor’s 
independence and objectivity and the effectiveness 
of the audit process; and
• developing and implementing policy on the 
engagement of the external auditor to supply 
non-audit services.
The Board has during the year extended the 
Committee’s remit such that the Committee now also: 
• advises the Board, in connection with its obligation 
under Section C.1.1 of the Code, on whether the 
annual report and accounts, taken as a whole, is 
fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess 
the performance of the Group, along with its 
business model and strategy;
• ensures that the external audit services contract is 
put out to tender at least once every ten years; and
• reports on the signiﬁcant issues that it considered in 
relation to the ﬁnancial statements and how these 
were addressed.
Audit Committee Chairman’s statement
Dear Shareholder
During 2013 the Committee’s work focused on 
implementation of the changes to narrative reporting and 
the corporate governance environment which applied 
to the Group with effect from the start of the year, in 
addition to our normal support of the Group’s internal 
control and external audit work.
At the request of the Board, the Committee has extended 
its remit to include a review of the content of the annual 
report and accounts in order to advise the Board on its 
statement required by Section C.1.1. of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (described below). The Committee  
has also reviewed how it reports to the Board and to 
shareholders on the discharge of its responsibilities and 
continues to seek to enhance reporting to both.
Following the external audit tender process undertaken  
in 2012 which resulted in the appointment of 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP in July that year the 
Committee has monitored the effectiveness of the audit 
process and is pleased to recommend their re-appointment 
at the 2014 annual general meeting.
The second year of our three year work plan relating 
to co-sourced internal audit services was successfully 
completed in 2013. The result was that all the Group’s 
operating companies have now been visited by KPMG (UK) 
LLP , the co-sourced internal auditor, or received visits from 
the Company’s Head of internal Audit and senior members 
of the head ofﬁce ﬁnance team to review controls, and in 
the case of larger operating companies they have received 
both visits. 
The Committee’s work during the course of the year also 
involved discharging its other responsibilities for those 
matters delegated to it by the Board under its remit and 
which is reported on in the following section of this report.
Alex Catto served on the Committee during the year on an 
interim basis and will be replaced by Brendan Connolly in 
March 2014. I would like to thank Alex for his work and 
welcome Brendan to the Committee.

Audit Committee Chairman 28  Synthomer plc Annual Report 2013  
Auditor objectivity and independence
With regard to seeking to ensure the independence and 
objectivity of the auditor, the Audit Committee’s policy, which 
was reviewed and revised during the year, is to ensure that  
the auditor’s integrity is not compromised, by restricting their 
involvement in the provision of non-audit services where a 
conﬂict of interest, real or perceived, may exist. The policy 
splits the approval of non-audit work into three categories:
• services which are prohibited
• services which are pre-approved subject to limits
• services which require speciﬁc approval on a  
case-by-case basis.
Prohibited services include:
• maintaining or preparing accounting records and 
ﬁnancial statements;
• the design and implementation of ﬁnancial information 
systems or ﬁnancial controls;
• secondments to the Group;
• recruitment and remuneration related services for key 
management positions;
• appraisal, valuation and actuarial services;
• tax services which require interpretation of tax law 
or reliance on accounting treatments;
• legal services unrelated to the audit.
A full copy of the policy on the provision of non-audit services 
by the external auditor is available on the Company website.
In addition the auditor has been requested not to provide 
services to executive Directors or senior executives except 
where approved by the Audit Committee. Non-executive 
Directors are required to disclose any relationship they have 
with the auditor. Prior to appointment in July 2012 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP were providing and have 
continued to provide personal tax advice to the Chief 
Executive Ofﬁcer and expatriate tax services to the Group’s 
senior managers who are required to work outside their home 
country. The Committee do not consider that the provision of 
these services creates any conﬂict of interest as they are of a 
minor nature and are provided by individuals and teams who 
are not involved in the audit and accordingly have approved 
their continuation.
Details of audit and non-audit fees paid to the auditor in 2013 
are set out in note 6 on page 71. Non-audit fees principally 
relate to tax compliance and tax advisory services and due 
diligence work in relation to potential acquisitions.
The Chief Financial Ofﬁcer and senior members of his 
department attend meetings of the Committee as part of the 
review of the Group’s interim and annual ﬁnancial statements 
prior to their submission to the Board and as part of the 
internal audit process. The Committee meets periodically  
with the Company’s auditor without management present to 
discuss the adequacy of the Group’s ﬁnancial management, 
internal controls and information systems and to review  
the terms of the auditor’s engagement, effectiveness, 
independence and objectivity.
Activities during the year
The Committee met formally four times during 2013 and 
carried out the following main activities in addition to the items 
mentioned in the Chairman’s overview:
• Reviewed the ﬁnancial statements in the 2012 annual 
report and the 2013 interim statement;
• Reviewed the scope and effectiveness of the external audit;
• Reviewed the Group’s Risk Register;
• Monitored the effectiveness of internal controls and 
risk management;
• Received reports from the external auditor on the major 
ﬁndings of its work;
• Approved the annual external audit plan and the basis 
on which the auditor assesses materiality;
• Received a report on the Group’s tax provisions 
and restructuring;
• Approved a new policy on the provision of non-audit 
services by the external auditor;
• Reviewed the remit and effectiveness of the Committee; 
• Reviewed the Group’s whistleblowing arrangements; 
• Reviewed the Group’s internal audit plan; and
• Received detailed reports and presentations from KPMG, 
the co-sourced internal auditors, and the reviews 
undertaken by senior members of head ofﬁce ﬁnance 
team. Reviewed reports relating to the implementation  
of recommendations from internal audit visits to enable  
the Committee to assess the improvements in the Group’s 
controls and reporting and where further actions are 
required. Considered and approved the plan for 2014 
internal audit reviews which will complete the initial three 
year cycle under which all Group companies will be visited  
by KPMG and senior members of Group ﬁnance during 
the cycle.
In addition the Chairman of the Committee had regular 
dialogue with the external auditor during the course of the year.

Nomination Committee
Nomination Committee membership since 1 January 2013:
Neil Johnson Chairman
Jez Maiden
Adrian Whitﬁeld
The Committee is responsible for: the regular review of the structure, size 
and composition of the Board and the making of recommendations with 
regard to any changes; leading the process for Board appointments and 
nominating candidates for non-executive positions; and considering 
succession planning. 
Since 17 May 2012 the Nomination Committee has not 
complied with the composition requirements of Code 
Provision B.2.1 in that a majority of its members are not 
independent non-executive Directors. The Board considers 
that the current composition of the Nomination Committee 
provides it with the ﬂexibility and speed of decision making 
that is necessary in connection with the interview process 
required for making nominations to ﬁll Board vacancies. 
Accordingly the Board does not currently intend to  
make any changes to the composition of this Committee.
The Committee led the process for nominating 
Mr B W D Connolly for appointment as an independent 
non-executive Director. This process involved a thorough 
review of a range of candidates put forward by an 
independent recruitment consultancy, Heidrick & Struggles 
(with which the Company has no other connection) which 
conducted an extensive search process. The diversity 
(including gender) of the Board was taken into account  
by the Committee when making this nomination.
The Committee also reviewed senior management succession 
planning within the Group during the course of the year.
The Nomination Committee held one formal meeting during 
2013 and a number of informal meetings and telephone calls 
as well as several interviews in connection with the nomination 
process referred to above.
The Board adopted a policy on diversity in March 2013.  
This policy seeks to ensure that diversity in its broadest sense 
is taken into account in the process of making appointments 
on merit against objective selection criteria. A copy of the 
policy is available at www.synthomer.com. Further details  
on the Company’s approach to diversity is contained within 
the Strategic report.
Assessment of effectiveness of the external audit
During the year the Committee evaluated the performance, 
independence and effectiveness of the external auditors. 
As part of this process feedback was obtained from head 
ofﬁce and operating company staff involved with the external 
audit together with the Committee’s meetings with the 
external auditors. The Committee assessed the robustness  
of the audit, the quality of delivery of the audit against the 
agreed plan and the competence with which the auditors 
handle key accounting and audit adjustments. Considering 
all of these factors the Committee concluded that the 
external auditors were effective.
Financial reporting and signiﬁcant judgements
As part of their monitoring of the integrity of the ﬁnancial 
statements, the Committee reviews whether suitable 
accounting policies have been adopted, whether management 
has made appropriate estimates and judgements and also 
seeks support from the external auditors to assess them.
The main issues reviewed in the year ended 31 December 
2013 are set out below:
• Provisions for uncertain taxation positions:
  Signiﬁcant judgement is exercised by management,  
with advice from appropriate tax advisors, to arrive at  
the amounts provided for tax as the ﬁnal tax outcome of 
several transactions is uncertain and may not be known  
for several years. As part of their audit the external auditor 
reviewed the judgements that had been made, using tax 
specialists as appropriate, and provided the Committee 
with an assessment of the appropriateness of 
management judgements.
• Deﬁned beneﬁt pension accounting:
  The Group operates a number of deﬁned beneﬁt schemes 
which have signiﬁcant liabilities as outlined in Note 25 to 
the Group Financial Statements. Although the UK schemes  
are closed to future accrual they are sensitive to changes  
in actuarial assumptions. During their audit, the external 
auditor evaluated the assumptions and methodologies 
used by the Group’s actuarial advisors and management 
and assessed whether the assumptions made were 
appropriate and not materially different from external 
benchmarks. The external auditors reported to us that  
they were satisﬁed with the assumptions used and with  
the way that the schemes had been accounted for. 30  Synthomer plc Annual Report 2013  
A report on the approach to internal control is set out below. 
The Directors endeavour to make the annual report and 
ﬁnancial statements as informative and understandable 
as possible.
Internal control
The Board of Directors has ultimate responsibility for the 
Group’s system of internal control and sets appropriate 
policies to ensure that the Code requirements on internal 
control are met. The system of internal control deployed  
within the Group is designed to reduce the risks of failure  
to meet business objectives, but these risks cannot be 
eliminated. The internal control system adopted can  
therefore only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance 
about meeting such business objectives or against material  
mis-statement or loss.
The Group’s internal controls over the ﬁnancial reporting and 
consolidation processes are designed under the supervision 
of the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer to provide reasonable assurance 
regarding the reliability of ﬁnancial reporting and the 
preparation and fair presentation of the Group’s published 
ﬁnancial statements for external reporting purposes in 
accordance with IFRS.
An ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing 
signiﬁcant business risks faced by the Group has been  
in place since 2000. This has since been built upon so as  
to embed further the process into the businesses and to 
enhance the usefulness of the relevant processes and 
information, and has been operated throughout 2013 and  
up to the date of approval of the annual report and accounts, 
and accords with the Turnbull Guidance.
The system is applied across the Group on a functional  
and regional basis and a ‘bottom up’ risk proﬁle is created  
by evaluating the information at an operational and Group 
level. Individual senior managers within Synthomer’s 
businesses identify and assess key risks associated within 
their area of responsibility based on formal management 
information and interaction with colleagues, customers, 
suppliers and other parties.
The individual submissions are consolidated, reviewed and 
agreed by the Executive Committee. A business risk report  
is prepared that is closely linked to business strategy and 
takes account of key internal and external factors. Risks are 
prioritised using a common risk matrix, which forms the  
basis of a single corporate risk report that is reviewed and 
discussed by the Audit Committee.
The individual business risk reports are formally reviewed 
every six months, out of which a revised report is submitted 
which identiﬁes changes in the risk environment.
Remuneration Committee
All matters relating to the Remuneration Committee and 
remuneration are covered in the Remuneration report,  
set out on pages 32 to 48.
Relations with shareholders
Dialogue with institutional investors is conducted on a regular 
basis by the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and the Chief Financial 
Ofﬁcer and meetings take place following the announcement 
of interim and full year results and at other times according 
to circumstances.
The Board has adopted a set of shareholder communication 
principles in order to ensure that Board members develop an 
understanding of the views of the Group’s major shareholders. 
These principles require the Chairman to be present with  
the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer at 
sufﬁcient shareholder presentations and meetings that he fully 
understands the issues and concerns of major shareholders. 
Alternatively the Chairman is also available for meetings with 
major shareholders at their request.
The Chief Executive Ofﬁcer reports on shareholder relations 
at each Board meeting. Communications with shareholders 
relating to corporate governance matters are conducted by 
the Chairman with the assistance of the Chairmen of the 
Audit, Nomination and Remuneration Committees. Written 
reports on all meetings between non-executive Directors and 
institutional shareholders and their representative bodies are 
presented to the Board at the ﬁrst opportunity following such 
meetings as is all correspondence with them.
The Senior Independent Director is available to shareholders 
if they have concerns which contact through the normal 
channels of the Chairman or the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer has 
failed to resolve or for which such contact is inappropriate.
The Board seeks to encourage participation of all 
shareholders, and in particular private investors, at the 
Company’s Annual General Meeting and endeavours to 
ensure all Board members are in attendance. In particular,  
the Chairmen of the Remuneration, Audit and Nomination 
Committees are available to answer questions.
The Company makes use of its website www.synthomer.com 
to communicate with its shareholders where it publishes interim 
and full year results, Company announcements, share price 
and corporate governance and other investor information.
Accountability
An explanation of the Directors’ responsibility for preparing  
the ﬁnancial statements, their report that the business is a 
going concern, a responsibility statement and their statement 
as to disclosure of information to the auditor are set out  
on pages 50 and 51 respectively. Statements by the auditor 
about its reporting responsibilities are set out on pages 52 
to 55 and 95 to 96 respectively.
Corporate governance 
continued Synthomer plc Annual Report 2013  31  
Governance
Environmental matters
The maintenance of high standards of environmental  
(together with health and safety) protection is central to the 
Company’s business. A separate statement on safety, health 
and environmental (SHE) matters has been a feature of the 
annual report for a number of years. The Corporate social 
responsibility report statement on pages 20 to 23 includes 
a report on the initiatives the Company has adopted 
regarding sustainable development.
Social, community and human rights matters
The Board takes account of social and ethical matters as part 
of its review of internal control which, by virtue of its approach 
to risk identiﬁcation, covers areas which encompass social 
and ethical matters.
The Board is conscious of its responsibility to the communities 
in which the Group’s businesses operate and encourages 
local engagement by management which includes supporting 
environmental, health and education initiatives.
The Board is also aware of the reputational and legal risks 
associated with social and ethical issues and has a Group-
wide code of business conduct on corruption and anti-
competitive activities, which is available on the Company’s 
website and upon request from the Company Secretary.  
The purpose of this code is to ensure that the Group’s 
employees have a clear understanding of the principles that 
are important in these areas when conducting the Group’s 
business. The application of the code is explained to senior 
management at regular intervals and they are charged with  
its communication throughout their businesses supported  
by internal and external training. A compliance procedure 
involving annual certiﬁcation by regional senior management 
and a procedure for maintaining a register of, and where 
appropriate gaining prior approval for, gifts, entertainment  
and corporate hospitality operates throughout the Group.  
A report is made to the Audit Committee annually on the  
code and the Company’s whistleblowing procedure.
The Group’s operating activities are highly regulated in 
all territories and largely carried out in countries that have 
established legislation on human rights issues. As such 
information on human rights issues is not considered to 
be necessary for an understanding of the development, 
performance or position of the Group’s business. The Group 
has nonetheless adopted a policy on equal opportunities, 
diversity and human rights which is available at 
www.synthomer.com.
The Company is a member of the FTSE4Good Index.
The process was last reviewed by the Synthomer Board of 
Directors in February 2014. The nature of the risks identiﬁed 
as a result of this process during the year primarily relate to 
matters of an operational and ﬁnancial nature and the most 
signiﬁcant of those which faced the Group in 2013 are 
reviewed in the Strategic report.
Risks associated with safety, health and the environment are, 
by the nature of the Group’s business, always of the utmost 
concern and the corporate social responsibility report  
on pages 20 to 23 reviews the Group’s performance in this 
connection in 2013.
The processes which are used by the Board either directly  
or, where appropriate, through the Audit Committee to review 
the effectiveness of the internal control and risk management 
systems (including in relation to the ﬁnancial reporting process 
and the process for preparing consolidated accounts) include 
the following:
• a review of the external audit work plan;
• consideration of reports from management and external 
parties, including the internal and external auditor, on the 
system of internal ﬁnancial control and any material control 
weaknesses;
• a quarterly review of safety, health and environmental 
performance; 
• discussion with management of the actions taken on  
any possible problem areas for the business identiﬁed  
by Board members or in the audit report;
• consideration of a consolidated risk management report 
setting out the main conclusions from the internal control 
process; and
• a biannual report from the internal audit function.
In addition, the Board:
• receives copies of the minutes from all Audit  
Committee meetings;
• considers the role of the Group insurance programme;
• receives regular written and oral reports from management 
on all aspects of production, operations, ﬁnancial and risk 
management matters; and
• in compliance with Provision C.2.1 of the Combined Code 
the Board regularly reviews and approves the effectiveness 
of the Group’s system of internal controls.
The Board conﬁrms that a review of the effectiveness of the 
Company’s risk management and internal control systems 
was carried out in 2013. 32  Synthomer plc Annual Report 2013  
Directors’ remuneration report
Remuneration Committee Chairman’s statement
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present the Company’s Directors’ Remuneration Report for the ﬁnancial year ending 31 December 2013. 
During the year we undertook a comprehensive review of our executive Director pay arrangements. We have concluded 
that the key principles and parameters of our remuneration policy do not need to change. The key elements of pay are:
• A competitive base salary.
• A short-term cash based incentive.
• A long-term share based incentive.
As part of the review we undertook a full benchmarking review of executive Director remuneration. The conclusions were 
that base salaries and other ﬁxed pay elements are broadly competitive.
The incentive structure was reviewed in the context of supporting Synthomer’s strategy to build a strong platform 
for long-term proﬁtable growth. The key changes we have made to our policy are as follows:
• Addition of strategic measures under the annual bonus and the performance share plan.
• A modest increase to PSP award opportunity.
• A recognition that EPS targets under the PSP should be stretching, but must also calibrate with the expectations  
for the business.
We undertook extensive shareholder consultation on our proposals. The Committee was very pleased with the 
constructive dialogue and responses from its shareholders to the new policy. 
Out-turns for 2014
For 2014 base salaries have been increased by 2.5% which is lower than the average across the all-employee population. 
Under the annual bonus plan, the threshold level of PBT performance was not met and no annual bonuses have been paid.
Directors’ Remuneration Report
This is the ﬁrst report presented in the new format as prescribed by the new reporting regulations. Accordingly our 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy will be subject to a binding vote and our Annual Report on Remuneration will be subject  
to an advisory vote. We hope we will have the support of our shareholders for both reports. 
Remuneration Committee
I am delighted to report that Brendan Connolly, who joined your Board and the Committee in January 2014, has agreed 
to take over the Chair of the Committee next month. I would like to thank the members of the Committee for their work 
and support during my chairmanship.

Governance
Directors’ Remuneration – Policy principles
The key principles for executive Directors’ remuneration at Synthomer are as follows:
• Sufﬁcient to attract and retain executive Directors of the ability and expertise necessary to achieve the strategic goals  
of the Company.
• Incentivise executive Directors by rewarding performance and driving the right behaviours.
• Align executive Director reward with the experience of shareholders. 
In setting executive Directors’ remuneration, the Committee takes account of pay and conditions throughout the Company.  
The Committee also considers corporate governance requirements and best practice in terms of remuneration structures and 
the process of setting executive remuneration.
The Committee reviews performance targets regularly to ensure that they do not encourage or motivate inappropriate risk 
taking. Furthermore, the Committee, when necessary, will take into account any environmental, social and governance (ESG) 
events and the Audit Committee’s risk assessment when assessing performance.
The following diagram provides an overview of the key elements of reward for executive Directors and the performance 
measures used.
Directors’ Remuneration Policy
The following sections set out our Directors’ Remuneration Policy (the “Policy”). This Policy will be put forward for shareholder 
approval at the 2014 AGM in accordance with section 439A of the Companies Act 2006. This Policy is effective from the 2014 
AGM on 1 May 2014.
The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of ofﬁce (including exercising any 
discretions available to it in connection with such payment) notwithstanding that they are not in line with the policy set out below 
where the terms of the payment were agreed (i) before the policy came into effect or (ii) at a time when the relevant individual 
was not a Director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was not in consideration for the individual 
becoming a Director of the Company. For these purposes “payments” includes the Committee satisfying awards of variable 
remuneration and, in relation to an award over shares, the terms of the payment were “agreed” at the time the award is granted.

Shareholding 
guidelines
The Company operates shareholding guidelines for executive Directors. The current guidelines are detailed 
in the annual report on Remuneration (page 42).
Provisions to withhold or recover sums paid under incentives are as detailed in the table above. No other elements  
of remuneration are subject to recovery provisions. 
The Committee may make minor amendments to the Policy (for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative purposes 
or to take account of a change in legislation) without obtaining shareholder approval for that amendment. 
The 2011 Performance Share Plan shall be operated in accordance with the rules of the plan as approved by shareholders. 
In accordance with the plan rules:
• The performance condition may be replaced or varied if an event occurs which causes the Committee reasonably to 
consider that it would be appropriate to amend the performance condition, in which case the Committee can vary or replace 
the performance condition provided that the amended performance condition is in its opinion, fair, reasonable and not 
materially less difﬁcult than the original condition when set. 
• The Committee may determine that awards will be settled in cash.
• The Committee may make adjustments to awards in the event of a variation of share capital, a demerger, rights issue, 
special dividend or other similar events.
Performance measures and targets
Annual bonus
The annual bonus performance measures are chosen to provide an appropriate balance between incentivising executive 
Directors to meet ﬁnancial targets for the year and to deliver speciﬁc strategic and operational goals. This balance allows  
the Remuneration Committee to effectively reward performance against the key elements of our strategy.
The bonus targets are set by the Remuneration Committee each year to ensure that executive Directors are appropriately 
focused on the key objectives for the next 12 months. Targets are set by reference to the Company’s business plan.

Governance
Performance Share Plan
The performance measures under the PSP are set to align with the long-term strategy of the Company and long-term value 
creation for shareholders.
• EPS growth – reﬂects the ﬁnancial performance of the Company. The Committee sets targets to be appropriately stretching, 
with regard to a number of internal and external reference points.
• Relative TSR – Total Shareholder Return (TSR) reﬂects the Company’s ultimate delivery of value to shareholders. 
The Committee considers that this promotes alignment between the interests of executive Directors and the shareholder 
experience. 
• Strategic measures – This element directly incentivises management to deliver the Company’s key strategic priorities. 
• The Committee considers that this performance framework represents an appropriate and balanced basis on which 
to measure the performance of the Company.
Difference in policy for executive Directors and other employees
The remuneration policy for our executive Directors is designed in accordance with the same principles that underpin 
remuneration for the wider employee population. The wider employee group also participate in performance-based incentives. 
Throughout the Group, base salary and beneﬁt levels are set in accordance with the prevailing market conditions. Differences 
between executive Director pay policy and other employee pay reﬂect the seniority of the individuals, the prevailing market 
conditions and the corporate governance practices for executive Director remuneration. The key difference in policy is that 
for executive Directors a greater proportion of total remuneration is based on incentives. 
Non-executive Director fees
Non-
executive 
Director fees
The Board reviews non-executive Director fees periodically. When reviewing fee levels the Board  
may consider the scope and time commitment of the role, the skills and experience of the individual,  
and fee levels at other companies. Non-executive Directors do not participate in the determination  
of their own fees.
Non-executives are paid differential fee levels based on their membership of Board committees, 
chairmanship of Board committees or role as Senior Independent Director.
Expenses incurred in the performance of non-executive duties for the Company may be reimbursed  
or paid for directly by the Company, as appropriate, including any tax due on the expenses. 
Chairman 
fees
The Remuneration Committee review Chairman fees periodically. When reviewing fee levels they  
may consider the scope and time commitment of the role, the skills and experience of the individual,  
and fee levels at other companies. The Chairman does not participate in the determination of the fee level.
Expenses incurred in the performance of duties for the Company may be reimbursed or paid for directly 
by the Company, as appropriate, including any tax due on the expenses. 
Total fees to non-executives, including the Chairman, operate within the cap deﬁned in the Articles of Association currently 
£750,000 per annum.
Recruitment policy
Executive Directors
The Committee would have regard to the following principles when agreeing the components of a remuneration package  
upon the recruitment of a new executive Director:
• Base salary will be set taking into account the principles set out in the policy table and may be set at a level higher or lower 
than the previous incumbent. 
• The Committee may, on appointing an executive Director, need to ‘buy out’ remuneration arrangements forfeited on leaving 
a previous employer. Any buyout would take into account the terms of the arrangements (e.g. form of award, performance 
conditions, timeframe) being forfeited in the previous package. The form of any award would be determined at the time  
and the Committee may if necessary make use of LR 9.4.2 of the Listing Rules (for the purpose of buyout awards only).  
The overriding principle will be that any replacement buy-out awards will, in the opinion of the Committee, be no more 
valuable than the entitlement which has been forfeited.  38  Synthomer plc Annual Report 2013  
Directors’ remuneration report 
continued
• Annual bonus opportunity will be no more than the maximum set out in the policy table. The Committee may determine 
that for the ﬁrst year of appointment the annual bonus award will be subject to such conditions as it may determine.
• PSP opportunity will be no more than the plan rules maximum set out in the policy table. The exceptional maximum may 
be used for the purpose of recruitment.
• The maximum variable pay opportunity on recruitment (excluding buyouts) is 400% of salary, consistent with the maximums 
in the policy table above.
• The Committee may extend leaving arrangements to include a payment in lieu of notice to cover beneﬁts as well as base 
salary for the outstanding period.
Other
For interim positions a cash supplement may be paid rather than salary (for example a non-executive Director taking on an 
executive function on a short-term basis).
Where an executive is appointed from within the Company, the normal policy of the Company is that any legacy arrangements 
would be honoured in line with the original terms and conditions and that they would be appointed on a new service contract. 
Similarly, if an executive Director is appointed following the acquisition of or merger with another company, legacy terms and 
conditions would be honoured.
Non-executive Directors and Chairman 
In the event of the appointment of a new non-executive Director or Chairman, remuneration arrangements will be in line with  
the principles detailed in the relevant table above.
Service contracts
The current contracts in place for executive Directors are as follows:
Director Date of contract
A M Whitﬁeld 22 November 2005
D C Blackwood 12 September 2007
There is no unexpired term as each of the executive Directors’ contracts is on a rolling basis. Save in circumstances justifying 
summary termination the notice period for each of the above contracts is one year. Service contracts for new executive 
Directors will be limited to 12 months’ notice. 
The executive Directors are also entitled to 25 working days’ holiday plus public holidays per holiday year.
All non-executive Directors are appointed in writing. Letters of appointment do not include entitlement to participation in the 
Company’s share incentive plans or any other of its employee beneﬁts, and do not currently have a notice period. The Company 
may add a notice period of no more than 3 months. The non-executive Directors are subject to annual re-election. There is  
no right to compensation for loss of ofﬁce if they are not re-elected or if the Company terminates the appointment because  
the non-executive Director has accepted a position with another company without prior board approval and which the Board 
reasonably considers likely to give rise to a material conﬂict. The periods of appointment and the requirements for re-election of 
non-executive Directors are provided within the Performance Evaluation section of the Corporate Governance report on page 26. 
Directors’ service contracts and letters of appointment are available for inspection at the Company’s registered ofﬁce during 
normal business hours and will be available at the Annual General Meeting.
Policy on payment for loss of ofﬁce
The Committee takes a number of factors into account when determining leaving arrangements for an executive Director.
• Where either party gives notice of the termination of an executive Directors’ employment, the Committee may make 
a payment in lieu of notice based on the base salary for the outstanding period. Other than this provision, the obligation  
to pay accrued but untaken holiday and as outlined below regarding bonus and the Performance Share Plan, service 
contracts make no provision for pre-deﬁned compensation on termination. The Committee may include beneﬁts  
(including pension) for the payment in respect of the outstanding period. The following principles shall apply when 
determining payments for loss of ofﬁce for current and new executive directors. Notwithstanding the provisions of the 
executive directors service contracts, the Committee may structure compensation payments in such a way as it deems 
appropriate (for example, considering making phased payments and/or requiring the executive director to mitigate his loss) 
taking into account the circumstances of departure including performance and bearing in mind any potential consequences. Synthomer plc Annual Report 2013  39  
Governance
• If employment is terminated by the Company the departing executive Directors may have a legal entitlement (under statute  
or otherwise) to additional amounts, which would need to be met. In addition, the Committee retains discretion to settle any 
claims by or on behalf of the executive Director in return for making an appropriate payment and contributing to legal fees 
incurred by the executive Director in connection with termination of employment where the Company wishes to enter into 
a settlement agreement and the individual must seek independent legal advice. These arrangements will be used sparingly 
and only entered into where the Committee believes it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to do so.
• While there is no entitlement to a bonus when a Director leaves employment or serves notice before 31 March following  
the year end (except in the case of death or retirement), the Committee may award an annual bonus for leavers taking into 
account the circumstances of departure. Any bonus would normally be subject to performance and time pro-rating and 
would not be made in circumstances of poor performance. 
• The treatment of outstanding share awards is governed by the relevant share plan rules. The following table summarises  
the leaver provisions of the 2011 Performance Share Plan under which executive Directors may currently hold awards 
in the form of share options or conditional rights to receive shares.

• Awards will normally vest on a time-apportioned 
basis and subject to the achievement of 
performance conditions at the relevant vesting 
date. The Committee may dis-apply or modify  
the time pro-rating of unvested awards.
• The vesting date for such awards will normally  
be the original vesting date, although the 
Committee may determine that awards can vest 
upon the later of cessation of employment or the 
assessment of any performance condition relating 
to such cessation.
• Awards in the form of options that vest early due  
to cessation of employment may be exercisable 
until the earlier of (i) 12 months from the date of 
vesting, and (ii) the normal expiry of the exercise 
period. Following this date unexercised awards  
will lapse.
• If the participant ceases employment after the 
normal vesting date, options may be exercisable 
until the earlier of 12 months from the date of 
cessation, or the normal expiry of the exercise 
period. Following this date unexercised awards  
will lapse.
• In the event of death following cessation of 
employment all unvested awards shall vest  
on the date of death on a time-apportioned  
basis and subject to the achievement of 
performance conditions.

normally lapse in full

Directors’ remuneration report 
continued
Vested shares under the 2002 Performance Share Plan are exercisable before the sooner of ten years from the date of grant 
of the original award or twelve months from the date of cessation of employment.
Where an award is made for the purpose of recruitment (for example a buyout award) then the leaver provisions would be 
determined at the time of award having regard to the circumstances of the recruitment, the terms of awards being bought 
out and the principles for leavers in the current policy.
On change of control or in the event of a demerger, special dividend or other similar event treatment will be in accordance 
with the rules of the 2011 Performance Share Plan.
In the event of a change of control of the Company, unvested awards may vest subject to achievement of the performance 
conditions and time pro-rating. In such circumstances the Committee may elect to dis-apply or modify the time pro-rating 
of unvested awards. In the event of an internal reorganisation the Committee may determine that unvested awards are 
automatically surrendered for a new award which the Committee determines is equivalent to the surrendered award (including 
as to any performance condition) except that it shall be over shares in the acquiring company or some other company.
In the event of a demerger, special dividend or other similar event which, in the opinion of the Committee, would materially  
affect the market price of shares, the Committee may allow awards to vest, subject to time pro-rating (unless dis-applied) and 
achievement of the performance conditions.

Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Company
When setting the policy for the remuneration of the executive Directors, the Committee has regard to the pay and employment 
conditions of employees within the Group. The Committee considers salary increases within the business but does not formally 
consider comparison metrics.
The Committee does not consult directly with employees when formulating the remuneration policy for executive Directors. 
Consideration of shareholder views
The Committee undertook a comprehensive review of the remuneration policy during 2013. The Committee consulted with  
its largest shareholders as part of this process, and shareholders’ comments were taken into account by the Committee  
in ﬁnalising the remuneration policy.
Annual Report on Remuneration
Operation of the Executive Director Remuneration Policy for 2014
During 2013 the Committee undertook a comprehensive review of executive remuneration. This review was on a ‘clean sheet’ 
basis, with the aim of developing a long-term remuneration policy that supports Synthomer’s strategy and which will remain 
in place for at least three years (see Policy Report, pages 33 to 41). The key changes we have made to our policy are as follows:
• Addition of strategic measures under the annual bonus and the performance share plan (PSP). 
• A modest increase to PSP award opportunity. This reﬂects a market review of total remuneration opportunity, against the 
background of the performance demonstrated by our highly experienced management team, and the increased size and 
scale of the Group. 
• A recognition that EPS targets under the PSP should be stretching, but must also calibrate with the expectations  
for the business. 
The speciﬁc remuneration arrangements for 2014 are described below: 
Base salary Salary increases of 2.5%, effective 1 January 2014. 
2014 salaries:
• A W Whitﬁeld: £512,500
• D C Blackwood: £320,441
Pension and beneﬁts No changes. Executives receive a cash allowance in lieu of pension contributions, 
a fully expensed car and private health insurance. 
2014 cash allowances in lieu of pension contributions:
• A W Whitﬁeld: 25% of salary
• D C Blackwood: 20% of salary
Annual bonus For 2014, performance under the annual bonus will be measured on the 
following basis:
• 80% subject to performance against underlying proﬁt before tax targets
• 20% subject to performance measures against key strategic and 
operational objectives.
• Targets and objectives are considered by the Board to be commercially 
sensitive. However, the Committee will provide information on targets and 
objectives retrospectively.
2014 maximum award opportunity:
• A W Whitﬁeld: 100% of salary
• D C Blackwood: 100% of salary 42  Synthomer plc Annual Report 2013  
Performance share plan For awards made in 2014, performance will be measured as follows:
• 40% based on relative TSR performance versus FTSE 250 excluding 
investment trusts and ﬁnancial services companies: 
 – 25% of this element will vest for median performance
 – 100% vesting for upper quartile performance. 
 – Vesting on a straight line basis between these points.
• 40% based on underlying EPS growth: 
 – 25% of this element will vest for EPS growth of 4.5% per annum, 
 – 100% vesting for EPS growth of 10% per annum. 
 – Vesting on a straight line basis between these points. 
 –  This target range was set following consideration of the long-term strategy 
and the outlook for the markets in which we operate.
• 20% based on performance against three equally weighted measures directly 
linked to the delivery of the business strategy: 
 –  Proportion of sales from new products, measured over the 5 years to the  
end of the performance period – incentivising greater innovation through new 
product development.
 –  Growth in Asia EBIT – incentivising growing the scale and proﬁtability  
of operations in emerging markets.
 –  Cumulative Europe EBITDA – incentivising the delivery of stable cash ﬂows 
from our more mature European business to fund this international growth.
 – For each of these measures, 25% will vest for threshold performance.
 –  The targets for these measures, and the level of performance achieved,  
will be disclosed following the end of the performance period.
2014 maximum award opportunity:
• A W Whitﬁeld: 125% of salary 
• D C Blackwood: 110% of salary
Shareholding guidelines Executives are required to build unfettered interests in shares of at least 100%  
of salary. The Committee will keep the level under review.

4    Executive Directors are required to hold 100% of their annual salary in the Company’s shares. Until this requirement is met no sales of shares that  
vest under long-term incentive plans are permitted other than to satisfy tax liabilities that arise on the exercise of share awards under such plans.  
 The Committee considers that unfettered unexercised vested nil-cost awards are economically equivalent to shares and as such that they should count  
(on a net of tax basis) toward compliance with the 100% salary guideline. The Committee will keep the guideline level of share interest under review.

Mr A M Whitﬁeld is a non-executive Director of the Chemical Industries Association Limited and assumed the role of President

Jez Maiden
Just Jansz 
Ishbel Macpherson until 7 February 2013 and Chairman until that date
Brendan Connolly joined the Committee on 23 January 2014 and will become Chairman of the Committee on 1 March 2014 at which time Neil Johnson  
will step down.
The Committee’s composition was non compliant with the requirements of Code Provision D.2 for most of 2013 as it was 
comprised of only two Independent non-executive Directors and the Company chairman was also chairman of the Committee. 
This composition was adopted as an interim measure due to the Board not having available to it the resources to staff a fully 
compliant Remuneration Committee and in the circumstances it was considered most appropriate for the chairman to lead the 
processes required to meet the new Director remuneration reporting regulations.
Attendance at Committee meetings is set out on page 26.
Key duties of the Committee
The Committee is responsible for determining, in agreement with the Board, the Company’s policy on executive remuneration 
and the speciﬁc remuneration for the chairman and each of the executive Directors, including pension rights, within the terms of 
the agreed policy. The Committee is also responsible for reviewing the remuneration of senior executives throughout the Group.  48  Synthomer plc Annual Report 2013

Advisers
The Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, Chief Financial Ofﬁcer and Company Secretary are invited to attend Committee meetings to 
contribute to the Committee in its deliberations. However, no individual is involved in discussions, or is part of any decisions, 
relating to their own remuneration.
The Committee received independent advice from New Bridge Street (a trading name of Aon Hewitt Limited) for the three 
months to 31 March 2013. Following a review, from April 2013 the Committee appointed Deloitte LLP as the Committee’s 
independent remuneration advisors. 
During the year, New Bridge Street provided advice on market data that materially assisted the committee. The fees paid to 
New Bridge Street in respect of this work in 2013 totalled £1,000. Aon Hewitt Limited is part of Aon Group as is Aon Limited 
which provides insurance broking services to the Group. The Committee was satisﬁed that this did not compromise the 
independence of the advice received from New Bridge Street. 
During the year, Deloitte provided advice on new reporting regulations, market data and other remuneration matters that 
materially assisted the Committee. The fees paid to Deloitte in respect of this work were charged on a time and expenses basis 
and totalled £93,850 for advice in 2013. Deloitte also provided tax services to the Company in the year. The Committee was 
satisﬁed that this did not compromise the independence of the advice received.
Both New Bridge Street and Deloitte are founding members of the Remuneration Consultants Group, and adhere to its code  
of conduct. In each case the ﬁrms were appointed directly by the Committee, and the Committee is satisﬁed that the advice 
received was objective and independent.

Voting outcome
Following the 2013 AGM the Chairman spoke with a number of institutional shareholders in relation to the key concerns.  
The points raised included the exercise of discretion to award an annual bonus for exceeding synergy targets, and the 5.8% 
increase to the CEO’s salary. 
Shortly before the AGM, the Committee had appointed Deloitte LLP to assist in a comprehensive review of the executive 
Director arrangements. The Committee considered shareholders’ concerns as part of this review. 
The proposals were developed on a ‘clean sheet’ basis taking into account the following perspectives:
• The strategy of the business, and ensuring that incentives and performance measures supported that strategy.
• Best practice and corporate governance developments.
• Market review against companies of similar size and complexity.
The Committee chairman consulted extensively with shareholders following the review before ﬁnalising the proposals. It was 
appreciated that there were a range of views from shareholders on various matters. However, the Committee was pleased 
with the dialogue and level of support received during this process. 
A number of shareholders raised the question of increasing shareholding guidelines. The Committee is currently satisﬁed that 
the current shareholding guidelines are entirely consistent with practice in comparable FTSE 250 companies. The Committee 
will keep this area under review.

Results and dividends
The proﬁt attributable to shareholders for the year was

shareholders and this alternative will continue to be offered 
until further notice.
Financial instruments
Details of the Group’s use of ﬁnancial instruments and  
its ﬁnancial risk management objectives and policies,  
and of its exposure to price, credit, liquidity and cash ﬂow  
risk in relation to such instruments, are contained in note 22 
to the ﬁnancial statements.
Directors
The present membership of the Board is shown on page 24  
all of whom served throughout the year apart from Mr B W D 
Connolly who joined on 20 January 2014. All the Directors will 
retire and will be seeking election or re-election as appropriate 
at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
None of the Directors seeking election or re-election has a 
service contract other than Mr Whitﬁeld and Mr Blackwood 
who each have a service contract which contains a twelve 
month notice period. Details of Directors’ emoluments and the 
interests of each Director in the share capital of the Company 
are shown in the Directors’ remuneration report on  
pages 32 to 48.
Director indemnity provisions
Under the Company’s Articles of Association, the Directors 
of the Company have the beneﬁt of a qualifying third-party 
indemnity provision which provides that they shall be 
indemniﬁed by the Company against certain liabilities as 
permitted by Sections 232 and 234 of the Companies Act 
2006 and against costs incurred by them in relation to  
any liability for which they are indemniﬁed. The Company  
has purchased and maintains insurance against Directors’  
and ofﬁcers’ liabilities in relation to the Company.
Share capital and control
Details of the Company’s share capital are contained in note 
26 to the ﬁnancial statements. During 2013 no shares were 
issued or repurchased. A total of 195,730 shares were 
purchased on the open market on behalf of the shareholders 
who elected to participate in the dividend reinvestment plan.
The rights and obligations attaching to the Company’s 
ordinary shares, being the only class of issued share capital, 
as well as the powers of the Company’s Directors, are set out 
in the Company’s Articles of Association, copies of which can 
be obtained from Companies House or can be downloaded 
from the Company’s website. There are no restrictions on the 
voting rights attaching to the Company’s ordinary shares or 
on the transfer of securities in the Company. No person holds 
securities in the Company carrying special rights with regard 
to the control of the Company. The Company is not aware of 
any agreements between holders of securities that may result 
in restrictions on the transfer of securities or on voting rights. 
Unless expressly speciﬁed to the contrary in the Articles of 
Association of the Company, the Company’s Articles of 
Association may be amended by special resolution of the 
Company’s shareholders.
Other than in relation to its borrowings which, unless certain 
conditions are satisﬁed, become repayable on a takeover, 
the Company is not party to any signiﬁcant agreements that 
would take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control 
following a takeover bid. The Company does not have 
agreements with any Director or employee that would provide 
compensation for loss of ofﬁce or employment resulting from 
a takeover.
All of the Company’s share schemes contain provisions 
relating to a change of control. Outstanding options and 
awards would normally vest and become exercisable on 
a change of control, subject to the satisfaction of any 
performance conditions at that time.

Going concern
The Directors have acknowledged the latest guidance on 
going concern and in reaching their conclusions have taken 
into account factors including:
• the Group’s euro denominated £150 million term loan 
facility and £60 million multicurrency revolving credit facility 
which terminate on 31 March 2015; and
• the second repayment under the 2004 series private 
placement notes of US$70 million due in September 2014.

resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis 
in preparing the annual report and accounts.

Statement as to disclosure of information to auditor
Each Director of the Company conﬁrms that, so far as he 
is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the 
Company’s auditor is unaware and that he has taken all the 
steps that he ought to have taken as a Director in order to

to establish that the Company’s auditor is aware of that 
information. For these purposes, relevant audit information

of going concern basis
The Directors are responsible for preparing the annual report 
and the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare ﬁnancial 
statements for each ﬁnancial year. Under that law the 
Directors are required to prepare the Group ﬁnancial 
statements in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European 
Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have elected  
to prepare the parent company ﬁnancial statements in 
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards 
and applicable law). Under company law the Directors must 
not approve the accounts unless they are satisﬁed that they 
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company 
and of the proﬁt or loss of the Company for that period.
In preparing the parent company ﬁnancial statements, 
the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards  
have been followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the ﬁnancial statements; and
• prepare the ﬁnancial statements on the going concern 
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business.
In preparing the Group ﬁnancial statements, International 
Accounting Standard 1 requires that Directors:
• properly select and apply accounting policies;
• present information, including accounting policies,  
in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable 
and understandable information;
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
speciﬁc requirements in IFRSs are insufﬁcient to enable 
users to understand the impact of particular transactions, 
other events and conditions on the entity’s ﬁnancial 
position and ﬁnancial performance; and
• make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufﬁcient to show and explain  
the Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the ﬁnancial position of the Company 
and enable them to ensure that the ﬁnancial statements 
comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company  
and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention  
and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 52  Synthomer plc Annual Report 2013  
Report on the Group ﬁnancial statements
Our opinion  
 In our opinion the Group ﬁnancial statements, deﬁned below:
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2013 and of the Group’s proﬁt and cash ﬂows 
for the year then ended;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
This opinion is to be read in the context of what we say in the remainder of this report.
What we have audited
The Group ﬁnancial statements (the “ﬁnancial statements”), which are prepared by Synthomer plc, comprise:
• the Consolidated balance sheet and Analysis of net borrowings as at 31 December 2013;
• the Consolidated income statement and Consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year then ended;
• the Consolidated statement of changes in equity and Consolidated cash ﬂow statement for the year then ended; and
• the notes to the ﬁnancial statements, which include a summary of signiﬁcant accounting policies and other 
explanatory information.
The ﬁnancial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation comprises applicable law and IFRSs as adopted  
by the European Union.
What an audit of ﬁnancial statements involves 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (ISAs (UK & Ireland)).  
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements sufﬁcient to give reasonable 
assurance that the ﬁnancial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of:
• whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed;
• the reasonableness of signiﬁcant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and 
• the overall presentation of the ﬁnancial statements. 
In addition, we read all the ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial information in the Annual Report for the ﬁnancial year to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited ﬁnancial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based 
on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of  
any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Overview of our audit approach
Materiality
We set certain thresholds for materiality. These helped us to determine the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures 
and to evaluate the effect of misstatements, both individually and on the ﬁnancial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the Group ﬁnancial statements as a whole to be 
£4.1 million, which represents 4.5% of underlying proﬁt (being proﬁt before tax adjusted for special items). We used underlying 
proﬁt for our materiality judgement because it is the principal measure used by the Directors in the Annual Report to discuss  
the Group’s ﬁnancial performance. 
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identiﬁed during our audit above £200,000 
as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.

Group ﬁnancial statements
Overview of the scope of our audit
The Group has business operations worldwide, principally in Europe and Asia, the largest being Germany, Malaysia and  
the UK. The Group ﬁnancial statements are a consolidation of reporting units, being holding companies, intermediate holding 
companies and operations based in thirteen countries comprised of nineteen trading companies. 
In establishing the overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be performed at the 
reporting units by us, as the Group engagement team, or component auditors within PwC operating under our instruction. 
Where the work was performed by component auditors, we determined the level of involvement we needed to have in the audit 
work at those reporting units to be able to conclude whether sufﬁcient appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis 
for our opinion on the Group ﬁnancial statements as a whole. The Group engagement team visited operations in Germany and 
the UK as part of the audit. 
In determining our scope we considered the nature, location and size of the Group’s operations at each component and any 
signiﬁcant issues reported by local statutory audit teams around the Group. 
Based on this scoping, our Group audit focused on six reporting units which were all subject to audits of their complete ﬁnancial 
information and included Germany, Malaysia and the UK. Together with various head ofﬁce companies, which were also subject 
to audits of their complete ﬁnancial information, this accounted for 78% of the Group’s revenue, 79% of the Group’s operating 
proﬁt and 83% of the Group’s underlying proﬁt before tax. 
Areas of particular audit focus
In preparing the ﬁnancial statements, the Directors made a number of subjective judgements, for example in respect of 
signiﬁcant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. 
We primarily focused our work in these areas by assessing the Directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming our 
own judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements.
In our audit, we tested and examined information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we considered 
necessary to provide a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtained audit evidence through testing the 
effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures or a combination of both. 
We considered the following areas to be those that required particular focus in the current year. This is not a complete list  
of all risks or areas of focus identiﬁed by our audit. We discussed these areas of focus with the Audit Committee. Their report  
on those matters that they considered to be signiﬁcant issues in relation to the ﬁnancial statements is set out on page 29.
Area of focus
How the scope of our audit addressed 
the area of focus
Provisions for uncertain taxation positions
We focused on this area because the Group has a number 
of signiﬁcant taxation provisions, which by their nature 
require an element of judgement to determine an 
appropriate level to record them at. 
We requested and read the latest correspondence between 
the Group and the overseas tax authorities. 
We discussed the potential tax exposure with senior Group 
management and the basis for their positions with the 
Group’s in-house tax specialists. 
We utilised our experience of similar challenges elsewhere 
to independently assess the evidence for these provisions. 
Deﬁned beneﬁt pension accounting 
We focused on this area because the Group has signiﬁcant 
deﬁned beneﬁt pension schemes in the UK and Germany, 
with a material net pension liability recorded on the Group 
balance sheet. The net liability is based on a number  
of assumptions and is highly sensitive to small changes 
in these.
We evaluated the reasonableness of the assumptions used 
for the valuation of the UK and German pension schemes, 
focusing on the key ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial assumptions 
where a small movement in the assumption could lead to a 
signiﬁcant movement in the net pension liability. The key 
assumptions were the discount rate and mortality 
assumptions which are disclosed in note 25 of the Group 
ﬁnancial statements.
We compared these assumptions to our expected range  
for similar schemes as at the year end.  54  Synthomer plc Annual Report 2013  
Area of focus
How the scope of our audit addressed 
the area of focus
Fraud in revenue recognition 
ISAs (UK & Ireland) presume there is a risk of fraud in 
revenue recognition because of the pressure management 
may feel to achieve the planned results or expectations.
We focused on whether the revenue recognised 
corresponded to sales transactions that took place in  
the period. T o address this we tested a sample of revenue 
transactions in the year to supporting documentation.  
We also used data analysis techniques to identify any 
unusual transactions relating to revenue, and tested these. 
In addition we tested manual journal entries posted to 
revenue accounts, obtaining supporting evidence to 
determine that the journal was appropriate. 
Risk of management override of internal controls 
ISAs (UK & Ireland) require us to consider the risk 
associated with management override of controls.  
We assessed the overall control environment of the Group, 
including the arrangements for staff to “whistle-blow” 
inappropriate actions, and assessed the results of the 
Group’s internal audit reviews that took place in the year. 
We examined the signiﬁcant accounting estimates and 
judgements relevant to the ﬁnancial statements for evidence 
of bias by the Directors that may represent a risk of material 
misstatement due to fraud with a particular focus on 
centrally held provisions and accruals. We also evaluated 
controls in place over the approval and processing of 
manual journals, testing manual journals that we considered 
to be higher risk in nature and obtaining supporting 
evidence to determine that these journals were appropriate.
Going concern
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the Directors’ statement, set out on page 51, in relation to going concern.  
We have nothing to report having performed our review.
As noted in the Directors’ statement, the Directors have concluded that it is appropriate to prepare the Group’s ﬁnancial 
statements using the going concern basis of accounting. The going concern basis presumes that the Group has adequate 
resources to remain in operation, and that the Directors intend it to do so, for at least one year from the date the  
ﬁnancial statements were signed. As part of our audit we have it that the Directors’ use of the going concern basis 
is appropriate.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the  
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Opinion on matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the ﬁnancial year for which the Group  
ﬁnancial statements are prepared is consistent with the Group ﬁnancial statements.
Other matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of information and explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion we have not received all the information  
and explanations we require for our audit. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration 
speciﬁed by law have not been made, and under the Listing Rules we are required to review certain elements of the report 
to shareholders by the Board on Directors’ remuneration. We have no exceptions to report arising from these responsibilities.

Corporate Governance Statement
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Company’s 
compliance with nine provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code (‘the Code’). We have nothing to report having 
performed our review.
On page 51 of the Annual Report, as required by the Code Provision C.1.1, the Directors state that they consider the Annual 
Report taken as a whole to be fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for members to 
assess the Group’s performance, business model and strategy. On page 29, as required by C.3.8 of the Code, the Audit 
Committee has set out the signiﬁcant issues that it considered in relation to the ﬁnancial statements, and how they were 
addressed. Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• the statement given by the Directors is materially inconsistent with our knowledge of the Group acquired in the course  
of performing our audit; or
• the section of the Annual Report describing the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately address matters 
communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Other information in the Annual Report
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the Annual Report is:
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited ﬁnancial statements; or
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group acquired  
in the course of performing our audit; or
• is otherwise misleading.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Responsibilities for the ﬁnancial statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the Directors 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 51, the Directors are responsible  
for the preparation of the Group ﬁnancial statements and for being satisﬁed that they give a true and fair view. 
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the Group ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
ISAs (UK & Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.

Synthomer plc is a company incorporated in the United 
Kingdom under the Companies Act. The address of the 
registered ofﬁce is given on page 24.
These ﬁnancial statements are presented in pounds sterling 
because that is the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the Group operates. Foreign operations 
are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 2.
New and amended standards adopted by the Group
The following standards have been adopted by the Group 
for the ﬁrst time for the ﬁnancial year beginning on or after 
1 January 2013 and have a material impact on the Group:
Amendment to IAS 1, ‘Financial statement presentation’ 
regarding other comprehensive income. The main change 
resulting from these amendments is a requirement for entities 
to Group items presented in ‘other comprehensive income’ 
(OCI) on the basis of whether they are potentially reclassiﬁable 
to proﬁt or loss subsequently (reclassiﬁcation adjustments).
IAS 19, ‘Employee beneﬁts’ was revised in June 2011.  
The changes on the Group’s accounting policies has been  
as follows: to immediately recognise all past service costs; and 
to replace interest cost and expected return on plan assets 
with a net interest amount that is calculated by applying  
the discount rate to the net deﬁned beneﬁt liability (asset).  
See note 33 for the impact on the ﬁnancial statements.
IFRS 13, ‘Fair value measurement’, aims to improve 
consistency and reduce complexity by providing a precise 
deﬁnition of fair value and a single source of fair value 
measurement and disclosure requirements for use across 
IFRSs. The requirements, which are largely aligned between 
IFRSs and US GAAP , do not extend the use of fair value 
accounting but provide guidance on how it should be applied 
where its use is already required or permitted by other 
standards within IFRSs.
New standards and interpretations not yet adopted
A number of new standards and amendments to standards 
and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning 
after 1 January 2013, and have not been applied in preparing 
these consolidated ﬁnancial statement. None of these is 
expected to have a signiﬁcant effect on the consolidated 
ﬁnancial statements of the Group, except the following set  
out below:
IFRS 12, ‘Disclosures of interests in other entities’, includes 
the disclosure requirements for all forms of interests in other 
entities, including joint arrangements, associates, special 
purpose vehicles and other off balance sheet vehicles. The 
adoption of this standard will have no impact on the primary 
statements. The only signiﬁcant impact will be an increase  
in the disclosure relating to the investment in joint ventures.
2 Signiﬁcant accounting policies
Basis of accounting
These ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted 
by the European Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU), IFRIC 
Interpretations and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to 
companies reporting under IFRS. The ﬁnancial statements 
have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for 
the revaluation of ﬁnancial instruments. As discussed in the 
Report of the Directors on page 50, the ﬁnancial statements 
have been prepared on a going concern basis. The principal 
accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements incorporate the ﬁnancial 
statements of the Company and entities controlled by the 
Company (its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each 
year. Control is achieved where the Company has the power 
to govern the ﬁnancial and operating policies of an investee 
entity so as to obtain beneﬁts from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the 
year are included in the consolidated income statement from 
the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date  
of disposal, as appropriate. Where necessary, adjustments  
are made to the ﬁnancial statements of subsidiaries to  
bring the accounting policies used into line with those used  
by the Group.
The results of joint ventures are accounted for using equity 
accounting.
Minority interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries 
are identiﬁed separately from the Group’s equity therein. 
Minority interests consist of the amount of those interests  
at the date of the original business combination (see below) 
and the minority’s share of changes in equity since the date  
of combination.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses 
are eliminated on consolidation.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the 
cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of 
the identiﬁable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, associate 
or jointly controlled entity at the date of acquisition. Goodwill  
is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at least 
annually at the operating segment level. Any impairment is 
recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement 
and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to 
each of the Group’s cash generating units expected to beneﬁt 
from the synergies of the combination. Cash-generating units 
to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment 
annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that 
the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the 
cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of  
the unit, the impairment loss is allocated ﬁrst to reduce the 
carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and  
then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis  
of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled 
entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in  
the determination of the proﬁt or loss on disposal. Group ﬁnancial statements
Synthomer plc Annual Report 2013  61  
Group ﬁnancial statements
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition  
to IFRSs has been retained at the previous UK GAAP 
amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date. 
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 
has not been reinstated and is not included in determining  
any subsequent proﬁt or loss on disposal.
Business combinations
Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted  
for using the acquisition method. The consideration for each 
acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values 
(at the date of exchange) of assets given, liabilities incurred  
or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in 
exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs 
are recognised in proﬁt or loss as incurred.
The acquiree’s identiﬁable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 
3(2008) are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition 
date, except that:
• deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets 
related to employee beneﬁt arrangements are recognised 
and measured in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes 
and IAS 19 Employee Beneﬁts respectively;
• assets (or disposal groups) that are classiﬁed as held for 
sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current assets held 
for sale and discontinued operations are measured in 
accordance with that standard.
If the initial accounting for a business combination is 
incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the 
combination occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts 
for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. Those 
provisional amounts are adjusted during the measurement 
period (see below), or additional assets or liabilities are 
recognised, to reﬂect new information obtained about facts 
and circumstance that existed as of the acquisition date that, 
if known, would have affected the amounts as of that date.
The measurement period is the period from the date of 
acquisition to the date the Group obtains complete information 
about facts and circumstances that existed as of the 
acquisition date, and is subject to a maximum of one year.
Acquired intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired through acquisition are measured 
at their fair value and are amortised on a straight-line basis 
over their estimated useful lives, on the following bases:
Customer relationships – between 5 and 8 years
Technology – 10 years
Where necessary the fair value at acquisition and estimated 
useful lives for these intangible assets are based on 
independent valuation reports.
Other intangible assets
Software development and environmental licensing costs 
resulting in development of a long-term intangible asset are 
measured initially at cost and are amortised on a straight-line 
basis over their estimated useful lives as follows:
Software – between 3 and 5 years
An internally-generated intangible asset arising from the 
Group’s product development is recognised only if all of 
the following conditions in IAS 38 are met:
• an asset is created that can be separately identiﬁed  
(such as software and new processes);
• it is technically feasible to complete the asset;
• management intends to complete the development;
• there is an ability to use or sell the asset once development 
has been completed;
• it is probable that the asset created will generate future 
economic beneﬁts;
• adequate technical, ﬁnancial and other resources  
to complete the development are available; and
• the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
No research or development costs met the criteria for  
required capitalisation under IAS 38 during the year.
Where no internally-generated intangible asset can be 
recognised, development expenditure is recognised as 
an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost (original 
purchase price and the costs attributable to bringing the  
asset to its working condition for its intended use), net of 
accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment. 
Except for freehold land and land grants in Malaysia, which 
are not depreciated, the cost of property, plant and equipment 
is depreciated on a straight-line basis over its expected useful 
life as follows:
Freehold buildings – 50 years
Leasehold land and buildings –  the lesser of 50 years and  
the period of the lease
Plant and equipment – between 3 and 10 years
Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible 
assets excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying 
amounts of its plant, property and equipment and intangible 
assets to determine whether there is any indication that those 
assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication 
exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in 
order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). 
Where the asset does not generate cash ﬂows that are 
independent from other assets, the Group estimates the 
recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which 
the asset belongs. 62  Synthomer plc Annual Report 2013  
Notes to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements 
continued
2 Signiﬁcant accounting policies continued
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs  
to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the 
estimated future cash ﬂows are discounted to their present 
value using a pre-tax discount rate that reﬂects current  
market assessments of the time value of money and the  
risks speciﬁc to the asset for which the estimates of future 
cash ﬂows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) 
is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying 
amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its 
recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an 
expense immediately.
When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying 
amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is increased to 
the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that  
the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying 
amount that would have been determined had no impairment 
loss been recognised in prior years. A reversal of an 
impairment loss is recognised immediately in proﬁt or loss.
Operating leases
Operating lease payments are expensed on a straight-line 
basis to the income statement over the term of the relevant 
lease. Any beneﬁts received as an incentive to enter into an 
operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over 
the lease term.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable 
value. Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, 
direct labour costs and those overheads that have been 
incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location 
and condition. Cost is calculated using the weighted average 
method. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling 
price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to  
be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution. Provision  
is made for obsolete, slow-moving or defective items  
where appropriate.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities are recognised on  
the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party 
to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Loans and receivables
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are measured at initial recognition at  
fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised  
cost using the effective interest rate method. Appropriate 
allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are 
recognised in proﬁt or loss where there is objective  
evidence that the asset is impaired.
All trade receivables that are factored by third parties are  
done so on a non-recourse basis. At the point of factoring,  
the Group forfeits the right to future cash ﬂows from these 
receivables and those amounts are derecognised. The cost  
of factoring receivables is recognised as a ﬁnance cost in  
the period in which the receivable is factored.
Amortised costs
Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the 
proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, 
including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and 
direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis  
to the income statement using the effective interest method 
and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to  
the extent that they are not settled in the period in which  
they arise.
Trade payables
Trade payables are measured at initial recognition at fair value 
and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest rate method.
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments
The Group uses derivative ﬁnancial instruments to reduce 
exposure to foreign exchange risk and interest rate 
movements. The Group does not hold or issue derivative 
ﬁnancial instruments for speculative purposes.
The use of ﬁnancial derivatives is governed by the Group’s 
policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide 
written principles on the use of ﬁnancial derivatives, as set  
out in note 22.
Impairment of ﬁnancial assets
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying 
amounts of its ﬁnancial assets to determine whether there is 
any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment 
loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of 
the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the 
impairment loss (if any).
Finance costs
Finance costs of debt are recognised in the income statement 
over the term of such instruments at an effective interest  
rate on the carrying amount. Finance costs that are directly 
attributable to the construction of property, plant and 
equipment are capitalised as part of the cost of those assets 
in accordance with IAS 23.
Foreign currencies 
In preparing the ﬁnancial statements of the individual 
companies, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s 
functional currency are recorded at the rates of exchange 
prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each balance 
sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are 
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the  
rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Non-monetary 
assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated 
in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at 
the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary 
items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign 
currency are not retranslated.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange 
risks, the Group enters into forward contracts and options 
(see below for details of the Group’s accounting policies  
in respect of such derivative ﬁnancial instruments).  Group ﬁnancial statements
Synthomer plc Annual Report 2013  63  
Group ﬁnancial statements
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s 
overseas operations are translated at exchange rates 
prevailing on the balance sheet date. Income and expense 
items are translated at the average exchange rates for  
the period unless exchange rates ﬂuctuate signiﬁcantly. 
Exchange differences arising, if any, are classiﬁed as equity 
and transferred to the Group’s translation reserve. Such 
translation differences are recognised as income or as 
expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition 
of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the 
foreign entity and translated at the closing rate. The Group has 
elected to treat goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on 
acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRSs as sterling-
denominated assets and liabilities.
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments
The Group enters into a variety of derivative ﬁnancial 
instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and 
foreign exchange rate risk, including foreign exchange forward 
contracts, interest rate swaps and foreign currency options.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date 
a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently 
remeasured to their fair value at each balance sheet date. 
A derivative with a positive fair value is recognised as a 
ﬁnancial asset whereas a derivative with a negative fair value 
is recognised as a ﬁnancial liability. The resulting gain or loss 
is recognised in proﬁt or loss immediately unless the derivative 
is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which 
event the timing of the recognition in proﬁt or loss depends  
on the nature of the hedge relationship. The Group designates 
certain derivatives as either hedges of highly probable forecast 
transactions or hedges of foreign currency risk of ﬁrm 
commitments (cash ﬂow hedges), or hedges of net 
investments in foreign operations.
Hedge accounting
The Group designates certain hedging instruments, which 
include derivatives, embedded derivatives and non-derivatives 
in respect of foreign currency risk, as either cash ﬂow hedges, 
or hedges of net investments in foreign operations.
At the inception of the hedge relationship, the entity 
documents the relationship between the hedging instrument 
and the hedged item, along with its risk management 
objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge 
transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge  
and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether  
the hedging instrument that is used in a hedging relationship 
is highly effective in offsetting changes in cash ﬂows of the 
hedged item.
Cash ﬂow hedges
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives 
that are designated and qualify as cash ﬂow hedges are 
deferred in equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective 
portion is recognised immediately in the consolidated  
income statement.
Amounts deferred in equity are recycled in proﬁt or loss in the 
periods when the hedged item is recognised in proﬁt or loss, 
in the same line of the income statement as the recognised 
hedged item. However, when the forecast transaction that  
is hedged results in the recognition of a non-ﬁnancial asset  
or a non-ﬁnancial liability, the gains and losses previously 
deferred in equity are transferred from equity and included 
in the initial measurement of the cost of the non-ﬁnancial 
asset or non-ﬁnancial liability.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes 
the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires or  
is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualiﬁes for 
hedge accounting. Any cumulative gain or loss deferred in 
equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when 
the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in proﬁt or 
loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to 
occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was deferred in equity 
is recognised immediately in proﬁt or loss.
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are 
accounted for similarly to cash ﬂow hedges. Any gain or loss 
on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion  
of the hedge is recognised in equity in the foreign currency 
translation reserve. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective 
portion is recognised immediately in proﬁt or loss, and  
is included in the ‘other gains and losses’ line of the  
income statement.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits 
held at call with banks, restricted cash balances which 
become fully liquid within three months or less and other 
short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities  
of three months or less.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently 
payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable proﬁt for the 
year. Taxable proﬁt differs from net proﬁt as reported in the 
consolidated income statement because it excludes items  
of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other 
years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or 
deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated 
using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable 
on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities in the ﬁnancial statements and the corresponding  
tax bases used in the computation of taxable proﬁt, and  
is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. 
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable 
temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised 
to the extent that it is probable that taxable proﬁts will be 
available against which deductible temporary differences  
can be utilised. 64  Synthomer plc Annual Report 2013  
Notes to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements 
continued
2 Signiﬁcant accounting policies continued
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary 
differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and 
associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where  
the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary 
difference and it is probable that the temporary difference  
will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at 
each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it 
is no longer probable that sufﬁcient taxable proﬁts will be 
available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected  
to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset  
is realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income 
statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited 
directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt 
with in equity.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when  
there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets 
against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income 
taxes assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the 
same taxation authority on either the taxable entity or different 
taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the 
balances on a net basis.
Retirement beneﬁt costs 
The costs of deﬁned beneﬁt contributions to the Group’s 
pension schemes and of augmenting existing pensions  
are charged to the consolidated income statement on  
a systematic basis over the expected period of beneﬁts  
from employees’ service.
Payments to deﬁned contribution retirement beneﬁt schemes 
are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Actuarial gains on the deﬁned beneﬁt schemes are recognised 
in full in each period in which they occur. They are recognised 
outside of the consolidated income statement and are 
presented in the consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income.
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of 
deﬁned beneﬁt pension plans is the present value of the 
deﬁned beneﬁt obligation at the end of the reporting period 
less the fair value of plan assets, together with adjustments  
for unrecognised past-service costs. The deﬁned beneﬁt 
obligation is calculated annually using the projected unit credit 
method. The present value of the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation is 
determined by discounting the estimated future cash outﬂows 
using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are 
denominated in the currency in which the beneﬁts will be paid, 
and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms  
of the related pension obligation.
The UK deﬁned beneﬁt scheme is funded, with the assets  
of the scheme held separately from those of the Group,  
in separate trustee-administered funds.
For the German schemes, the assets are included within the 
assets of the respective companies, as permitted under local 
laws. The assets of the other overseas schemes are held 
separately from those of the Group.
Provisions
Provisions for warranty costs are recognised at the date of 
sale of the relevant products, at the Directors’ best estimate 
of the expenditure required to settle the Group’s liability.
Provisions for restructuring costs are recognised when the 
Group has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring that  
has been communicated to affected parties.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration 
received or receivable and represents amounts receivable  
for goods provided in the normal course of business,  
net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes.
Sales of goods are recognised when goods are delivered  
and title has passed, where delivery is deﬁned in accordance 
with Incoterms 2000.
Share-based payments
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2  
Share-based Payments.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments  
to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments  
are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value 
determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share- 
based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over  
the vesting period.
Deﬁnitions
Total sales
Total sales represent the total of revenue from the Company, 
its subsidiaries, and its share of the revenue of joint ventures.
Operating proﬁt
Operating proﬁt represents proﬁt from continuing activities 
before ﬁnancing costs and taxation.
EBITDA
EBITDA is calculated as operating proﬁt before depreciation, 
amortisation and special items (as deﬁned below).
Special items
The following are disclosed separately in order to provide  
a clearer indication of the Group’s underlying performance:
• Amortisation of acquired intangible assets;
• Impairment of non-current assets;
• Costs of business combinations;
• Re-structuring and site closure costs;
• Fair value adjustment – mark to market adjustments in 
respect of cross currency and interest rate derivatives used 
for hedging purposes where IAS 39 hedge accounting is 
not applied; Group ﬁnancial statements
Synthomer plc Annual Report 2013  65  
Group ﬁnancial statements
• Amounts advanced in respect of invoices sold under 
non-recourse factoring arrangements;
• Other non-recurring and non-operating items;
• Tax impact of the above items; and
• Settlement of prior period tax issues.
Underlying performance 
Underlying performance represents the statutory performance 
of the Group under IFRS, excluding special items.
Net borrowings
Net borrowings represents cash and cash equivalents 
together with short and long-term borrowings, as adjusted  
for the effect of related derivative instruments irrespective  
of whether they qualify for hedge accounting, non-recourse 
factoring arrangements, and the inclusion of Financial Assets.
Critical judgements in applying accounting policies
The following are the critical judgements, apart from those 
involving estimations (see below), that the Group has made  
in the process of applying the accounting policies and that 
have the most signiﬁcant effect on the amounts recognised  
in the ﬁnancial statements.
Going concern
The assessment that the ﬁnancial statements should be 
prepared on a going concern basis requires the Directors to 
make a judgement that, after taking account of reasonably 
possible changes in trading performance, the Group has 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence  
for the foreseeable future.
Recognition of deferred tax assets
The Group activities give rise to signiﬁcant potential deferred 
tax assets, particularly in respect of the UK pension liability,  
tax losses and accelerated capital allowances. Determination 
of whether these assets should be recognised requires a  
high degree of management judgement and is dependent on 
management’s ability to project future earnings from activities 
that may apply loss positions carried forward against future 
income taxes.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The preparation of consolidated ﬁnancial statements requires 
that management make estimates and assumptions that 
affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and 
expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are 
based on historical experience and various other factors  
that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, 
the result of which form the basis of making the judgements 
about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not 
readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may  
differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying 
assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis taking  
the current and expected future market conditions  
into consideration.
Impairment/reversal of impairment
The Group has signiﬁcant investments in property, plant and 
equipment, acquired intangibles and goodwill. Changes in the 
circumstances or expectations of future performance of an 
individual asset may be an indicator that the asset is impaired 
requiring the book value to be written down to its recoverable 
amount. Impairments, excluding goodwill, are reversed if the 
conditions for impairment are no longer present. Evaluating 
whether an asset is impaired or if an impairment should be 
reversed requires a high degree of judgement and may 
depend to a large extent on the selection of key assumptions 
about the future.
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an 
estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to 
which goodwill has been allocated. The value in use calculation 
requires the entity to estimate the future cash ﬂows expected 
to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount 
rate in order to calculate present value. The growth rates used 
within the forecast future cash ﬂows are developed with 
reference to external sources but are subject to estimation 
uncertainty. See note 13 for more details.
Post retirement beneﬁt obligations
Included in the actuaries’ calculation of the post retirement 
beneﬁt obligations are a number of assumptions. These are 
shown in detail in note 25.
Current tax liability and deferred tax
The Group annually incurs signiﬁcant amounts of income 
taxes payable to various jurisdictions around the world, and it 
also recognises signiﬁcant changes in deferred tax assets and 
deferred tax liabilities, all of which are based on management’s 
interpretations of applicable laws, regulations and relevant 
court decisions. The quality of these estimates is highly 
dependent upon management’s ability to properly apply what 
can be very complex sets of rules and to recognise changes 
in applicable rules. 66  Synthomer plc Annual Report 2013

8 Taxation continued
UK corporation tax is calculated at 23.25% (2012 24.5%) of the estimated assessable proﬁt for the year. Taxation for other 
jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions.
As a result of the provisions of Finance Act 2012 to reduce the UK corporation tax rate from 24% to 23% from 1 April 2013  
the applicable rate of corporation tax for the year is 23.25%. Finance Act 2013 introduced further changes to the main rate  
of corporation tax, which was reduced from 23% to 21% from 1 April 2014 and to 20% from 1 April 2015. UK deferred tax 
balances have therefore been re-measured to reﬂect the rate at which they are expected to reverse.
Reconciliation of tax expense to proﬁt before taxation
The differences between the total tax expense shown above and the amount calculated by applying the standard rate  
of UK corporation tax to the proﬁt before tax is as follows.

Deferred tax assets have been recognised in respect of all tax losses and other temporary differences giving rise to deferred  
tax assets to the extent that it is probable that these assets will be recovered. No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted 
earnings of overseas subsidiaries and joint ventures. As the earnings are continually reinvested by the Group, no tax is expected 
to be payable on them in the foreseeable future.

Group ﬁnancial statements
The recoverable amounts for CGUs are determined from value in use calculations, based upon discounted cash ﬂows. The key 
assumptions for those discounted cash ﬂow calculations are the discount rate, proﬁtability and growth rate. The discount rate  
is based on the Group’s weighted average cost of capital adjusted, where appropriate, for the risk premium attributable to the 
particular CGU’s activities and geography of operation. Proﬁtability and growth rates are based on past experience combined 
with management’s expectations for future business performance, which is informed by a number of factors including economic 
growth, internal plans and competitor and customer activity.
Discount rates of 11% (2012 11%) and 12% (2012 12%) have been used in the above calculations for Europe & North America 
and Asia & Rest of World respectively.
The proﬁt used in the cash ﬂows for the ﬁrst year is derived from management forecasts; for years 2 to 10 a growth rate  
is applied. The proﬁt for year 10 is then assumed to apply without further growth into perpetuity. Growth rates of between 
2% (2012 2%) and 5% (2012 5%) have been used for Europe & North America and Asia & Rest of World respectively, 
representing management’s best estimate of each CGU’s circumstances, and these do not exceed the long-term growth  
rates for the markets concerned.
There is no reasonable possible change in key assumptions that would lead to an impairment.
Of the net book value of goodwill at 31 December 2013, £70.5 million (2012 £70.5 million) is located in the UK.

17 Financial asset
The Group disposed of its Pharma Chemicals business on 30 November 2011. Part of the consideration agreed with the  
buyer, totalling $10.0 million, was in the form of a deferred payment to the Group which will be made by the buyer on or before 
30 September 2014. In the event that the buyer is unable to fulﬁl his obligation, this deferred consideration is secured by an 
irrevocable bank guarantee held in favour of Synthomer plc by HSBC Bank plc.
 
In view of the security held, the Directors consider this deferred consideration virtually certain to be received and have therefore 
included it in these ﬁnancial statements as a Financial Asset, and within the Group’s deﬁnition of Net Borrowings.
The amount of £5.8 million (2012 £5.6 million) represents the agreed amount of $10.0 million discounted at the rate of 5% per 
annum from 30 September 2014 to date of completion, plus an appropriate amount unwound on this discounting in the period 
up to 31 December 2013.

by variations in interest rates, and subsequent amortisation thereof, to the extent that these constituted effective hedges prior  
to the adoption of IFRS.
Cash and cash equivalents are deposited with ﬁnancial institutions with a credit rating of A or higher.
22 Financial instruments
The Group’s treasury function operates procedures designed to reduce or eliminate ﬁnancial risk and ensure that funds  
are available for current and future needs. The policies are approved by the Board and the use of ﬁnancial instruments  
is strictly controlled.
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising 
the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The capital structure of the Group consists 
of debt, which includes the cash and borrowings disclosed in note 21, and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, 
comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings. It is management’s intention to maintain the underlying net 
borrowings to EBITDA metric to between one and two times:

Fair values have been obtained from the relevant institutions where appropriate. Where market values are not available, fair 
values of ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities have been calculated by discounting expected future cash ﬂow at prevailing 
interest rates and by applying year end exchange rates. The carrying amount of short-term borrowings approximates to  
book value.
The fair value of the Group’s ﬁnancial instruments are measured using inputs other than quoted prices that are directly 
or indirectly observable.
The main risks arising from the Group’s ﬁnancial instruments are market risk and liquidity risk. The Board reviews and agrees 
policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below, together with related disclosure required by IFRS. Synthomer plc Annual Report 2013  83  
Group ﬁnancial statements
Market risk
The Group’s main exposure to market risk is in the form of interest rate risk and foreign currency risk. The policies adopted  
to address these risks are as follows:
Interest rate risk
The Group ﬁnances its operations through a mixture of retained proﬁts, loan notes and bank borrowings. The Group borrows  
at both ﬁxed and ﬂoating rates of interest and uses interest rate swaps to generate the desired interest proﬁle in order to 
manage the Group’s exposure to interest rate ﬂuctuations.
Foreign currency risk
The Group uses currency borrowings, forward contracts and currency swaps to hedge overseas net assets, which are 
predominantly denominated in euros. Proﬁt translation exposures are not hedged.
The Group hedges currency transaction exposures at the point of conﬁrmed order, using forward foreign exchange contracts. 
The Group’s policy is, where practicable, to hedge all exposures on monetary assets and liabilities. Consequently, there are 
no material currency exposures to disclose (2012 none).
Impact on income statement
Changes in the fair value of derivative contracts amounting to £1.2 million have been debited to the income statement in the 
year (2012 debit of £1.7 million). These changes are shown separately as a special item in the consolidated income statement.
Hedge accounting
The Group has a number of cross currency swaps that are used to reduce the exposure to interest rate and currency risk.
These swaps are fully effective at eliminating the risks they address. The Group has reviewed the requirements necessary 
to permit the application of hedge accounting under IAS 39. It has concluded that the costs involved in meeting these 
requirements cannot be justiﬁed and therefore IAS 39 hedge accounting will not be applied.
Changes in the fair value of derivative ﬁnancial instruments to which hedge accounting is not applied are recognised in the 
income statement as they arise.
The Group has designated a number of Interest Rate Swap agreements, acquired as part of the acquisition of PolymerLatex 
Group, which in combination represent a ﬂoating to ﬁxed interest rate swap on a principal euro amount of €156 million,  
as an effective hedge against the interest rate exposure associated with a substantial portion of the Group’s euro denominated, 
ﬂoating rate, £150 million Term Loan. As such these contracts are now accounted for as Cash Flow Hedges as permitted 
by IAS 39. These contracts matured on 31 December 2013 and have not been renewed.
In addition, the Group has taken out forward foreign exchange contracts to ﬁx the sterling value of its net investments in certain 
foreign operations, which have a euro functional currency. These contracts, together with €177.8 million drawn on the multi 
currency term loan facility have been accounted for as net investment hedges as permitted by IAS 39.

The interest rate sensitivity analysis has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivatives and 
non-derivative instruments at the balance sheet date. For ﬂoating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount 
of liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
The foreign currency sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts 
their translation at the period end for a 10% change in foreign currency rates. The sensitivity analysis includes external loans as 
well as loans to foreign operations within the Group where the denomination of the loan is in a currency other than the functional 
currency of the lender or borrower.
Liquidity risk
The objective of the Group is to meet ﬁnancial commitments as and when they fall due. The Board closely monitors liquidity 
through monthly management accounts.
At the year end, Synthomer plc had the following principal facilities:
A committed syndicated bank facility of £210 million comprising a £150 million Term Loan which was drawndown in euros on 
completion of the PolymerLatex acquisition, and a £60 million revolving credit facility which was undrawn at 31 December 2013. 
Unsecured loan notes totalling approximately £51 million raised from the US private placement market in 2004. With maturity 
between 2014 and 2016, these loan notes provide the Group’s long-term requirements. Please see note 21 for further details.

The land is owned by Kind Action Sdn Bhd, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Revertex Malaysia Sdn Bhd, which has 
a 30% minority interest.
The Directors decided during the year to dispose of this land, excluding the 300 acres immediately surrounding the 
manufacturing facilities, on the open market.
At 31 December 2013, contracts have been exchanged on 700 acres for a total consideration of approximately £27 million.
These disposals are subject to regulatory approval which may take up to 2 years. 86  Synthomer plc Annual Report 2013

UK pension schemes
The Group’s UK deﬁned beneﬁt scheme was closed to future accrual in 2009. All pension beneﬁts since that time are provided 
by way of a deﬁned contribution scheme.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the companies concerned.
Deﬁned beneﬁt scheme
The deﬁned beneﬁt scheme is administered by a separate fund that is legally separated from the Company. 
The trustees of the pension fund are required by law to act in the interest of the fund and of all relevant stakeholders in 
the scheme. The trustees of the pension are responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets of the fund.
A full actuarial valuation was carried out as at 6 April 2012 and updated to 31 December 2013 by a qualiﬁed actuary.
The Group has agreed that it will aim to eliminate the pension plan deﬁcit over the next 8 years. Synthomer plc Annual Report 2013  87  
Group ﬁnancial statements
The scheme is exposed to a number of risks the most signiﬁcant of which are detailed below:
Asset return risk The plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields; 
if plan assets underperform this yield, this will increase the deﬁcit. The scheme holds a signiﬁcant 
proportion of equities which are expected to outperform corporate bonds on the long-term while 
providing volatility and risk in the short-term. 
Interest rate risk A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities, although this will be partially  
offset by an increase in the value of the plans’ bond holdings.
Longevity risk The majority of the plans’ obligations are to provide beneﬁts for the life of the member,  
so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the plans’ liabilities. 
The risk relating to beneﬁts to be paid to the dependents of scheme members (widow and orphan beneﬁts) is re-insured  
by an external insurance company.
The major assumptions used for the purposes of the actuarial valuations were as follows:
2013 2012 
Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.30% 3.00%
Rate of increase in pensions in deferment 2.30% 2.00%
Discount rate 4.55% 4.60%
Inﬂation assumption 3.30% 3.00%
Assumptions regarding future mortality are based on actuarial advice in accordance with published statistics. These assumptions 
translate into an average life expectancy in years for a pensioner retiring at 65 as follows:
2013 2012 
Retiring today:
Males 87.5 87.4
Females 89.9 89.8
Retiring in 20 years:
Males 89.2 89.1
Females 91.9 91.8
Signiﬁcant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation are discount rate and mortality. 
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the assumptions occurring  
at the end of the reporting period assuming that all other assumptions are held constant:
Assumption Change in assumption Impact on scheme liabilities
Discount rate Increase/decrease by 1% Decrease/increase by £45 million
Rate of mortality Increase by 1 year Increase by £9 million
The above senstivities are based on a change of assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. In practice, this is 
unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may have some correlation. When calculating the sensitivity of the 
deﬁned beneﬁt obligation to signiﬁcant actuarial assumptions the same method (present value of the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation 
calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period) has been applied as when calculating the 
pension liability recognised within the balance sheet.  88  Synthomer plc Annual Report 2013

Group ﬁnancial statements
Overseas pension schemes
The Group operates a number of smaller overseas pension and post-retirement schemes. The assets of these schemes  
are held separately from those of the Group, with the exception of the unfunded German schemes (net liability £51.3 million, 
2012 £47.7 million), where in line with common practice, the assets are held within the respective companies. 
Deﬁned beneﬁt schemes 
The aggregated pension disclosure below for the overseas deﬁned beneﬁt schemes has been compiled from a number  
of actuarial valuations at 31 December 2013.
The largest of these schemes accounts for £38.3 million (2012 £37.8 million) of the deﬁcit at 31 December 2013.  
The major assumption used in the actuarial valuation of this scheme are:
2013 2012 
Rate of increase in salaries 3.00% 3.00%
Rate of increase in pensions 2.00% 2.00%
Discount rate 3.80% 3.80%
Mortality assumptions
Investigations have been carried out within the past three years into the mortality experience of the Group’s deﬁned beneﬁt 
scheme. These investigations concluded that the current mortality assumptions include sufﬁcient allowance for future 
improvements in mortality rates. The assumed life expectations on retirement at age 65 are:
2013 2012 
Retiring today: 
Males 86.0 85.8
Females 91.0 90.8
Retiring in 20 years:
Males 89.3 89.1
Females 94.2 94.1
The major assumption used in the valuation of the other overseas schemes do not differ signiﬁcantly from the above.

Yule Catto Employee Beneﬁt Trust
The Company established a trust, the Yule Catto Employee Beneﬁt Trust, on 17 July 1996 to distribute shares to employees 
enabling the obligations under the Yule Catto Longer-Term Performance Share Plan and the Yule Catto Longer-Term Deferred 
Bonus Plan to be met. The Trust is managed by the RBC Trustees (Guernsey) Limited, an independent company located in 
Guernsey. 
At 31 December 2013, the Trust held 331,502 ordinary shares (2012 331,502) in the Company with a market value  
of £0.8 million (2012 £0.6 million). 
The dividends on these shares have been waived. All of the shares are under option. Costs are amortised over the life  
of the plans.
33 Restatement on adoption of IAS 19 revised
IAS 19 (revised) “Employee beneﬁts” was amended in June 2011 and is effective for ﬁnancial years beginning on or after 
 1 January 2013. The Company has implemented IAS 19 (revised) in the year ended 31 December 2013. The speciﬁc impact of 
this on the income statement is a change in the calculation of the interest income on plan assets. This was previously based on 
the expected returns on the various asset types held within the investment portfolio. It is now calculated at the same rate used 
to calculate the interest expense on the pension liability, being a discount rate derived from corporate bonds. The difference 
between this calculated return and the actual return is reported as an actuarial gain/loss through reserves. 
In addition, as part of the implementation of IAS 19 (revised) the Group has chosen to classify the interest expense on the net 
pension liability within ﬁnance costs. The expected return on plan assets and interest expense on the pension liability were 
previously reported as part of operating expenses. 
The change in accounting policy has been applied retrospectively to the comparator periods. 
There is no signiﬁcant change to the net pension liability or to net assets as a result of the adoption of IAS 19 (revised).  
As a result no restatement of the balance sheet is required. 
Restatement of prior full year period to 31 December 2012 
The effect of adopting IAS 19 (revised) on the Group’s proﬁt is to reduce both underlying and total reported proﬁt after tax  
by £3.5 million for the prior full-year ended 31 December 2012. In addition, £2.2 million of expenses relating to the expected 
return on plan assets and interest expense on the pension liability, previously reported within operating expenses have been 
reclassiﬁed to ﬁnance costs.  Synthomer plc Annual Report 2013  93

Independent auditor’s report

Report on the Parent Company 
ﬁnancial Statements
Our opinion 
In our opinion the Parent Company ﬁnancial statements:
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Parent 
Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2013;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements 
of the Companies Act 2006.
 This opinion is to be read in the context of what we say in 
the remainder of this report.
What we have audited
The Parent Company ﬁnancial statements, which are 
prepared by Synthomer plc, comprise:
• the Parent Company balance sheet as at 31 December 
2013;
• the notes to the Parent Company ﬁnancial statements, 
which include a summary of signiﬁcant accounting policies 
and other explanatory information.
The ﬁnancial reporting framework that has been applied  
in their preparation comprises applicable law and United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice).
In applying the ﬁnancial reporting framework, the Directors 
have made a number of subjective judgements, for example  
in respect of signiﬁcant accounting estimates. In making such 
estimates, they have made assumptions and considered 
future events.
What an audit of ﬁnancial statements involves 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK & Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”). 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts  
and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements sufﬁcient to give 
reasonable assurance that the ﬁnancial statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of:
• whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the 
Parent Company’s circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed;
• the reasonableness of signiﬁcant accounting estimates 
made by the Directors; and 
• the overall presentation of the ﬁnancial statements. 
In addition, we read all the ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial 
information in the Synthomer Annual Report (the ‘Annual 
Report’) to identify material inconsistencies with the audited 
Parent Company ﬁnancial statements and to identify any 
information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, 
or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by 
us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware 
of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies 
we consider the implications for our report.
Opinions on matters prescribed by the Companies  
Act 2006
In our opinion:
• The information given in the Strategic report and the 
Directors’ Report for the ﬁnancial year for which the Parent 
Company ﬁnancial statements are prepared is consistent 
with the Parent Company ﬁnancial statements.
• The part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be 
audited has been properly prepared in accordance with  
the Companies Act 2006.
Other matters on which we are required to report  
by exception
Adequacy of accounting records and information 
and explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report  
to you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have 
not been received from branches not visited by us; or
• the Parent Company ﬁnancial statements and the part  
of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are 
not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this 
responsibility.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report if, 
in our opinion, certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration 
speciﬁed by law have not been made. We have no exceptions 
to report arising from this responsibility.
Other information in the Annual Report
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland), we are required to report to you 
if, in our opinion, information in the Annual Report is:
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited 
Parent Company ﬁnancial statements; or
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Parent Company 
acquired in the course of performing our audit; or
• is otherwise misleading.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this 
responsibility.
Responsibilities for the ﬁnancial statements 
and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the Directors 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement set out on page 51, the Directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the Parent Company ﬁnancial 
statements and for being satisﬁed that they give a true  
and fair view.  96  Synthomer plc Annual Report 2013  
Independent auditor’s report 
to the members of Synthomer plc continued
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the 
Parent Company ﬁnancial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and ISAs (UK & Ireland). Those standards 
require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s 
Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and 
only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance 
with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for 
no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept 
or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other 
person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it 
may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent 
in writing.

Notes to the Company ﬁnancial statements
31 December 2013
1 Accounting policies
The principal accounting policies are summarised below.  
They have all been applied consistently throughout the year 
and the preceding year.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption from 
preparing a cash ﬂow statement under the terms of FRS1 
“Cash Flow Statement”. The cash ﬂows of the Company are 
included in the Synthomer plc group ﬁnancial statements.
Basis of accounting
The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared on the going 
concern basis under the historical cost convention as 
modiﬁed by the revaluation of certain ﬁxed assets, and comply 
with applicable UK accounting standards and the Companies 
Act 2006.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate  
of exchange at the date of the transaction or, if hedged,  
at the forward contract rate. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date 
are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at that date  
or, if appropriate, at the forward contract rate.
Tangible ﬁxed assets
Tangible ﬁxed assets are stated at cost or valuation, net of 
depreciation and any provision for impairment. Cost includes 
the original purchase price of the asset plus the costs 
attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition  
for its intended use. Except for freehold land, which is not 
depreciated, the cost or valuation of tangible ﬁxed assets  
is depreciated on a straight-line basis over their expected 
useful lives as follows:
Freehold buildings – 50 years
Leasehold land and buildings –  the lesser of 50 years and 
the period of the lease
Plant and equipment – between 3 and 10 years
Revaluation of properties
Where depreciation charges are increased following a 
revaluation, an amount equal to the increase is transferred 
annually from the revaluation reserve to the proﬁt and loss 
account as a movement on reserves. On the disposal or 
recognition of a provision for impairment of a revalued ﬁxed 
asset, any related balance remaining in the revaluation reserve 
is also transferred to the proﬁt and loss account as a 
movement on reserves.
Investments
Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less provision  
for impairment.
Intercompany
Intercompany balances are shown gross unless a right  
of set off exists.
Borrowings
Borrowings are initially stated at the amount of the net 
proceeds after deduction of issue costs.
Taxation
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax,  
is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) 
using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences 
that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet 
date where transactions or events that result in an obligation 
to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the 
future have occurred at the balance sheet date. Timing 
differences are differences between the Company’s taxable 
proﬁts and its results as stated in the ﬁnancial statements  
that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax 
assessments in periods different from those in which they  
are recognised in the ﬁnancial statements.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and 
therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available 
evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there 
will be suitable taxable proﬁts from which the future reversal  
of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that  
are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing 
differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates  
and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted  
by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities (including derivative 
instruments) are recognised on the Company balance sheet 
when the Company becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.
Trade debtors
Trade debtors do not carry any interest and are stated at their 
nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for 
estimated irrecoverable amounts. 
Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the 
proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, 
including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and 
direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accrual basis to 
the proﬁt and loss account using the effective interest method 
and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to  
the extent that they are not settled in the period in which  
they arise.
Trade creditors
Trade creditors are not interest-bearing and are stated at their 
nominal value.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded  
at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Synthomer plc Annual Report 2013  99  
Company ﬁnancial statements
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments
The Company enters into derivative ﬁnancial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk, 
including cross currency interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts. The Company does not hold or issue 
derivative ﬁnancial instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured 
to their fair value at each balance sheet date. A derivative with a positive fair value is recognised as a ﬁnancial asset whereas a 
derivative with a negative fair value is recognised as a ﬁnancial liability. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the proﬁt and 
loss account immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing  
of the recognition in the proﬁt and loss account depends on the nature of the hedge relationship. The Company designates 
certain derivatives as fair value hedges.
The use of ﬁnancial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written 
principles on the use of ﬁnancial derivatives.
Fair value hedge accounting
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the proﬁt and loss 
account, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.  
The Company only applies fair value hedge accounting for foreign currency exposure associated with the underlying hedged 
item. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is also recognised in the proﬁt and loss account.
Net borrowings
Net borrowings represents cash and cash equivalents together with short and long-term borrowings, as adjusted for the effect 
of related derivative instruments irrespective of whether they qualify for hedge accounting.
Pension funding
In accordance with FRS17, the Company accounts for its contributions to the deﬁned beneﬁts scheme as if it were a deﬁned 
contribution scheme because it is not possible to identify the Company’s share of the assets and liabilities in the scheme  
on a consistent and reasonable basis.
The UK deﬁned beneﬁt scheme is funded, with the assets of the scheme held separately from those of the Group, in separate 
trustee-administered funds. 
Payments to deﬁned contribution retirement beneﬁt schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
2 Auditors’ remuneration
The audit fee of Synthomer plc amounted to £4,000 (2012 £4,000).

Company ﬁnancial statements
Additions for the year represent an additional investment in Ennismore Limited, a Company incorporated in Jersey.  
A total amount of ¤11.5 million (£9.9 million) was invested. 
The Company has designated its euro denominated £150 million multi currency Term Loan Facility of ¤177.8 million  
(see note 8) as a FRS 26 fair value hedge against ¤177.8 million its investment in Ennismore Limited. Under FRS 26,  
the hedged portion of this investment is re-translated at the year end spot rate with the resulting gain or loss being taken  
to the proﬁt and loss account, where it is fully offset by the exchange gain or loss resulting from the re-translation of the  
Term Loan Facility at the same date.
Disposals during the year represent previously impaired non-trading companies which have been disposed of as part  
of a restructuring exercise.

14 Guarantees and other ﬁnancial commitments
The Company has given guarantees amounting to £5.5 million (2012 £5.7 million) in respect of bank and other facilities  
of subsidiaries and joint ventures.
15 Pension commitments 
The Group participates in a funded scheme with both a deﬁned beneﬁt and deﬁned contribution section (the Yule Catto  
Group Retirement Beneﬁt Scheme). The scheme’s deﬁned beneﬁt section was closed to new members with effect from 
31 December 1998 and with effect from 1 January 1999 a deﬁned contribution section was introduced and is open to all eligible 
Group employees. During 2009 the Group announced that it intended to close the deﬁned beneﬁt scheme to future accrual. 
This process commenced in 2009 and was completed in September 2010.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the companies concerned.  104 Synthomer plc Annual report 2013

15 Pension commitments continued
The pension charge for the year for the Company amounted to £0.0 million (2012 £14.1 million). 
A valuation under FRS17 has not been performed at Group level and therefore the deﬁcit calculated in accordance with IAS 19 
of £60.3 million (2012 – £69.5 million) is disclosed as a permitted alternative.

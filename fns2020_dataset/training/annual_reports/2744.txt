12    CAIRN ENERGY PLC  ANNUAL REPORT 2008 Corporate overview 
Cairn has a focused strategy for delivering organic growth  
and shareholder value. 
Underpinning the strategy for growth is the sequential 
development of our 25 oil discoveries in Rajasthan, 
complemented by a new and exciting frontier exploration  
position in Greenland. 
Cairn’s vision to create and build a business in India over the last 
15 years has been based on the firm belief in the hydrocarbon 
potential of the country and its hidden value potential. Today 
Cairn’s Indian business, operated and managed by Cairn India 
Limited (CIL), is entering a period of transformational growth with 
the phased build up of oil production, followed by a sustainable 
plateau, from its world class oil fields in Rajasthan. 
Cairn holds a similar vision for Greenland, based on the same 
belief in its hydrocarbon potential. These two areas are however  
at different stages of the exploration and production cycle; in 
Rajasthan, production will commence in 2009, whilst Greenland 
offers material frontier exploration potential, the true value of 
which has yet to be discovered.
In the first half of 2008, the Government of India (GoI) approved 
the shifting of the point where the crude would be delivered from 
the MBA fields in Rajasthan. This meant that the contractual crude 
oil delivery point moved from the Mangala Processing Terminal 
(MPT) in the Rajasthan desert to existing infrastructure hubs and 
points on the Gujarat coast, with investment in the evacuation 
pipeline included in the project. This change in development plan 
necessitated the raising of $630m of additional funds via a placing 
of CIL shares in April 2008. Following the placing, the Company’s 
holding in CIL reduced by 4% to 65%. 
In the second half of the year, the capital markets (both debt and 
equity) were difficult to access for most businesses. The main 
priority for Cairn throughout this period was to re-examine and 
re-schedule the phasing of certain key elements of the Rajasthan 
development. This was done to meet the target delivery date of 
first oil in the second half of 2009 and to ensure that the project 
remained suitably financed. 
 
The 5% placing of PLC shares announced in March 2009 has 
raised $161m to strengthen Cairn’s equity capital base in order  
to maintain operational and financial flexibility across all of its 
operations both in relation to the Rajasthan development and  
its exploration position in Greenland. 
 
India
The current focus for CIL is the delivery of the high-value 
Rajasthan project. 
The planned ultimate production capacity of the Rajasthan 
development has increased over the last 12 months as we have 
sought to optimise the potential of the resource base. The decision  
to develop the key fields in a phased manner has enhanced 
operational flexibility and allowed the initial focus to remain  
on Mangala and the export infrastructure. 
The Bhagyam and Aishwariya fields, Enhanced Oil Recovery 
(EOR), the Barmer Hill potential and other fields will follow in 
sequence when production is expected to rise to more than 
175,000 barrels of oil per day. 
Once Mangala is on stream it will generate revenues that will be 
used initially to invest in further development work in Rajasthan 
and to pay down debt. The increasing production profile will 
deliver further value from Rajasthan, which will in turn provide  
the Group with additional financial flexibility.
Greenland
Cairn’s exploration acreage position in Greenland is held through 
its 90% owned international exploration subsidiary Capricorn.  
A total of eight offshore blocks were acquired during 2008 and 
Capricorn has already completed its obligatory seismic work 
programme for the first four-year period over all of its blocks. 
Planning for an exploration drilling campaign is already underway. 
The Arctic basins of Greenland are increasingly being recognised 
as a potentially world class prospective area. In July 2008, the US 
Geological Survey (USGS) released its Circum-Arctic Resource 
Appraisal report and concluded that “The extensive Arctic 
continental shelf may constitute the geographically largest 
unexplored prospective area for petroleum remaining on earth.” 
A previous study by the USGS in 1996 recognised Greenland as 
one of the world’s top ten potential hydrocarbon destinations for 
‘yet to finds’.
Board 
I would like to record my thanks to Ed Story who stood down as a 
Non-Executive Director in January 2009 having joined the Board 
in 1997. His insight and knowledge of the worldwide oil and gas 
industry has been hugely beneficial to the Board. 
Dr James Buckee, the former President and Chief Executive Officer 
of T alisman Energy, was appointed to the Board in January 2009. 
I am also delighted to report that Mike Watts, formerly Exploration 
and New Business director is now Deputy Chief Executive of  
the Company. 
outlook
The Group intends to continue to target material growth across 
its business. 
The focus in 2009 is delivering production in Rajasthan on 
schedule and agreeing oil sales contracts with the buyers of  
the Rajasthan crude.
Cairn’s original vision for and belief in India has been borne out  
by events. This year will see production commence not only in 
Rajasthan but also from the substantial discoveries made by 
Reliance off the east coast.
Our exploration activities in Greenland are at a very early stage, 
but we firmly believe in the country’s hydrocarbon potential and 
our evaluation efforts will continue whilst we also investigate 
options for early drilling.
The next two years promise to be an exciting time for Cairn.  
With a marked increase in Group production and cash flow we  
will continue to evaluate the strategic options for further creation 
of shareholder value.

Sir Bill Gammell, Chief Executive
Cairn’s Rajasthan development continues  
to grow in scope and scale with first oil  
production in the second half of 2009.
We have established a material frontier  
exploration position offshore west and  
south Greenland with 72,000 km

16    CAIRN ENERGY PLC  ANNUAL REPORT 2008 Cairn strategy has always been to focus on opportunities with 
material growth potential. For more than 20 years Cairn has been 
successful in exploring for, finding and developing hydrocarbons 
and the focus on South Asia has been the cornerstone of the 
Group’s growth. Integral to the next stage of growth are the 
Rajasthan development project centred on Mangala, the largest  
of 25 current discoveries on the block and the expansion into 
frontier exploration acreage in Greenland.
India
Cairn India, in its second year of operation as an Indian listed 
subsidiary, has continued to make good progress across all  
of its business. 
The integrated upstream and midstream project in Rajasthan 
(with local power and water supply) is one of the largest onshore 
oil and gas developments in India with more than 10,000 workers 
currently involved in construction activities in Rajasthan and Gujarat.
Preparations for first oil from the Rajasthan fields are on track  
and the development of the MPT to which the bulk of the other 
field facilities will be connected is well underway. Construction  
of the 600 km heated pipeline from the MPT to the coast and  
the complex work in respect of the related facilities is on track. 
The size and scope of the Rajasthan project has substantially 
increased since the original Mangala discovery in 2004 when peak 
production was originally forecast at 100,000 barrels of oil per 
day (bopd). Today the facilities at the MPT will include the phased 
construction of four processing trains with a production capacity 
of 205,000 bopd and scope for expansion. 
The MBA fields have proven plus probable (2P) gross reserves 
and 2C resources of almost 700 million barrels of oil equivalent 
(mmboe) with a further 300 mmboe of EOR potential presently 
classified as contingent resource. Subject to the results of the EOR 
project these resources would be expected to be re-categorised 
over time as additional 2P reserves. First production from Rajasthan

and the significant related terminal facilities are currently being built 
to 	 be 	 r eady 	 by 	 Q4 	 2009. 	 Mangala 	 plateau 	 pr oduction 	 is 	 planned	
to reach 125,000 bopd in 2010 with overall plateau production of 
175,000 bopd expected to commence in 2011 from the MBA fields. 
The GoI is in the process of confirming multiple nominees for the 
Rajasthan crude. The pipeline routing to a nodal point within the 
existing Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) infrastructure and to coastal 
destinations gives Cairn and its partner, ONGC, access to wider 
refining capacity. In order to facilitate the trucking and sale of oil 
ahead of the pipeline completion, trial runs have been successfully 
carried out on the route from Mangala to the Gujarat coast.
More than 3,000 km
2
 in Rajasthan are now under long term 
development contract. There is further incremental production 
growth potential across this acreage as demonstrated by the 
Raageshwari East well, which flowed 500 bopd in December 2008. 
The challenge in the coming years will be to exploit the full 
resource potential in the Barmer basin in Rajasthan through the 
use of EOR techniques and through further work on the remaining 
fields including the Barmer Hill reservoirs. 
Subject to regulatory approval there is potential to extend and 
also enhance peak plateau production from the resource base  
of the Rajasthan fields above the level of 175,000 bopd.
Greenland
A significant frontier exploration position in Greenland has been 
established. Within the first year of the licence agreements a 
10,000 km 2D seismic programme in the west and south of 
Greenland has been acquired and final processed results for the 
Disko area became available in late March. The seismic results for 
the southern area are expected in April. This seismic programme 
has satisfied in full the Group’s initial four year exploration work 
programme across all of its acreage. Interpretation of these data 
sets is now underway.
The first Cairn operated exploration drilling in Greenland is 
planned for 2011. It is however the intention to undertake at least 
three drilling site surveys and to purchase certain long lead items 
this year in order to preserve the option, should a suitable rig 
become available, for exploration drilling in 2010.
Offshore west Greenland can be considered as containing three 
separate geological basin areas with various sub-basins; the eight 
blocks Cairn has acquired are spread across each of these main 
basins. The two Disko blocks, for example, lie within the Baffin Bay 
Basin, where to date no offshore drilling has taken place. 
In view of the perceived material exploration potential of 
Greenland, Cairn is still looking to enhance its acreage portfolio, 
particularly when the Baffin Bay and North East Greenland Basins 
are put up for bid by the authorities in 2010 and 2012 respectively. 
Subject to Government approval the company intends to acquire 
reconnaissance seismic along the coast of east Greenland this 
year where it has applied for a Prospecting Licence. 
Financial review
In 2008, Cairn has focused on allocating its resources to those 
assets that will drive shareholder value. At 31 December 2008 
Cairn had net cash of $898m, positive operating cash flows and 
net assets of $2.3bn.
The Group’s existing cash resources, debt facilities and cash 
flow from operations provide adequate funding to complete 
the core Mangala development project plus the pipeline and to 
commence first production in 2009. However, Cairn will continue 
to monitor the credit markets to assess current pricing, and may 
consider expanding its facilities in due course.
Cairn has always maintained a capital structure appropriate  
for its operations in exploration, appraisal and development. 
Given the background of global market conditions Cairn decided 
to strengthen its equity capital base and earlier this month raised  
a further $161m through a 5% placing of shares. 
Cairn has entered 2009 with the financial and operational 
flexibility necessary to deliver its key project in Rajasthan thereby 
providing cash flow to target the next phase of growth and 
continued creation of shareholder value.

18    CAIRN ENERGY PLC  ANNUAL REPORT 2008 Group Production
Cairn’s average gross production during 2008 was 76,298  
barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) (2007: 87,031 boepd). 
The Group’s average entitlement production for 2008 was 
12,801 boepd net to Cairn (2007:19,809 boepd). 
The figures in the table below show group production for 2008 
on a gross, working interest and entitlement interest basis 
(including 100% of both CIL’s and Capricorn’s production).

Entitlement interest  5,711 4,478 2,612 12,801
The average realised price per barrel of oil equivalent (boe)  
for 2008 was $63.88 (2007: $39.70). Cairn’s current entitlement 
interest production is 46% gas: 54% oil. On commencement 
of production from Rajasthan the vast majority of the Group’s 
production will be oil.
Group Booked 2P reserves
The table below shows reserves information at 31 December 
2008 on an entitlement interest basis for the Group (including 
100% of both CIL’s and Capricorn’s reserves). For accounting  
and reserves purposes, the Group has used an oil price 
assumption of $50/bbl for 2009 and $65 for 2010 onwards  
(real) (2007: $60/bbl (real)).

2007: 255.3 mmboe), comprising 346.0 mmboe in India and  
2.0 mmboe in Bangladesh. The net entitlement reserves  
position has also increased by 84.3 mmboe from 170.2 to  
254.5 mmboe. This increase is largely due to the booking of 
Bhagyam and Aishwariya 2P reserves. It also includes an increase 
in the entitlement to Mangala oil as a result of the increase of 
plateau offtake rate and the inclusion of pipeline costs following 
the GoI approval to the moving of the delivery point to the coast. 
There is also a reduction as a consequence of a change in the 
Group’s oil price assumption.

progress is being made in the development of the MPT  
with more than 6,000 workers currently involved in upstream  
construction activities in Rajasthan.
India reserves
With approved Field Development Plans (FDPs) in place for  
the Mangala, Saraswati, Raageshwari, Bhagyam and Aishwariya 
fields, net entitlement 2P reserves totalling 240.5 mmboe  
have been booked for the Rajasthan fields at the 2008 year end.  
There is a further 12.4 mmboe 2P reserves in the Lakshmi,  
Gauri and Ravva fields at the year end.
The net entitlement 2P reserves for Mangala, Saraswati and 
Raageshwari were originally booked at the 2005 year end 
following the approval by the GoI of the FDPs. The Aishwariya 
reserves were not booked at that time even though the FDP  
was approved. This was because the Aishwariya development 
was planned to follow the larger Bhagyam development and  
the Bhagyam FDP was not yet submitted. 
Two additional Mangala wells were drilled and extensive 
reservoir studies completed following the submission of 
the original Mangala FDP . During 2007, the stock tank oil 
initially in place (STOIIP) volumes in Mangala and Aishwariya 
were also updated based on the results of remapping, more 
accurate water saturation determination and a comprehensive 
petrophysical review. 
A	 Mangala	 FDP	 Addendum	 was	 submitted	 in	 Q4	 2008,	 which	
included a higher oil production offtake from 100,000 bopd 
to 125,000 bopd (resulting in greater cumulative production 
during the production sharing contract (PSC) period) and 
implementation of an EOR pilot. This higher offtake rate has 
been included in the calculation of Mangala reserves. The 
estimated incremental volumes expected to be recovered 
through EOR are not included in the reserves figures but are 
classified as contingent resources.
The Bhagyam FDP was submitted to the Joint Venture (JV)  
and the GoI in May 2007 and was approved by the GoI in  
March 2008. Consequently, Bhagyam and Aishwariya reserves 
were booked at 2008 mid year.

The net entitlement 2P reserves for Sangu are 1.6 mmboe at the 
2008 year end, compared to 0.8 mmboe at the 2007 year end. 
The increase has resulted from better than forecast production 
fr om	 a	 number	 of	 wells,	 well	 intervention	 work	 in	 Q4	 2008	 and	
incremental recovery associated with installation of onshore 
compr ession,	 which	 is	 due	 to	 commence	 operation	 in	 Q3	 2009.	
A reduction in forecast operating costs has also extended the 
expected field life. Sangu net entitlement 2P reserves now 
represent around 0.6% of total booked Group reserves.

CAIRN ENERGY PLC  ANNUAL REPORT 2008    21 Construction of the key facilities and related infrastructure in 
r eadiness	 for	 the	 Q3	 start	 is	 making	 good	 pr ogr ess	 with	 all	 of	
the key elements to enable production from the MPT now in an 
advanced stage of preparation. These include key features such 
as well pads, in-field infrastructure, processing facilities, export 
facilities and power generation and utilities.
The overall development includes the construction of four 
planned processing trains with a capacity of 205,000 bopd  
and scope for expansion:
•	 Q3	 2009:	 Mangala	 pr oduction	 train	 1	 (30,000	 bopd	 capacity),	
initial export by trucking
•	 Q4	 2009:	 Mangala	 pr oduction	 train	 2	 (50,000	 bopd	 capacity),	
export by pipeline
•	 H1	 2010:	 Mangala	 pr oduction	 train	 3	 (50,000	 bopd	 capacity),	
providing for 125,000 bopd Mangala plateau production
•	 2011:	 Pr oduction	 train	 4	 (75,000	 bopd	 capacity),	 pr oviding	 
for 175,000 bopd Rajasthan plateau production
Cairn has been able to significantly enhance the reserves, STOIIP 
and production rates since the original FDP was approved by the 
GoI in 2006. 
The key features of the revised Mangala FDP submitted in 2008 
and which is now with GoI for approval are:
•	 A	 25%	 incr ease	 in	 the	 plateau	 pr oduction	 rate	 to	 
125,000 bopd 
•	 Upwar d	 r evision	 of	 the	 2P	 (P50)	 STOIIP	 to	 1,293	 mmbbls,	 an	
increase of more than 20% over the earlier estimated figures
•	 A	 30%	 incr ease	 in	 the	 2P	 r eserves	 and	 2C	 r esour ces	 over	
previous estimates to 474 mmbbls (a recovery factor of 
around 37% of 2P STOIIP)
The revised FDP was submitted following further drilling in the 
development area, along with extensive subsurface and detailed 
design and engineering studies.
The front end engineering design for Bhagyam has been completed. 
The Aishwariya STOIIP has increased to 293 mmbbls. The estimated 
increased 2P reserves and 2C resources is 62 mmboe supporting a 
plateau production of 20,000 bopd compared to the 10,000 bopd 
plan approved in 2006. These estimates are subject to regulatory and 
partner approvals and the implementation of a revised FDP .
 
Development – Pipeline – (Cairn India 70% (Operator)  
ONGC 30%)
Construction of the ~600 km insulated and heated pipeline is 
well underway with more than 4,000 personnel involved in the 
building of the facilities including the terminals. 
Approval under Right of Use (RoU) has been obtained in 
principle from the GoI for the entire length of the pipeline from 
Barmer to the Gujarat coast. The land for all the above ground 
installations and the terminals at Viramgam, Radhanpur and the 
Gujarat coast has been acquired.
The pipeline route through Rajasthan and Gujarat passes through 
eight districts and more than 250 villages. There are also 35 heating 
stations under construction along the length of the pipeline plus 
a terminal at Viramgam, which will function as both a storage and 
pump station with the ability to distribute to refiners. 
Currently there are nine pipeline laying spreads deployed in 
Gujarat and Rajasthan. To date ~215 km of pipeline has been 
constructed and lowered. 
The pipeline route has ~600 crossings of various types  
(rivers, roads, rail etc) with all the necessary approvals from 
the respective statutory authorities in place. In total there are 
59 cased crossings of which 36 have been completed with 
construction underway on seven additional cased crossings.
Construction at the Viramgam terminal is well advanced, with 
all storage tanks and the main building superstructures nearing 
completion. The manufacture and delivery of all long lead items 
are in the final stages of completion and are well in advance of 
the dates they are required on site to support construction.

BUSINeSS revIeW
22    CAIRN ENERGY PLC  ANNUAL REPORT 2008 Rajasthan – Sales 
India currently imports more than two million bopd against 
a domestic production of 700,000 bopd. The Indian refining 
sector is growing rapidly and demand for crude oil is expected 
to increase. 
Following final GoI approvals, the route of the Rajasthan pipeline 
allows access to an existing pipeline infrastructure, with a final 
coastal delivery point that will afford access to the majority of 
India’s refining capacity.
The oil from Rajasthan is categorised as medium sweet crude 
with an average API of 28º. The viscosity and pour point are 
relatively high, but normal for crude generated from this type  
of onshore lacustrine source rock. The oil must however be  
kept warm during transportation. 
Prior to first production via the pipeline the crude from the  
MPT will be trucked to the Gujarat coast. The GoI has nominated 
Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Limited (MRPL) as 
purchaser of the crude and is in the process of confirming 
additional nominees. Currently, Cairn India’s focus is to complete 
arrangements	 for	 crude	 oil	 sales	 in	 Q3	 2009.	
In order to facilitate the trucking and sale of oil ahead of the 
pipeline completion trial runs have been successfully carried  
out on the route from Mangala to the Gujarat coast.
Kameshwari Development Area (Cairn India 100%) 
During 2008 the GoI approved the three discoveries made in 
Kameshwari West 2, 3 and 6 and the new Development Area  
of 822 km
2
.
Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR)
Cairn has made 25 discoveries in the RJ-ON-90/1 block to date 
and has established a significant growing resource base in the 
Barmer basin, currently estimated at around 3.7 billion barrels  
of oil in place. Cairn continues its efforts to develop this resource 
base through the application of appropriate cost efficient 
technologies. The initial focus has been to develop the MBA fields 
which contain over two billion barrels in place in the Fatehgarh 
reservoirs, through primary and secondary recovery schemes. 
Cairn continues its efforts on the staged and early application of 
aqueous-based chemical flooding EOR techniques in the MBA 
fields. Early application of chemical flooding EOR in these fields 
would be designed to increase the overall recovery from the 
fields, extend their crude oil production plateau periods, reduce 
water production, mitigate future decline rates and potentially 
accelerate crude oil production. Cairn is actively planning to 
conduct an EOR pilot trial in the Mangala field following very 
encouraging results obtained from the laboratory and simulation 
studies. The current assessment of the EOR resource base is 
more than 300 mmbbls of incremental recoverable oil from the 
MBA fields. 
In addition Cairn continues to evaluate the resources and the 
development options of the other discoveries, of which the 
Barmer Hill formation over the Mangala and Aishwariya fields 
contains around 400 mmbbls of oil in place in tighter reservoir 
rocks (lower permeabilities). This reservoir has tested oil at rates 
of up to 250 bopd after stimulation. Analogous fields in the 
world have been developed with expected ultimate recoveries 
of 7-20% under primary and secondary recovery schemes. Cairn 
is planning to conduct pilot activities to evaluate this additional 
resource potential and associated development options. 
Cairn will also continue to consider low cost development 
options for the smaller fields through the use of cost effective 
technologies and by leveraging the existing infrastructure. 
Cairn India – Producing Assets
Average gross production from Block CB/OS-2 for 2008 was 
13,778 boepd (comprising average gas production of 39 million 
standard cubic feet of gas per day (mmscfd) and average oil/
condensate production of 7,228 bopd). 
Oil production has increased from the new wells that were added 
during the 2008 infill well development drilling campaign.
Krishna-Godavari Basin – Eastern India 
Ravva (Cairn India 22.5% (Operator) 
Average gross production from the Ravva field for 2008  
was 53,809 boepd (comprising average oil production of  
41,999 bopd and average gas production of 71 mmscfd). 
Production at Ravva is being sustained with the contribution 
from new wells and successful workovers that were conducted  
in the 2008 drilling campaign. Further studies are continuing  
to identify additional in-place reserves within the field.
 
Three new infield subsea pipelines have been installed to 
overcome pipeline capacity bottlenecks and the commissioning 
of these pipelines is ongoing to aid production from the field.
Cairn India – Exploration 
During 2008 Cairn India operated four of seven wells in which  
it participated, three of which were successful: 
•	 The	 RB-4	 well	 in	 Ravva	 encounter ed	 additional	 oil	 sands	 that	
were later put on stream at 500 bopd through the Ravva 
production facilities. 
•	 Raageshwari	 East-1	 in	 Rajasthan	 flowed	 500	 bopd	 and	
0.4 mmscfd on test from Thumbli sands in a separate oil 
accumulation adjacent to the Raageshwari field. 
•	 The	 Mangala	 North-1	 well	 extended	 the	 contingent	 r esour ce	
in the Barmer Hill Formation for the Mangala field. 
Two wells were drilled in CB-ONN-2002/1 and one in each of 
GV-ONN-2002/1 and GV-ONN-97/1, all of which were dry. 
Seismic acquisition included both 2D and 3D seismic in blocks 
KG-ONN-2003/1, GV-ONN-2003/1 and 2D in block VN-
ONN-2003/1. A marine 2D seismic survey was also completed  
in block KK-DWN-2004/1 in 2008. 
Over the next 12 months further drilling and seismic programmes 
are planned. Drilling is scheduled onshore in the KG basin, with 
acquisition of 3D seismic totalling 1,800 km

CAIRN ENERGY PLC  ANNUAL REPORT 2008    25 Greenland
Capricorn has acquired a leading frontier exploration position 
offshore west and south Greenland.
The prospective geological basins around the coast of 
Greenland are at a very early stage of evaluation with only six 
offshore and one onshore exploration well having been drilled  
to date, and most of those during the 1970s. However, the 
results of these wells, together with more recent onshore 
geological mapping over the past 15 years, have confirmed  
the presence of all the essential elements required for the 
generation and trapping of hydrocarbons.
The Circum-Arctic Resource Appraisal study published by the  
US Geological Survey (USGS) in 2008 estimates significant  
‘yet to find’ hydrocarbons within the Arctic Greenlandic basins, 
recognising Greenland as a potentially very prospective, but 
under- explored country.
The report contains the USGS assessment of risked potential  
in the eastern Greenland (31 billion boe), northern Greenland 
(3.3 billion boe) and western Greenland – east Canada  
(17 billion boe) basins. The south Greenland off-shore area lies 
outside of the Arctic Circle and was not included in the survey. 
The Greenlandic and Danish authorities are in the process of 
gradually opening up the Arctic areas of these basins to the 
industry through competitive bid rounds, whilst other selected 
areas are available via application.
During 2008, Capricorn completed its obligation seismic work 
programme for the first licence phase over all six of its operated 
licences. A 6,600 km 2D seismic survey was acquired in the Disko 
West blocks Sigguk and Eqqua, followed by the acquisition of a 
further 1,200 km 2D seismic survey in the southern Kingittoq and 
Saqqamuit blocks and around 1,780 km of 2D seismic data over 
the Salliit and Uummannarsuaq blocks (Cape Farewell 1 & 2). 
Processing of all the collected data is nearing completion.
A Controlled Source Electromagnetic Survey (CSEM) was also 
acquired in 2008 over the Lady Franklin and Atammik blocks 
operated by EnCana and the data is currently being evaluated. 
Additional seismic and well site surveys are being planned for 
the 2009 operational season. 
Bangladesh
Production and Development
In 2008, the Sangu gas field passed a landmark of 10 years on 
production, during which time it has consistently demonstrated 
an enviable record for safety and low cost production. The field 
is now in decline and during the year, Cairn and its JV partners 
successfully completed three well intervention programmes and 
committed to a compression project, which is currently being 
implemented. These measures will help to increase and extend 
production.
The third well intervention programme carried out on wells 1  
and 9 in the Sangu field resulted in an initial 60% improvement  
in production, and rates are now around 55 mmscfd. 
Operating and Exploration Review
Continued
Capricorn: Capricorn continues to build an asset base for exploration  
led growth and has strengthened its exploration portfolio by building  
its acreage position in Greenland throughout 2008. 
Capricorn now has assets in South Asia (Northern India, Bangladesh  
and Nepal), Greenland, the Mediterranean (Tunisia, Albania and  
pending licence awards in Spain) and Papua New Guinea. 
BUSINeSS revIeW
26    CAIRN ENERGY PLC  ANNUAL REPORT 2008 To augment further gas production from Sangu the installation  
of an onshore compressor is under way and is expected to be 
operational by July 2009. 
Sangu has produced in excess of 440 bcf since production 
started in 1998. Located in the Bay of Bengal, some 50 km off 
the coast at Chittagong, the field is the only offshore gas field  
in Bangladesh. Sangu was one of the largest discoveries in the 
1990s, when Cairn was one of the first international companies 
to start operating in the country. To date, Cairn and its JV 
partners have invested approximately $1bn in Bangladesh. 
The JV partners in the Sangu field are currently Cairn, Santos  
and HBR Energy.
Exploration
Following the drilling campaign at Magnama and Hatia earlier  
in 2008, there have been no further operations in Block 16 and 
an appraisal programme is being considered.
In Block 5 Cairn and its JV Partner Santos have decided not  
to proceed into the next phase of the PSC and the block has 
therefore been returned to the Government of Bangladesh.
Nepal
The security situation in Nepal continues to be monitored 
closely. Contractual force majeure remains in place on the 
acreage in Nepal, precluding in-country operations. As soon as 
the security situation permits, fieldwork will include aerogravity 
and seismic acquisition. 
other Assets 
(Tunisia, Albania, Australia, Peru, Spain, Papua New Guinea)
In the Mediterranean, site surveys have been carried out in 
Tunisia for exploration well locations in both the Louza and 
Nabeul permits. 
An environmental impact assessment is presently underway 
offshore Albania ahead of a planned 2009 3D seismic survey. 
Several licence applications offshore Spain remain pending.  
As a result of an ongoing rationalisation programme, the 
exploration permits inherited from Plectrum in Australia  
(Bremer Basin), Peru and The Shetlands have been either 
transferred or relinquished. 
In Papua New Guinea the Operator (Talisman) has recently 
completed a 3D seismic survey over the undeveloped Pandora 
gas field to define better the extent of the gas resource.

28    CAIRN ENERGY PLC  ANNUAL REPORT 2008 our Corporate responsibility Priorities
Cairn is conscious that its operations – especially in regions of 
economic, social or environmental sensitivity – may have impacts 
on staff, local communities and the environment. Cairn aspires  
to the highest standards in all of its business activities including 
corporate responsibility. Cairn promotes the principles of 
respect, relationships and responsibility to staff, partners, 
suppliers and contractors. This helps to create a widespread  
and sustainable business culture, founded on a fundamental 
respect for people. 
Underpinning our strategy for transformational growth is  
the phased development of our 25 oil discoveries in Rajasthan, 
complemented by a new and exciting frontier exploration 
position in Greenland. 
We remain committed to ensuring the sustainability of  
our business strategy by conducting all of our activities  
in a responsible manner. 
During 2008, we concentrated on eight key areas of business 
practice identified as having high significance through our 
business risk management and stakeholder engagement 
processes. These are:
• Stakeholder Engagement
• Business Ethics
•  Employee Development
• Health Safety and Security
• Community Development
• Human Rights
• Environmental Impacts
• Climate Change
We have sought to meet these priorities through responsible 
business practices underpinned by our policies and guiding 
principles. Some years ago, Cairn established specific group-
wide policies for Health, Safety and Environment, Security  
and Corporate Social Responsibility. Endorsed by the Board, 
these policies establish the principles by which the Company  
is managed. Our CR Guiding principles describe Cairn’s 
fundamental values and approach to managing CR.

Stakeholder engagement
At Cairn we believe that building strong, open and lasting 
relationships with our stakeholders is not merely a social 
responsibility, it is also vital to achieving our business goals.  
Our activities are influenced by – and may potentially impact 
– a range of different stakeholders at local, national and 
international levels. In particular, governments and local 
communities can significantly affect our capacity to carry out  
our activities and achieve our aims. In Rajasthan, the scale of  
our development project requires extensive consultation.  
This continues to be guided by a Public Consultation and 
Disclosure Plan that completed 54 consultation meetings in 
2008. Thirty-four grievances were received for the Rajasthan 
project in 2008 all of which were successfully resolved. In 2008, 
we have initiated public consultation in Greenland where we 
carried out a seismic acquisition campaign without recording  
a single grievance in relation to our activity. 
Business ethics
Corruption when it occurs is recognised as a major hindrance  
to sustainable development with an often disproportionate 
impact on poor communities. At its worst the impact on 
businesses can be considerable, impeding economic growth, 
distorting competition and representing serious legal  
and reputational risks. 
Revenues paid to government and the value of contracts 
awarded in carrying out our activities can be significant in the 
countries in which we operate and in the local communities  
in which we work. 
It is important that we operate at all times with integrity,  
honesty and transparency. The Code of Business Ethics  
and Whistleblowing Policy are currently under review.  
A comprehensive communication plan to roll out the new  
Code and Policy to all staff is proposed for 2009.
employee Development
Cairn’s success is driven by its people. Consequently, employee 
engagement and personal and organisational development 
have been key focus areas for the Company throughout 2008, 
particularly in the Capricorn arm of the business where the 
organisational transformation has been greatest. In 2008,  
we have updated HR policies for Capricorn after an employee 
engagement survey was carried out across the UK and 
Bangladesh. Leadership and management development  
has remained a key focus being recognised by Cairn receiving 
the Scotland PLC Developing Your People award for 2008.
Absentee rates across the business also remain below the UK 
Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development benchmark 
although there has been some increase in absenteeism over  
the business in 2008. 
Health, Safety and Security
We recognise that we must protect the health, safety and 
security of our employees and contractors working on our sites 
and the people who come into contact with our operations.  
In Rajasthan and Gujarat more than 10,000 people are employed 
in building the MPT and pipeline to the Gujarat coast. We are 
pleased to report that our safety statistics have improved across 
the business and remain below the average for the oil and gas 
industry as last reported by the International Association of Oil 
and Gas Producers (OGP) for 2007. In 2008, we also maintained 
zero lost time incidents for a 10th consecutive year at our Sangu 
production plant in Bangladesh. 
In 2008, Corporate Responsibility guiding principles 
were reviewed and updated in line with the re-organisation  
of the Group and stakeholders’ expectations. 
Corporate Responsibility

30    CAIRN ENERGY PLC  ANNUAL REPORT 2008 Community Development
Cairn recognises that its activities can affect the social and 
economic environment of the communities in which we operate. 
This is particularly true where Cairn’s presence dominates local 
industrial or commercial activity as is the case in the remote and 
arid part of Rajasthan where Cairn are developing major oil and 
gas fields. In 2008, we have continued our partnership with the 
IFC, further establishing the Enterprise Centre to promote local 
economic development, a rural dairy development project and  
a child and maternal health awareness initiative. 
human rights
Cairn recognises the importance of human rights. In Rajasthan, 
we continue to apply a ‘Rights Aware’ approach to safeguard  
the local community’s right to water in an area with limited  
water resources while accessing the water required to support  
our operations. Land acquisition for the Rajasthan project is also 
important for a project requiring land access for well pads, 
terminals and pipelines. Consultation underpins the land 
acquisition plans and ensure that processes for grievances and 
compensation are well understood by effected stakeholders.
environmental Impact
Cairn recognises that its exploration, development and 
production activities can have an impact on the environment. 
Some of Cairn’s exploration and production acreage lies in  
areas of environmental significance. Cairn recognises its 
responsibilities and focuses on the avoidance of negative 
impacts on the environment during its operations. In 2008,  
we were pleased to complete the seismic acquisition offshore 
Greenland without safety or environmental incident. 
Last year, we reported that we were exploring long-term water 
effluent management solutions for our production facility at 
Sangu in Bangladesh in order to eradicate the requirement to 
dilute effluent to meet regulatory discharge limits. We have been 
examining the feasibility of reinjecting produced water into a 
non-producing well and testing the effectiveness of this solution, 
culminating in a successful pilot carried out in October and 
November of 2008. Produced water injection will be continued 
in 2009. 
Climate Change
Activities involved in our operations, such as power generation, 
flaring, venting and transportation, produce emissions to air, 
including methane (CH
4
) and carbon dioxide (CO
2
), two gases 
recognised as GHG. The burning of oil and gas, our primary 
products, also produces emissions. Climate change is a complex 
issue with many causes both natural and due to human activity. 
Energy is essential to social and economic progress but we 
recognise that we have a responsibility to take a precautionary 
approach to climate change. In 2008, we adopted a climate 
change strategy for the group focussing on four key areas:
i. Verifying and reporting on GHG
ii. Maintaining energy and emissions efficiency
iii. Demonstrating informed and transparent action  
on climate change
iv. Contributing to programmes addressing environmental  
and social impacts of climate change
At all times, we seek to minimise GHG emissions of our 
operations. In 2008, we met our targets for GHG emissions 
across the business maintaining our emissions relative to 
hydrocarbon production below the average for the oil and gas 
industry as last reported by OGP for 2007.

Accounting overview
In March 2008 CIL arranged a private placement with Petronas 
and Orient Global Tamarind Fund Pte Limited, who subscribed 
$634m for a total of 113m new shares, representing 4% of  
the company. As a consequence Cairn’s holding in CIL has 
reduced from 69% to 65%. 
The 35% interest in CIL held by external shareholders is reflected 
in our Financial Statements as a minority interest, as is the 10% 
interest in Capricorn held by Dyas.
The fair values assigned to the assets and liabilities of subsidiaries 
acquired in the last financial year have been reassessed in accordance 
with IFRS 3 resulting in a reduction on goodwill from $14m to $4m 
(see Note 3 of the Fiancial Statements for further details). In addition, 
the prior period results have been adjusted for changes in the 
accounting for deferred tax. 
The Group’s significant accounting policies and details of  
the key accounting estimates and assumptions are disclosed 
within the notes to the Financial Statements where appropriate. 
The net impact of these adjustments is set out in Note 37 of  
the Financial Statements.
Production, Revenue and Gross Profit
Oil production accounted for 54% (2007: 37%) of the Group’s 
entitlement production. Total average entitlement production 
for 2008 has fallen by 35% from 19,809 boepd to 12,801 boepd. 
This reflects the sale of 50% of our interest in Sangu last year, 
a general decline in gross production across all of our fields 
and the impact of higher oil prices, which also reduces Cairn’s 
entitlement interest.
Lower entitlement production levels have, however been offset 
by the strong oil prices and revenue therefore remains in line 
with 2007. 
Total production costs, which include pre-award costs and stock 
movements, have also remained in line with 2007. Production 
costs per boe have increased slightly as the fixed cost elements 
are spread over a declining production base; in addition pre-
award costs have increased.
Unsuccessful exploration costs of $48m for the year primarily 
relate to dry exploration wells in and proposed relinquishment of 
the GV-ONN 97/1, GV-ONN 2002/1 and CB-ONN-2002/1 blocks.
Total depletion and decommissioning charges have fallen 
significantly reflecting the sale of 50% of our interest in Sangu  
in 2007. The depletion and decommissioning charge per boe 
has also fallen from $13.29 to $10.16 as a consequence of 
reserve additions in Sangu and CB/OS-2.
Gross profit for the year was $137m (2007: $62m).
Profit for the Year
Administrative expenses include non-cash charges for share-
based payments of $21m (2007: $25m) and for depreciation 
and amortisation of $10m (2007: $6m). Net of these charges, 
administrative expenses have increased from $57m to $64m 
reflecting the growth in CIL’s corporate infrastructure.
An impairment charge of $13m has been recognised against  
the Magnama and Hatia exploration well costs incurred  
in the year. The impairment charge in 2007 also related  
to Magnama and Hatia well costs and certain other blocks  
in Bangladeshand Nepal.
Net finance income for the year was $42m (2007: $52m).  
Finance income received, mainly bank interest, was $66m 
(2007: $65m). Finance costs have increased from $13m to 
$24m primarily as a result of realised foreign exchange losses 
(increased from $6m to $10m) and charges in respect of  
options held to manage Rupee currency exposures (increased 
from $3m to $7m).
The Group made an exceptional gain of $356m on the deemed 
disposal of 4% of CIL to Petronas and Orient Global Tamarind 
Fund Pte Limited through an issue of shares. The prior year’s 
exceptional gain relates to the disposal of 31% of CIL on its  
initial public offering (IPO) and the disposal of a 10% interest  
in Capricorn to Dyas. These gains are not chargeable to tax.
The Group’s total tax charge for the year was $74m (2007: $34m). 
Of this, only $14m is current tax (2007: $4m, after the release 
of an $8m provision). Actual tax paid was $14m (2007: $15m). 
The majority of the total tax charge is deferred tax on temporary 
differences between the book values and tax written down 
values of the Rajasthan fields. Deferred tax is provided at the 
effective tax rate expected to apply over the life of these fields.
Reported profit for the year was $367m (2007 restated: 
$1,556m). Profit for the year, adjusted for the gains arising on  
the deemed disposal and IPO of CIL, was $11m (2007 restated: 
loss $23m).
CAIRN ENERGY PLC  ANNUAL REPORT 2008    35 Portfolio Management
The Board continues to monitor the Group’s portfolio actively. 
In order to secure a release from commitments: the Group 
relinquished its interests in Block 5 Bangladesh and Blocks 
214/19 and 214/20 West of Shetland and transferred $1.5m to 
Gold Oil along with its interest in Block Z-34 Peru. In addition, 
exploration permits WA-379-P and WA-380-P offshore Western 
Australia were transferred to Enovation Resources Limited and 
Arcadia Petroleum Limited respectively. These transactions had 
no impact on the Group’s profit for the year.
Cash Flow, Capital Investment and liquidity
Cash flow from operating activities has decreased slightly from 
$155m to $150m.
Major inflows during the year came from the private placement 
by CIL raising $630m (net of expenses) and from the drawdown 
of $425m of its $850m facility, taking the total debt drawn at the 
year end to $500m. The Group earned interest on cash balances 
of $51m (2007: $65m).
Cash outflow on capital expenditure is set out on the table below:
 2008 2007 
 $m $m
Exploration/appraisal expenditure 125 156
Development/producing expenditure 494 244
Other capital expenditure 5 11
In light of the downturn in global market conditions the 
Group has targeted its cash resources on the core Mangala 
development project in Rajasthan and where prudent, 
exploration activities have been deferred, resulting in  
a lower overall exploration spend this year.
The Board will continue to focus the Group’s cash resources 
to maximise shareholder value and maintain financial and 
operational flexibility. Balance sheet additions on the core 
Mangala development in 2009 are expected to be $910m  
net to Cairn ($1.3bn gross). 
Group net cash at 31 December 2008, after taking account of  
the $500m debt drawn was $898m (2007: $827m). The facility  
is now fully drawn and has a phased repayment schedule that 
does not start until July 2010. 
Details of the Group’s financial risk management objectives  
and policies are set out in Note 30 of the Financial Statements.
Financial Strategy and outlook
The Group’s existing cash resources, debt facilities and cash 
flow from operations provide adequate funding to complete 
the core Mangala development project plus the pipeline and to 
commence first production in 2009. However, Cairn will continue 
to monitor the credit markets to assess current pricing and may 
consider expanding its facilities in due course.
Cairn has always maintained a capital structure appropriate for 
its operations in exploration, appraisal and development. Given 
the background of global market conditions Cairn decided to 
strengthen its equity capital base and earlier this month raised  
a further $161m through a 5% placing of shares. 
Cairn has entered 2009 with the financial and operational 
flexibility necessary to deliver its key project in Rajasthan thereby 
providing cash flow to target the next phase of growth and 
continued creation of shareholder value.

40    CAIRN ENERGY PLC  ANNUAL REPORT 2008 GOVERNANCE AND ACCOUNTS
The Company is subject to a variety of risks including those which derive from the nature of the oil and gas exploration  
and production business and relate to the countries in which it conducts its activities. Outlined below is a description of the 
principal risk factors that may affect performance. Such risk factors are not intended to be presented in any order of priority. 
Any of the risks, as well as the other risks and uncertainties referred to in this report, could have a material adverse effect  
on business performance. In addition, the risks set out below may not be exhaustive and additional risks and uncertainties,  
not presently known to the Company, or which the Company currently deems immaterial, may arise or become material  
in the future. The risk factors should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary note to shareholders in relation to 
forward-looking statements set out on page 136. 
The Company’s Performance is Dependent upon the Performance of Cairn India and the Capricorn Group
The Company’s principal assets are its 65% shareholding in Cairn India, a company listed on the BSE and NSE in India, and its 90% 
shareholding in its unlisted subsidiary, Capricorn. Accordingly, the Company’s performance and market price are dependent upon 
the performance of Cairn India and Capricorn. Any failure by Cairn India or by Capricorn to successfully develop their respective 
businesses could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business performance.
The Company’s material shareholding in Cairn India represents a significant proportion of the Company’s value. Any fluctuations  
in the market price of Cairn India’s share price may have a direct effect on the Company’s share price.
Relationship with Cairn India
The Company exercises its influence over Cairn India through certain provisions contained within the memorandum and articles  
of association of Cairn India and by the terms of a relationship agreement between Cairn India and the Company. Under the 
memorandum and articles of association, the Company has three nominee directors on the board of CIL, including the Chairman 
and, additionally, one nominee director on the audit committee and two nominee directors on the remuneration committee.  
The relationship agreement regulates the sharing and disclosure of information to enable the Company to comply with its legal  
and regulatory obligations and also specifically provides that CIL shall comply with such best practice principles, standards, policies 
and provisions which the Company reasonably requires it to comply with. The required information is covered in a definitive list of 
agreed information requirements.
As a listed company on the LSE, the Company is subject to the rules of the FSA, the LSE, the Listing Rules and the Disclosure and 
Insider Trading Rules, whereas as a company listed on the BSE and NSE, Cairn India is subject to the rules, regulations and guidelines  
of SEBI and to its listing agreement with the BSE. The Company is therefore at risk of changes to the company regulations in these 
countries that may affect their operations and the risks of not fully meeting the requirements in both countries. The Company has 
adopted a suite of policies and procedures and through their application, aims to minimise the risk of inconsistent communications  
or not fully complying with market reporting requirements in the UK and India. 
Project Assessment and Delivery
Prior to sanction of any development project it is necessary to determine with suitable accuracy the resource base, the optimal 
production profile of the field, the costs of development, the time it will take to complete the development as well as commencing 
or concluding commercial arrangements with buyers for the sale of the oil or gas produced. Risks during the pre-sanction period are 
typically technical, engineering, commercial or regulatory in nature. Specific risks include the possible over-estimation of crude oil 
and natural gas initially in place and recoverable, inadequate technical and geophysical assessment, inaccurate cost estimations,  
not securing appropriate long-term commercial agreements or, where required, applicable governmental or regulatory consents, 
permits, licences or approvals. This can cause delays to the commercialisation of reserves and this may have a material effect on 
medium to long-term cash flow and income. 
Post sanction, project delivery is particularly subject to technical, commercial, contractor, economic and corporate responsibility risks. 
Projects can be unsuccessful for many reasons, including availability, competence and capability of human resources and contractors, 
mechanical and technical difficulties and infrastructure constraints, resulting in cost increases, delays in completion and deferral of 
income from production from the field under development. In addition, some development projects may require the use of new and 
advanced technologies or produce hydrocarbons from challenging reservoirs, which can exacerbate such problems. 
The Company’s principal project is the development by Cairn India of discovered oil fields in Rajasthan. The scope of this project 
includes the installation of the Mangala Processing Terminal (MPT), well pads, transportation infrastructure and export pipeline to 
enable the transport of produced and treated oil to designated end users in India. 
Availability of production from the largest oil field, Mangala, is currently scheduled for Q3 2009 with initial export by trucking. 
Thereafter Mangala production is expected to build up to 125,000 bopd with export via pipeline during the first half of 2010.  
The Bhagyam and Aishwariya Fields are then scheduled to commence production in 2011. Project risks include the potential for 
delays in the delivery of materials and equipment, construction, installation or commissioning activities, which may lead to delay  
in the start-up and build up in oil production levels from the MBA fields. 
The crude oil at the northern fields in Rajasthan is characterised by its viscous nature in the reservoir and its propensity to solidify  
at low temperatures, whether in the well-bore or at surface, than is commonly the case for most producing oil fields. This presents 
both extraction and transportation risks. The development, production and transportation plans for the northern fields are 
dependent upon availability of a reliable fuel supply for power generation and heating of the facilities. A parallel development  
Risk Factors
CAIRN ENERGY PLC  ANNUAL REPORT 2008    41 of the Raageshwari gas field in Rajasthan is being undertaken to provide such fuel gas. Under the present schedule, fuel gas will be 
available to meet the power generation and heating requirements to support availability of production from the Mangala field and 
the availability of transportation infrastructure during the second half of 2009. Residual risks are essentially similar to those which 
pertain to the completion of the Mangala development.
Efficient recovery of Mangala production requires the use of secondary recovery techniques, which requires the injection of water  
to maintain reservoir pressure and to sweep the oil to the production wells. The accessing, delivery and injection of this water into 
the reservoir has a number of associated risks including maintaining regulatory approval for the extraction of saline water from 
subterranean aquifers, maintaining the water infrastructure and injecting sufficient volumes of water into the reservoir to achieve  
the desired levels of secondary recovery. The inability to inject sufficient volumes of water could result in lower offtake volumes  
and lower ultimate recoverable reserves.
The development plans for the northern fields are expected to assume the use of EOR techniques to extract an additional 
incremental percentage of the estimated oil in place in the reservoirs. There is a risk that Cairn India may not be able to use EOR 
techniques successfully. These risks include sourcing, purchasing and transportation of large quantities of the types of polymer 
chemicals that would be required for the EOR techniques, failure to maintain the properties of the polymer chemicals in the 
reservoir, leading to lower incremental recovery of oil and polymer fouling of the surface facilities leading to a deterioration of the 
operating efficiency of the processing plant. The economic viability of the EOR application will be determined by the prevailing 
crude oil price and the incremental operational expenditure which includes the cost of chemicals. A pilot EOR project is planned 
shortly after commencement of production from the Mangala field to test the validity of the EOR techniques.
Operations
The Company’s revenues are dependent on the continued production from its operating facilities in India and Bangladesh. Operational 
risks include maintaining asset integrity, which can be affected by a number of factors including not following prescribed operating and 
maintenance procedures resulting in reduced plant availability, unplanned shutdowns and/or equipment failure. The performance by 
and sharing of risk between JV partners and the location of some of the Group’s operations (which may expose them to natural hazards 
such as cyclones, flooding and earthquakes) can also affect operations. If these risks materialise, the Group may not be able to meet its 
corporate responsibility policies and standards, or planned output levels or unit operating costs. These factors may have an effect on 
cost control, or a potentially material impact on the Group’s reputation and the results of the Group’s operations.
Future production of crude oil and natural gas from new fields is dependent on the Group finding, or acquiring and developing 
further reserves. The Group has exploration licences in a number of countries where environmental, geological and infrastructural 
conditions are challenging and as a consequence costs could be higher. 
The cost of drilling, completing and operating wells is often uncertain. As a result, the Group may incur cost overruns or may be 
required to curtail, delay or cancel drilling operations because of many factors, including unexpected drilling conditions, pressure  
or irregularities in geological formations, equipment failures or accidents, adverse weather conditions, the need for compliance  
with environmental regulations, governmental requirements and shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs and the 
delivery of equipment. 
If the Group fails to conduct successful exploration activities or to acquire assets holding oil and gas reserves and resources,  
the Group’s reserves and resources will decline as it extracts and depletes existing reserves. The Group’s future production depends 
significantly upon its success in finding or acquiring and developing additional reserves and resources. If the Group is unsuccessful, 
it may not meet its production targets, and its total proven reserves and production will decline, which could adversely affect the 
results of its operations and financial condition. 
Commercial
Cairn India may not be able to sell all of the oil that it is able to produce from its fields in Rajasthan or obtain the crude oil price 
determined in accordance with the PSC. Under the PSC Cairn India is obliged to sell 100% of its crude oil production to the GoI, 
which nominates the buyer(s). The GoI may not be able to fulfil its obligation under the PSC in which case Cairn India’s ability to  
sell all of the oil that it can produce and at the price set out in the PSC might be compromised. This could lead to reduced cash  
flow and future projects currently planned to be funded out of cash flows may be deferred.
The purchase price calculation mechanism set out in the PSC is based upon a basket of crude oils to be decided between Cairn 
India and the nominee(s) based upon a mixture and weighting of crude oils that would produce a quality similar to the quality of 
crude oil expected to be produced by Cairn India. There can be no assurance that the basket of crude oils used to determine the 
price of Cairn India crude oil sales to the nominee(s) will result in a value approximating to the price used by Cairn India in its 
development and financial planning.
Exchange Rates, Interest Rates, Currency Controls and Fiscal Regulation
The Group’s cash flow, income statement and balance sheet are reported in US Dollars and may be significantly affected by 
fluctuations in exchange rates. Shares in Cairn India are, and any dividends which may become payable in respect of them will be 
denominated in Rupees. The material holding in Cairn India by the Group, whose principal currency is not Rupees, exposes the 
Group to foreign currency exchange rate risk. 
GOVERNANCE AND ACCOUNTS
Risk Factors
Continued
42    CAIRN ENERGY PLC  ANNUAL REPORT 2008 GOVERNANCE AND ACCOUNTS
Cairn India has been funded largely in US Dollars through its cash generation from operations, the conversion of the IPO proceeds 
and its loan facilities, and has significant US Dollar cash holdings. Cairn India will nonetheless incur significant expenses in Rupees  
in connection with the development of the oil fields in Rajasthan. Accordingly, Cairn India has adopted and implemented a foreign 
exchange hedging policy to limit exposure to movement in the exchange rate between the US Dollar and the Rupee.
The Group’s financing costs may be significantly affected by interest rate volatility. Furthermore, the GoI currently operates certain 
controls on currency exports which restrict the transfer from India of Rupees. While the policy and practice of the GoI has been to 
relax many of these controls and no restrictions are in place at present that would prevent free remittance of dividends from Cairn 
India to the Company, there is a risk that controls may be re-imposed in future. Indian law further restricts the ability of the Company 
to dispose of certain of its shares in Cairn India until three years after the IPO.
Environmental Regulation 
The Group may incur material costs in complying with, or as a result of, health, safety and environmental laws and regulations.  
The Group is subject to a broad range of health, safety and environmental laws and regulations that impose controls on, among 
other things, the storage, handling and transportation of petroleum products, employee exposure to hazardous substances and 
other aspects of its operations. 
The Group may also incur liabilities for environmental damage caused by acts or omissions of any third party contractors. Further, the 
adoption of new health, safety and environmental laws and regulations, new interpretations of existing laws, increased governmental 
enforcement of environmental laws or other developments in the future may require additional capital expenditures or result in the 
Group incurring additional operating expenses in order to maintain current or future operations. These laws and regulations are 
increasingly stringent and may in the future create substantial environmental compliance or remediation liabilities and costs. 
If the Group fails to meet environmental requirements or has a major accident or disaster, it may also be subject to administrative, 
civil and criminal proceedings by governmental authorities, as well as civil proceedings by environmental groups and other 
individuals, which could result in fines, penalties and damages against it as well as orders that could limit, halt or even cause closure 
of its operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition.
Market Place
The Group’s results from its operations and financial condition are subject to fluctuations in oil and gas prices. The oil and natural gas 
industry is highly competitive. Due to, amongst other things, the significant increase and subsequent decline in international oil prices 
in 2008, the Group is subject to highly competitive market conditions for the resources required to conduct its ongoing business,  
in particular with regard to the engagement of leading third party service providers and the purchase of capital equipment. Coupled 
with relatively limited resources and expertise in India, in particular in the area surrounding Rajasthan, this has resulted in a strain on the 
specialist engineering and other services that Cairn India needs to develop its fields in Rajasthan. The remaining development costs,  
as well as the current target of the second half of 2009 for first commercial production from the Mangala field, are subject to these risks 
of raw material and equipment shortages, or price increases above those anticipated and an inability to procure or design the 
engineering services required. 
The current capital constraints may also impact the ability of the contractors and their sub-contractors working on the Rajasthan 
project, to deliver equipment, materials and personnel on schedule. The Company has sought to liaise closely with the primary 
contractors to ensure appropriate timing of payments.
Insurance
Consistent with good industry practice, an insurance programme is in place to mitigate significant losses. There is a risk, however,  
that the Group’s insurance policies may not be sufficient in covering all losses which it or any third parties may suffer. If the Group  
suffers an event for which it is not adequately insured, there is a risk that this could have a material adverse effect on its business,  
results of operations and financial condition. The insurance programme is also subject to certain limits, deductibles and other terms 
and conditions.
Human Resources
The Group’s performance and its ability to mitigate those risk factors within its control depend on the skills and efforts of its 
employees and management teams across the Group. Future success will depend to a large extent on the Group’s continued  
ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled and qualified personnel. Attracting and retaining top quality managerial talent  
is a challenge facing companies in the oil and gas exploration and production sector. Failure to have or retain key positions and 
functions in place could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, results of operations and financial condition.
Corporate Responsibility (CR) 
The Group recognises that applying its CR Policies and ‘Guiding Principles’ in all activities is essential in maintaining its ‘licence  
to operate’ and business reputation. CR risks occur when any part of the business fails to implement these Policies and ‘Guiding 
Principles’. CR risks that could affect the Group’s ability to deliver projects on time and within budget include inadequate 
stakeholder engagement, failure to put in place appropriate controls to mitigate environmental and social impacts, not having 
adequate processes in place to protect human rights in activities in our ‘sphere of influence’ and the ineffective implementation  
of health and safety policies, which could also lead to health problems and injuries at the Group’s worksites. 
Risk Factors
Continued
CAIRN ENERGY PLC  ANNUAL REPORT 2008    43 The Group’s producing fields and construction projects carry significant health, safety and environmental risks. The Group seeks to 
minimise these risks though the application of the CR Management System (CRMS). The CRMS provides the basis for managers and 
supervisors to conduct risk assessments and to identify and implement appropriate steps to minimise the risks to people, facilities 
and the environment. Road transportation has been identified as a key safety risk in our activities and appropriate measures are in 
place aimed at minimising the potential for accidents or environmental impacts.
War, Terrorist Attack and Natural Disasters
The Group’s business may be adversely affected by a war, terrorist attack, natural disaster or other catastrophe, particularly  
given the location of some of the Group’s assets in South Asia where terrorist attacks have become more prevalent in recent times. 
Regular security assessments, audits and ongoing engagement with Government officials are the main ways through which the 
Group mitigates the risks to staff and assets from terrorist actions. 
The Group’s assets are also exposed to risks from adverse weather conditions. In India the projects in Rajasthan and production 
operations in Cambay can be impacted by heavy rains during the monsoon season. Capricorn’s assets in Bangladesh are also 
exposed to risks from extreme weather conditions, such as cyclones, which can occur in South Asia. The low-lying nature of much  
of Bangladesh puts it at risk from any rise in sea levels as a result of global warming. Any damage to the Cairn India and Capricorn 
infrastructure in India or Bangladesh or disruption or suspension of production could have a material adverse affect on the financial 
condition and/or operating results of the Group.
Capricorn’s ability to conduct its operations in its Greenland acreage may be adversely affected by sea ice and icebergs even within 
the operating windows during which activities can normally proceed. 
Political Climate
The Group is active in a number of overseas markets and may be affected by a change in fiscal policy in respect of, or which impacts 
upon, these markets. The Group cannot predict the impact of future changes in fiscal policy in the countries and markets in which it 
operates. Amendments to existing legislation (particularly increases in tax rates or withdrawals of tax relief), the introduction of new  
tax laws (such as the imposition of import and/or export quotas or import and/or export tariffs) and changes from time to time in the 
interpretation of existing tax laws could materially adversely affect the Group’s reputation, financial condition and/or operating results.
Cairn India may be liable to pay cess under the Indian Oil Industry (Development) Act 1974 (‘OIDA cess’) in relation to the production 
of crude oil from Rajasthan under the terms of the RJ-ON-90/1 PSC. Any requirement to pay OIDA cess on commercial production 
of crude oil, whether or not recoverable pursuant to the terms of the PSC, may have a material adverse effect on Cairn India’s 
financial condition and results of operations.
In respect of the political climate in Nepal, with the declaration of a Republic on 28 May 2008 and the entry of the Maoist party into 
Government the security and political situation in that country has improved but remains sensitive. For this reason Capricorn has not 
lifted the force majeure notices served earlier in respect of its exploration interests and will await further progress before doing so. 
There is a risk that the situation in Nepal may never improve sufficiently to enable the Group to recommence its activities in that country. 
Cash Flow and Funding
Cairn has always maintained a capital structure appropriate for its operations in exploration, appraisal and development. Due to the 
concentration on exploration, appraisal and development activities, both Cairn India and Capricorn are expected to remain cash 
flow negative for some time. Given the current global market conditions, the Company strengthened its equity capital base in March 
2009 through placing approximately 5 per cent of the existing issued ordinary share capital with both new and existing institutional 
investors, in order to maintain operational and financial flexibility across Cairn’s operations, particularly in relation to the Rajasthan 
development and to its exploration position in Greenland. 
Cairn India finances its operations from cash generated from its producing fields, from the cash proceeds received and retained in 
respect of the IPO and from the private placement of shares to Petronas and Orient Global in 2008 and committed and available 
loan facilities. If production from any of the producing fields is interrupted or suspended, this would have a negative impact on the 
Group’s cash flow.
The directors consider that the existing banking facilities, together with the Group’s cash resources, currently provide sufficient 
funding to complete the core Mangala development and the export pipeline, and that the additional equity raised in March 2009 
will enable the Group to retain significantly greater optionality in the delivery of its Rajasthan project. 
Global Economic Slowdown and Associated Risk
The Group is exposed to liquidity risks, including risks associated with refinancing borrowings as they mature, the risk that borrowing 
facilities are not available to draw down and the risk that assets cannot readily be converted to cash without loss of value. This risk 
has been increased by the volatility of the current economic environment. The Group may be unable to obtain sufficient credit or 
may only be able to obtain credit on unfavourable terms due to banking and capital market conditions. If this happens, the Group 
may not be able to develop new projects or meet existing financial commitments and, as a result, operating results, revenues and 
cash-flows may be adversely affected.
The Group is exposed to counterparty risk that could result in financial losses and credit risks should those counterparties, including 
JV partners and suppliers, become unable to meet their obligations to the Group. The current economic climate has increased this 
counterparty risk.

GOVERNANCE AND ACCOUNTS
44    CAIRN ENERGY PLC  ANNUAL REPORT 2008 GOVERNANCE AND ACCOUNTS
Cairn is committed to achieving compliance with the principles and provisions set out in the Combined Code appended to 
the Listing Rules and to ensuring that high standards of corporate governance are maintained. The Board considers that the 
Company is compliant with the Combined Code, other than in the areas detailed on page 55. 
Set out below is a statement of how the Company applied the principles of the Combined Code for the year ended 31 December 2008.
The Board
Cairn’s business is international in scope and carries political, commercial and technical risks. Accordingly, particular attention is paid  
to the composition and balance of the Board to ensure that it has wide experience of the sector and regulatory environment in which 
Cairn operates, and appropriate financial and risk management skills. In each Board appointment, whether executive or non-executive, 
the Board considers that objectivity and integrity, as well as skills, experience and ability that will assist the Board in its key functions,  
are prerequisites for appointment. 
The Board currently comprises the Chairman, the Chief Executive, five executive directors and five independent non-executive 
directors. The directors’ biographies are on pages 38 to 39. Andrew Shilston and Ed Story also both served as non-executive 
directors during the year. However, following their resignations with effect from 23 May 2008 and 15 January 2009 respectively,  
their biographical details are no longer included. 
Hamish Grossart, Deputy Chairman, is currently Cairn’s senior independent non-executive director although this role will be taken 
over by Iain McLaren with effect from 19 May 2009. A key responsibility for the senior independent non-executive director is to be 
available to shareholders in the event that they may feel it inappropriate to relay views through the Chairman or the Chief Executive 
or the Finance Director. In addition, the senior independent non-executive director takes the lead role when the non-executive 
directors assess the performance of the Chairman, further details of which are set out on page 46. 
All of the directors are subject to election by shareholders at the first AGM after their appointment to the Board and to re-election 
by shareholders at least once every three years. In addition, any non-executive director who has served on the Board for more than 
nine years is subject to annual re-election. 
The division of responsibilities between the Chairman and the Chief Executive has been clearly established, set out in writing and 
agreed by the Board and was reviewed during 2008 to ensure it remains appropriate and effective. 
The Board has a formal schedule of matters specifically reserved to it for decision. These reserved matters include determination  
of the overall strategy of the Group and approval of the annual report and accounts and any other financial statements, the Group’s 
annual budget and amendments to that budget over a particular amount, borrowing and security, acquisitions and disposals,  
capital expenditure over a specified amount, amendments to the organisational structure of the Group and Board, approval  
of significant changes to accounting policies and approval of management incentive schemes and Group policy on pensions.  
The schedule of matters reserved to the Board was also reviewed and updated during 2008.
The Board delegates the execution of its strategic objectives to the Chief Executive’s Committee, which comprises the executive 
directors and senior management. Operational management of the Group on a day-to-day basis is delegated to the Management 
Operating Team, which comprises the asset managers and functional heads of department.
The Board has full and timely access to all relevant information to enable it to perform its duties. The Company Secretary is 
responsible for advising the Board, through the Chairman, on all corporate governance matters. In addition, each director has 
access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary and Deputy Company Secretary. There is also a procedure agreed  
by the Board for directors, in furtherance of their duties, to take independent professional advice if necessary, at the Company’s 
expense, up to a pre-determined limit. 
During 2008, seven scheduled meetings of the Board were held, six of which were held at the Company’s registered office in 
Edinburgh with the other meeting held in New Delhi. Details of attendance at each of those meetings, and at meetings of Board 
committees, are set out on page 51. 
During the year, certain further meetings took place to deal with specific matters that required to be considered at short notice. 
When a specific matter requires consideration at short notice, there is a procedure that sets out when those matters must be 
considered at a short-notice Board meeting and when they may be dealt with by a committee of the Board (comprising at least  
two non-executive directors (one of whom must be the Chairman or Deputy Chairman) and two executive directors). 
Any director who is physically unable to attend Board and committee meetings is given the opportunity to be consulted and 
comment in advance of the meeting by telephone or in writing. Video and telephone conferencing facilities are also used when 
directors are not able to attend meetings in person.
The formal agenda for each scheduled Board meeting, which regularly includes presentations from senior operational management, 
is set by the Chairman in consultation with the Chief Executive and the Company Secretary. In particular, the agenda for each Board 
meeting includes a detailed update on matters in respect of the Group’s Indian business from those directors of the Company who 
also sit in a non-executive capacity on the board of Cairn India (currently Sir Bill Gammell, Jann Brown and Malcolm Thoms).  
The Chief Executive of Cairn India, Rahul Dhir, also frequently attends parts of the meetings to ensure that the Board is kept fully 
Corporate Governance Statement
CAIRN ENERGY PLC  ANNUAL REPORT 2008    45 briefed on matters relating to Cairn India. Formal minutes of all Board and committee meetings are circulated to all directors  
prior to the next Board meeting and are considered for approval at that Board meeting. In addition, the members of the Board  
are in frequent contact between meetings to progress the Group’s business. The non-executive directors also meet informally, 
without any executives present, on a regular basis to discuss matters in respect of the business.
New directors receive a full and appropriate induction on joining the Board. This involves meetings with other Board members, 
senior management and certain of the Company’s principal advisers. In addition, a new director is provided with an induction pack 
which contains background materials and general information on the Company, the Company’s policies and procedures, financial 
information, an operational review and a briefing on directors’ legal and regulatory responsibilities. Details of the procedures 
followed for the appointments of Iain McLaren and Dr Jim Buckee, who were appointed as non-executive directors of the Company 
during 2008 and 2009 respectively, are set out on pages 49 and 50.
The Company provides the necessary resources for developing and updating its directors’ knowledge and capabilities. In particular, 
the Company is committed to the provision of continuing professional development training to its directors and in 2008 held a number 
of seminars for Board members, which are regularly presented by the Company’s external advisers and guest speakers, on subjects 
appropriate to the Company’s business, including changes to legislation, regulation and market practice. These seminars were held at 
the end of Board meetings and were attended by all directors present at such meetings. This process is continuing in 2009. Any director 
may request that a particular subject is covered in a seminar. In addition, all press cuttings relating to the Company and all brokers’  
and analysts’ reports on the Company are distributed to all directors. At least once a year, the Board visits an operational site and in 
December 2008, the directors visited the Company’s operations in Rajasthan, India. 
The Company has directors’ and officers’ liability insurance in place. 
Performance Evaluations 
The Board has a formal rigorous process of annual performance evaluation for the Board, audit, nomination and remuneration 
committees and individual directors. The Board reviews on an annual basis whether such performance evaluation should be 
conducted using an external resource. The Board decided, however, that for 2008 there was value in conducting the process 
internally to develop an appropriately tailored approach and benefit first-hand from direct input from individual directors. 
The performance evaluation of the Board and the Board committees was primarily based upon answers to a detailed questionnaire 
which had been updated since the previous year’s evaluation and which was prepared internally by the Company Secretary  
and Chairman. The questionnaire was distributed to all Board members and the Company Secretary. The areas covered in the 
questionnaire included the effectiveness of the Board and Board committees, performance against objectives, preparation for  
and performance at meetings and corporate governance matters. One particular area that the questionnaire addressed was the 
performance of those directors who are also non-executive directors of Cairn India in respect of the stewardship of that part of  
the Group’s business. The questionnaire addressed all of the issues raised by the Higgs Review of the role and effectiveness of  
non-executive directors. 
The review process carried out pursuant to the questionnaires can be summarised as follows:
Evaluators  Chairman  Executive directors   Non-executive directors
Evaluating
Board      
Chairman      
Board committees      
Executive directors      
Non-executive directors    
Self-assessment      
Once a questionnaire had been completed by each member of the Board and the Company Secretary, the Chairman held a meeting 
with each director and the Company Secretary individually, as appropriate to discuss their responses. The Chairman then reported the 
results of the process to the Board at a Board meeting, which discussed the comments and implemented the conclusions. The Board 
and Board committees are satisfied that they are operating effectively.
The Deputy Chairman sought the views of the executive directors and met with each of the other non-executive directors, in the 
absence of the Chairman, to discuss and assess the Chairman’s performance. The results of this review were then discussed with the 
Chairman. The Board (not including the Chairman) is satisfied that the Chairman’s performance is effective and that he demonstrates 
continued commitment to the role.
The performance evaluation process indicated areas for improvement, which have been or are being implemented. Following  
the performance evaluations, the Board believes that all of the directors’ performance (including those of Todd Hunt, Dr Mike Watts,  
Phil Tracy and Hamish Grossart, who are standing for re-election at the AGM) continues to be effective and that they demonstrate 
commitment to the role. 
GOVERNANCE AND ACCOUNTS
Corporate Governance Statement

46    CAIRN ENERGY PLC  ANNUAL REPORT 2008 GOVERNANCE AND ACCOUNTS
A performance evaluation of the Board, the Board committees and individual directors will continue to be conducted annually and 
the method for such review will continue to be reviewed by the Board in order to optimise the process.
The executive directors have their performance individually reviewed by the remuneration committee against objectives which  
are set annually. The bonuses payable to the executive directors under the Company’s cash bonus scheme (described further on 
page 66 and 67) are linked directly to the results of these reviews.
Independence of Non-Executive Directors
The Board evaluation and review process also covered the independence of each of the non-executive directors, taking into account 
their integrity, objectivity and contribution to the Board and its committees. In particular, the process again considered the 
independence of Hamish Grossart. 
Hamish Grossart
Since Mr Grossart has served on the Board for more than nine years, in terms of the Combined Code he can be considered as 
independent only if the Board deems him to be so. 
 
Mr Grossart commits a substantial amount of time to the affairs of the Company. In particular, Mr Grossart has been the Deputy 
Chairman and a member of the Company’s nomination, remuneration and audit committees for a number of years and has been the 
Company’s senior independent non-executive director since the role was created in 2003. Mr Grossart will however be relinquishing 
the role of senior independent non-executive director with effect from 19 May 2009 and the Board has agreed that Iain McLaren will 
assume this role on that date. In addition, Mr Grossart is resigning as chairman and a member of the remuneration committee and as 
a member of the nomination committee, also with effect from 19 May 2009. The Board has agreed that Jim Buckee will replace Mr 
Grossart as chairman of the remuneration committee and Norman Murray will replace him as a member. Todd Hunt  
will replace Mr Grossart as a member of the nomination committee.
The Board is aware that PIRC have queried whether Mr Grossart can be classed as an independent director of the Company. It is 
understood, however, that in terms of its internal policies, PIRC does not consider any non-executive director who has been on a 
board for more than nine years to be independent, notwithstanding that the Combined Code permits the Board to determine a 
director with this length of tenure to be independent. 
The Board believes that the following behaviours are essential in order for a director to be considered independent:
•  provides an objective, robust and consistent challenge to the assumptions, beliefs and views of senior management  
and the other directors;
•  questions intelligently, debates constructively and challenges rigorously and dispassionately;
•  acts at all times in the best interests of the organisation and its shareholders; and
•  has a detailed and extensive knowledge of the Group’s business, industry and the market as a whole.
Having thoroughly reviewed the matter, without Mr Grossart being present, the Board is firmly of the view that Mr Grossart 
demonstrates each of the behaviours set out above and that there is currently no evidence that length of tenure is having an  
adverse impact on his independence. The Board believes that Mr Grossart’s performance continues to be effective and that  
he demonstrates continued commitment to the role. In particular, the Board noted that Mr Grossart does not participate in the 
Company’s cash bonus scheme, share option plans, long-term incentive plans or pension scheme and is not dependent upon  
the fees received from the Company as his primary source of income. 
Mr Grossart has indicated that he is willing to stand for re-election as a director of the Company on an annual basis and a resolution 
will be proposed at the AGM to be held on 19 May 2009 to this effect. The Board believes that it is in shareholders’ interests for  
Mr Grossart to be re-elected as an independent non-executive director of the Company. In addition, the Board is firmly of the belief 
that due to both the current economic climate and the recent changes in Board composition, Mr Grossart’s experience, particularly 
in financial matters, and his detailed understanding of the Group’s business are valuable at this time. The Board therefore believes 
that Mr Grossart’s continued presence on the Board and the audit committee is helpful for continuity. 
Having reviewed the independence of each of the non-executive directors, the Board concluded that all non-executive directors of 
the Company are independent.
Board Committees
The Board has established an audit committee, a remuneration committee and a nomination committee, each of which has formal 
terms of reference approved by the Board. The terms of reference for each of these committees satisfy the requirements of the 
Combined Code and are reviewed internally on an ongoing basis by the Board. Copies of the terms of reference are available for 
inspection on request and will be available for inspection before the AGM to be held on 19 May 2009.
The committees are provided with all necessary resources to enable them to undertake their duties in an effective manner.  
The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the committees and the minutes of all committee meetings are circulated to  
all directors. 
Set out below are reports from the audit committee, remuneration committee and nomination committee.
Corporate Governance Statement
Continued
CAIRN ENERGY PLC  ANNUAL REPORT 2008    47 1. Audit Committee Report
The audit committee comprises three non-executive directors, all of whom are considered by the Board to be independent. 
Currently, its members are Iain McLaren (chairman), Hamish Grossart and Dr Jim Buckee. The Board is satisfied that two members  
of the committee have recent and relevant financial experience. Mr McLaren was formerly a partner at KPMG LLP . Mr Grossart 
serves on audit committees of other listed companies and trained as an investment banker. The Board considers it appropriate  
for Mr Grossart to remain a member of the audit committee for the time being to ensure continuity given that Iain McLaren and  
Dr Jim Buckee are new members of the committee.
Andrew Shilston served as chairman of the audit committee during the year under review until his resignation with effect from  
23 May 2008. Ed Story also served as a member of the audit committee during the entire year under review, although he has 
subsequently resigned as a non-executive director with effect from 15 January 2009.
The audit committee met five times in 2008. At the request of the audit committee, the Finance Director and senior members of the 
Finance Department attended each of these meetings. The Chairman also attended one meeting as an observer, on being invited 
to do so by the committee. In addition, all five meetings were attended by the external auditors and by the internal auditors. 
The external auditors receive copies of all audit committee papers (including papers to be considered at meetings when they are 
not in attendance) and minutes of all committee meetings. In addition, the chairman of the committee regularly meets with the 
external audit partner to discuss matters relevant to the Company. 
The role of the committee includes:
• monitoring the integrity of the financial statements of the Company and formal announcements relating to the Company’s 
financial performance and reviewing any significant financial reporting judgements contained in them; 
• reviewing accounting policies, accounting treatments and disclosures in financial reports; 
• reviewing the Company’s internal financial controls and internal control and risk management systems;
• monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the Company’s internal audit function; 
• overseeing the Company’s relationship with the external auditors, including making recommendations to the Board as to the 
appointment or reappointment of the external auditors, reviewing their terms of engagement, and monitoring the external 
auditors’ independence, objectivity and effectiveness; and 
• reviewing the Company’s whistleblowing procedures and ensuring that arrangements are in place for the proportionate and 
independent investigation of possible improprieties in respect of financial reporting and other matters and for appropriate 
follow-up action.
The audit committee met on three occasions during the 2007 year-end process. Issues likely to impact the financial statements are 
raised at the initial meeting by both the senior management and the external auditors. The auditors also present their audit plan. 
Audit committee guidance is sought on accounting policies and assumptions to be adopted in preparing the financial statements. 
After discussing and challenging the issues raised, the audit committee recommends the policies to be adopted or direct senior 
management to produce further information if deemed necessary. 
At the final meeting, the external auditors report their audit results to the audit committee, including a summary of any significant 
accounting and auditing issues, internal control findings and a summary of audit differences identified. The audit committee 
considers any disagreements in accounting treatment between management and the auditors, should any arise.
The audit committee has established a policy in relation to the supply of non-audit services by the external auditors and other  
third parties. The Company will engage an external adviser to provide non-audit services on the basis of the skills and experience 
required for the work, where benefit will be derived as a result of the third party’s knowledge of the Company and cost. These 
advisers may include the Company’s external auditors for a restricted list of non-audit services, although, before the engagement 
commences, the Company must be satisfied that the auditors’ objectivity and independence would not be compromised in any way 
as a result of being instructed to carry out those services. If the cumulative fees to be paid to an external adviser for the provision of 
non-audit services are below a certain level, the adviser may be engaged in accordance with the Company’s financial delegations of 
authority after a quotation has been received. If the fees payable are expected to exceed that level on a cumulative basis, the 
engagement must be approved by the audit committee in advance after following a tender process.
KPMG LLP has been appointed by the audit committee to supervise and co-ordinate the Company’s internal audit function.  
KPMG also provide internal audit services to Cairn India. At the beginning of each year, an internal audit plan is developed by the 
internal auditor, in consultation with senior management, based on a review of the outcome of the previous year’s internal audit,  
the significant risks in the Group Risk Matrix and identified mitigation measures. The internal auditor also attends meetings of the 
Group Risk Management Committee and certain of the meetings of the Management Operating Team to maintain an understanding 
of the business activities and associated risks. The audit committee receives updates on the internal audit work plan on an ongoing 
basis. The external auditors do not place any reliance on the work undertaken by the Company’s internal audit function due to the 
nature of the scope and the timing of their work. The external auditors do, however, attend audit committee meetings where 
internal audit updates are given.

The Company undertook an audit tender process in 2003, as a result of which Ernst & Young LLP (EY) were re-engaged as the 
Company’s auditors. The Company monitors its auditors’ performance on an ongoing basis, including an annual assessment  
carried out by the audit committee with input from the Finance Director and other key members of the finance department. 
Following such assessment, the audit committee meets to discuss what actions, if any, require to be taken. In addition to this,  
the EY senior audit partner working with Cairn is subject to rotation and a new audit partner worked with the Company on the  
2008 year-end process.
2. Remuneration Committee Report
The remuneration committee comprises four non-executive directors, all of whom are considered by the Board to be independent. 
Currently, its members are Hamish Grossart (chairman), Mark Tyndall, Todd Hunt and Dr Jim Buckee. Ed Story served as a member 
of the remuneration committee during the year under review until his resignation with effect from 15 January 2009. As mentioned 
above, Hamish Grossart will resign as chairman and as a member of the remuneration committee on 19 May 2009 and will be 
replaced by Jim Buckee as chairman and by Norman Murray as a member. The remuneration committee met five times in 2008.
The Chief Executive, at the request of the committee, attends its meetings. In addition, he is consulted by the committee on its 
proposals. The Chairman also attended four meetings of the committee during 2008 as an observer, on being invited to do so by 
the committee. Certain other of the executive directors attended meetings of the committee as observers on being invited to do so 
by the committee. None of the members of the committee, nor the Chief Executive nor the Chairman, participated in any meetings 
or discussions relating to their own remuneration.
The role of the committee includes:
• determining and agreeing with the Board the remuneration policy for all the executive directors, the Chairman and the members 
of the CEC;
• within the terms of the agreed policy, determining the total individual remuneration package for each executive director;
• determining the level of awards made under the Company’s share option plans and long-term incentive plans and the 
performance conditions which are to apply;
• determining bonuses payable under the Company’s cash bonus scheme;
• determining the vesting of awards under the Company’s long-term incentive plans and exercise of share options; and
• determining the policy for pension arrangements, service agreements and termination payments for executive directors.
Details of the Company’s policies on remuneration, service contracts and compensation payments are given in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on pages 60 to 72.
 
3. Nomination Committee Report
The nomination committee currently comprises Norman Murray (chairman), two independent non-executive directors, Hamish Grossart 
and Iain McLaren, and, to ensure input from the executive, one executive director, Sir Bill Gammell (Chief Executive). Ed Story served as  
a member of the nomination committee during the year under review until his resignation with effect from 15 January 2009. Certain other 
of the non-executive directors attended meetings of the committee as observers on being invited to do so by the committee.  
The nomination committee met five times in 2008. 
As mentioned above, Hamish Grossart will resign as a member of the nomination committee with effect from 19 May 2009 and will 
be replaced by Todd Hunt. The Board has also agreed that Mark Tyndall will be appointed a member of the nomination committee 
with effect from 19 May 2009. 
The Combined Code requires there to be a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure for the appointment of new directors, which 
should be meritocratic and made against objective criteria. For this purpose, the Board has established the nomination committee, 
whose role includes considering the composition, balance and skills of the Board and making recommendations to the Board on 
these matters, on the appointment of new directors and on the reappointment and orderly succession of existing directors.
Iain McLaren and Dr Jim Buckee were appointed as non-executive directors of the Company with effect from 1 July 2008 and  
15 January 2009 respectively. The following procedures were followed in respect of these appointments:
•  Appointment of Iain McLaren
Following the resignation of Andrew Shilston as a non-executive director, the nomination committee considered the technical 
abilities required by his successor. In particular, the nomination committee considered that any such appointee should have such 
recent and relevant financial experience to enable him or her to act as chairman of the audit committee following Mr Shilston’s 
departure from that role. After detailed consideration, the nomination committee identified Iain McLaren, who was formerly a 
senior partner of KPMG LLP in Scotland, as a suitable successor given his detailed knowledge of the oil and gas sector and his 
significant experience in the accounting profession. After seeking the views of the other non-executive directors, a proposal  
that Iain McLaren be appointed as a non-executive director and as chairman of the audit committee was put to the Board, who 
unanimously approved the appointment. Iain McLaren was appointed as a non-executive director and as chairman of the audit 
committee with effect from 1 July 2008. Mr McLaren was appointed as a member of the nomination committee with effect from 
21 August 2008.
Corporate Governance Statement
Continued
CAIRN ENERGY PLC  ANNUAL REPORT 2008    49 •  Appointment of Dr Jim Buckee 
The nomination committee evaluated the balance of skills, knowledge and experience on the Board and recommended that  
the Company appoint a new non-executive director. Having considered the preferable background of any potential candidate,  
it was agreed that any appointee should have extensive experience in the oil and gas industry and have an engineering background.  
The nomination committee recommended to the Board that Dr Jim Buckee, who had previously been President and Chief Executive 
Officer of Talisman Energy, Inc. be appointed as a non-executive director of the Company and as a member of the audit committee 
and remuneration committee. Dr Buckee’s appointment was unanimously approved by the Board and he was appointed as a  
non-executive director and as a member of the audit committee and the remuneration committee with effect from 15 January 2009.
Following their identification as candidates and prior to their appointment, both Iain McLaren and Dr Jim Buckee met with the 
chairman and other members of the nomination committee and also with the executive directors and senior management.  
They were also given the opportunity to carry out due diligence on the Company, including meetings with the Company’s auditors, 
discussions with the executive directors and attendance at results presentations prior to their appointment.
Although neither of the above directors was identified by means of an external search consultancy or by advertising, the nomination 
committee does use the services of independent consultants from time to time to assist in the identification of candidates for  
non-executive directors and/or to benchmark candidates already identified by the committee against possible candidates identified  
by consultants. By way of example, Spencer Stuart assisted the Company in identifying Andrew Shilston as a non-executive director 
and Ridgeway Partners assisted in identifying candidates for non-executive directors of Cairn India Limited.
The nomination committee is currently considering the possibility of appointing another non-executive director to the Board during 
the next 12 months and Ridgeway Partners have been retained to assist in this process. The nomination committee reviews Board 
composition on an ongoing basis and regularly considers whether any skills gap exists on the Board. Any new appointments to the 
Board will be considered in this context.
Succession Planning
The nomination committee regularly reviews the structure, size and composition (including the skills, knowledge and experience) 
required of the Board and makes recommendations to the Board as appropriate. The Board has satisfied itself that the nomination 
committee has in place appropriate plans for orderly succession to the Board and senior management positions as well as 
procedures to ensure an appropriate balance of skills within the Company and on the Board and its committees. The Board and 
nomination committee are satisfied that individuals currently fulfilling key senior management positions in the organisation have  
the requisite depth and breadth of skills, knowledge and experience to ensure that orderly succession to the Board can take place.
Organisational Planning 
The focus throughout 2008 was on employee engagement and organisational development. 
It is essential that all employees are able to contribute to the future of the organisation and engage fully in its ongoing development. 
Having undergone significant organisational change over the preceding two years, in 2008 the Company conducted an independent 
employee engagement survey to formally solicit feedback from staff. Overall the results of the survey were largely positive, although 
some key areas for development were also highlighted. All staff were involved in developing actions to address the highlighted 
development areas and a follow-up survey is planned for 2009.
Leadership and management development was also a key focus in 2008. Following on from the success of the 2007 pilot 
programme (which was attended by several executive directors), all senior managers participated in a bespoke Henley leadership 
programme during 2008. A separate management development programme was also developed and run in June and November 
for all other ‘people managers’ in Edinburgh and Bangladesh respectively. Further leadership and management development  
will be undertaken in 2009.
Building upon a holistic, independent benefits review undertaken for the Edinburgh office in 2007, coupled with changes to  
rules governing UK pensions, the Company proposed a new, more flexible Group Personal Pension Plan, which would allow  
each employee to make their pension arrangements specific and unique to their circumstances. Following a comprehensive  
staff consultation, the new Group Personal Pension Plan came into force on 1 June 2008. Since implementing the new scheme,  
the number of staff making additional voluntary contributions to their pensions has increased from 4% to 31%. 
In April 2008, the Company was awarded the Scotland PLC Developing Your People Award, which ‘recognises the efforts 
of companies in nurturing and encouraging their employees to make the most of their talents’.

Relations with Shareholders
Communications with shareholders are given high priority by the Board. Cairn sends both its annual report and accounts and  
half-yearly report to all shareholders. In order to ensure that the members of the Board develop an understanding of the views  
of major shareholders, there is regular dialogue with institutional shareholders, including meetings after the announcement of  
the year-end and interim results. The Chairman attends a number of these meetings. At the Board meeting immediately following  
these meetings, a detailed report is given to all directors who were not in attendance at those meetings. In addition, the Company 
maintains an external relations database which details all meetings attended by the directors with third party stakeholders.  
All analysts’ and brokers’ reports on the Company are also distributed to all directors. Cairn responds to all correspondence  
from shareholders and also has a website, which contains a range of information, including a dedicated investor relations section. 
The senior independent non-executive director is available to shareholders if they have concerns that contact through the normal 
channels of the Chairman, Chief Executive or Finance Director has failed to resolve or for which such contact is inappropriate.
Each of the non-executive directors is available to attend meetings with major shareholders (without the executive directors 
present), if requested by such major shareholders.
At the end of 2008 and then again prior to the AGM to be held on 19 May 2009, the Chairman and the Company Secretary held 
meetings with several of the Company’s institutional shareholders, the ABI, RREV and PIRC, to discuss current corporate governance 
issues, their reports on the Company’s annual report and accounts for the previous financial year and, in particular, the steps that 
had been taken by the Company during 2008 to address comments made in respect of Board composition and the procedures that 
are in place to ensure the continuing independence of the non-executive directors.
Corporate Governance Statement
Continued
CAIRN ENERGY PLC  ANNUAL REPORT 2008    51 Annual General Meeting 
The Board uses the AGM to communicate with private and institutional investors and welcomes their participation. It is policy  
for all directors to attend the AGM if at all possible. Whilst this may not always be possible for business or personal reasons,  
in normal circumstances the chairmen of the audit, remuneration and nomination committees will attend the AGM and be  
available to answer questions.
It is policy to involve shareholders fully in the affairs of the Company and to give them the opportunity at the AGM to ask questions 
about the Company’s activities and prospects. 
Details of resolutions to be proposed at the AGM on 19 May 2009 can be found in the Notice of Annual General Meeting and on  
the Company’s website.
The proxy votes for and against each resolution, as well as abstentions, will be counted before the AGM and the results will be made 
available at the meeting after the shareholders have voted on each resolution on a show of hands. The Form of Proxy for the AGM 
includes a ‘vote withheld’ option in respect of each resolution, to enable shareholders to abstain on any particular resolution. It is 
explained on the Form of Proxy that a ‘vote withheld’ is not a vote in law and will not be counted in the calculation of the proportion 
of the votes ‘for’ or ‘against’ a resolution.
Directors’ Responsibility Statement
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the Group and Company financial statements in accordance with 
applicable United Kingdom law and those IFRSs as adopted by the EU.
The directors are required to prepare the Group and Company financial statements for each financial year which present fairly the 
financial position of the Group and Company and the financial performance and cash flows of the Group and Company for that 
period. In preparing each of the Group and Company financial statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies in accordance with IAS 8: Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors 
and then apply them consistently;
• present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information;
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirement in IFRSs is insufficient to enable users to 
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the Group’s and Company’s financial position 
and financial performance; and
• state that the Group and Company have complied with IFRSs, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the 
financial statements.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records, which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Group and Company and enable them to ensure that the Group’s and Company’s financial statements 
comply with the Companies Act and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Going Concern
The directors have considered the factors relevant to support a statement on going concern. They have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group will continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and have therefore used the going concern basis in 
preparing the financial statements.
Internal Control 
The Board acknowledges its responsibility for the system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. The system of 
internal control plays a critical role in managing the risks towards the achievement of corporate vision, strategy and objectives,  
and is also central to safeguarding shareholders’ interests and Company assets. This system of internal control is in accordance  
with the guidance of the Turnbull Committee and is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives and can only provide reasonable but not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
The process has been in place in respect of the Group for the 2008 accounting period and up to the date of approval of the report 
and accounts. The Board has carried out a review of the effectiveness of the system of internal controls during 2008 and will ensure 
that such reviews are performed in 2009. In so doing, the Board has taken into account the assurance provided by the Chief 
Executive Officer of Cairn India in respect of the effectiveness of the system of internal control within Cairn India and which derives 
from a parallel process followed within Cairn India. The Board is accordingly satisfied that effective control is in place and that risks 
have been mitigated to an acceptable level. 
The Company is subject to a variety of risks that derive from the nature of the oil and gas exploration and production business and 
relate to the countries in which it conducts its activities. The directors believe that Cairn derives its competitive edge by focusing 
activities in areas where they believe they have a technical and commercial advantage and the experience gained over many years 
enables the Company to manage these risks effectively. 
GOVERNANCE AND ACCOUNTS
Corporate Governance Statement
Continued
52    CAIRN ENERGY PLC  ANNUAL REPORT 2008 GOVERNANCE AND ACCOUNTS
Operations in any country are only possible when values are shared, and the directors believe that the Group’s values of integrity, 
social and environmental responsibility, teamwork and nurturing of individuals, creativity, risk management and alliancing with key 
partners are ingredients that are central to the Company’s success. The ability to recognise the value of working as a partnership 
with host governments, both nationally and regionally, has also been a critical ingredient in this approach and success.
2008 was another year of change for the Company with the focus on supporting the subsidiary company Cairn India with 
progressing the Mangala Field development and building an exploration portfolio and new organisation in the Capricorn  
subsidiary. Particular attention has been placed by Group management on ensuring that a robust system of internal control  
has been maintained during 2008 in relation to the significant risks in these business activities. 
Cairn India is subject to the rules, regulations and guidelines of SEBI and to its listing agreement with the BSE and NSE. Under the 
terms of a relationship agreement between the Company and Cairn India entered into at the time of the IPO (the ‘Relationship 
Agreement’), both companies have also agreed to use reasonable endeavours to ensure that they can comply with their respective 
obligations to SEBI, the FSA, the BSE, the LSE and the NSE and under the SEBI Insider Trading Regulations and UK regulation and 
legislation relating to the disclosure of information or dealing in respect of listed securities or corporate governance. This has 
included adopting and following the principles and policies of corporate governance, including risk management, which enable 
each company to comply with these obligations. 
The following describes the key elements of the internal control system and the processes used by the Board during 2008 to review 
the effectiveness of the system. It also describes the approach to be taken in 2009.
1. Strategic direction
The Group business model is conventional in that strategy is set by the directors and approved by the Board and its implementation 
is delegated to the CEC. Following its listing on the BSE and NSE in January 2007, Cairn India is a subsidiary of the Company with  
its own board of directors. In accordance with the memorandum and articles of association of Cairn India, the Company has three 
non-executive directors on the board of Cairn India (including Sir Bill Gammell as Chairman) and, therefore, has an input to Cairn 
India’s strategy. From time to time, these three non-executive directors are also rotated and during 2008 Jann Brown replaced 
Norman Murray as a non-executive director of Cairn India. Malcolm Thoms also replaced Hamish Grossart as a non-executive 
director of Cairn India during 2007. In addition to this, Norman Murray and Hamish Grossart can act as alternate directors to  
Jann Brown and Malcolm Thoms respectively.
2. Operating management
Outside of Cairn India, the Group, through its unlisted subsidiary Capricorn, operates several business units in different countries 
and with various partners. Work programmes and budgets are prepared annually to meet the Group strategy, starting at the  
asset level before being consolidated at Group level. A detailed business plan is also prepared to meet the agreed annual work 
programme and budget. This sets out detailed objectives and KPIs for each asset and supporting functional departments, and is 
consolidated into the company’s annual business plan. After an iterative process, the business plan and budget is presented to the 
CEC and the Board for approval. 
The asset management teams then have the required authority to implement the business plans and to deliver the agreed work 
programme within the approved budget and delegation of authorities, and in accordance with the internal control framework. 
The remit of the CEC is to oversee the delivery of the strategy through the annual business plans and approved budget. The directors 
have also appointed Group functional heads whose roles include providing input and ‘challenge’ to the work programmes, budgets 
and business plans, and supplying the relevant director with full and accurate information and to make statements on the adequacy  
of internal control.
3. Risk management 
The Group Risk Management Committee (GRMC), established by the Board in 1999, continues to be responsible for the development 
of risk management strategy and processes within the Company and for overseeing the implementation of the requirements of this 
strategy. It does this by ensuring that the framework for the identification, assessment, mitigation and reporting on all areas of risk is  
‘fit for purpose’ and that appropriate assurance arrangements are in place in relation to these risks.
The GRMC membership was changed in 2008 in order to maintain a robust and challenging approach to risk management.  
The GRMC is chaired by the Finance Director and comprises executive directors and senior functional management. The non-executive 
Chairman of the Audit Committee is a member of the GRMC and the Internal Auditor also attends meetings, in order to ensure internal 
audit’s integration with the risk management process. 
The Group Business Risk Management System (GBRMS), which defines the processes through which Cairn seeks to systematically 
identify, analyse, assess, treat and monitor the business risks faced by the Group, was updated in 2008 to ensure alignment with risk 
management processes across the group. The GBRMS also identifies the risk management organisational structure through which 
business risks are managed and regularly reviewed at operating, asset, country and group levels. 
Corporate Governance Statement
Continued
CAIRN ENERGY PLC  ANNUAL REPORT 2008    53 Subsequent to its listing, Cairn India operates its own RMC in line with its Business Risk Management System (BRMS) under the 
chairmanship of the Chief Operating Officer and reporting to the Cairn India Board. Risk Management Sub Committees have also 
been set up reporting to the Cairn India RMC to consider the specific risks associated with operations, finance, exploration and the 
Rajasthan upstream and midstream projects. The Cairn India BRMS is substantially similar to that of the Company and, under the 
terms of the Relationship Agreement, a copy of the Cairn India risk report and RMC minutes is routinely submitted for review at the 
GRMC, at which a senior representative from Cairn India is present to provide explanation and take questions. 
Business risks in Capricorn, together with the identified mitigating measures and responsibilities, are recorded in asset and country 
risk registers which, following endorsement by the Management Operating Board, are reported through to the Group risk register. 
The Cairn India and Capricorn risk registers are integrated into the Group risk register, and are regularly reviewed by the GRMC to 
ensure that the business understands the key risks it faces and that there is an embedded risk management approach in place across 
the Group.
The GRMC reports on the Group’s risk profile to both the audit committee and the Board. Additionally, the audit committee and 
Board receive internal reviews of the effectiveness of internal control relative to the key risks. The conclusion of the Board following 
these reviews during 2008 is that the internal controls in respect of key risks are appropriate.
4. Assurance
The integrated assurance framework adopted by the Board provides for three levels of assurance against the risks facing the Group: 
firstly at the operational level; secondly through overview by Group functional management and the GRMC; and thirdly through 
internal, external or joint venture audits. 
During 2008, the directors reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s system of financial and non-financial controls, including 
operational and compliance controls, risk management and the Group’s high level internal control arrangements. The directors 
derive assurance from the following internal and external controls:
• a regularly updated schedule of matters specifically reserved for a decision by the Board;
• policies and procedures for key business activities;
• an appropriate organisational structure;
• control over non-operated joint venture activities through delegated representatives;
• specific delegations of authority for all financial and other transactions;
• segregation of duties where appropriate and cost effective;
• business and financial reporting, including KPIs;
• functional management reviews;
• the nomination of various directors of the Company to the Cairn India board (in a non-executive capacity) and to certain of its 
committees. The Board also receives copies of minutes of meetings of the Cairn India board of directors;
• a Relationship Agreement with Cairn India, which, inter alia, contains provisions for the supply by Cairn India to the Company  
of such information and confirmations as the Company may require to comply with legal, regulatory and reporting obligations;
• an annual ‘letters of assurance’ process, through which country managers confirm the adequacy of internal financial and  
non-financial controls and their compliance with Group policies and report any control weaknesses identified in the past year;
• a ‘letter of assurance’ from the Cairn India Chief Executive Officer confirming the adequacy of internal controls within Cairn India 
in line with its policy, and reporting of any control weaknesses identified in the past year;
• Group internal audits to assess compliance – the internal auditor implements a number of audits during the year in line with  
the annual internal audit plan approved by the audit committee and Board;
• reports from the Group audit committee and GRMC, (including reports from the Cairn India RMC and Cairn India audit 
committee);
• reports from the Group external auditor on matters identified during its statutory audits;
• reports from audits by host governments and co-venturers; and
• independent third party reviews.
GOVERNANCE AND ACCOUNTS

54    CAIRN ENERGY PLC  ANNUAL REPORT 2008 GOVERNANCE AND ACCOUNTS
Compliance with the Combined Code
Throughout 2008 the Company complied with the provisions of the Combined Code, except in the following areas:
Provision of the Combined Code Company Position Explanation
A.3.2 – at least half the Board, excluding 
the chairman, should comprise non-
executive directors determined by the 
Board to be independent.
 
From 1 January 2008 until 23 May 2008, 
the Board comprised the Chairman,  
the Chief Executive, five other executive 
directors and five independent non-
executive directors. Following Andrew 
Shilston’s resignation on 23 May 2008, 
the number of independent non-
executive directors decreased to four 
until Iain McLaren’s appointment on  
1 July 2008. Since the end of 2008,  
Ed Story has resigned and Jim Buckee  
has been appointed as an independent 
non-executive director.
The Board firmly believes that the 
composition of the Board was 
appropriate and effective for the 
challenges that it faced during 2008.  
The Board is satisfied that it maintained  
a sufficient degree of independence 
throughout the year to enable it to 
discharge effectively and properly its 
obligations under the Combined Code. 
The composition of the Board and the 
issue of succession planning is under 
constant review and is a regular item  
on the agenda for meetings of the 
nomination committee. 
A.4.1 – a majority of the members of  
the nomination committee should be 
independent non-executive directors.
 
The Company complied with this 
provision from 1 July 2008 until  
31 December 2008. During the period 
from 1 January 2008 to 30 June 2008  
the Company did not comply with  
the provision.
At the start of 2008 the nomination 
committee comprised two independent 
non-executive directors, the Chairman 
and one executive director. Following  
the appointment of Iain McLaren as a 
non-executive director and member of 
the nomination committee, the Company 
complied with the provision. 
Since the end of 2008, Ed Story has 
resigned as a non-executive director but 
Todd Hunt and Mark Tyndall are being 
appointed members of the committee 
with effect from the AGM on 19 May 
2009. The Board believes that the newly 
agreed membership of the committee  
is appropriate and effective.
C.3.1 – the Board should establish  
an audit committee of at least three 
independent non-executive directors. 
The Company complied with this 
provision during the year other than 
during the period from 23 May 2008  
to 30 June 2008.
Following the resignation of Andrew 
Shilston as a non-executive director  
and chairman of the audit committee  
on 23 May 2008, the audit committee 
comprised only two independent non-
executive directors. However, with effect 
from 1 July 2008 the Company again 
complied with this provision as the Board 
appointed Iain McLaren, a former partner 
at KPMG LLP , as a non-executive director 
and chairman of the audit committee. 
During the period when the Company  
did not comply, no meetings (whether 
scheduled or otherwise) of the audit 
committee took place.
D.2.4 – the Company should arrange  
for the Notice of AGM and related papers 
to be sent to shareholders at least 20 
working days before the AGM. 
The Notice of AGM and related papers 
are being sent to shareholders 17 working 
days (26 clear days including weekends 
and bank holidays) prior to the AGM this 
year. This complies with the statutory 
minimum notice period contained in the 
Companies Act.
The Company is committed to ensuring 
that the AGM is used constructively.  
Due to the unavailability of certain key 
members of the Board in late May, a 
decision was taken to hold the AGM on  
19 May 2009 which, although providing 
shareholders with less than 20 working 
days notice, will enable all directors to 
attend and therefore provide investors 
with the opportunity to ask questions  
of such directors.

All of the Company’s share incentive plans contain provisions relating to a change of control and full details of these plans are 
provided in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 60 to 72. Outstanding options and awards would normally vest and 
become exercisable on a change of control, subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions, if applicable, at that time. 
On a change of control of the Company resulting in the termination of a director’s employment, each of the executive directors is 
also entitled, pursuant to their service contracts, to compensation of a sum equal to their annual basic salary as at the date of 
termination of employment. There are no agreements providing for compensation to employees on a change of control.
There are no significant agreements to which the Company is a party that take effect, alter or terminate in the event of a change of 
control of the Company except the $850 million syndicated revolving credit facility agreement dated 22 November 2006 entered 
into by certain of the Company’s subsidiaries, The Royal Bank of Scotland PLC and IFC and a syndicate of other commercial banks 
(the ‘Facility’). Under the Facility, lenders may, upon 30 days’ notice, cancel all of their commitments and declare all outstanding 
loans made by them, together with accrued interest, immediately due and payable if any person or group of persons acting in 
concert gains control of the Company while it retains control of Cairn India.

GOVERNANCE AND ACCOUNTS
Directors’ Report
56    CAIRN ENERGY PLC  ANNUAL REPORT 2008 GOVERNANCE AND ACCOUNTS
At 31 December 2008, none of the directors (or any members of their families) holds an interest in options over ordinary shares  
in the Company. 
None of the directors has a material interest in any contract, other than a service contract, with the Company or any of its subsidiary 
undertakings. Details of the directors’ service contracts are set out on pages 67 and 68 of the Directors’ Remuneration Report. 
Share Capital
The authorised and issued share capital of the Company are shown in Note 27 of the Notes to the Accounts. At the date of this 
report, 137,681,011 ordinary shares of 6 
2
/ 13 pence each have been issued and are fully paid up and are quoted on the London Stock 
Exchange. The rights attaching to the ordinary shares are set out in the Company’s articles of association. There are no special 
control rights in relation to the Company’s shares and the Company is not aware of any agreements between holders of securities 
that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or on voting rights.
Voting Rights
Subject to any special rights or restrictions attaching to any class of shares, at a general meeting or class meeting, on a show of hands, 
every member present in person and every duly appointed proxy entitled to vote shall have one vote and on a poll every member 
present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall have one vote for every share held by him. In the case of joint holders of a share, 
the vote of the senior member who tenders a vote, whether in person or by proxy, shall be accepted to the exclusion of the votes of the 
other joint holders and for this purpose seniority shall be determined by the order in which the names stand in the register of members 
in respect of the joint holding. Under the Companies Acts, members are entitled to appoint a proxy, who need not be a member of  
the Company, to exercise all or any of their rights to attend and to speak and vote on their behalf at a general meeting or class meeting.  
A member may appoint more than one proxy in relation to a general meeting or class meeting provided that each proxy is appointed  
to exercise the rights attached to a different share or shares held by that member. A corporation which is a member of the Company 
may authorise one or more individuals to act as its representative or representatives at any meeting of the Company, or at any separate 
meeting of the holders of any class of shares. A person so authorised shall be entitled to exercise the same powers on behalf of such 
corporation as the corporation could exercise if it were an individual member of the Company.
Restrictions on Voting
No member shall, unless the directors of the Company otherwise determine, be entitled in respect of any share held by him to 
attend or vote at a general meeting of the Company either in person or by proxy if any call or other sum presently payable by him  
to the Company in respect of shares in the Company remains unpaid. Further, if a member has been served with a notice by the 
Company under the Companies Acts requesting information concerning interests in shares and has failed in relation to any shares  
to provide the Company, within 14 days of the notice, with such information, the directors of the Company may determine that such 
member shall not be entitled in respect of such shares to attend or vote (either in person or by proxy) at any general meeting or at 
any separate general or class meeting of the holders of that class of shares. Proxy forms must be submitted not less than 48 hours 
before the time appointed for the holding of the meeting or adjourned meeting or (in the case of a poll taken otherwise than at,  
or on the same day as, the meeting or adjourned meeting) not less than 24 hours before the time appointed for the taking of the  
poll at which it is to be used.
Variation of Rights
Whenever the share capital of the Company is divided into different classes of shares, all or any of the special rights attached to any 
class may, subject to statute and unless otherwise expressly provided by the rights attached to the shares of that class, be varied or 
abrogated either with the consent in writing of the holders of not less than three-fourths in nominal value of the issued shares of that 
class or with the sanction of a special resolution passed at a separate general meeting of the holders of the shares of that class. At every 
such separate general meeting the quorum shall be two persons holding or representing by proxy at least one-third in nominal value  
of the issued shares of the class. These provisions apply to the variation or abrogation of the special rights attached to some only of the 
shares of any class as if the shares concerned and the remaining shares of such class formed separate classes. The rights attached to 
any class of shares shall, unless otherwise expressly provided by the terms of issue of such shares or the terms upon which such shares 
are for the time being held, be deemed not to be varied or abrogated by the creation or issue of further shares ranking pari passu with 
or subsequent to the first mentioned shares or by the purchase by the Company of its own shares.
Transfer of Shares
Subject to any procedures set out by the directors in accordance with the Articles of Association, all transfers of shares shall be 
effected by instrument in writing in any usual or common form or in any other form acceptable to the directors of the Company.  
The instrument of transfer shall be executed by, or on behalf of, the transferor and (except in the case of fully paid shares) by,  
or on behalf of, the transferee. The transferor shall be deemed to remain the holder of the shares concerned until the name  
of the transferee is entered in the register of members of the Company. 
The directors may, in their absolute discretion and without assigning any reason therefor, refuse to register a transfer of any share 
which is not a fully paid share unless such share is listed on the Official List of the UK Listing Authority and traded on the London 
Stock Exchange’s main market for listed securities. The directors may also refuse to register a transfer of a share in uncertificated 
form where the Company is entitled to refuse (or is excepted from the requirement) under the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 
2001 to register the transfer and they may refuse any such transfer in favour of more than four transferees. The directors may also 
refuse to register any transfer of a share on which the Company has a lien. 
Directors’ Report
Continued
CAIRN ENERGY PLC  ANNUAL REPORT 2008    57 The directors may, in their absolute discretion and without assigning any reason therefor, refuse to register a transfer of any share  
in certificated form unless the relevant instrument of transfer is in respect of only one class of share, is duly stamped or adjudged  
or certified as not chargeable to stamp duty, is lodged at the transfer office or at such other place as the directors may determine,  
is accompanied by the relevant share certificate(s) and such other evidence as the directors may reasonably require to show the  
right of the transferor to make the transfer and is in favour of not more than four transferees jointly.
If the directors refuse to register a transfer, they shall, within two months after the date on which the transfer was lodged with the 
Company (in the case of a share in certificated form) or the date on which the operator-instruction (as defined in the Uncertificated 
Securities Regulations 2001) was received by the Company (in the case of a share in uncertificated form) (or in either case such longer  
or shorter period (if any) as the Listing Rules may from time to time permit or require), send to the transferee notice of the refusal.

charities within an overall annual budget. There are currently seven members of the Charities Committee comprising a broad range 
of employees from across the organisation. The Chief Executive is not a member of the Charities Committee. 
During the year the Company made various charitable contributions in the UK totalling $285,968 (2007: $3,146,764). Contributions in 
the UK are made to a variety of charitable organisations whose areas of operation and activities are aligned with Cairn’s. In addition, 
the Group provides funding to various charitable initiatives outwith the UK. Further details of these can be found in our Corporate 
Responsibility Report.
No political donations were made and no political expenditure was incurred during the year.
Creditor Payment Policy and Practice
It is Cairn’s payment policy to ensure settlement of suppliers’ services in accordance with the terms of the applicable contracts.  
In most circumstances, settlement terms are agreed prior to business taking place. Trade creditors of the Company at  
31 December 2008 were equivalent to 27.5 days’ purchases, based on the average daily amount invoiced by suppliers to  
the Company during the year.
Financial Instruments
The financial risk management objectives and policies of the Company are detailed in Note 30 of the Notes to the Accounts.
Election/Re-Election of Directors
The directors’ biographies are on pages 38 and 39. The Company’s Articles of Association provide that directors can be appointed

are set out in the Corporate Governance Statement on pages 45 to 55 and in the Company’s Articles of Association. An explanation 
of the performance evaluation procedure carried out by the Company is also contained in the Corporate Governance Statement,  
on pages 45 to 55.

Directors’ Report
Continued
CAIRN ENERGY PLC  ANNUAL REPORT 2008    59 Remuneration Committee and Advisers
Reference is made on page 49 of the Corporate Governance Statement, where there is a summary of the role of the remuneration 
committee.
Cairn’s remuneration committee operates within terms of reference set by the Board. These are reviewed periodically to ensure that 
the remuneration committee remains up to date with best practices appropriate to Cairn, its strategy and the business environment 
in which it operates. The terms of reference are available on request from the Company Secretary.
The deliberations and decisions of the remuneration committee are governed by the provisions in the Listing Rules and the Combined 
Code (appended to the Listing Rules) and the remuneration committee has followed these provisions and those of the Companies Act 
1985 (as amended) and the Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002. In accordance with the requirements of this legislation,  
a resolution to approve the remuneration committee’s report will be proposed at the forthcoming AGM.
As and when the remuneration committee deems appropriate, it takes external advice on remuneration from a number of sources. 
During the year it consulted with Hewitt New Bridge Street (an independent executive compensation consultancy appointed  
by the committee) on various aspects of the directors’ remuneration packages. The Company’s legal advisers, Shepherd and 
Wedderburn LLP and auditors, Ernst & Young LLP , also provided assistance to the committee in respect of the Company’s share 
option schemes and long-term incentive plans. Advice obtained from Ernst & Young LLP is purely in relation to their independent 
verification of the Company’s achievement against performance criteria applicable to the Company’s share option schemes and 
long-term incentive plans. 
The current members of the remuneration committee are Hamish Grossart (chairman), Mark Tyndall, Todd Hunt and Jim Buckee.  
Ed Story served as a member of the committee during the year until his resignation with effect from 15 January 2009. Jim Buckee 
was appointed as a director of the Company and member of the remuneration committee, also on 15 January 2009. As explained  
in the corporate governance statement, Hamish Grossart will resign as chairman and as a member of the committee with effect  
from 19 May 2009 and will be replaced by Jim Buckee as chairman and by Norman Murray as a member. 
The Chief Executive is not a member of the remuneration committee but may attend its meetings by invitation and is consulted  
in respect of certain of its proposals (although the Chief Executive is not consulted or involved in any discussions in respect of his 
own remuneration). 
The remuneration committee determines and agrees with the Board the overall remuneration policy for the executive directors and 
the members of the CEC. The remuneration committee also determines, within the terms of the agreed policy and having consulted 
with the Chief Executive about their proposals, specific remuneration packages for each of the executive directors, including 
pension rights and any compensation payments to be paid on termination.
Remuneration Policy – Overview
Cairn’s policy on executive directors’ remuneration for the current year and subsequent financial years is that the overall remuneration 
package should be sufficiently competitive to attract, retain and motivate high quality individuals capable of achieving the Group’s 
objectives and thereby enhancing shareholder value. The package is generally weighted more towards variable pay and, in relation  
to the variable pay element, the package is weighted more towards long-term performance. In designing the remuneration structures  
of the executive directors, the committee takes into account pay policies within the Group as a whole.
Each executive director’s remuneration package currently consists of basic salary, benefits, annual performance-related bonuses,  
a long-term incentive plan, a defined contribution pension (if appropriate) and life assurance of four times basic annual salary. 
The package is designed to support the Group’s business strategy and to provide an appropriate incentive to maximise individual 
and corporate performance, whilst ensuring that overall rewards are market competitive. Details of the individual components of  
the package and of contracts are given below. 
The remuneration of the non-executive directors takes the form solely of fees, which are agreed by the executive members of the Board 
and the Chairman, having taken independent advice on appropriate levels, within an overall limit determined by shareholders. The fees 
are designed to attract experienced individuals and reflect the responsibilities of the role. The fees stated on page 70 are in respect of 
all responsibilities undertaken by the non-executive directors, including membership of Board committees.
Remuneration Policy – Proposed Changes in 2009
At this year’s AGM, in addition to the standard advisory vote on this remuneration report the Company’s shareholders will be asked 
to approve resolutions relating to the adoption of new share schemes that will be used to grant awards and options over ordinary 
shares to the Company’s senior executives and employees in 2009 and subsequent years.
Further details in relation to this proposal are set out below and in the Circular to shareholders accompanying this Annual Report  
and Accounts.
GOVERNANCE AND ACCOUNTS
Directors’ Remuneration Report
60    CAIRN ENERGY PLC  ANNUAL REPORT 2008 GOVERNANCE AND ACCOUNTS
Basic Salary and Benefits
Basic salary is reviewed annually by the remuneration committee and any changes take effect from 1 January each year. In deciding 
appropriate levels, the committee relies on objective benchmarking which gives up-to-date information on remuneration practice 
within a comparator group of similar companies within the sector.
Following a review carried out by Hewitt New Bridge Street in July 2008 the basic salaries of the executive directors were increased 
to £552,000 for Sir Bill Gammell, £402,500 for Dr Mike Watts and £345,000 for each of Malcolm Thoms, Phil Tracy, Jann Brown and 
Simon Thomson. These increases took effect from 1 January 2008 and represented the first increase in executive directors’ salaries 
since 2006. The executive directors’ salaries have been retained at these levels for the year 2009. 
Also with effect from 1 January 2008 and following the review carried out by Hewitt New Bridge Street in July 2008, the non-executive 
directors fees were increased to £200,000 for Norman Murray, £105,000 for Hamish Grossart and £60,000 for each of the other non-
executive directors. In addition to this a fee of £10,000 is payable to the chairman of each of the audit and remuneration committees. 
The non-executive directors’ fees for 2009 were retained at 2008 levels. 
Benefits available to the executive directors comprise a company car, permanent health insurance, private health insurance and 
death in service benefit.
Share Options – Current Arrangements
Details of the Group’s current share option plans are as follows:
1. 1996 Second Share Option Scheme (‘1996 Scheme’)
2. 2002 Unapproved Share Option Plan (‘2002 Plan’)
3. 2003 Approved Share Option Plan (‘2003 Plan’)
4. 2006 Share Option Plan (‘2006 Plan’)
5. Cairn India Share Option Schemes (‘Cairn India Schemes’).
1996 Scheme
The 1996 Scheme was adopted in 1996 and expired in May 2006. The date of grant of the last award of options under the 1996 
Scheme was 1 October 2002. Details of the options outstanding as at 31 December 2008 under the 1996 Scheme are set out in 
Note 7 of the Notes to the Accounts.
2002 Plan and 2003 Plan
The principal difference between the 2002 Plan and the 2003 Plan is that the approval of the Inland Revenue was not sought  
for the 2002 Plan. The 2003 Plan was approved by shareholders at the 2003 AGM and subsequently by the Inland Revenue. 
Following the adoption of the 2006 Plan (see below), no further awards will be granted under the 2002 Plan or the 2003 Plan.  
The date of grant of the last award of options under these arrangements was 4 July 2006.
Options granted under the 2002 Plan and the 2003 Plan are exercisable three to ten years following the date of grant and are 
subject to performance conditions on exercise. In the case of all outstanding options under these arrangements, the option holder 
may only exercise their awards if Cairn’s share price has increased by 5% on a compound basis over the period from the date of  
grant of options up to the date they are exercised. In addition, the percentage increase in Cairn’s share price over the period must 
be at least equal to or greater than the percentage movement in the FTSE Oil & Gas Index. 
2006 Plan
The 2006 Plan was approved by shareholders at an EGM held in November 2006, conditional on the flotation of Cairn India 
becoming effective, which occurred on 9 January 2007 . The date of grant of the first award of options under the 2006 Plan was  
29 March 2007 with a performance period commencing on 9 January 2007. No options have been or will be granted under the  
2006 Plan to the Company’s executive directors or to any employee or director of the Cairn India Group.
The 2006 Plan, together with the 2006 LTIP described below, were intended to reflect the fact that, following the flotation of  
Cairn India, there were two distinct arms to the Group’s business (namely, a majority shareholding in Cairn India and an exploration 
and production business owned and operated by the Capricorn Group) and therefore sought to incentivise employees of the Group 
in relation to the arm(s) which they could affect.
The 2006 Plan enables selected employees (excluding those that are employed by the Cairn India Group) to be granted ‘phantom 
options’ (which are equity settled) over ‘units’ in the Capricorn Group (see below under 2006 LTIP for how these units are created 
and valued). On the exercise of an option, participants will generally become entitled to such number of Cairn shares as have a 
market value equal to the notional gain that they realise (i.e. the difference between the ‘notional exercise price’ attributable to their 
option and the price of the units in respect of which their option has been exercised). However, the extent to which options become 
exercisable will be dependent on continued employment with the Group and the extent to which pre-determined performance 
conditions are met over a specified period.
Directors’ Remuneration Report
Continued
CAIRN ENERGY PLC  ANNUAL REPORT 2008    61 All options granted under the 2006 Plan are currently subject to a Capricorn unit price target measured over a three-year 
performance period. Under this target, vesting will occur as follows:
  Average annual compound growth in 
Percentage of Capricorn units comprised in option that vest Capricorn unit price over the performance period
0%  Less than 5%
50% 5%
100% 10% or more
50%-100% on a straight-line basis More than 5% but less than 10%
Notwithstanding the above condition, no part of an option will vest unless the notional total shareholder return (‘TSR’) of a Capricorn 
unit over the performance period is sufficient to place it at or above the median level in the same comparator group of companies 
that is used for the purposes of the Capricorn awards granted pursuant to the 2006 LTIP (see below).
None of the directors holds any options under any of the Company’s share option plans. Since 1999, the long-term incentives for 
executive directors and certain other senior executives have been made pursuant to long-term incentive plans and therefore no 
options have been granted to these individuals under any of the Company’s share option plans since that time.
Share Options – proposed arrangements
Over recent months, significant issues have been identified in relation to the mechanism used to place a value on the units over 
which options have been granted pursuant to the 2006 Plan.
As explained in the Circular to shareholders accompanying this Annual Report and Accounts, the remuneration committee has  
decided that, in view of these concerns, it is no longer appropriate to continue with the current unitised structure of this arrangement. 
As a result, it is seeking shareholder approval at the AGM to introduce new share option schemes that will replace the 2006 Plan for all 
future grants.
Further details in relation to these new schemes are set out in the Circular. It is, however, worth noting that their terms effectively mirror 
those of the 2006 Plan summarised above, save that awards will be granted over ordinary shares in the Company rather than units. 
The remuneration committee is currently assessing how to treat outstanding options that have already been granted under the 2006 
Plan. As and when a preferred approach has been identified, appropriate proposals will be put to shareholders for their consideration 
and approval.
Cairn India Schemes
As part of the arrangements surrounding its flotation, Cairn India established the following share option schemes pursuant to which 
options to acquire its shares can be granted:
• the Cairn India Senior Management Plan;
• the Cairn India Employee Stock Option Plan (2006); and
• the Cairn India Performance Option Plan (2006).
These arrangements (brief details of which are set out in Note 7 of the Notes to the Accounts) have been or will be used to grant 
options to selected employees and executive directors of Cairn India and its various subsidiary undertakings. None of the executive 
directors of the Company participates, or will participate, in any of the Cairn India Schemes.
Long-Term Incentive Plans – current arrangements
Details of the Group’s current LTIPs are as follows:
1. Cairn Energy PLC Long-Term Incentive Plan 2002 (‘2002 LTIP’).
2. Cairn Energy PLC Long-Term Incentive Plan 2006 (‘2006 LTIP’).
2002 LTIP 
Details of directors’ awards granted pursuant to the 2002 LTIP , which was implemented in 2002, are given on pages 97 and 98.  
The 2002 LTIP was superseded by the 2006 LTIP , further details of which are set out on page 98. The date of grant of the  
last award under the 2002 LTIP was 24 April 2006.
Participants have been granted Tier One and Tier Two awards under the 2002 LTIP . Performance conditions for each are determined 
by the remuneration committee and the calculation of shares vesting based on these conditions is subject to independent 
verification by Ernst & Young LLP. 
Performance Conditions – Tier One
A Tier One award is an award of Cairn shares with the vesting and release of all/part of those shares being dependent upon the 
executive remaining an employee and achievement of performance conditions over a performance period of three years. 
The vesting of all outstanding Tier One awards is subject to a TSR target that is calculated in two steps, each of which must  
be satisfied. 
GOVERNANCE AND ACCOUNTS
Directors’ Remuneration Report
Continued
62    CAIRN ENERGY PLC  ANNUAL REPORT 2008 GOVERNANCE AND ACCOUNTS
Step One
First, the TSR of a Cairn share during the performance period is compared to the average TSR performance of the companies 
comprising the relevant FTSE Index (‘the Index’) at the beginning and at the end of the performance period (details of the FTSE 
Indices used are set out on page 64). If Cairn’s TSR performance exceeds the average TSR performance of the Index, then the step 
one test has been passed. The step two test is then used to calculate how many (if any) Cairn shares that are the subject of the  
award will vest.
Step Two
Under step two, the TSR of Cairn shares is compared to the TSR of a share in each company in a comparator group comprising 
exploration, production and integrated oil companies over the performance period (details of the relevant comparator groups are 
set out on page 65). Each company is then ranked in order of TSR performance. Cairn’s position in the comparator group list then 
determines how many (if any) Cairn shares that are the subject of the award will vest, as follows:
Percentage of Cairn shares comprised in Tier One Award that vest Ranking of Cairn in relevant comparator group
0%  Below median
20% Median
100% Upper quartile or above
20%–100% on a straight-line basis Between median and upper quartile
In addition, no Tier One award will vest unless the remuneration committee is satisfied that there has been a satisfactory and 
sustained improvement in Cairn’s underlying financial position and performance over the performance period. 
Performance Conditions – Tier Two
A Tier Two award is a share appreciation right over a number of notional Cairn shares. The maximum potential benefit a participant  
may receive under a Tier Two award is calculated by comparing the increase in Cairn’s share price over the performance period with 
|the change in the average share price of the comparator group over the same period. The increase in Cairn’s share price (if any) over  
the rise (or fall) in the average share price of the comparator group over the performance period is then multiplied by the number of 
notional shares that are the subject of the award. This gives rise to a monetary figure which is then converted into an actual number  
of Cairn shares using the market value as at the date of vesting. Where there has been a fall in Cairn’s TSR, no Tier Two award will vest. 
Vesting of the Tier Two award is then subject to a further TSR target which is calculated in two steps, each of which must be satisfied. 
Step One
This step is the same as step one of the performance conditions in respect of Tier One.
Step Two
Under step two, the TSR of Cairn shares is compared to the TSR of a share in each company comprised in the comparator group over 
the performance period. As with Tier One awards, each company is then ranked in order of TSR performance. Cairn’s position in the 
comparator group list then determines how many (if any) shares that are the subject of the award will vest, as follows:
Percentage of Cairn shares comprised in Tier Two Award that vest Ranking of Cairn in relevant comparator group
0%  Below upper quartile
40% Upper quartile
100% Number one position
40%-100% on a straight-line basis Between upper quartile and number one position
In addition, no Tier Two award will vest unless the remuneration committee is satisfied that there has been a satisfactory and 
sustained improvement in Cairn’s underlying financial position and performance over the performance period. 
Release of shares following vesting
At the end of the performance period, 50% of vested shares under both Tier One and Tier Two awards are transferred to participants 
immediately, and the remaining shares are transferred at the end of one year. 
FTSE indices used for 2002 LTIP
For the first step of the TSR target described above, for 2005 awards, the Company’s performance is measured against the FTSE 
250 Index. The remuneration committee reviewed this performance condition in March 2006 and decided to measure awards made 
in 2006 against the FTSE 350 Index.

2006 LTIP
The 2006 LTIP was approved by shareholders at the EGM held on 17 November 2006, conditional on the flotation of Cairn India 
becoming effective, which occurred on 9 January 2007 . 
The 2006 LTIP enables selected executive directors and employees (excluding those that are employed by the Cairn India Group) to 
be granted conditional awards over two separate pools of notional ‘units’, the first relating to Cairn India (‘Cairn India Units’) and the 
second relating to the Capricorn Group (‘Capricorn Units’) (together, ‘Units’).
For the purposes of the 2006 LTIP , each of these Cairn India Units and Capricorn Units is ascribed a notional price. On any day, the 
price of a Cairn India Unit is equal to the price of a Cairn India share, as quoted on the BSE and the NSE of India (the ‘Exchanges’). 
The price of a Capricorn Unit is calculated by taking the total value of the Capricorn Group and dividing it by the number of 
Capricorn Units created for the purposes of the 2006 LTIP. For these purposes, the value of the Capricorn Group is generally 
determined by deducting (i) the value of the Company’s holding in Cairn India; and (ii) the amount of any cash held by the Company 
that is to be returned to shareholders, from the total market capitalisation of the Company.
The extent to which an award over Cairn India Units (a ‘Cairn India Award’) or an award over Capricorn Units (a ‘Capricorn Award’) 
(together, ‘Awards’) vests will be dependent on continued employment within the Group and the extent to which pre-determined 
performance conditions relating to Cairn India or the Capricorn Group are met over a specified period (see below).
Following the vesting of an award, the participant will then generally become entitled to such number of Cairn shares as have a market 
value equal to the aggregate price of the vested Units. Only 50% of these shares will be transferred to the participant immediately.  
The remaining 50% will be held for a further year.
The first awards under the 2006 LTIP were made on 29 March 2007 with a performance period commencing on 9 January 2007 . 
Performance conditions
All awards granted to date under the 2006 LTIP are subject to a relative TSR target measured over a three-year performance period. 
For the purposes of applying this measure to any Cairn India Award, the TSR of a Cairn India share is used. For a Capricorn Award, 
the condition is based on the notional TSR of a Capricorn Unit. Under the TSR condition, the extent to which a Cairn India Award  
or Capricorn Award vests is determined by comparing the TSR of a Cairn India share or Capricorn Unit (as appropriate) over the 
performance period with the TSR of a share in each company in a comparator group. The tables below show the comparator groups 
for Awards granted under the 2006 LTIP.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
Continued
CAIRN ENERGY PLC  ANNUAL REPORT 2008    65 In order to ensure that the 2006 LTIP adequately encourages and rewards exceptional performance, the terms of the above 
performance condition also provide that, where the TSR of a Cairn India share/Capricorn Unit produces a ranking at or above the 
upper decile level in the appropriate comparator group, a participant will then be given the opportunity to increase the percentage 
of the relevant award that vests through the application of a ‘multiplier’ that is linked to the TSR actually achieved over the 
performance period. The way in which this multiplier operates is as follows:
Multiplier applied to determine the number of  TSR of a Cairn India share over TSR of a Capricorn Unit over
Cairn India Units/Capricorn Units that actually vest the performance period the performance period
1  40% or less 75% or less
1.33 80% or more 150% or more
1-1.33 on a straight-line basis Between 40% and 80% Between 75% and 150%
Notwithstanding the performance of a Cairn India share or Capricorn Unit against the above targets, no part of any Award will  
vest unless the remuneration committee is satisfied that there has been an overall satisfactory and sustained improvement in  
the performance of the Company as a whole over the performance period.
The 2006 LTIP is designed to provide the executive directors and other senior executives with a long-term incentive based on the 
performance of the particular arm of the business that they can affect. As such, the performance conditions described above are 
deemed appropriate by the remuneration committee.
Individual limits
The total value of Units over which an individual may be granted Awards under the 2006 LTIP during the period commencing on  
9 January 2007 (i.e. the date of its adoption) and ending on the final day of the Company’s financial year ending 31 December 2007  
could not exceed 400% of his/her rate of annual base salary. In any subsequent financial year of the Company, the total value of  
Units over which an individual may be granted Awards during that year must not exceed 300% of his/her annual base salary (save in 
exceptional circumstances where a 400% limit may be applied). These limits are broadly consistent with those that applied under  
the 2002 LTIP and reflect the remuneration committee’s policy of placing a significantly higher weighting on variable pay rather  
than fixed pay.
Long-Term Incentive Plans – proposed arrangements
For the same reasons as noted above in relation to the 2006 Plan, the remuneration committee has concluded that it is no longer 
appropriate to continue with the current structure of the 2006 LTIP , insofar as it relates to Capricorn Units. As a result, it is seeking 
shareholder approval at the AGM to introduce a new long term incentive plan that will replace the 2006 LTIP for all future grants.
Further details in relation to this new LTIP are set out in the Circular to shareholders accompanying this Annual Report and Accounts.  
It is, however, worth noting that its terms are largely identical to those of the 2006 LTIP summarised above, save that awards will be 
granted over ordinary shares in the Company rather than Units. 
The remuneration committee is currently assessing how to treat outstanding awards over Capricorn Units that have already  
been granted under the 2006 LTIP. As and when a preferred approach has been identified, appropriate proposals will be put  
to shareholders for their consideration and approval.
Share Scheme Dilution
In any ten-year rolling period, the number of shares that may be issued in connection with the 2006 LTIP and 2006 Plan, when added 
to the number of unissued shares that have been allocated in that same period under any other discretionary share scheme adopted 
by the Company, cannot exceed 5% of Cairn’s issued ordinary share capital.
In addition, in any ten-year rolling period, the number of shares that may be issued in connection with the 2006 LTIP and 2006 Plan, 
when added to the number of unissued shares that have been allocated in that same period under any other employees’ share 
scheme adopted by the Company, cannot exceed 10% of Cairn’s issued ordinary share capital.
Annual Cash Bonus Scheme
Cairn’s annual cash bonus scheme applies to all employees and executive directors. Bonuses under the scheme are based on 
individual and Company performance measures. Individual performance is measured through the Company’s performance 
management system. Company performance measures are based on annually defined key performance indicators (‘KPIs’). The KPIs 
for 2008 encompassed various portfolio growth and operational performance targets, the substantial majority of which were met. 
For employees other than executive directors, only the individual and Company performance measures determine the overall bonus 
award. The bonus award to the executive directors is subject to two additional performance measures, being performance against 
annually defined corporate objectives and reserve replacement performance. For 2008, this resulted in one-quarter of the award 
being determined by individual performance, one-quarter by Company performance, one-quarter by performance against 
corporate objectives and one-quarter by reserve replacement performance. The corporate objectives for 2008 are commercially

sensitive and are therefore excluded from this report, as are the 2009 corporate objectives. The choice of these measures, and their 
respective weightings, reflects the committee’s belief that any short-term incentive compensation should be tied both to the overall 
performance of the Company and to those areas of its business that each individual can directly influence.
The maximum level of bonus award for the executive directors for 2008 was up to 100% of salary. The actual bonuses awarded to 
the executive directors for performance in 2008 are shown in the table on page 70. The maximum level of bonus award for other 
senior executives for 2008 was 40% of salary. The bonus cap for all other employees for 2008 was between 25% and 40%.
The remuneration committee has the discretion to award bonuses in addition to those payable under the annual cash bonus scheme 
in recognition of particular efforts or achievements by employees, including executive directors. No bonuses of this kind were 
awarded to executive directors during 2008.
A similar structure with equivalent maximum bonus potentials will operate in 2009.
Pension Arrangements
The Company operates a defined contribution group personal pension scheme in the UK. With effect from 1 June 2008, the 
previous scheme (the Cairn Energy PLC Retirement Benefits Scheme) was replaced with a new scheme (the Capricorn Oil Group 
Pension Plan). The scheme remains non-contributory and all UK permanent employees are eligible to participate. The Company 
contributes 10% of basic annual salary (15% in respect of senior executives) on behalf of all qualifying employees.
Dr Mike Watts and Jann Brown were members of the Cairn Energy PLC Retirement Benefits Scheme until 31 May 2008 and of the 
Capricorn Oil Group Pension Plan from 1 June 2008. Each received a contribution equal to 15% of their respective annual basic salaries. 
Simon Thomson and Malcolm Thoms each have an individual personal pension plan and received a contribution from the Company 
equal to 15% of their respective annual basic salaries. 
Sir Bill Gammell and Phil Tracy each received an amount equivalent to 15% of their respective annual basic salaries in the form of 
additional salary as their pension arrangements are fully funded. 
Further details of the contributions made by the Company in respect of each executive director are set out in the table on page 70. 
The Company is also the principal employer for a Small Self-Administered Scheme. Sir Bill Gammell is the sole member of this 
scheme. The Company is not contractually obliged to make any contributions into this scheme on behalf of Sir Bill Gammell and  
did not do so during the year. 
 
Service Contracts
The Company’s policy is for all executive directors to have contracts of service that can be terminated by either the director concerned 
or the Company on giving 12 months’ notice of termination. In the event of early termination by the Company (other than as a result of a 
change of control), the executive directors would be entitled to loss of salary, benefits and pension contributions for the notice periods. 
Depending on the circumstances of termination, the executive directors may be entitled, or the remuneration committee may exercise 
its discretion to allow the executive director, to retain a proportion of their outstanding awards under long-term incentive arrangements 
(but only to the extent that any applicable performance conditions have been met). The committee’s policy on early termination is to 
emphasise the duty of the terminated party to mitigate any loss caused by the early termination to the fullest extent practicable.
On a change of control of the Company resulting in the termination of a director’s employment, each of the directors is entitled  
to compensation of a sum equal to his/her annual basic salary as at the date of termination of employment. 
Each of the non-executive directors has a letter of appointment in terms of which he is appointed for a fixed three-year period, 
subject to the Company’s Articles of Association, which provide for retirement by rotation at least once every three years. The letters 
of appointment set out the time commitment expected by the Company and can be terminated with immediate effect by either the 
director concerned or the Company. The Board is satisfied that each of the non-executive directors commits sufficient time to fulfil 
his duties as a director of the Company. None of the non-executive directors has any conflict of interest that has not been disclosed 
to the Board in accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association. 
The executive directors’ service contracts and non-executive directors’ letters of appointment are available for inspection on 
request and will be available for inspection before and during the AGM to be held on 19 May 2009.

Notes:
(1)  Malcolm Thoms ceased to be a director of Revus Energy AS on 22 December 2008. His fees reflect the period from 1 January 
2008 to that date and were payable partly in cash and partly in shares.
(2) Jann Brown was appointed a director of Hansen Transmissions International nv on 16 May 2008 and her fees reflect the period 
from that date to 31 December 2008.
The Board believes, in principle, in the benefits of executive directors accepting positions as non-executive directors of other 
companies in order to widen their skills and knowledge for the benefit of the Company, provided that the time commitments  
are not unduly onerous.
The appointment of any executive director to a non-executive position with another company must be approved by the Board.  
In the case of a proposed appointment to a company within the oil and gas industry, permission will only be given if the two 
companies do not compete in the same geographical area.

74    CAIRN ENERGY PLC  ANNUAL REPORT 2008 GOVERNANCE AND ACCOUNTS
We have audited the group and parent company financial statements (the ‘financial statements’) of Cairn Energy PLC for the year 
ended 31 December 2008 which comprise the Group Income Statement, the Group and Company Balance Sheets, the Group and 
Company Cash Flow Statements, the Group and Company Statements of Recognised Income and Expense and the related notes  
1 to 38. These financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited the 
information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985.  
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state  
to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report,  
or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective Responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial statements  
in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited in 
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether financial statements and 
the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
1985 and, as regards the group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also report to you whether in our opinion 
the information given in the directors’ report is consistent with the financial statements. The information given in the directors’ 
report includes that specific information presented in the Highlights of 2008, Chairman’s Statement, Chief Executive’s Review, 
Assets, Operating & Exploration Review, Corporate Responsibility and Financial Review that is cross referred from the Business 
Review section of the directors’ report. 
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the 
information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and other 
transactions are not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement reflects the company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2006 
Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are 
not required to consider whether the Board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the 
effectiveness of the Group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial statements.  
The other information comprises only the Operating and Exploration Review, Financial Review, Chairman’s Statement, Chief Executive’s 
Review, Corporate Governance Statement, Directors’ Report, the unaudited part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report and other items 
listed in the table of contents. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material 
inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Independent Auditor’s Report to the Members of Cairn Energy PLC
CAIRN ENERGY PLC  ANNUAL REPORT 2008    75 Basis of Audit Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing  
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the significant 
estimates and judgments made by the directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the group’s and company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations that we considered necessary in  
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report to be audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. 
In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements and 
the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, of the state 
of the Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2008 and of its profit for the year then ended;
• the parent company financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union  
as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1985, of the state of the parent company’s affairs as at  
31 December 2008;
• the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and, as regards the group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation; and
• the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the financial statements.

Statement of Cash Flows
For the Year Ended 31 December 2008
80    CAIRN ENERGY PLC  ANNUAL REPORT 2008 GOVERNANCE AND ACCOUNTS
1. Accounting Policies
a) Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of Cairn Energy PLC (‘Cairn’ or ‘the Group’) for the period ended 31 December 2008 were 
authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the directors on 6 April 2009. The Group is a limited company incorporated 
and domiciled in the United Kingdom whose shares are publically traded. The registered office is located at 50 Lothian Road, 
Edinburgh, Scotland.
Cairn prepares its accounts on a historical cost basis. Where there are assets and liabilities calculated on a different basis, 
this fact is disclosed in the relevant accounting policy. 
b) Accounting standards
Cairn prepares its accounts in accordance with applicable International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as adopted by the EU. 
The Group’s financial statements are also consistent with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (‘IASB’). 
Relevant new standards and interpretations issued by the IASB, but not yet effective and not applied in these financial statements 
are as follows:
   Date of adoption
Title  Change to accounting policy by Cairn Impact on initial application

     statement, with corresponding 
increase in assets. 
IAS 1 ‘Revised Presentation  No changes to current accounting policy. 1 Jan 2009 Presentation and disclosure 
of Financial Statements’    requirements for certain items  
in the Income Statement.
Effective date from 1 July 2009
Revised IAS 27 ‘Consolidated and  Reclassification of gain on deemed disposal 1 Jul 2009 Presentation of gain on deemed 
Separate Financial Statements’ from Income Statement direct to equity.   disposal will change. 
 Share for share exchange transactions in  
 subsidiaries will be recognised at book  
 value rather than fair value. 
IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’  Expensing of all transaction costs. 1 Jul 2009 Applies only to business 
– Revised   combinations after  
   effective date.
No other IFRS as issued by the IASB which are not yet effective are expected to have an impact on the Group’s or Company’s 
financial statements. 
Cairn has adopted IFRIC 11 – ‘Group and Treasury Share Transactions’. This interpretation requires share based payment awards 
relating to employees of a subsidiary to be recognised in the equity of that company. On adoption, there was no impact at group  
or company level. 
Cairn has adopted IFRS 8 – ‘Operating Segments’. IFRS 8 replaces IAS 14 ‘Segment Reporting’. Cairn early adopted this standard  
as of 1 January 2008. The Group concluded that the operating segments determined in accordance with IFRS 8 are equivalent to 
the business segments previously identified under IAS 14. IFRS 8 disclosures are shown in Note 4, including related revised 
comparative information.
c) Presentational currency
The functional currency of Cairn Energy PLC, the ultimate parent company of the Group, is Sterling. These accounts have been 
presented in US Dollars ($), the functional currency of most companies within the Group. It is deemed to be more appropriate to 
present the financial statements in line with the functional currency of the majority of the Group. The Group’s policy on foreign 
currencies is detailed in note 1(p).
Notes to the Accounts Notes to the Accounts
CAIRN ENERGY PLC  ANNUAL REPORT 2008    81 1. Accounting Policies continued
d) Basis of consolidation
The consolidated accounts include the results of Cairn Energy PLC and its subsidiary undertakings to the Balance Sheet date.  
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed during the year are included in the Income Statement and Statement of Cash  
Flows from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal as appropriate.
Cairn allocates the purchase consideration of any acquisition to assets and liabilities on the basis of fair values at the date of acquisition. 
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the assets and liabilities is recognised as goodwill. Any goodwill arising is 
recognised as an asset and is subject to annual review for impairment. Goodwill is written off where circumstances indicate that the 
value of the underlying cash generating unit including the asset may no longer support the carrying value of goodwill. Any such 
impairment loss arising is recognised in the Income Statement for the period. Impairment losses relating to goodwill cannot be 
reversed in future periods. Negative goodwill is credited immediately to the Income Statement.
Cairn has used the exemption granted under section 230(1)(b) of the Companies Act 1985 that allows for the non disclosure of the 
Income Statement of the parent company. The loss attributable to the Company for the year ended 31 December 2008 was $19.4m 
(2007: profit of $1,170.7m).
e) Joint Ventures
Cairn participates in several unincorporated Joint Ventures that involve the joint control of assets used in the Group’s oil and gas 
exploration and producing activities. Cairn accounts for its share of assets, liabilities, income and expenditure of Joint Ventures in 
which the Group holds an interest, classified in the appropriate Balance Sheet and Income Statement headings. Cairn’s principal 
licence interests are jointly controlled assets.
A list of Cairn’s interests in unincorporated Joint Ventures is given on page 73 and 74.
f) Revenue and other income
Revenue from operating activities
Revenue represents Cairn’s share of oil, gas and condensate production, recognised on a direct entitlement basis, and tariff income 
received for third-party use of operating facilities and pipelines in accordance with agreements.
Other income
Income received as operator from Joint Ventures is recognised on an accruals basis in accordance with Joint Venture agreements 
and is included within ‘Other operating income’ in the Income Statement. Interest income is recognised using the effective interest 
method on an accruals basis and is recognised within ‘Finance income’ in the Income Statement.
g) Oil and gas intangible exploration/appraisal assets and property, plant & equipment – development/producing assets
Cairn follows a successful efforts-based accounting policy for oil and gas assets. 
Costs incurred prior to obtaining the legal rights to explore an area are expensed immediately to the Income Statement.
Expenditure incurred on the acquisition of a licence interest is initially capitalised on a licence-by-licence basis. Costs are held, 
undepleted, within exploration/appraisal assets until such time as the exploration phase on the licence area is complete or 
commercial reserves have been discovered. 
Exploration expenditure incurred in the process of determining exploration targets is capitalised initially within exploration/appraisal 
assets and subsequently allocated to drilling activities. Exploration/appraisal drilling costs are initially capitalised on a well-by-well basis 
until the success or otherwise of the well has been established. The success or failure of each exploration/appraisal effort is judged on a 
well-by-well basis. Drilling costs are written off on completion of a well unless the results indicate that hydrocarbon reserves exist and 
there is a reasonable prospect that these reserves are commercial. 
 
Following appraisal of successful exploration wells, if commercial reserves are established and technical feasibility for extraction 
demonstrated, then the related capitalised exploration/appraisal costs are transferred into a single field cost centre within 
development/producing assets after testing for impairment (see below). Where results of exploration drilling indicate the presence 
of hydrocarbons that are ultimately not considered commercially viable, all related costs are written off to the Income Statement. 
All costs incurred after the technical feasibility and commercial viability of producing hydrocarbons has been demonstrated are 
capitalised within development/producing assets on a field-by-field basis. Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only where it 
either enhances the economic benefits of the development/producing asset or replaces part of the existing development/
producing asset. Any remaining costs associated with the part replaced are expensed.
Net proceeds from any disposal of an exploration asset are initially credited against the previously capitalised costs. Any surplus 
proceeds are credited to the Income Statement. Net proceeds from any disposal of development/producing assets are credited 
against the previously capitalised cost. A gain or loss on disposal of a development/producing asset is recognised in the Income 
Statement to the extent that the net proceeds exceed or are less than the appropriate portion of the net capitalised costs of  
the asset.

1. Accounting Policies continued
g) Oil and gas intangible exploration/appraisal assets and property, plant & equipment – development/producing assets continued
Depletion
Cairn depletes separately, where applicable, any significant components within development/producing assets, such as fields, 
processing facilities and pipelines, which are significant in relation to the total cost of a development/producing asset. 
Cairn depletes expenditure on property, plant & equipment – development/producing assets – on a unit of production basis, based 
on proved and probable reserves on a field-by-field basis. In certain circumstances, fields within a single development area may be 
combined for depletion purposes.
Impairment
Exploration/appraisal assets are reviewed regularly for indicators of impairment following the guidance in IFRS 6 ‘Exploration for 
and Evaluation of Mineral Resources’ and tested for impairment where such indicators exist. In such circumstances the exploration 
asset is allocated to development/producing assets within the same operating segment and tested for impairment. Any impairment 
arising is recognised in the Income Statement for the year. Where there are no development/producing assets within an operating 
segment, the exploration/appraisal costs are charged immediately to the Income Statement. 
Impairment reviews on development/producing assets are carried out on each cash-generating unit identified in accordance with 
IAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’. Cairn’s cash generating units are those assets which generate largely independent cash flows and are 
normally, but not always, single development areas. 
At each reporting date, where there are indicators of impairment, the net book value of the cash generating unit is compared  
with the associated expected discounted future net cash flows. If the net book value is higher, then the difference is written off  
to the Income Statement as impairment. Discounted future net cash flows for IAS 36 purposes are calculated using an estimated 
short-term oil price of $50/bbl and a long-term oil price of $65/bbl (2007: short- and long-term of $60/bbl), or the appropriate gas 
price as dictated by the relevant gas sales contract, escalation for prices and costs of 3%, and a discount rate of 10% (2007: 3%  
and 10% respectively). Forecast production profiles are determined on an asset-by-asset basis, using appropriate petroleum 
engineering techniques. 
Where there has been a charge for impairment in an earlier period that charge will be reversed in a later period where there has 
been a change in circumstances to the extent that the discounted future net cash flows are higher than the net book value at the 
time. In reversing impairment losses, the carrying amount of the asset will be increased to the lower of its original carrying value or 
the carrying value that would have been determined (net of depletion) had no impairment loss been recognised in prior periods.
 
h) Property, plant & equipment – other
Property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment and depreciated over their 
expected useful economic lives as follows:
      Depreciation 
    Annual Rate (%)  method 
 
Tenants’ improvements     10-33*  straight line
Vehicles and equipment    25-50*  straight line
* Depreciation is charged over the shorter of the economic life or the remaining term of the lease.
i) Intangible assets – other
Intangible assets have finite useful lives, are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment, and amortised over 
their expected useful economic lives as follows:
      Amortisation 
    Annual Rate (%)  method 
Software costs    25-50   straight line
 
Goodwill arising on business combinations is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment. See note 1(d) above.
j) Investments
The Company’s investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less provisions resulting from impairment. The recoverable value of 
investments is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and value in use. Value in use is based on the discounted future net cash 
flows of the oil and gas assets held by the subsidiary.
Discounted future net cash flows for IAS 36 purposes are calculated using an estimated short-term oil price of $50/bbl and a  
long-term oil price of $65/bbl (2007: short- and long-term of $60/bbl) or the appropriate gas price as dictated by the relevant  
gas sales contract, escalation for prices and costs of 3%, and a discount rate of 10% (2007: 3% and 10% respectively). Forecast 
production profiles are determined on an asset-by-asset basis, using appropriate petroleum engineering techniques.

CAIRN ENERGY PLC  ANNUAL REPORT 2008    83 1. Accounting Policies continued
k) Inventory
Inventories of oil and condensate held at the balance sheet date are valued at net realisable value based on the estimated selling 
price in accordance with established industry practice.
l) Financial instruments
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument  
of another entity. 
Financial assets are categorised as financial assets held at fair value through profit or loss, held-to-maturity investments, loans and 
receivables and available-for-sale financial assets. The Group holds financial assets that are classified as either available-for-sale financial 
assets or loans and receivables, with the exception of derivative financial instruments, which are held at fair value through profit or loss. 
Financial liabilities generally substantiate claims for repayment in cash or another financial asset. Financial liabilities are categorised 
as either fair value through profit or loss or held at amortised cost. All of the Group’s financial liabilities are held at amortised cost, 
with the exception of derivative financial instruments, which are held at fair value through profit or loss. 
Financial instruments are generally recognised as soon as the Group becomes party to the contractual regulations of the 
financial instrument.
Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency options to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency 
fluctuations. Such derivative financial instruments are designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss.  
The derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into  
and are subsequently remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities  
when the fair value is negative.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value on derivatives during the year are taken directly to the Income Statement.  
The Group did not apply hedge accounting for derivative financial instruments held during the current and prior year.
 
Available-for-sale financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets are those non-derivative financial assets that are not classified as loans and receivables.  
The Group’s available-for-sale financial assets represent listed equity shares that are held at fair value (the quoted market price). 
Movements in the fair value during the year are recognised directly in equity and are disclosed in the Statement of Recognised 
Income and Expense. The cumulative gain or loss that arises on subsequent disposal of available-for-sale financial assets will be 
recycled through the Income Statement.
Loans and other receivables
Trade receivables, loans and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted on an active market 
are classified as ‘loans and receivables’. Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method 
less any impairment. Trade and other receivables are recognised when invoiced. Interest income is recognised by applying the 
effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables where the recognition of interest would be immaterial.
The carrying amounts of loans and other receivables are tested at each reporting date to determine whether there is objective 
material evidence of impairment, for example overdue trade debt. Any impairment losses are recognised through the use of an 
allowance account. When a trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries 
of amounts previously written off are credited against the allowance account. Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance 
account are recognised in the Income Statement or Balance Sheet in accordance with where the original receivable was recognised.
Bank deposits
Bank deposits with an original maturity of over three months are held as a separate category of current asset and presented on the 
face of the Balance Sheet.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
For the purposes of the consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents  
as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Trade payables and other non derivative financial liabilities
Trade payables and other creditors are non-interest bearing and are measured at cost.
Interest-bearing bank loans and borrowings
All interest-bearing bank loans and borrowings represent amounts drawn under the Group’s revolving credit facilities, classified 
according to the length of time remaining under the respective facility. Loans are initially measured at fair value less directly 
attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans are subsequently measured at amortised cost  
using the effective interest method. Interest payable is accrued in the Income Statement using the effective interest rate method.

1. Accounting Policies continued
l) Financial instruments continued
Finance leases
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value at the inception of the lease or, if lower,  
at the present value of the minimum lease payments. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the Balance Sheet as a 
finance lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to 
achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged to the Income Statement, 
unless they are directly attributable to qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalised in accordance with the Group’s general 
policy on borrowing costs (see below).
The Group has reviewed the terms and conditions of the lease arrangements and determined that all risks and rewards of ownership 
lie with the Group and has therefore accounted for the contracts as finance leases.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs are recognised in the Income Statement in the period in which they are incurred except for borrowing costs incurred 
on borrowings directly attributable to development projects that are capitalised within the development/producing asset.
 
m) Equity
Equity instruments issued by Cairn are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs, allocated between share capital 
and share premium.
n) Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax.
The current tax is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Income Statement 
because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are 
never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the Balance Sheet date. 
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit.
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences except in respect of taxable temporary differences 
associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in Joint Ventures where the timing of the reversal of the temporary 
difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. A deferred 
income tax liability is not recognised if a temporary difference arises on initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is 
not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax assets and unused 
tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, 
carry forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses can be utilised, except where the deferred income tax asset relating to  
the deductible temporary timing difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a 
business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss. In respect  
of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in Joint Ventures, deferred 
tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future 
and taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets are reviewed at each Balance Sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no 
longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the asset is 
realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the Balance Sheet date.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where they arise within the same entity and tax jurisdiction and the group intends 
either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. 
o) Decommissioning
At the end of the producing life of a field, costs are incurred in removing and decommissioning production facilities. Cairn recognises 
the full discounted cost of dismantling and decommissioning as an asset and liability when the obligation arises. The decommissioning 
asset is included within property, plant & equipment – development/producing assets with the cost of the related installation.  
The liability is included within provisions. Revisions to the estimated costs of decommissioning that alter the level of the provisions 
required are also reflected in adjustments to the decommissioning asset. The amortisation of the asset, calculated on a unit of 
production basis based on proved and probable reserves, is included in the ‘Depletion and decommissioning charge’ in the  
Income Statement, and the unwinding of the discount on the provision is included within ‘Finance costs’.

CAIRN ENERGY PLC  ANNUAL REPORT 2008    85 1. Accounting Policies continued
p) Foreign currencies
In the accounts of individual Group companies, Cairn translates foreign currency transactions into the functional currency at the rate 
of exchange prevailing at the transaction date. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated into 
the functional currency at the rate of exchange prevailing at the Balance Sheet date. Exchange differences arising are taken to the 
Income Statement except for those incurred on borrowings specifically allocable to development projects, which are capitalised as 
part of the cost of the asset.
 
The Group maintains the accounts of the parent and subsidiary undertakings in their functional currency. Where applicable, the 
Group translates parent and subsidiary accounts into the presentational currency, $, using the closing rate method for assets and 
liabilities that are translated into $ at the rate of exchange prevailing at the Balance Sheet date and rates at the date of transactions 
for Income Statement accounts. Cairn takes exchange differences arising on the translation of net assets of Group companies whose 
functional currency is non $ directly to reserves. 
Rates of exchange to $1 were as follows:
   31 December Average 31 December  Average
   2008 2008 2007 2007
    
Sterling   0.684 0.540 0.504 0.500
Indian Rupee   48.620 43.146 39.400 41.339
q) Employee benefits
Pension schemes
Cairn operates defined contribution pension schemes in the UK and India. The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of 
Cairn and its subsidiaries. Cairn also operates insured benefit schemes for certain Indian and Bangladeshi employees as required under 
local legislation. In accordance with IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ these are treated as defined contribution schemes. The pension cost 
charged represents contributions payable in the year in accordance with the rules of the schemes.
Share schemes
The cost of awards to employees under Cairn’s LTIP and share option plans, granted after 7 November 2002, are recognised over 
the three-year period to which the performance relates. The amount recognised is based on the fair value of the shares as measured 
at the date of the award. The shares are valued using either the Black Scholes or binomial model, further details of which are given  
in note 7 .
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the 
performance and/or service conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to 
the award (‘the vesting date’). The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the 
vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Company’s best estimate of the number of equity 
instruments that will ultimately vest. The Income Statement charge or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative 
expense as recognised at the beginning and end of that period.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market 
condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other 
performance conditions are satisfied.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, the minimum expense recognised is the expense as if the terms had not 
been modified. An additional expense is recognised for any modification, which increases the total fair value of the share-based 
payment arrangement, or is otherwise beneficial to the employee as measured at the date of modification.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet 
recognised for the award is recognised immediately. However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated 
as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modification of the 
original award, as described in the previous paragraph. 
Shares acquired to meet awards under these shares schemes are held by the ESOP Trust. The accounts of the ESOP Trust are 
aggregated into these financial statements. 
The costs of awards to employees, in the form of cash but based on share performance (phantom options) are recognised  
over the period to which the performance relates. The amount recognised is based on the fair value of the liability arising from  
the transaction.
Termination benefits
Cairn recognises a liability for termination benefits at the point where the Group is committed to making the payments in return  
for employee redundancy.

r) Operating lease commitments
Cairn charges rentals payable under operating leases to the Income Statement on a straight line basis over the lease term. 
The Group has reviewed the terms and conditions of the lease arrangements and determined that all risks and rewards of  
ownership lie with the lessor and has therefore accounted for the contracts as operating leases.
s) Exceptional items
Exceptional items are those not considered to be part of the normal operation of the business. Such items are identified as 
exceptional and a full explanation is given in the notes to the accounts.
t) Key estimations and assumptions
The Group has used estimates and assumptions in arriving at certain figures within the financial statements. The resulting

On 9 October 2008, the entire issued share capital of Plectrum Petroleum Limited (whose principal asset was a 50% interest in  
Block Z-34, offshore Peru) was transferred to Gold Oil Caribbean Limited (a subsidiary of Gold Oil PLC) (‘Gold’). The Group made  
a payment of $1.5m to Gold in connection with the transfer. However no gain or loss has been recognised, as Plectrum was sold at 
book value.
Capricorn Oil and Gas Tunisia Gmbh (formerly REAP Gmbh), a subsidiary of Plectrum Petroleum Limited, which holds a 50% equity 
interest in the Nabeul permit offshore Tunisia was transferred to Capricorn Petroleum Limited, a member of the Group, prior to the 
sale of Plectrum Petroleum Limited.

2007 transactions
a) Acquisition of Plectrum Petroleum Limited (formerly Plectrum Petroleum Plc) 
On 7 September 2007 , the Group announced a recommended cash offer for Plectrum. Plectrum and its subsidiaries held a 50% 
equity interest in the Nabeul permit offshore Tunisia and in addition held interests in Australia, Peru and the UK at the time of 
acquisition. The offer was declared unconditional in all respects and Cairn gained control of Plectrum on 10 October 2007.

The goodwill of $4.4m arises on acquisition as consideration paid exceeds the fair value of assets acquired, including the deferred 
tax liability recognised. Refer to note 16 for further details. 
From the date of acquisition to 31 December 2007 , Plectrum incurred a loss of $1.7m. This loss is included in the results of the Group. 
As Plectrum does not hold producing assets, the acquisition had no impact on Group revenue. If the combination had taken place at 
the beginning of the year, the profit for the Group in 2007 would have been $1,523.8m.

b) Acquisition of medOil Plc
On 7 September 2007 , the Group announced a recommended cash offer for medOil. medOil holds a 100% equity interest in the 
Louza permit offshore Tunisia and in addition has interests in Albania and applications pending in Spain. The offer was declared 
unconditional in all respects and Cairn gained control of medOil on 10 October 2007. 
The fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of medOil as at the date of acquisition and the corresponding carrying amounts 
immediately prior to acquisition were:

Deferred tax liabilities recognised on acquisition have subsequently been reassessed and released in full. Consequently, negative 
goodwill arising on acquisition has been restated to $35.0m from $17.4m reported in the 31 December 2007 financial statements. 
The negative goodwill arises on acquisition as the fair value of the net assets acquired exceeds the consideration paid. In 
accordance with IFRS the negative goodwill is recognised immediately in the Income Statement.
The total cost of the combination was $30.8m which is made up of:

From the date of acquisition to 31 December 2007 , medOil incurred a loss of $0.3m. This loss is included in the results of the Group. 
As medOil does not hold producing assets, the acquisition had no impact on Group revenue. If the combination had taken place at 
the beginning of the year, the profit for the Group in 2007 would have been $1,526.3m.
c) Disposal of Cairn Energy Bangladesh Limited
On 25 October 2007 Santos International Holdings Pty Limited acquired 100% of Cairn Energy Bangladesh Limited from the Group 
for a total cash consideration of $55.8m. There is an additional contingent consideration of $20.0m, which is payable in tranches 
dependent upon future development as a result of the 2007/2008 exploration drilling programme, which has not been recognised. 
As a result of this transaction the Group disposed of a 37.5% holding in Bangladesh Block 16, including Sangu, and a 45% interest in 
each of the Bangladesh Exploration Blocks 5 and 10.

4. Segmental Analysis
Operating segments
For management purposes, the Group is organised into two business units; the Capricorn Group, being Capricorn Oil Limited  
and its subsidiary undertakings, and the Cairn India Group, each reporting internally to its own chief executive. There are three 
reportable operating segments as follows:
Cairn India Limited Group’s operations are primarily within India.
Capricorn Group’s operations focus on new exploration activities in Greenland and the Mediterranean. The Capricorn Group also 
includes the Group’s interests in Bangladesh and Nepal and a share in certain North Indian assets operated by Cairn India Limited.
Cairn Energy PLC exists to accumulate the activities and results of Cairn UK Holdings Limited, an intermediate holding company  
and direct parent of Cairn India Limited, and Cairn Energy PLC company results. Unallocated expenditure and net assets/(liabilities) 
including amounts of a corporate nature, not specifically attributable to one of the sub-Groups, are also included within this segment.
No operating segments have been aggregated to form the above reportable segments. 
Management monitors the results of its business units separately for the purposes of making decisions about resource allocation 
and performance assessment.

At the year end the Group reviews the carrying value of cash generating units within property, plant & equipment – development/
producing assets for indicators of impairment or reversal of prior year impairment. In the current year this review determined that  
the value of certain units previously impaired within the Capricorn Group was in excess of the carrying value. As a result a reversal  
of prior year impairment charges of $2.7m (2007: $3.7m) has been recognised through the Income Statement. 
At the year end the Group also reviews intangible/exploration assets for indicators of impairment defined under IFRS 6.  
Where such indicators are identified the Group tests those assets for impairment. In the current year the write-down of intangible 
exploration/appraisal assets followed an impairment test of the Capricorn Group cash generating unit. The producing asset in this 
cash-generating unit is currently carried at net present value and no additional headroom exists to support the carrying value of 
exploration assets where indicators of impairment are identified. As a result a write-down of $21.0m (2007: $58.9m) in relation  
to intangible exploration/appraisal assets has been charged to the Income Statement.
During the year, the Group relinquished Block 5 in Bangladesh. As a result costs of $6.5m were charged to the Income Statement  
as unsuccessful exploration costs. As these costs were previously fully impaired, the impairments have been released on 
relinquishment of the block.
Refer to details on the reason for impairment in the Operating and Exploration Review on page 18 and note 1(g) for details of the 
assumptions used in the impairment calculation.
c) Continuing operations
All profits and losses in the current and preceding year were derived from continuing operations.

The Group made an exceptional gain of $355.8m on the deemed disposal of 4.23% of Cairn India Limited during the period.  
4.12% of this disposal was through the private placement on the Bombay Stock Exchange and National Stock Exchange of India, 
which completed on 16 April 2008. Cairn India Limited entered an agreement with Petronas and Orient Global Tamarind Fund Pte 
Limited, further to which the investors agreed to purchase a total of 113m shares of Cairn India Limited at Rs. 224.30 per share.
Share options exercised under the Cairn India Senior Management Plan account for the additional reduction of the Company’s 
indirect percentage holding in Cairn India Limited. At 31 December 2008, the Company retained an indirect holding of 64.68%  
in Cairn India Limited.
In 2007 the Group made an exceptional gain of $1,538.9m (restated) on the deemed disposal of 31% of Cairn India Limited through the 
Initial Public Offer (‘IPO’) on the Bombay Stock Exchange and National Stock Exchange of India, which completed on 9 January 2007 . 
Cairn India Limited listed with a partial IPO of 538.5m shares of 10 Rupees each, including 209.7m shares by way of pre-IPO placement. 
A further 13.1m shares were issued during the subsequent stabilisation period. The Company’s indirect percentage holding in Cairn 
India Limited reduced as a result from 100% to 69.0%.
In 2007, the Group also made an exceptional gain of $40.3m on the deemed disposal of 10% of Capricorn Oil Limited (formerly 
Capricorn Energy Limited) to Dyas BV on 7 September 2007 . This resulted from the issue of share capital by Capricorn Oil Limited  
in a private placement. The Company retains a direct 90% interest in Capricorn Oil Limited.

The Cairn Energy PLC share options have been valued using a binomial model. The main inputs to the model include the number of 
options, share price, leaver rate, trigger points, discount rate and volatility. 
• Leaver rate assumptions are based on past history of employees leaving the Company prior to options vesting and are revised to 
equal the number of options that ultimately vest.
• Trigger points are the profit points at which the relevant percentage of employees is assumed to exercise their options. 
• The risk-free rate is based on the yield on a zero coupon Government bond with a term equal to the expected term on the option 
being valued.
• Volatility was determined as the annualised standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the shares of a 
peer group of similar companies selected from the FTSE, as disclosed in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 60 to 72, 
over a ten-year period to the date of award.

2006 Plan
Under the 2006 Share Option Plan (the ‘2006 Plan’), certain executive directors and employees had been granted ‘phantom options’ 
(which are equity settled) over ‘units’ in the Group. On the exercise of an option, participants will generally become entitled to such 
number of Cairn shares as have a market value equal to the notional gain that they realise, being the difference between the 
‘notional exercise price’ attributable to their option and the price of the units in respect of which their option has been exercised. 
However, the extent to which options become exercisable is dependent on continued employment with the Group and the extent  
to which predetermined performance conditions are met over a three-year period.
The following table details the number and weighted average notional exercise price (WANEP) of share options issued under the 
2006 Plan at the Balance Sheet date:

Under UK tax law, borrowing costs which are capitalised in the accounts will generally be deductible expenses for tax in the period 
in which they are capitalised. Under Indian tax law, capitalised costs must be apportioned between property, plant and equipment 
and intangible assets based on the nature of the assets which were funded by the borrowing. To the extent that the borrowing costs 
relate to property, plant and equipment, they will be deductible for tax according to the normal tax depreciation rules. Borrowing 
costs relating to intangibles will be a deductible expense, for Indian tax purposes, in the period in which they are capitalised.

     ––––––––––– –––––––––––
The applicable tax rate was the weighted average rate for the year of the UK, Netherlands, Australian, Indian, Jersey, Swiss, 
Bangladeshi, Sri Lankan and Mauritian tax rates. The UK mainstream rate of corporation tax reduced from 30% to 28% on 1 April 2008, 
resulting in an averaged UK rate for the year of 28.5%. Other than this, there have been no major changes in the statutory tax rates 
applying in each of these jurisdictions, however, the weighted average rate is subject to fluctuations from year to year based on the 
level of profits and losses which arise to the Group in each jurisdiction.
c) Factors that may affect future corporation tax charges
At 31 December 2008, Cairn had losses of approximately $366.0m (2007: $261.9m) available for offset against future trading  
profits chargeable to UK Corporation Tax. In addition there are surplus management expenses of $121.9m (2007: $134.4m) and  
non-trade deficits of $10.1m (2007: $14.4m) available for offset against future investment income. None of the trading losses,  
surplus management expenses or non-trade deficits has been recognised for deferred tax as there is no reasonable certainty  
that they will be used. Under UK tax law, tax losses may generally be carried forward indefinitely.
At 31 December 2008, Cairn had losses of approximately $14.7m (2007: $14.7m) available for offset against future trading profits 
chargeable to Netherlands Corporate Income Tax, but there are restrictions on the use of these losses. Under Netherlands tax law, 
losses may be carried forward for a period of up to nine years. No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these losses.
At 31 December 2008, Cairn had losses of approximately $369.1m (2007: $373.6m) available for offset against future trading profits 
chargeable to Indian Corporate Income Tax. Under Indian tax laws, losses may be carried forward for a period of up to eight years. 
These losses have not been recognised for deferred tax purposes as it is not sufficiently certain that they will be utilised against 
future trading profits chargeable to Indian tax. $334.9m (2007: $341.7m) of the loss has not been recognised as it is expected that 
these losses will expire during the period of an Indian tax holiday. The remaining $34.2m (2007: $31.9m) of the loss has not been 
recognised due to expectations regarding the level of income in the entity concerned. 
Tax losses incurred in one jurisdiction cannot usually be offset against profits or gains arising in another jurisdiction.

12. Earnings per Ordinary Share
The earnings per ordinary share is calculated on a profit of $348.8m (2007 (restated): profit $1,543.1m) and on a weighted average of 
129,803,431 ordinary shares (2007: 135,637 ,411). The weighted average number of shares excludes shares held by the Cairn Energy 
PLC Employees’ Share Trust. No retrospective adjustment was made to the weighted average number of shares, relating to the 
share consolidation of 23 March 2007, as there was a corresponding change in resources in the form of the return of cash to 
shareholders (see notes 27 and 29).
The diluted earnings per ordinary share is calculated on a profit of $346.9m (2007 (restated): profit $1,543.1m) and on 129,973,851 
ordinary shares (2007: 135,844,139). The profit of $346.9m reflects the reduced profit attributable to equity holders of the parent 
after potential Cairn India Limited share option issues. The 129,973,851 ordinary shares is the basic weighted average of 129,803,431 
ordinary shares and the 170,420 dilutive potential ordinary shares relating to share options.

CAIRN ENERGY PLC  ANNUAL REPORT 2008    105 13. Intangible Exploration/Appraisal Assets continued
Exploration costs transferred to property, plant and equipment – development/producing assets (note 14) during the year of 
$98.8m relate to successful exploration activities. This includes Rajasthan costs associated with Bhagyam and Aishwariya oil  
fields where Cairn booked reserves during the year and Ravva general costs, which have been allocated to successful exploration 
activities. Transfers in 2007 of $11.2m were costs associated with Lakshmi oil reserves that were booked in that year. 
During the year, the Group relinquished Block 5 in Bangladesh. As a result costs of $6.5m were charged to the Income Statement  
as unsuccessful exploration costs. As these costs were previously fully impaired, the impairments have been released on 
relinquishment of the block.
The acquisition of subsidiaries in 2007 refers to the acquisition of Plectrum and medOil. See note 3 for further details.
 
The disposal of assets in 2007 relates to the sale of Cairn Energy Bangladesh Limited to Santos International Holdings Pty Limited. 
See note 3 for details.
At the year end, the Group reviews exploration/appraisal assets for indicators of impairment defined under IFRS 6. Where an 
indicator is identified, the asset is tested for impairment. 
In 2008, exploration/appraisal costs of $21.0m (2007: $58.9m) relating to Bangladesh and Nepalese assets have been impaired.  
See note 5 for further details of the impairment review.

Goodwill was acquired through business combinations in 2007 (see note 3). The goodwill has been allocated to the Capricorn  
cash-generating unit, which is also a reporting segment, and has been tested for impairment. No impairment has been identified  
in the period (2007: $nil).
The recoverable amount of the Capricorn cash-generating unit has been determined based on value in use using estimated 
cashflow projections over the licence period of the exploration assets within the unit as reported to management. The key 
assumptions used in the calculation are disclosed in note 1(g).
The key assumptions are sensitive to market fluctuations and the success of future exploration drilling programs. The most likely 
factor that will result in a material change to the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is the results of the future 
exploration drilling, which will determine the licence area’s future economic potential.

*  The movements during the period relate to amounts with corresponding balances in trade receivables, deferred income or other 
creditors in the Balance Sheet therefore do not affect the Income Statement.
In determining the recoverability of a trade or other receivable, the Group carries out a risk analysis based on the type and age of 
the outstanding receivable. 
Included in the allowance for doubtful debts are individually impaired Joint Venture debtors with a balance of $60.9m (2007:$42.8m). 
These predominantly relate to outstanding Rajasthan cash calls which are currently being pursued by management. The increase in 
allowance recognised in the Income Statement for impaired Joint Venture debtors is included in unsuccessful exploration costs.

At the Balance Sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries 
for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was $408.4m (2007 (restated): $406.7m). No liability has been recognised 
in respect of these differences because Cairn is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it 
is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
As at the Balance Sheet date, a deferred tax asset was not recognised in respect of Group losses of $881.8m (2007: $799.0m) 
(Company: $113.1m; 2007: $131.7m) where it is not probable that they can be utilised in future periods.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised at 31 December 2008 (2007: nil) in respect of trading or other losses, as it is not 
considered to be sufficiently certain that these losses will be utilised against future trading or other profits arising to the Group. 
24. Obligations Under Finance Leases
The Group has finance leases for various items of tenants’ improvements and office equipment all of which provide the specific 
entity which holds the lease with the option to purchase. Future finance lease commitments are as follows:

The average lease term is 3 to 5 years. For the period ended 31 December 2008, the average effective borrowing rate was 9.04% 
(2007: 7.52%). Interest rates are fixed at the contract date. All leases are on a fixed repayment basis and no arrangements have been 
entered into for contingent rental payments. The fair value of the Group’s lease obligations approximates their carrying amount.  
The Group’s obligations under finance leases are secured by the lessors’ rights over the leased assets. 
The Company does not have any obligations under finance leases.

Decommissioning costs are expected to be incurred between 2012 and 2041 (2007: 2008 and 2020). The provision has been 
estimated using existing technology at current prices and discounted using a real discount rate of 7% pa (2007: 7%). The change in 
decommissioning estimate in 2008 arose as a result of a third party review of estimated costs of decommissioning for the Ravva and 
Lakshmi and Gauri fields and together with estimates of additional wells drilled in Rajasthan and the Rajasthan facilities in place at 
the year end. 
Other provisions are production related payments payable to the GoI specified within the respective PSCs and provisions for 
committed spend recognised on the acquisition of Plectrum and medOil (see note 3).
A contingent liability has been disclosed within these financial statements in respect of additional payments that may fall due with 
regard to the Ravva arbitration proceedings; see note 35 for details.

At an extraordinary general meeting held on 22 March 2007, it was resolved that the 160,467,920 existing ordinary shares of  
10 pence each be replaced by 130,380,185 new ordinary shares of 6 
2
/ 13 pence each and 160,467 ,920 B shares of 5 pence each.  
The effective date of this transaction was 23 March 2007 .
The B share scheme allowed Cairn to return to shareholders $936m (including expenses) of the proceeds from the flotation of its 
Indian business, Cairn India. The B shares were not listed on the Official List nor admitted to trading on the London Stock Exchange. 
As at 31 December 2007, all B shares had been fully converted to cash.
In order to make the market price of a Cairn share comparable before and after the return of cash to shareholders, a share consolidation 
was carried out to convert 16 existing ordinary shares of 10 pence each to 13 new ordinary shares of 6

Shares held by ESOP Trust
Shares held by the ESOP Trust represent the cost of shares held by the Cairn Energy PLC Employees’ Share Trust at 31 December 2008. 
The number of shares held by the Cairn Energy PLC Employees’ Share Trust at 31 December 2008 was 1,157 ,415 (2007: 1,342,701) and 
the market value of these shares was £23.3m (2007: £41.3m).
As a result of the return of cash to shareholders, $13.8m was returned to the ESOP Trust in 2007 and is aggregated in the financial 
statements.
Foreign currency translation
Group
Unrealised foreign exchange gains and losses arising on consolidation of subsidiary undertakings are taken directly to reserves  
in accordance with IAS 21, ‘The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates’.
In accordance with IAS 21, foreign exchange differences arising on intra-group loans are not eliminated on consolidation;  
this reflects the exposure to currency fluctuations where the subsidiaries involved have differing functional currencies.  
These intra-group loans are not considered to be an investment in a foreign operation.
Company
Unrealised foreign exchange gains and losses arise on translation of the Company’s £ functional results into $ presentational 
currency in accordance with IAS 21.
 
Capital reserves – non-distributable
Capital reserves – non-distributable include non distributable amounts arising on various Group acquisitions. 
Cash returned to shareholders
In April 2007 , Cairn Energy PLC returned cash to shareholders of £3 per share out of the proceeds of the flotation of Cairn India on 
the Bombay Stock Exchange and National Stock Exchange of India. Costs of the transaction of $3.3m have been charged direct to 
equity and are included within the reduction in retained earnings.

30. Financial Risk Management: Objectives and Policies
Group and Company
The main risks arising from the Company’s and the Group’s financial instruments are liquidity risk, interest rate risk, foreign currency 
risk, commodity price risk and credit risk. The respective Boards of Cairn Energy PLC and Cairn India Limited review and agree 
policies for managing each of these risks and these are summarised below:
The Group’s treasury functions at Cairn Energy PLC, Capricorn Oil Limited, Cairn India Limited and local operational offices are 
responsible for managing liquidity and credit risk relating to instruments other than receivables for their respective businesses in 
accordance with the policy set by their Board. This is carried out by monitoring of investment and funding requirements by using a 
number of techniques including daily cash flow monitoring. They must also recognise and manage interest, foreign exchange and 
commodity price exposure whilst ensuring that the Company and the Group has adequate liquidity at all times in order to meet its 
immediate cash requirements. Credit risk relating to receivables is managed by both Group, Cairn India Group and local management.
The primary financial instruments comprise bank loans, cash, short- and medium-term deposits, money market liquidity and  
mutual funds, intra-group loans, forward foreign exchange options, and other receivables and financial liabilities held at amortised 
cost. The Group’s strategy has been to finance its operations through a mixture of retained profits and bank borrowings. Other 
alternatives like equity and other forms of non investment grade debt finance are reviewed by the respective Boards, when 
appropriate, to fund substantial acquisitions or oil and gas projects.
 
Liquidity risk
Cairn India has available a $850.0m revolving credit facility to fund Rajasthan developments. The facility was previously held by  
Cairn Energy PLC and certain of its subsidiaries but an amendment agreement was entered into on 22 November 2006 to transfer 
the facility to Cairn India. Following the IPO of Cairn India on the Bombay Stock Exchange and the National Stock Exchange of India 
the amendment agreement became fully effective on 31 January 2007. 
The facility is provided by a consortium of ten international banks (expiry date 31 December 2011) and the International Finance 
Corporation (expiry date 31 December 2015). Interest is charged at floating rates determined by LIBOR plus an applicable margin. 
The maximum facility amount that can be drawn at any point in time is determined by reference to the net present value of the 
Rajasthan developments. The full $850.0m facility is currently available to be drawn, of which $500.0m was drawn at 31 December 
2008 (2007: $75.0m). Cairn India may cancel and repay the facility at any time. 
Under the terms of the original agreement, as security under the facility, a share pledge was provided over the shares in Cairn Energy 
Hydrocarbons Limited (a 100% subsidiary of Cairn India Holdings Limited, which holds 50% of the Group’s interest in Rajasthan).
On 28 March 2008 Cairn Energy PLC entered into a £30.0m revolving credit facility to fund its working capital. The facility is jointly 
provided by The Royal Bank of Scotland PLC and the Bank of Scotland PLC and expires on 31 January 2013. Interest is charged at 
floating rates determined by LIBOR plus an applicable margin. At 31 December 2008 £nil was drawn.
In addition, as at 31 December 2008 the Group has $80.0m (2007: $90.0m) of facilities in place to cover the issue of bank guarantees. 
Fixed rates of interest apply to these. $49.0m (2007: $28.2m) was unutilised at 31 December 2008.

30. Financial Risk Management: Objectives and Policies continued
Liquidity risk continued
The Group currently has surplus cash, which it has placed in a combination of money market liquidity funds and fixed-term deposits 
with a number of International and Indian banks and financial institutions, ensuring sufficient liquidity to enable the Group to meet 
its short/medium-term expenditure requirements.
The Group is conscious of the current environment and constantly monitors counterparty risk. Policies are in place to limit 
counterparty exposure. The Group monitors counterparties using published ratings and when investing in money market liquidity 
and mutual funds primarily by consideration of the funds investment policy. 
Interest rate risk
Surplus funds are placed on short/medium term deposit at floating rates. It is Cairn’s policy to deposit funds with banks or other 
financial institutions that offer the most competitive interest rate at time of issue. The requirement to achieve an acceptable yield  
is balanced against the need to minimise liquidity and counterparty risk.
Short/medium-term borrowing arrangements are available at floating rates. The treasury function may from time to time opt to 
manage a proportion of the interest costs on this debt by using derivative financial instruments like interest rate swaps. At this time, 
however, there are no such instruments (2007: none).
Interest rate risk table
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of the Group’s profit before tax to a change in interest rates (through the impact on 
floating rate borrowings and deposits). In addition there would be an increase of $0.8m to development/producing assets carrying 
value as a result of the capitalisation of the borrowing costs for the Rajasthan development (2007: $0.4m).
    Increase/decrease  Effect on profit
    in basis points  before tax
2008    50  $4.5m
2007    50  $3.3m
The amounts calculated are based on actual drawings and deposits in the periods for a 50 basis point movement in the total rate of 
interest on each loan or deposit.
Foreign currency risk
Cairn manages exposures that arise from receipt of revenues in foreign currencies, by matching receipts and payments in the same 
currency, and actively managing the residual net position. Generally the exposure has been limited given that receipts and payments 
are have mostly been in US dollars, and the functional currency of most companies in the Group is US dollars. Currently there is a 
significant Indian Rupee requirement but forward foreign exchange options are being utilised to mitigate this exposure.
In order to minimise Cairn’s exposure to foreign currency fluctuations, currency assets are matched with currency liabilities by 
borrowing or entering into foreign exchange contracts in the applicable currency if deemed appropriate. The loan facilities are 
multi-currency and allow drawings in currencies in US dollars, Sterling or such other currency as may be agreed between the  
lenders and Cairn from time to time.
Cairn reports in US dollars which, with most assets US dollar-denominated, minimises the impact of foreign exchange movements  
on the Group’s Balance Sheet.
Company and Group may from time to time, opt to use derivative financial instruments to minimise its exposure to fluctuations in 
foreign exchange and interest rates.
During the year Cairn India entered into forward foreign exchange options to hedge the exposure of future Indian Rupee 
requirements as part of the Rajasthan Development. Refer to note 31 for further details.
During 2007, a currency exchange option contract matured. The contract was entered into by the Company in 2006 in order to 
hedge the impact of currency fluctuations resulting from transactions carried out in Indian Rupees as part of the IPO. This was not 
exercised due to favourable movements in the exchange rate. 
Commodity price risk
There are implicit product price hedges in place through the pricing mechanisms applicable to Sangu, CB-OS/2 and Ravva Gas 
Sales Contracts (GSCs). The requirement for hedging instruments to unwind these pricing mechanisms is reviewed on an ongoing 
basis. These implicit product price hedges do not give rise to any embedded derivatives under IAS 39.
Ravva and CB-OS/2 oil sales are made to approved government nominated buyers or approved third parties at floating prices.  
This will also be the case for Rajasthan when sales commence.
No commodity price hedging contracts have been entered into during either the current or the previous year. There were no 
outstanding commodity price contracts at the start of the year or at the end of the year. The Group would not normally hedge 
commodity price risk but the respective Boards do monitor the position.
Notes to the Accounts
continued
CAIRN ENERGY PLC  ANNUAL REPORT 2008    123 30. Financial Risk Management: Objectives and Policies continued
Credit risk
Cairn has obtained payment guarantees or letters of credit from buyers as payment security on both the CB-OS/2 and Sangu GSCs. 
With respect to Ravva there is no payment security, however the buyers have been nominated by the GoI.
Investments in money market liquidity funds are only made with AAA-rated funds and where the investment policy is limited to 
liquidity instruments which excludes equity. Deposits and other investments are generally only placed with banks or financial 
institutions that has a Moody’s or Standard & Poor’s rating of AA and above. As at the 31 December 2008, $1,089.7m of the  
cash equivalents was held with 13 banks and $335.7m was held with 14 money market funds.
The respective Boards will continue to assess the Group’s strategies for managing credit risks but at this time they view existing 
policies as satisfactory for oil and gas sales in South Asia. At the year end the Group does not have any significant concentrations  
of bad debt risk other than that disclosed in note 20. 
The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets is represented by the carrying value as at the Balance Sheet date.
Capital management
The objective of the Group’s capital management structure is to ensure that there remains sufficient liquidity within the Group to 
carry out committed work programme requirements. The respective Groups monitor the long-term cash flow requirements of their 
businesses in order to assess the requirement for changes to the capital structure to meet that objective and to maintain flexibility.
The respective Boards manage their own capital structure and makes adjustments to it, in light of changes to economic conditions. 
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Groups may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital, issue new 
shares for cash, repay debt, put in place new debt facilities or other such restructuring activities as appropriate. 
No significant changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during the period ended 31 December 2008.

The derivative financial assets in 2008 and 2007 relate to forward foreign exchange options to hedge the exposure of future Indian 
Rupee requirements as part of the Rajasthan Development entered into by the Cairn India Group. The fair value of the currency 
options is determined by reference to market values for similar options at the year end. The cost to the group of exercising the 
currency options on contractual maturity was paid on purchase of the options. The fair value movement in the carrying value of  
the option has been included in the 2008 and 2007 financial statements. The options are not hedge accounted.
The available-for-sale financial asset relates to listed equity shares held by Cairn India. Refer to note 17 for further detail.
The fair value of financial assets and liabilities has been calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows at prevailing 
interest rates.

35. Contingent Liabilities 
Ravva arbitration
The calculation of the Government of India’s (GoI) share of petroleum produced from the Ravva oil field has been a matter of 
disagreement for some years. Ravva is an unincorporated Joint Venture (JV) in which Cairn has an interest.
An arbitration panel opined in October 2004 and Cairn has been willing to be bound by the award, although it was not as favourable 
as had been hoped. The GoI, however, has lodged an appeal in the Malaysian courts in respect of one element of the award that was 
in Cairn’s favour, namely the ‘ONGC Carry’ issue.
Cairn challenged both the GoI’s right to appeal and the grounds of that appeal. 
A judgement was delivered at the Malaysian High Court on 12 January 2009 ruling in favour of the GoI and setting the arbitration 
award aside. This has the effect of negating the original award in favour of Cairn. This judgement is subject to appeal to the 
Malaysian Court of Appeal and, potentially, the Malaysian Federal Court. Cairn has appealed to the Malaysian Court of Appeal.
Should Cairn finally lose the argument through the Malaysian courts, given the terms of the High Court’s award itself, this will require 
the matter to be arbitrated afresh under the terms of the PSC for dispute resolution.
Cairn has received advice from their Malaysian legal counsel to the effect that they have strong grounds for appeal through the 
Malaysian courts but, even if this proved unsuccessful, given there was one arbitration award in Cairn’s favour on this issue and a 
similar award was made in favour of one of Cairn’s Joint Venture partners on the same issue in a separate arbitration with GoI,  
Cairn believes it has a good chance of any new arbitration panel coming to the same conclusion.
In the event that the GoI’s appeal ultimately succeeded and a process then ensued that concluded with the arbitration award being 
reversed in a manner and a forum which Cairn accepted as binding (in effect by a new arbitration panel ruling in favour of GoI), then 
Cairn would be due to pay an additional $63.9m. Cairn would also be potentially liable for interest on this sum currently estimated at 
$29.8m though the calculation of interest would require further agreement.
The ‘ONGC Carry’ issue relates to whether Contractor Parties under Ravva PSC are entitled to include in their accounts for the 
purposes of calculating the PTRR certain costs paid by Contractor Parties in consideration for ONGC having paid 100% of costs 
prior to the signing of the Ravva PSC in 1994.

128    CAIRN ENERGY PLC  ANNUAL REPORT 2008 GOVERNANCE AND ACCOUNTS
35. Contingent Liabilities continued
In a separate and unrelated dispute related to the profit petroleum calculations under the Ravva PSC, the Ravva JV received a  
claim from the Director General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) for approximately $166.4m (representing $37.4m net to Cairn) for an alleged 
underpayment of profit petroleum to the Indian Government, together with interest on that amount through to 30 June 2006 of 
$30.6m (representing $6.9m net to Cairn).
This matter has now been referred to arbitration and the arbitration panel is in the process of being constituted.
This claim relates to the Indian Government’s allegation that the Ravva JV has recovered costs in excess of the Base Development 
Costs (‘BDC’) cap imposed in the PSC and that the Ravva JV has also allowed these excess costs in the calculation of the Post Tax 
Rate of Return (PTRR). Cairn believes that such a claim is unsustainable under the terms of the PSC because, amongst other reasons, 
the BDC cap only applies to the initial development of the Ravva field and not to subsequent development activities under the PSC. 
Additionally the Ravva JV has also contested the basis of the calculation in the above claim from the DGH. Even if upheld, Cairn 
believes that the DGH has miscalculated the sums that would be due to the Indian Government in such circumstances.
Indian Service Tax
Cairn India received three show cause notices from the tax authorities in India for non-payment of service tax as a recipient of 
services from foreign suppliers. These notices cover periods from 16 August 2002 to 31 March 2008. A writ petition challenging  
the applicability of service tax has been filed with the Chennai High Court in respect of two such show cause notices for the period  
16 August 2002 to 31 March 2007 . The reply for third show cause notice has to be filed before the authorities. Should the adjudication 
go against Cairn India, it will be liable to pay the service tax of $27.6m, including related interest, although this could be recovered  
in part where it relates to services provided to Joint Venture of which Cairn India is operator. 
Indian tax holiday on gas production 
Section 80-IB (9) of the Indian Income Tax Act allows the deduction of 100% of profits from the commercial production or refining  
of mineral oil. The term ‘mineral oil’ is not defined, but has always been understood to refer to both oil and gas, either separately  
or collectively.
The 2008 Indian Finance Bill appeared to remove this deduction by stating that ‘for the purpose of section 80-IB(9), the term 
“mineral oil” does not include petroleum and natural gas, unlike in other sections of the Act’. Subsequent announcements by  
the Indian Finance Minister and the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas have confirmed that tax holiday would be available  
on production of crude oil but have continued to exclude gas.
 
Cairn India filed a writ petition to the Gujarat High Court in December 2008 challenging the restriction of section 80-IB to  
the production of oil. In the event this challenge is unsuccessful, the potential liability for tax and related interest on tax holiday 
claimed on gas production for all periods to 31 December 2008 is approximately $52.4m.
Guarantees
It is normal practice for the Group to issue guarantees in respect of obligations during the normal course of business. 
The Group had provided the following guarantees at 31 December 2008:
• Various guarantees under the Group’s bank facilities (see note 30) for the Group’s share of minimum work programme 
commitments for the current year of $31.0m (2007: 80.0m).
• Parent company guarantees for the Group’s obligations under PSC, sales and other contracts.

(2007: $nil). There were no amounts owed to the party at the year end (2007: $nil). During the year the Company disposed of its 
intangible assets to Capricorn Oil Limited, a direct subsidiary, at arm’s length values (refer to Note 16).
37. Prior Year Adjustments
Indian deferred tax liabilities
Deferred tax liabilities relating to India have been restated to reflect the taxable temporary difference that remains at the end  
of the seven-year tax holiday period on the Rajasthan tangible development/producing asset in two of the Group’s subsidiaries. 
Cairn Energy India Pty Limited had recorded deferred tax liabilities to reflect the difference between the net book value of 
development/producing assets and, their tax written down values. However, a liability should only have been created to recognise 
the taxable temporary difference on balances remaining at the end of the tax holiday period since movements in net book values 
and tax written down values during the tax holiday period will have no tax impact. Inconsistencies were also identified between the 
deferred tax calculations of Cairn Energy India Pty Limited and those of the rest of the Group, and these have also been adjusted 
(this also resulted in a restatement at 31 December 2007). 
Cairn Energy Hydrocarbons Limited previously had no recognised deferred tax liability recognised due to the availability of Indian 
tax losses. As these losses will unwind during the tax holiday period, a taxable temporary difference will remain at the end of the  
tax holiday period reflecting the forecast excess of net book values over tax written down values. A deferred tax liability should 
therefore have been recognised.
Fair values on acquisition of subsidiaries
Fair values were assigned to the assets and liabilities of subsidiaries acquired during 2007 . Under IFRS 3, these fair values have been 
reassessed during the period. See note 3 for further details.

Our Global Business Mix
The Systems Integration business, comprising 77% of total revenues, offers 
specialist IT infrastructure solutions across six lines of business – namely – 
Network Integration, which accounts for 59% of the total Systems Integration 
revenues, Converged Communications, Security, Data Centre and Storage, 
Customer Interactive Solutions (CIS) and Microsoft Solutions. These lines of 
business align with the core components of an organisation’s IT infrastructure 
and provide the focus for our technical skills investments. 
Outside our Systems Integration business, there are a number of businesses 
which operate within specific regions, the largest of which are Internet Solutions 
and Plessey in Middle East and Africa and Express Data in Australia. Taken 
together these businesses represent 23% of the Group’s total revenues. 
Systems Integration - Product and Services
Dimension Data offers a full lifecycle of IT services across all our SI lines of 
business, where products and services are sold together as solutions to our 
clients. Within SI Professional Services we consult with the client to select 
and implement the correct IT infrastructure to meet their needs. Professional 
Services revenues were 34% of our overall SI Services revenues. Within SI 
Managed Services, which accounts for 66% of SI Services revenues, Dimension 
Data provides end-to-end support and management of a client’s technology 
environment.  Clients can select the service elements that satisfy their business 
needs – either for the full Managed Service function or on a per process basis.
The revenue in the table above is as reported, whereas the growth rates are calculated before eliminating intercompany 
revenue and adjusted, except in the case of Asia, for the impact of currency movements (i.e. in constant currency).

Integration breakdown Dimension Data Annual Report 2008 4 Chairman’s  
letter
As a start-up, our targeted competitors were industry giants. Today, those giants are both our 
competitors and our peers. Most of our initial clients are still clients today, testament to the 
enduring quality of the solutions and services we provide, as well as an ongoing commitment 
to customer care, satisfaction and relationships. I remain convinced that strong relationships 
are the hallmark of a successful business and continue to value every client as if they were 
our first. 
In 1983 we had a simple vision; we wanted to do great things in what we believed was a 
burgeoning new era in communication and collaboration. Dimension Data chose its sweet 
spot carefully, had the vision to understand the future, and is now a market leader in the field. 
These achievements would not have been possible without a strong core of talented people, 
equipped with the right vision and the technical skills needed to achieve it. We are fortunate 
to have a full spectrum of these people at Dimension Data, many of whom have been with the 
company since the early days. From the onset, we imbued our work with a culture of passion, 
commitment and determination. We decided then that it was crucial, not just to work hard, but 
to enjoy what we do - ideals which prevail unabated and undiluted 25 years on. 
As the Group – and the market – have evolved and matured, so too have our solutions and 
services. Today, the Group’s core Systems Integration business comprises 77% of our annual 
revenue and offers specialist IT infrastructure solutions via Network Integration, Converged 
Communications, Security, Data Centre and Storage, Customer Interactive Solutions and 
Microsoft Solutions. In recent years, clients’ IT sourcing strategies have changed to a best-
in-class mix of in-house and outsourced IT services. Dimension Data anticipated this shift 
and has over the past several years invested in developing a full lifecycle of IT services for our 
clients across our lines of business. 
In 2008, Dimension Data celebrated its 25th year of business. This is a significant 
achievement; few other IT companies have such longevity, they are usually either bought, 
merged or simply fold. It is a source of great pride for me that from such small beginnings 
– a start-up of three determined people – we are now a company of approximately 
11,000 people with offices in 47 different countries across the globe. A turnover of 
close to R300,000 in 1983 has expanded to over US$4.5 billion in 2008, and we are 
recognised by clients and partners alike as a leader in our sector of the market. On the 
back of another year of solid performance, we are pleased to propose to shareholders 
that the Group increase its dividend to 1.7 US cents per share.

Still doing 
great things
Most of our initial clients are still 
clients today, testament to the 
enduring quality of the solutions 
and services we provide, as well 
as an ongoing commitment to 
customer care, satisfaction and 
relationships. Outside our global Systems Integration business, there are a few other businesses that 
operate within specific regions, the largest being Internet Solutions and Plessey in Middle 
East and Africa and Express Data in Australia. Taken together, these businesses and other 
smaller regional businesses represent 23% of the Group’s annual revenue and while not part 
of our globally consistent, core offerings, offer strategic differentiation in the specific regions 
that they operate. 
Our continued investments in our Systems Integration business and other regional businesses 
will reflect the market opportunities we believe are playing out in our regions. Post period 
we completed the acquisition of the remaining 44.9% stake in Datacraft, a company with 
which we have enjoyed a strong and successful partnership for 11 years. Despite the near 
term economic environment, we continue to be bullish in the medium to long term on the 
opportunities throughout Asia and India. 
The current economic climate is both fragile and challenging. During the downturn of the 
early 2000s, it was our industry in the eye of the storm; the IT bubble burst on an industry 
that had over promised and under delivered. It was a difficult time for us; but not only did 
we weather the storm, we emerged stronger. Our business model is now exponentially more 
mature, robust and sustainable because of the challenges we had to face. Furthermore, we 
are fortunate that our offering to the market is of fundamental importance to the majority of 
companies and delivers value through cost savings, operational efficiency improvements and 
productivity gains. I am not saying that we will not feel the effects of this current slowdown 
- we are not immune to the current economic crisis and will, no doubt, be affected. I am 
confident, however, in the inherent health of both our business and the IT industry as a whole. 
To protect this health, we have adopted a very conservative approach and are continually 
monitoring a wide range of parameters within the business. 
A commitment to excellence, over the past 25 years, has shaped Dimension Data into the 
market leading company it is today. The health of our business, coupled with our maturity 
and our agility, will pave the way for tomorrow. It is an ongoing commitment, however, to our 
corporate responsibilities that will help us build a better tomorrow in which to celebrate the 
next 25 years of our business. 
Environmental responsibility has become everybody’s business. It constitutes a critical 
area of opportunity, both in terms of our business and in terms of our future. Through our 
submission to the Carbon Disclosure Project, we have declared our intention to tackle this 
challenge as part of a comprehensive environmental commitment. Our solutions and services 
already feature a range of energy-efficient options for clients. These solutions have been 
readily implemented into our own operations and have afforded significant efficiency and 
productivity improvements. We have, for example, employed the use of visual communication 
Our continued investments in our 
Systems Integration business 
and other regional businesses will 
reflect the market opportunities 
we believe are playing out in our 
regions.

Dimension Data Annual Report 2008 7 Dimension Data Annual Report 2008 8 Overview
The Group’s performance over the past financial year has been excellent, with strong revenue 
growth of 19.5%. We have maintained our gross margin and driven operating profit
(1)
 growth 
of 39.1% to an operating margin of 4.0% - a position that puts us firmly on track to achieve our 
medium term goal of 5% for the Group. The benefits have manifested themselves in significant 
EPS growth of 28.3%. In addition to our improved financial results, our cash generation during 
the period was excellent, driven by disciplined working capital management.
Our strong financial results are testament to the ongoing success of the Group’s strategy, as 
evident in the outstanding rate of Services growth, which hit 19.5% this year. This now reflects 
a compound annual growth rate of 22% over the past three years and is a significant and 
resounding achievement for the Group. 
We achieved growth across all of our businesses. In our largest business, the Systems 
Integration (SI) business, which accounts for 77.1% of revenues and operates in 47 countries 
around the world under the Dimension Data and Datacraft brands, we grew by 18.8%, 
evidencing a growing market share and strengthening competitive position. The performance 
was underscored by the achievement of a number of significant awards. 
Within our regional businesses, Internet Solutions and Plessey, both of which address the 
growing telecommunications sectors in Africa, achieved strong growth. In Express Data, our 
Australian distribution business, the rate of growth was more muted. 
Strong geographic performances in all regions reflect the improving robustness of our 
business model. Accelerated revenue growth was evident in all regions, but the emerging 
markets of Asia and Middle East and Africa led the Group with outstanding revenue growth 
of 23.9% and 27.1%, respectively. Operating profit improved across all geographies, with an 
exceptional improvement of 108.5% in Europe. Australia and Middle East and Africa posted 
particularly healthy improvements in their operating margins.

Chief Executive  
Officer’s review continued
The Group has enjoyed robust growth over the past few years and even in the current market 
conditions there are still a number of key areas within which clients are willing, and continuing, 
to invest. We continue to see our clients’ sourcing strategies evolve and believe that the 
present market conditions will prove particularly conducive to the benefits of Multisourcing, 
whereby clients can outsource specific elements of their IT environment to ‘best-of-breed’ 
IT service providers while retaining other IT functions in-house. Over the past few years, we 
have been investing in positioning ourselves for these opportunities and, during the period, 
we have started to see signs of early wins across several geographies and are optimistic of 
future growth opportunities. 
Deploying technology which can drive cost reduction opportunities for our clients is currently 
a real opportunity for Dimension Data. During FY2008 we have developed and introduced 
a number of services that play to this focus, including ITSM, performance optimisation, 
virtualisation and power and cooling assessment services, all of which are gaining 
market traction. Likewise, data centre consolidation, technology refresh projects, security 
consolidation and server and storage virtualisation remain strong drivers in the move towards 
cost and capacity optimisation and the focus of significant market interest. In addition, many 
of these cost saving technologies require network re-architecture and optimisation; a fast and 
long-lasting return on investment makes them a priority investment for many clients. Over and 
above network investment being a pre-requisite for a myriad of cost saving technologies, the 
network itself remains an integral, mission critical component for the majority of enterprises. 
Security is proving to be equally insulated from budgetary caution; businesses simply cannot 
afford to have security breaches, data leaks and compliance failures. Companies may now be 
forced to make breaches public and explain their redress, a costly exercise in both monetary 
and reputational terms. Compliance can actually prove to be a business pre-requisite, 
particularly in the retail industry, and will often unlock IT spend with considerable speed. 
Security is the fastest growing line of business year on year within Dimension Data and we 
envisage continued market opportunities going forward. 
The push for increased operational efficiencies, cost reductions and environmental responsibility 
has also spawned a substantial client interest in the capabilities of visual communications 
technologies. These technologies reduce the need to outlay expensive travel and time 
resources, as well as minimising environmental impact, and have demonstrated tremendous 
growth. 
The successful execution of our business strategy – driving profitable growth, offering a 
world class client experience, delivering operational excellence to our clients, and investing 
in our people and culture – is clearly paying dividends. The recognition that the Group has 
received from its clients, vendors and employees, coupled with a proven ability to meet our 
commitments to all three, provides us with confidence as we head into less certain economic 
times.
We continue to see our clients’ 
sourcing strategies evolve and 
believe that the present market 
conditions will prove particularly 
conducive to the benefits of 
Multisourcing, whereby clients 
can outsource specific elements 
of their IT environment to ‘best-
of-breed’ IT service providers 
while retaining other IT functions 
in-house. 
The Group has enjoyed robust 
growth over the past few 
years and even in the current 
market conditions there are still 
a number of key areas within 
which clients are willing, and 
continuing, to invest.  Dimension Data Annual Report 2008 11
Strengthening our position
We regard our clients, our people and our partners as the barometers by which we measure 
our operational performance - an approach that continues to be a cornerstone of the 
Group’s success. Dimension Data currently holds a significant number of partner awards, 
an achievement which underscores our partners’ recognition of the breadth of our technical 
expertise and experience. We are particularly proud of our recent positioning, by leading 
industry analyst Gartner
1
, in their Magic Quadrant for Managed and Professional Network 
Service Providers, Worldwide, Eric Goodness et.al. 22 August 2008
2
, which examined  
14 vendors of IT services for business communication systems worldwide. We believe the 
recognition of our ability to execute and completeness of vision is testament to the Group’s 
commitment to delivering operational excellence to our clients, and proves that we are 
firmly on track with the execution and delivery of our Services strategy within the Systems 
Integration business. Our extensive experience providing integrated unified communications 
solutions has also garnered us strong recognition from the industry. 
The Group has always articulated the pivotal importance of investing in our employees. 
We strongly believe that our people are, and must continue to be, a key differentiator for 
the business. In enabling, developing and retaining excellence in our people we are able to 
pass the benefits of these attributes on to our clients. Our continued investments in training 
and development have earned industry recognition, specifically for our Internet Protocol 
Technology (IPT) initiatives. 
Our annual employee satisfaction survey shows its fourth year of improvement, and the 
retention of senior leadership within the Group is particularly strong, with an attrition of just 
4%. The past year has seen continued focus on expanding our employees’ accreditations 
across the board; we now hold almost 2,000 Microsoft certifications and well over a thousand 
Information Technology Information Library (ITIL) certifications. We have also increased our 
Cisco certifications by 20% over the past year, which now include 6 Master Certifications and 
295 CCIEs.
The Group’s improved financial performance comes against a backdrop of ongoing investment 
across the Systems Integration business, which will enable us to build for further future 
success. To achieve service delivery excellence and to improve the client experience across 
the services lifecycle, we have made systems, people and process related investments. To 
improve the integration and efficiency of our Global Services Operating Architecture (GSOA) 
we are in the process of implementing a globally consistent IT service management platform 
to enhance service delivery to our clients, create new revenue generating opportunities for the 
Group and improve our operational and cost efficiency.

We have invested in a Group wide re-launch of Uptime, our maintenance service offering. We 
have introduced a new standard platform, systems and process for this offering in order to sell 
Uptime more profitably, increase contract revenue, reduce price churn and, at the same time, 
improve our client’s experience. Our Uptime service is an annuity revenue stream and success 
here improves the resilience of our business model. The Group has also invested in a Services 
International Project Office to accelerate and co-ordinate our response to global opportunities. 
We are driving towards total alignment with ITIL, an industry best practice framework for IT 
service delivery, across our services offerings. 
In addition to investment in the consistency of our operational delivery, we have also made 
investments in our go to market offerings to help orientate the business to a more services led 
approach. Our Secure Network Infrastructure Assessment (SNIA) identifies which hardware 
and software is in, or approaching, end-of-support and gives organisations the opportunity 
to update and standardise technology to ensure manufacturer support. This consultative 
approach can also help us identify further opportunities for infrastructure improvement within 
the organisation. Our Unified Communications Development Model (UCDM), which assists 
clients in building a strategic and operational roadmap to implement a unified communications 
strategy, has received significant industry and client recognition and helped enhance our 
reputation and credibility across our client base as thought leaders. 
We have seen similar strong interest and lead opportunities in our IT Service Management 
(ITSM) offering, which is a methodology driven, consultative approach to mapping service 
maturity. To address the business critical importance of network performance we developed 
the Network Performance Optimisation Assessment, which enables enterprises to extract 
maximum value and efficiency from their network. Our Power and Cooling Assessment has 
been developed to help organisations reduce their power requirements by optimising their 
infrastructure. In an era of spiralling energy and fuel costs, as well as increased environmental 
concerns and obligations, this service addresses yet another facet of our clients’ cost 
reduction objectives. Together with our existing services, these newer initiatives demonstrate 
the evolution of the Group’s offerings to meet emerging and changing market trends. 
The service provider market - which incorporates telecommunications providers, mobile 
operators, internet service providers (ISPs) and cable operators – represents roughly 26% 
of the Group’s revenue. The Systems Integration arm of the Dimension Data business is 
well positioned in this vertical and has ample opportunity to assist service providers in the 
deployment and ongoing management of their IT infrastructure. 
In addition to our Systems Integration offerings, the Group has exposure to the service 
provider market in Middle East and Africa through Plessey and Internet Solutions. Across 
the continent, the demand for access to telecommunication services is accelerating. Plessey 
The service provider 
market - which incorporates 
telecommunications providers, 
mobile operators, Internet service 
providers (ISPs) and cable 
operators – represents roughly 
26% of the Group’s revenue. Dimension Data Annual Report 2008 13
is strongly positioned to take advantage of the growth opportunities as their offerings are 
focused at telecommunication infrastructure solutions. Internet Solutions is a next generation 
communications provider that is particularly well positioned in South Africa and, as markets 
continue to deregulate and expand, increasingly positioned across the continent. We believe 
the business is strategically well placed within this evolving environment and, consequently, 
we have been investing and enhancing our offerings and capabilities. 
Outlook 
Over the last few years we have enjoyed tremendous momentum and consistent improvement 
as a business. The growth achieved has consistently been at rates greater than the market, 
indicating that we have been building our competitive strength and gaining market share from 
the competition. We believe that the long term fundamentals of the IT market segments in 
which we compete remain favourable and have good growth prospects. 
The FY2008 performance has been delivered against a weakening macro-economic 
environment. Despite the evident health, strength and ongoing improvement of our business, 
the current macro-economic conditions are a lot less favourable than before, and we expect 
that they will remain both fragile and uncertain for several quarters. Currency swings and the 
strength of the US dollar against most of our operating currencies are also likely to impact our 
reported results in the FY2009 financial year.
The global crisis of confidence which started in the financial markets is now undermining 
demand in most industries. Within this environment we expect the IT infrastructure market 
to be slower in general and that we will be affected accordingly. To counter the impact of 
these circumstances we will be prioritising our client engagement above all else and have 
implemented a conservative plan to manage our overhead base. We have tightened our 
investment and expenditure programme to match our view of short term market conditions 
and will continue to re-evaluate and adjust these on an ongoing basis. Our focus over the next 
six months will be on securing opportunities available in the market. We will balance this with 
a prudent expenditure and investment profile and tight cash management. 
The strength of the Group’s balance sheet, our market leading positioning and offerings, and 
our expansive geographic footprint provide us with confidence that we will successfully endure 
this market downturn and emerge in an enhanced competitive position.

Chief Financial Officer’s  
operating review
Dave Sherriffs
In the review below, growth rates are in relation to FY2007 and, unless otherwise indicated, are calculated before 
eliminating intercompany revenue, are adjusted for the disposal of the Swedish operations in the prior year and, 
except in the case of Datacraft Asia, are adjusted for the impact of currency movements (i.e. are constant currency 
growth rates).
Income statement summary
Revenue for the year was $4,511 million, an increase of 16.9%. Revenue from Asia and Middle 
East and Africa, and overall Services growth, were exceptional. Across the businesses, trading 
was particularly strong in Systems Integration (trading as Datacraft in Asia and as Dimension 
Data elsewhere), in Internet Solutions and in Plessey, with revenue growth of 18.8%, 30.1% 
and 17.3% respectively.
Gross profit for the period was $973.3 million, up 17.0%, reflecting a 0.2% improvement in 
gross margin to 21.6%. Both Product and Services margins were firmer, while an improved 
Services to Product mix also contributed to the growth.
Overheads grew by 13.3%, well below revenue, to $791.1 million. Of this, variable overheads 
(including bonuses and sales commission) were up by 18.9% to $143.3 million while fixed 
overheads grew by 10.8% to $647.8 million. 
Operating profit was strongly up on last year to $182.2 million - a year on year increase of 
39.1% - and operating margin improved from 3.5% to 4.0%.
The share of results from associates increased to $7.1 million from $5.7 million, while net 
interest costs reduced to $13.5 million, $1.4 million less than the prior period.
Property revaluation and other gains and losses include a gain on revaluation of the investment 
portion of the Campus property asset of $8.5 million (2007: $22.2 million).
The Group tax charge was $48.0 million, an effective tax rate on profit before tax of 25.9% 
(2007: 25.9%), excluding exceptional items. The Group continued to benefit in certain 
jurisdictions from significant assessed losses carried forward.

Trading and operations
Group Businesses
Systems Integration (Dimension Data and Datacraft)
The Systems Integration business, operating in 47 countries on five different continents, 
incorporates six lines of business: Network Integration, Converged Communications, Security, 
Customer Interactive Solutions (CIS), Data Centre and Storage (DCS) and Microsoft Solutions. 
Across these lines of business, we have developed a full lifecycle of services.
Network Integration (which accounts for 59.2% of total Systems Integration revenues) grew 
by 20.4%, another year of increasing market share for the Group. The network today plays 
an essential role in enabling business to operate and compete, and our vision of the network 
becoming the platform for all forms of communication is being realised. We saw growth from 
infrastructure refresh opportunities, and from projects that support clients’ business objectives 
around cost reduction, operational efficiency and improved customer service. Strong demand 
for unified communications (including voice and video solutions) resulted in upgrades in 
the core connectivity fabric. Similarly, an increasingly mobile workforce’s expectations for 
‘anywhere accessibility’ drove investment in wireless networks. We also saw growth in virtual 
private networks, network security, performance optimisation and operational services.
The demand for unified communications also supported our Converged Communications 
business, which grew by 22.4%. This business includes the Group’s IP telephony and visual 
communications solutions. Strong growth in video conferencing was driven by environmental 
concerns as well as ongoing pressure on travel costs. Opportunities in this business stem from 
our leadership in global IP networking and solid relationships with key unified communications 
partners, including Cisco, Tandberg and Microsoft. 
Concerns over data breaches extend into all areas of infrastructure – the network, perimeter, 
endpoints, applications and data in transit. Our Security line of business grew by 31.6%, as 
clients looked to implement multi-vendor solutions within a fragmented technology landscape 
and an environment of both increasing security breaches and evolving regulatory compliance 
requirements. 
The Microsoft Solutions business grew by 25.5%. This growth was supported by a services-
led approach to software procurement and deployment, in which we helped clients create

The Systems Integration 
business, operating in

Data Centre and Storage and 
Microsoft Solutions.  structured roadmaps to improve their Microsoft infrastructure while lowering software and 
operational costs. The need for a robust deployment and management strategy is critical as 
clients take advantage of Microsoft unified communications technologies.
The DCS line of business grew by 2.0%, impacted by a few large deals in the prior year which 
did not repeat. Clients continued to employ virtualisation and consolidation technologies to 
optimise performance, eliminate costs and improve energy efficiencies. Expanding data traffic, 
as well as increasing regulatory compliance requirements also supported demand for storage, 
backup and recovery solutions.
Growth in CIS of 1.5% was muted as a result of the loss of a large outsourced CIS contract 
in Australia. The line of business in that region has realigned its sales effort, and expects to 
record an improved outcome in the new year. The fundamental drivers for this line of business, 
which offers a range of contact centre solutions, remain sound. The call centre is a network 
super-user and as contact centres move away from distributed physical locations to virtualised 
single centres, there is a need for new technologies and management practices.

50 Product
Product revenues in the Systems Integration business grew by a robust 18.7% - well ahead 
of the market. The business offers a complete lifecycle of services, and product procurement 
is a key component of the overall solution to clients. An essential component of our value 
proposition is the established long term relationships the Group enjoys with the leading global 
technology vendors across all of its lines of business. The growth for the period was supported 
by our ongoing investment in our supply chain services, incorporating procurement, freight 
and the complex cross-border logistics between source and destination. 
Services
Services in the Systems Integration business demonstrated strong growth of 18.9%, evidence 
that our Services strategy is firmly on track. This growth reflects our ongoing focus on skills 
management, reducing staff churn and increasing our technical certifications, as well as a 
focus on improved global project delivery.
Professional Services growth of 16.3% reflects a continued focus on the consulting, planning, 
deployment and integration components of our Services continuum - expanding our offerings 
across the lines of business - with a focus on repeatable methodologies embedded with 
intellectual property and tools. 
Managed Services revenues, comprising support and managed services, grew by 20.4%. 
An emphasis on service levels contributed to the growth in the Uptime branded maintenance 
service offering, while investments in Managed Services solutions and capabilities saw a 
healthy return. Regional solutions, incubated in specific geographies, produced excellent 
returns.

Product revenues in the Systems 
Integration business grew by a 
robust 18.7% - well ahead of the 
market. Internet Solutions 
Internet Solutions is an African next generation services provider. Revenue growth for the 
period was strong, up 30.1% on the prior year. Gross margins reduced slightly, reflecting 
increased competition in the South African market. Originally an Internet Services Provider 
(ISP), the division now operates ten business units enabling clients to outsource the 
operations and management of their telecommunications, internet, data and voice services. Its 
core offerings relate to the provision of internet and network connectivity and include: access 
services, virtual private network (VPN) services, broadband services, Voice over IP (VoIP) 
services and application hosting. Internet Solutions provides connectivity services to many of 
the biggest companies in South Africa, as well as an expanding number of businesses and 
consumers across the African continent. 
Plessey
Plessey demonstrated another year of robust growth, with revenues up 17.3%. Plessey 
has regional offices in 12 African countries, providing telecommunications infrastructure 
solutions across the continent. An ongoing requirement from service providers looking 
to deploy high speed, multi-media networks supported demand for Plessey’s physical 
infrastructure and support services. Plessey’s offerings include the construction of core base 
station infrastructure, wireless, optical fibre, satellite and microwave solutions and managed 
services. 
Growth was strong in GSM infrastructure rollout in Ghana, Uganda and the Democratic 
Republic of Congo, while in South Africa there was a significant increase in fibre deployment 
revenues as deregulation and self-provisioning in the service provider market continued 
apace. 
Express Data
Express Data grew by 4.2% over the period, the strength of the Australian dollar for the 
majority of the year having depressed revenue growth, with price reductions of around 10% 
across most technologies. Express Data is a distributor of IT products in Australia and New 
Zealand, having represented many of the world’s leading technology vendors for the past 
twenty years. It provides a value added service to business-focused technology vendors with 
high levels of complexity. Express Data’s key vendor partnerships are deep and longstanding, 
and the division is the dominant channel to market for many of these vendors’ products. 
Other
The Group operates several other smaller businesses, including Dimension Data Advanced 
Infrastructure and Merchants, the outsourced call centre business, both operating in South 
Africa and the UK. Dimension Data Advanced Infrastructure in South Africa performed very 
well, as South Africa’s power shortages earlier in the year increased demand for power 
generation solutions. Merchants in the UK had a weaker year, largely as a result of some 
property lease write-offs and restructuring initiatives. 
The revenue, gross margin and operating profit in the tables below are as reported, whereas the growth rates 
are calculated before eliminating intercompany revenue, adjusting for the disposal of the Swedish operations in 
the prior year and adjusted, except in the case of Asia, for the impact of currency movements (i.e. in constant 
currency).

Regional performance
Americas
Revenue in the Americas region grew by 17.5%, although gross margins were lower. Product 
revenues were solid, as the Network Integration and Security lines of business recorded 
good growth. Professional Services revenue exceeded expectations, as the region leveraged 
its capabilities in large-scale multinational deployments and project management. The US 
operations continued to invest in its staff augmentation capabilities and in extending its 
Multisourcing capabilities.
Ongoing investment in standardising the region’s operating environment contributed to a 
significant improvement in the working capital position from the interim period.
While our US operations had a satisfactory year, we were not immune to the credit crisis 
affecting the financial sector and revenues and order rates were softer towards the end of 
the period. Outside of the US, the Mexican operations performed well, while the Brazilian 
operations made a good recovery in the second half after a disappointing loss in the first half. 
Asia
Datacraft Asia recorded an excellent operating result, with revenues up 23.9% and operating 
profit of $44.2 million (2007: $36.5 million). Growth was supported by strong showings from 
Network Integration, Security, Converged Communications and DCS. CIS growth was slower, 
influenced by a slowdown in volumes from BPO clients in India. 
Services growth was robust, with good demand for Uptime maintenance services, as well as 
product-led Professional Services engagements. The region continued to invest in improving 
its services capabilities, extending its ITIL framework and ensuring ISO 20000 compliance for 
its Global Services Centre in Bangalore.
During the period, Datacraft acquired Security-Assessment.com, a security consulting practice 
based in New Zealand, with competencies in security audits, assurance, assessment and 
advisory.
Australia
The Australian operations grew revenues by 12.3% for the period, with operating profit 
expanding strongly to $40.4 million, and operating margin to 4.1%. 
The Systems Integration business had an excellent year, growing revenues by 17.0%, 
supported by strong performances from the Network Integration, Security and Microsoft 
Solutions lines of business. In Managed Services, a focus on renewals and winning new clients 
contributed to healthy revenue growth. The business was somewhat impacted by project 
delays incurred through the change in Federal government during the period, but significant 
market consolidation provided opportunities for market share expansion. The business also 
continued to invest in productivity tools, contributing to the operating margin expansion for 
the year.

Learning Solutions, the training business, also had a good year, expanding revenues by 9.3%. 
As described above, Express Data grew revenues by 4.2%.
The region made two small acquisitions; a majority interest in Viiew, a Melbourne based 
recruitment firm, and the remaining minority interest in SQL, which provides database 
managed services. 
Europe
Europe reported a much improved performance for the year. Total revenues were up by 
10.1%, with Services revenues up by 13.8%. Overhead growth was contained, and operating 
profit expanded to $21.9 million compared to $8.5 million in the previous year. 
The Systems Integration business performed very well, with good contributions from the UK, 
Germany, France and the Benelux countries. Ongoing efforts to standardise processes, as 
well as inherent leverage in the operating model, contributed to the improved performance.  
Within the lines of business, Security and Converged Communications growth was particularly 
strong.
In the region’s other businesses, Dimension Data Advanced Infrastructure performed well 
despite a difficult trading environment, while Merchants UK had a weaker year (as discussed 
previously).
Middle East and Africa
The Middle East and Africa region remained the largest contributor to Group operating profit, 
with revenues up by 27.1% and operating profit expanding to $88.4 million.
The Systems Integration business had a strong year, with revenues up by 32.4% supported 
by strong growth across most lines of business. The Managed Services operations were solid, 
and Professional Services coupled revenue growth with increased gross margin on the back 
of improved project profitability. The region’s outsourcing business also performed well, with 
low client turnover and improved revenues in its existing client base.
The strong performance came despite economic volatility in South Africa which affected 
enterprise spending, particularly in the financial and retail sectors. However, public sector 
spending was strong, especially in the lead up to the 2010 FIFA World Cup, and the Group 
won contracts to provide IT services to five new stadiums for the 2010 event.
Expansion into the rest of the African continent and the Middle East continued during the 
period, where revenues were up by 121.8%. The Group acquired the remaining 49% interest 
in Dimension Data Kenya. In the Middle East, we acquired Data Processing Systems in Dubai 
and Abu Dhabi, and established a presence in Saudi Arabia. 
As described above, Plessey, Internet Solutions and DDAI all reported strong performances 
for the year. Merchants in South Africa had a better year, having resolved some of the 
performance issues arising on client contracts in the previous period.
The equity participation of our Black Economic Empowerment partners increased to 
approximately 16%, as a result of the robust regional performance for the year.

Central and Other
In Central and Other, net costs increased by 2.7% from $31.4 million to $32.3 million. 
Within this, the contribution from the Campus property was up by 11.6% for the period to  
$15.3 million, with near full occupation. Central management costs, net of trading income, 
increased by 9.1% to $47.6 million. Apart from the normal holding company costs, the 
Group continued to invest in the Systems Integration business’s services and line of business 
strategies, and in the standardisation of Group-wide systems and processes. 
Share of profit of associates
The share of profit of associates increased to $7.1 million from $5.7 million in 2007. 
Britehouse was the largest contributor with $4.1 million. Britehouse houses various application 
development operations and an IT resourcing business.
Interest income and finance costs
The Group earned interest of $17.5 million (2007: $15.4 million) on its cash holdings.  
Total finance costs were $31.0 million (2007: $30.3 million), including $22.6 million  
(2007: $23.4 million) in respect of the capitalised property finance lease in South Africa.
Property revaluation and other gains and losses
Included in property revaluation and other gains and losses is an $8.5 million  
(2007: $22.2 million) gain on revaluation of the investment portion of the Campus property 
asset in South Africa, based on the Directors’ assessment of fair value at 30 September 2008 
and verified by an external valuator.
Minority interests
Based on the results for the year, approximately 1.8% economic interest in a portion of 
the Group’s business in Middle East and Africa vested at period end in favour of our Black 
Economic Empowerment partners, bringing their total interest up to approximately 16%. 
Acquisitions and disposals
During the period, the Group concluded a few small acquisitions, none of which was material. 
In Asia we acquired a security practice in New Zealand. In Australia, we acquired Viiew, an IT 
recruitment and resourcing company, and the remaining minority interest in SQL Services, a 
provider of database managed services. In the Middle East and Africa we acquired Accelon, 
a broadband service provider operating in Nigeria and in Ghana and we acquired DPS, a 
network integration company in Dubai. 
Automate, a software development company providing solutions to the automotive industry, 
was sold to Britehouse during the period.
Subsequent to year end, we completed the acquisition of the outstanding minorities in 
Datacraft Asia for a total consideration of $276 million. Dimension Data Annual Report 2008 25
Balance sheet
The Group exited the year with an improved and strengthened balance sheet position, with 
equity attributable to equity shareholders of the parent increasing to $710.2 million from 
$561.9 million. This reflected the improved profitability of the Group for the period, as well 
as the issue of 136,121,909 new shares associated with the acquisition subsequent to year 
end of the outstanding minorities in Datacraft Asia. Datacraft Asia was a fully consolidated 
subsidiary at year end, although the payment of the cash consideration and other adjustments 
to the assets and liabilities reflecting the acquisition of the minority interests will only be 
reported in the interim balance sheet at 31 March 2009.
Fixed assets include the Campus property asset in South Africa, which was revalued at the 
end of the year, resulting in a revaluation gain through the income statement of $8.5 million in 
respect of the portion of the Campus accounted for as an investment property.
Total current assets, excluding cash, at year end were $1,241.4 million  
(2007: $1,196.2 million) and total current liabilities were $1,360.6 million (2007: $1.245.4 
million). Cash generated from a reduction in the Group’s net investment in working capital 
amounted to $79.2 million for the period.
Obligations under finance leases amounted to $139.9 million (2007: $149.9 million). Of this 
$123.9 million (2007: $144.9 million) related to the Campus finance lease obligation. The fair 
value of this lease obligation was estimated at $162.7 million (2007: $201.1 million) at balance 
sheet date. Other long term liabilities include deferred income relating to client maintenance 
contracts of $24.1 million (2007: $8.1 million).
The cash balance at 30 September 2008, net of bank overdrafts, was $682.4 million. 
Cash flow
Net cash from operating activities was $273.6 million (2007: $177.1 million). An inflow arising 
from net working capital movements of $79.2 million was the result of very good collections at 
period end, a continued focus on inventory management, as well as the resolution of certain 
working capital issues which were highlighted at the interim period. There were no changes 
in our trading terms with vendors.
The Group used $82.2 million in investing activities (2007: $57.9 million). The most 
significant investment was in respect of capital expenditure on intangibles of $13.3 million  
(2007: $6.3 million) and property, plant and equipment (net of disposals) of $77.8 million 
(2007: $59.7 million). The biggest increase came from South Africa, where Internet Solutions 
invested in its network as a consequence of growth in its client base, increasing its hosting 
capacity and in upgrading its voice capabilities. Dimension Data in South Africa refreshed its 
network, invested in power generation facilities at the Campus to support increased demand 
and in land adjacent to the Campus to be used for future expansion. In addition, Merchants in 
the UK invested in the establishment of a stand-alone IP call centre hosting capability. 
Towards the end of the period, the Group also invested in some licensed software in 
anticipation of an upgrade of its services operating architecture. Chief Financial Officer’s

was raised on the issue of new shares to fund the acquisition of the remaining shares in 
Datacraft Asia. In addition, the Group paid a dividend of $22.8 million (2007: $15.2 million). 
Subsequent to year end, a total cash consideration of $276 million will be paid out to minority 
shareholders in Datacraft Asia.
Principal risks and uncertainties
In terms of the UK Companies Act 1985, a description of the principal risks and uncertainties 
facing the Group is required. The Group’s Risk Management process is detailed in the 
Corporate Governance report. Set out below are some of the factors which could have 
an impact on the Group’s long term performance. These should not be regarded as a 
comprehensive range of all potential risks and uncertainties facing the Group. 
Exposure to economic downturn
A significant portion of the Group’s revenue is derived from clients in the Financial Services 
sector which has been impacted by the global credit crisis. The Group also derives a significant 
portion of revenues from the Telecommunications sector, and from multinational corporations. 
To the extent that economic downturn or recession impacts our clients in these sectors, and 
their willingness to invest in the Group’s IT solutions, the Group could be exposed to a lower 
level of revenue, and potentially the requirement to reduce its cost base. 
A mitigating factor is that many of the Group’s solutions are mission critical to clients, and 
these solutions are used to reduce costs and improve their productivity. The Group monitors 
demand for its products and services carefully, to ensure that its cost base is aligned to its 
revenues.

Dependency on key vendors or disruption of key vendor relationships
The Group has close and mutually beneficial partnerships with leading technology vendors, 
enabling it to provide its clients with the most advanced and flexible technology solutions.  
The Group’s relationship with these key vendors is important to its continued success.
Termination of a supply or services agreement or a significant change in vendor terms or 
conditions of sale could negatively affect our operating margins, revenue or the level of 
capital required to fund our operations. While the Group has multiple vendor relationships 
with leading global and regional technology vendors, the most significant vendor relationship 
measured by volume of purchases is with Cisco Systems.
Factors mitigating the risk are the fact that the Group’s geographic footprint, global 
procurement and logistics capabilities, and long standing local client relationships make it an 
important channel to market for its partners, and there is a mutual dependency on promoting 
stable and long term relationships. Equally, the Group invests substantial time and resource in 
promoting and managing its partner relationships at every level within the organisation.
Exposure to country and regional risk (political and economic)
The Group is present in 47 countries, and thus is subject to differing political, social, economic 
and market conditions. Particular aspects of country-specific risks that may have an impact 
include changes to government policies, laws and regulations, including taxation.
We mitigate these risks by having a balanced global footprint between emerging markets 
and established markets, as well as by developing and retaining strong local and global 
management capability.
Dependence on major clients and contracts
A significant portion of the Group’s revenue is generated from longer term contracts and 
agreements with clients, and therefore the Group would be exposed if these agreements 
were not to be renewed. However, no single client accounts for more than 5% of the 
Group’s revenue and therefore the risk of the loss of an individual client is considered to be 
contained.
People retention
Failure to retain and recruit key personnel could harm our ability to meet key objectives.
A key aspect of the Group’s strategy is to provide an outstanding employment experience 
that attracts high quality employees and offers them the opportunity to grow personally and 
professionally. The Group has a comprehensive programme to ensure employee retention, 
including: promotion and support of career development, a structured approach to employee 
incentives, consistency in reward and recognition, and effective communication with 
employees around the execution of strategy.
Professional liability (execution and delivery)
The design, support, and project management nature of most client engagements requires 
the application of high standards of process control, compliance and delivery ability. If the 
client’s service level expectations are not met, the Group’s reputation could be damaged and 
profitability impacted through the increased risk of litigation and damages. The Group could 
also be required to provide corrective services to clients at no charge.  Chief Financial Officer’s 
operating review continued
Dimension Data Annual Report 2008 28
The Group continues to invest in ensuring quality and rigour in its deal qualification, delivery 
and project management processes. The Group also carries comprehensive general and 
professional liability insurance coverage.
Increasing complexity and variability of client contracts
With the Group’s global presence, it is in a position to win an increasing number of contracts 
with multinational clients. These contracts are often logistically complex, requiring cross 
border co-operation and co-ordination. Furthermore, the Group is investing in its management 
and outsourcing capabilities, and contracts entered into in this market typically involve more 
complex delivery and service level obligations. 
The Group continues to invest in bid, project and commercial management capabilities to 
oversee the implementation of contracts both globally and locally. In addition, the Group 
constantly adapts and changes its project management methodology in line with best 
practice. 
Business continuity risk
The ability to provide our clients with a seamless, high level of service is a critical element of 
the Group’s service offering. In particular, a large element of the Group’s managed service 
revenues depends on remote infrastructure management, which in turn depends on resilient 
systems and internal IT infrastructure. 
The Group has an ongoing business continuity programme to address this risk, and to ensure 
that alternative solutions are in place to adapt to any unforeseen disruption to critical business 
processes.
Regulatory compliance risks – in particular taxation and transfer 
pricing
The Group operates in 47 different countries, increasing the breadth and complexity of 
compliance with regulatory requirements in a variety of different jurisdictions. Furthermore, 
there is an increasing scrutiny of and need to demonstrate regulatory compliance. Accordingly, 
the Group needs to ensure that the various compliance risks are understood and effectively 
managed.
The Group acknowledges the importance of compliance with all regulatory requirements in 
the territories within which it operates, and continues to invest in the people and processes to 
effectively manage this obligation. Dimension Data Annual Report 2008 29
Balance sheet risk and financial instruments
The principal risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are liquidity risk, credit risk and currency 
risk. Liquidity risk concerns the Group’s ability to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. This risk is 
managed through a combination of careful working capital management and investment decisions, the use 
of working capital facilities, as well as the maintenance of a strong net cash position.
Credit risk is the risk of default by a counter party on its obligations to the Group, the most important of 
which relates to trade receivables. While there is heightened risk as a result of the global credit crisis and 
likely economic downturn, the Group continues to manage the credit profile of its trade receivables very 
closely, and to provide for likely impairment where necessary.
The Group reports in US dollars, and currency risk is the risk of material negative impact on earnings as a 
result of currency fluctuations. While the Group hedges its exposure to financial instruments denominated 
in currencies other than the trading currencies of the entities to which the instruments relate, it does not 
hedge its earnings. Since the majority of the Group’s earnings are in currencies other than the US dollar, 
currency fluctuations will impact reported Group earnings. In particular, if the US dollar strengthens against 
the Group’s major trading currencies – South African rand, Australian dollar, Sterling or Euro – this will 
reduce translated US dollar earnings.

POST BALANCE SHEET EVENTS
On 15 October 2008 the Datacraft Asia (‘Datacraft’)

Authorised share capital
The authorised share capital of the Company is £50,000,
divided into 50,000 deferred shares of £1 each, and $30 million,
divided into 3 billion ordinary shares of 1US cent each. 
The holders of the deferred shares have no right to receive
notice of any general meeting of the Company, nor the right to
attend, speak or vote at such general meetings. The deferred
shares have no rights to dividends and on a return of assets in
a winding-up entitle the holder to the repayment of the amounts
paid on the deferred shares after repayment of the capital paid
up on the ordinary shares plus the payment of $10 million per
ordinary share.
Issued share capital
As at 30 September 2008, the Company's issued share capital
was 50,000 deferred shares of £1 each (comprising 0.003% 
of the issued shares and 1,694,459,681 ordinary shares of
1 US cent each (comprising 99.997% of the issued shares).
During the year ended 30 September 2008, options were
exercised pursuant to the Company’s share incentive
schemes, resulting in the allotment of 6,738,601 new ordinary
shares. No further new ordinary shares have been allotted
under these schemes since the end of the financial year to the
date of this report.
136,121,909 shares were issued in order to purchase the
minorities in Datacraft. Further details of the share issue are set
out in Note 23.
The Company has a current authority to purchase up to
77,579,900 of its ordinary shares (being 5% of the issued share
capital as at 30 September 2007) in the market, either for
cancellation or to hold as treasury shares. During the year the
Company did not purchase any shares, however the Employee
Share Trust acquired 30,183,055 shares during the period.
Rights and restrictions attaching to shares
Under the Company’s Articles of Association, holders of
ordinary shares are entitled to participate in the payment of
dividends pro rata to their holding. The Board may propose and
pay interim dividends and recommend a final dividend in
respect of any accounting period, out of profits available for
distribution under English law. A final dividend may be declared
by the shareholders in general meeting by ordinary resolution,
but no dividend may be declared in excess of the amount
recommended by the Board. 
At any general meeting a resolution put to the vote shall be
decided on a show of hands unless a poll is properly
demanded. On a show of hands every member who is present
in person or by proxy shall have one vote. On a poll every
member who is present in person or by proxy shall have one
vote for every ordinary share of which they are the holder.
No person holds securities in the Company carrying special
rights with regard to control of the Company. The Company is
not aware of any agreements between holders of securities
that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or
voting rights.
Restrictions on transfer of shares
The Company’s Articles of Association allow Directors, in their
absolute discretion, to refuse to register the transfer of a share
in certificated form which is not fully paid. They may also refuse
to register a transfer of a share in certificated form unless the
usual form of transfer is lodged, duly stamped, at the registered
office of the Company or at such other place as the Directors
may appoint and is accompanied by the share certificate to
which the transfer relates and such other evidence as the
Directors may reasonably require to show the right of the
transferor to make the transfer.
The Directors may refuse to register a transfer of a share in
uncertificated form in any case where the Company is entitled
to refuse (or is excepted from the requirement) under the
Uncertificated Securities Regulations to register the transfer.
The Directors may also refuse to register any transfer in favour
of more than four transferees.
The Company has irrevocable authority at any time to appoint
any person to execute on behalf of the holders of the deferred
shares a transfer of the deferred shares of an agreement to
transfer and/or to acquire the deferred shares (in accordance
with the provisions of the Companies Acts and subject to the
minimum capital requirements contained in the Companies
Acts), and without making any payment to or obtaining the
sanction of the holders of the deferred shares, to such persons

2009 to Friday, 13 February 2009 (both dates inclusive).
POWERS OF DIRECTORS
The Directors have the power to manage the business of the
Company, subject to the provisions of the Companies Act, the
Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Company, and
to any directions given by special resolution, including the
Company’s power to purchase its own shares. The Company’s
Articles of Association may only be amended by a special
resolution of the Company’s shareholders.
CHANGE OF CONTROL
The Group’s share incentive schemes contain provisions relating
to a change of control. Outstanding options under the share
option schemes would normally vest and become exercisable
on a change of control. Outstanding grants under the Long
Term Incentive Plan and Share Appreciation Rights Scheme
would normally become exercisable on a change of control
subject to the satisfaction of any performance conditions at that
time and pro rata to the proportion of the performance period
that has expired.
Some of the contracts that the Company has entered into with
its clients and vendors contain provisions that entitle, but not
oblige, the other party to terminate the specific contract in the
event of a change of control. Most of these provisions are
further restricted to instances where the change of control is to
a competitor of the other party and not just a mere change of
control. However, the aforementioned contracts are confidential
and subject to stringent non-disclosure provisions and can
therefore not be disclosed in this Directors' report.
CREDITOR PAYMENT POLICY
The Group is committed to maintaining a sound commercial
relationship with its creditors. The Group has no fixed payment
policies but negotiates the best possible terms with its suppliers.
The Company had no trade payables at the year end.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 
The Group does not incur research and development
expenditure in the conventional sense. However, it continues to
invest in its strategy of establishing world-class expertise in its
systems integration lines of business and service delivery
capabilities. Key projects during 2008 included a review and
upgrade of Dimension Data’s Services Architecture that forms
the basis for the delivery of the Group’s Services. This will
involve the incorporation of new Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)
vendors and Web 2.0 technology to streamline and improve
service management and delivery.
The Group also invested in various initiatives to automate the
delivery of a number of specialised services. 
In the lines of business, the Group was the recipient of a Global
Innovation award from Microsoft for a sophisticated integration
module between the Microsoft suite of offerings and that of IP
Telephony players to simplify the adoption of Unified
Communications offerings.
IT SYSTEMS
The Group continued to consolidate its IT infrastructure and
applications across the Group. System and process
standardisation remains a big opportunity to extract efficiencies
from the Group's operating model. The adoption of a standard
ERP application across Europe was an important achievement
during the year. Other initiatives include the refresh of a standard
IT Service Management platform as well as the ongoing
adoption of the e-procurement application, Direct.
GOING CONCERN 
After making due enquiry, the Directors consider that, as at the
date of the approval of the financial statements, the Group has
adequate resources to continue to operate for the foreseeable
future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going
concern basis in preparing the Group’s financial statements.  Dimension Data Annual Report 2008
37
At the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, Stephen Joubert,
Wendy Lucas-Bull, Rory Scott, and Dorian-Wharton Hood retire
and offer themselves for re-election in accordance with the
Articles of Association. Rory Scott and Dorian Wharton-Hood
were originally elected to the Board in July 2000 and therefore,
in compliance with the Combined Code, will be proposed for
election for a one year term.
The Nomination Committee and Chairman confirm that the
directors up for re-election and election continue to be effective
in their roles as directors of the Company, by virtue of their skills,
experience and contribution to the Board. Biographical details
of those directors seeking re-election and election are set out on
pages 32 and 33. Directors' memberships of Board
Committees are set out in the Corporate Governance Report.
Details of Directors' service contracts, remuneration and
interests in shares are set out in the Remuneration Report.
Details of the Directors' interests in any Group company can
also be found in the Remuneration Report.
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY 
Dimension Data's policies for environmental, social, ethics and
governance matters are detailed in the Corporate Social
Responsibility Report set out on pages 42 to 44. Charitable
donations and grants made during the year amounted to
$229,000 (2007: $162,000).
In line with its policy, the Company made no political donations
in the year under review (2007: nil).
EMPLOYEES
As at 30 September 2008, the Group employed 11,055
employees. Details of employee related costs are included in
Note 7 to the financial statements.
Quality and integrity of personnel
The Group is committed to aligning its employees with its
interests and values. It has an ethical code which employees are
expected to adhere to, and transgressions are strictly dealt with.
Employee consultation and communication
The Group understands that employee engagement drives
commitment and productivity, and therefore consults
regularly with its employees for views on matters affecting
them, including informing them of financial and economic
factors affecting the Group's performance. In FY2008 we
overhauled the employee section on the Group intranet to
provide better communication and more accessible
information to all employees.
We undertake an annual employee satisfaction survey to
generate constructive employee feedback on common
themes, such as leadership and management, learning and
development, job role contribution, working environment,
company image and satisfaction and communication. 
By acting on feedback, we received votes of strong confidence
by employees in the areas of leadership and management, job
role contribution and company image and satisfaction within
the organisation for the year. 
Another aspect of our employee engagement strategy included
the development of a career development process on our
Careers Portal, together with a range of new tools and support
material. We began the deployment of a global framework to
help our people map out career paths with us. We are
committed to the individual careers of our employees and will
continue to develop a nurturing environment for talented current
and future employees.

Employee remuneration
Dimension Data offers performance related bonuses, as well as
long term incentives to selected employees. Details of these
incentives appear in the Remuneration Report and in Note 37 to
the annual financial statements on pages 89 to 93. The Group
seeks to provide competitive and relevant compensation and
benefits programmes, centred on its aim to attract and retain
key skills. The total remuneration offerings are reviewed and
benchmarked annually against current market conditions, merit,
and targeted investment in people. These reviews follow
corporate governance approval procedures. 
Learning and development
The Dimension Data University (DDU) is a portal where all
employees from around the world can access the world of
development and training from their desktops or from home.
Through partnerships which include Harvard Business School
Publishing, the Centre for Creative Leadership, Cisco,
Microsoft and ITIL, we focus on the development of our
employees across specific key target groups: Leadership and
Management, Technical and Delivery, Sales and Client Facing
and Business Skills. 
Employee diversity
It is the Group's policy to promote equal opportunities in
employment for both existing employees and applicants for
employment, regardless of gender, age, race, national origin
and sexual orientation. Efforts are made to ensure that
applications from disabled persons are fairly considered and
that disabled employees have equal opportunities in career
development. In the event of an existing employee becoming
disabled, efforts are made to ensure that their employment by
the Group continues and that appropriate adjustments are
made to their work environment.
AUDITORS
Resolutions to reappoint Deloitte & Touche LLP as the Group's
auditors and authorising the Directors to determine their
remuneration will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual
General Meeting.
To the best of the directors' knowledge and belief (at the date of
approval of this annual report) and having made appropriate
enquiries of the officers of the Group, all information relevant to
enabling the auditors to provide their opinion on the financial
statements has been provided. Directors have taken reasonable
steps to ensure their awareness of any relevant audit
information and to establish that the Company's auditors are
aware of such information.
This information is given and should be interpreted in accordance
with the provisions of S234ZA of the Companies Act 1985.

Corporate governance report
This report explains the Company’s approach to corporate
governance, and contains a summary of how the Board has
complied with the principles set out in the Financial
Reporting Council’s (‘FRC’) Combined Code on Corporate
Governance.
Throughout the year ended 30 September 2008 the Company
has been in compliance with the Code provisions set out in
Section 1 of the 2006 FRC Combined Code on Corporate
Governance with the exception that:
Dillie Malherbe was appointed as a member of the
Remuneration Committee in September 2004 and is not
considered to be independent due to his executive role at
VenFin Limited. Peter Liddiard was appointed as a member of
the Audit Committee in September 2007 and is also not
considered to be independent due to his executive role at
VenFin Limited.
The Board considered the implications of the roles of both Dillie
Malherbe and Peter Liddiard at VenFin Limited and concluded
that this would not compromise the independence of their input
to these committees. As at 30 September 2008 VenFin Limited
held 25.4% of the Company’s share capital.
BOARD OF DIRECTORS
The Board including the Chairman comprises five executive
directors and eight non-executive directors. The Board
considers all non-executive directors, with the exception of Dillie
Malherbe and Peter Liddiard, to be independent. Rupert
Barclay is the senior independent non-executive director.
The Board met seven times during the past year. A table
indicating attendance by directors at Board and Committee
meetings is set out below. The non-executive directors have
met separately twice during the year, and in addition
communicate on a regular basis.
BOARD TRAINING AND EVALUATION
On appointment directors participate in a Group induction
programme and receive guidance on their responsibilities. 
Directors are able, at the Company’s expense, to obtain
independent professional advice on Board matters. They also
have access to the services of the Company Secretary.
Directors also receive ongoing briefings, including updates on
corporate governance, regulatory issues and information
relevant to the industry. 
The performance of the executive directors is evaluated
annually using the performance management system
implemented throughout the Group, with the CEO reviewing the
executives and the Chairman reviewing the CEO. The non-
executive directors, led by Rupert Barclay, the senior
independent director, reviewed the leadership and performance
of the Chairman. An evaluation of the effectiveness of the non-
executive directors, the Board and its principal committees was
commenced during September 2008, using a revised and
updated series of questionnaires designed by the Chairman and
the Company Secretarial Department. The results of this
evaluation are still under consideration. 
In terms of the Articles of Association directors are obliged to
retire in the third calendar year following the year in which they
were elected or last re-elected by the Company, after which
they may be available for re-election. 
BOARD OPERATION
The Board is accountable to shareholders for determining
strategy and for the conduct of the business of the Group.
A corporate governance framework in the form of an authorities
matrix defines the roles and responsibilities of the constituent
elements of the Group's management structure. This enables
the Board to plan, execute, control and monitor the Group's
activities in accordance with the strategic objectives.
Matters reserved for the Board include:
• approval of the Group's strategy and annual budget;
• review of Group performance;
• approval of major capital expenditure or disposals, material
contracts, material acquisitions and developments;
• maintenance and monitoring of the Group's internal controls
and risk management system;
• changes to the Company's capital structure and the
Memorandum and Articles of Association;
• recommendation of dividends;
• communication with shareholders, including approval of all
circulars, prospectuses and major public announcements;
• determination of the terms of reference of Board
committees;
• appointment, removal and remuneration of directors and the
Company Secretary;
• changes to retirement benefit schemes, employee share
plans and long term incentive programmes;
• approval of the interim statement and annual report and
accounts (including review of critical accounting policies and
judgements and assessment of the Company's position and
prospects); and
• appointment of the external auditors.
Financial reporting is performed according to a strict schedule.
The non-executive directors are provided with information to
enable them to reach independent conclusions on the matters
brought to their attention at Board meetings. The Board ensures
that each director is provided with appropriate and timely
information in order to exercise his or her judgement. 
AUTHORITY AND REVIEW
The authorities matrix determines levels of authority for the
subsidiary boards and their directors for financial and
operational decision making, including major investments,
capital expenditure and contractual engagements. The
Group’s internal audit function monitors compliance with these
authority levels.
BOARD COMMITTEES
The Board delegates specific responsibility to four committees,
which operate within written terms of reference available on
request from the Company Secretary or on the Company's
website www.dimensiondata.com Dimension Data Annual Report 2008

Corporate governance report
Executive Committee
The Executive Committee, which meets fortnightly, has
responsibility for the day-to-day running of the business and the
execution of the Group’s strategy. It is chaired by Brett Dawson.
All executive directors, other than Jeremy Ord, are members.
The members of the Executive Committee are set out on
page 31.
Audit Committee
Rory Scott (Chairman)
Rupert Barclay
Leslie Bergman (appointed 30 September 2008)
Peter Liddiard 
Derek Irish (resigned 30 September 2008)
During the year ended 30 September 2008 the Audit
Committee comprised three non-executive directors, two of
whom are independent, and Derek Irish, a chartered accountant
and a senior partner in an independent accounting practice.
A table showing attendance at committee meetings is available
on page 41. On 30 September 2008 Derek Irish resigned as a
member of the committee and Leslie Bergman was appointed.
Rory Scott, Rupert Barclay, Derek Irish and Peter Liddiard are all
qualified chartered accountants.
The main duties and activities of the Audit Committee in the
period under review can be summarised as follows:
Internal Control
Group risk
The Audit Committee reviews the effectiveness of the Group’s
internal controls, including financial, operational and compliance
controls, as well as its procedures for identification, assessment
and reporting of risks.
Internal audit
The Group's internal audit work is performed by the internal
audit team as well as PricewaterhouseCoopers. The Audit
Committee approves the internal audit programme and reviews
its results. The heads of the PricewaterhouseCoopers internal
audit team and the Internal Audit team have direct access to the
Chairmen of both the Audit Committee and the Board. The
PricewaterhouseCoopers internal audit team met with the Audit
Committee twice during the period under review and once
separately with the Chairman of the Audit Committee. 
External audit
The Audit Committee reviews the performance and
independence of the external auditors. When considering their
independence, the safeguards and procedures undertaken by
the external auditors are reviewed to ensure their independence
and objectivity. Based on this review, the Audit Committee has
recommended the continued appointment of Deloitte & Touche
for the coming financial year. During the period the Audit
Committee reviewed the scope of the audit including the Group
materiality level. To ensure independence, approval must be
obtained from the Audit Committee at the end of the financial
year for audit and tax services provided. Non-audit services
exceeding $50,000 on an individual basis or $250,000 in total
must be separately approved by the Audit Committee. Details of
the split between audit and non-audit work can be found in
Note 6 of the annual financial statements.
The Audit Committee considers that the approvals required for
audit and non-audit services, together with the other controls in
place within the Group, are sufficient to ensure the objectivity and
independence of the external auditors. During the period, the
Audit Committee met with the external auditors four times and
once informally without management present. The chairman also
met with the auditors on two further occasions.
Financial Statements
The Audit Committee has reviewed the financial statements for
the period, and has considered matters such as the
appropriateness of the accounting policies, decisions requiring
a major element of judgement, compliance with accounting
standards, a review of business and key performance
indicators, the going concern assumption and the statement on
internal control.
Other Audit Committee Matters
The ethical code and the whistle-blowing policy (copies of
which are available on the Company’s website) are intended to
assist individuals who believe they have discovered serious
malpractice to take the appropriate action. The Audit
Committee is satisfied that these arrangements provide for
proportionate and independent investigation of matters
reported and for appropriate follow up action. 
Remuneration Committee
Details of the Remuneration Committee and its activities are
contained in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 45
to 50.
Nomination Committee
Jeremy Ord (Chairman)
Dorian Wharton-Hood
Rupert Barclay (appointed 12 May 2008)
The Committee met once during the year under review. 
The Nomination Committee reviews the composition of the Board
and makes recommendations to the Board regarding the
appointment of new directors. It also satisfies itself that
succession plans are in place for the Board and senior
management of the Group, and reviews the performance of non-
executive directors. During the next financial year the Nomination
Committee will make recommendations to the Board regarding
succession planning for those directors who will be completing
their ninth year as independent non-executive directors. 
ETHICS 
The Group embraces the highest standards in its business
activities, operating in accordance with an ethical code 
that is distributed to employees via the corporate intranet. 
A copy of the code is available on the Group’s website,
www.dimensiondata.com
RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL
Ultimate responsibility for Risk Management and Internal
Control lies with the Board. This includes regular review by the
(continued) Dimension Data Annual Report 2008
41
Board and management of the effectiveness of the Risk
Management and Internal Control systems and functions. The
Risk Management function, headed by the Group Risk
Manager, is supported by an Enterprise Risk Management
programme and the internal audit function. The programme
provides assurance to the Board on all matters concerning
Group Risk, including strategic, operational, financial and
compliance, and focuses on the risks to the achievement of
Dimension Data’s business objectives. 
Internal controls are designed to manage, rather than eliminate
risks, and to provide reasonable, rather than absolute
assurance against material misstatement or loss. The internal
audit function performs a structured review of internal controls
based on risk assessment.
The Audit Committee regularly reviews the work plan and key
findings of the internal and external audit process and monitors
progress to ensure that areas of weakness are addressed.
Responsibility for implementing controls and improvements lies
with business unit or regional level management. The Audit
Committee has delegated the day-to-day responsibility for
review of the Group Risk Register to the Group Risk Manager
and the Internal Audit team.
The processes above have been in place for the year under
review up to the date of approval of the annual report and
accounts. The Audit Committee and the Board regularly review
these and are satisfied that the system of Internal Control is in
line with the revised guidance as set out in ‘Internal Control:
Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code’ issued by the
FRC in October 2005.
FINANCIAL REPORTING
The Chief Financial Officer is responsible for establishing Group
financial policy and, with the Chief Executive Officer, for the
execution thereof. The Chief Executive Officer is also
responsible for the integrity of forecast information upon which
executive decisions are based. A budgeting process takes
place annually, culminating in review and approval by the Board.
Each business unit reports actual and forecast revenue,
profitability and cash position monthly to the Chief Financial
Officer. The Chief Financial Officer considers these against
previous forecasts and budget, and reports to the Board
quarterly. In addition, the Chief Financial Officer distributes
monthly management accounts to the directors.
Controls over business unit risks include reviews against
performance indicators and exception reporting. Business units’
senior management are responsible for identifying, evaluating and
managing business risks. There are channels of communication
available to report significant risks to the Board if necessary.
COMMUNICATION WITH STAKEHOLDERS
The Group is committed to honest, open and regular
communication with all stakeholders on both financial and non-
financial matters.
The Group reports its half year and full year results formally to
shareholders, and twice a year provides interim management
statements. Effective communication with institutional investors,
analysts and the media is maintained through presentations by
executives and senior management. Meetings are held to update
the market on the Group’s strategies, operations and
performance. Executive and senior management attend these
meetings on a regular basis. Briefings and meetings are
conducted in line with the Group’s written guidelines to ensure
control over price-sensitive information and equality of disclosure.
The Annual General Meeting provides an opportunity to
communicate directly with shareholders. The Chairmen of the
Audit, Remuneration and Nomination committees are available
at the meeting to answer questions from shareholders. Notice
of the Annual General Meeting is enclosed within this Annual
Report. Separate resolutions are proposed on each
substantially different issue. The Company publishes on its
website details of proxy votes together with a summary of the
business conducted at the Annual General Meeting.
In addition to the interim and annual reports, and 
interim management statements, shareholders can obtain
information about the Group posted on the website

Corporate responsibility report
OVERVIEW
Dimension Data operates globally, spanning five continents and
over 47 countries. The Group is aware of its responsibilities as
a global corporate citizen not only to deliver value and profit to
shareholders, but also to adhere to a code of ethical conduct;
to provide a fair and unprejudiced employment framework for its
employees; to deliver solutions that answer the environmental
requirements of our clients, and to ensure that we operate as
sustainably as is practical.
During the year ended 30 September 2008 the Board has
reviewed our corporate responsibility programme, including the
long and short term risks to the value of the Group associated
with ethical, environmental and social issues. Following this
review our efforts were refocused with the appointment of an
executive as Global Lead, Sustainability. Our corporate
responsibility programme now covers three main areas:
environmental issues, social issues (including our own
employees as well as community engagement); and ethics and
governance. 
Dimension Data aims to integrate its Corporate Responsibility
programme into the Group’s values, operations and business
decisions at all levels, promoting an ethical and sustainable
corporate culture. This report focuses on the progress made during
the year in our environmental and social programmes. Further
details on ethics and governance can be found in the Business
Review and Corporate Governance Report (pages 39 to 41).
ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAMME
Dimension Data has a relatively low environmental impact
compared to similar sized organisations in different industry
sectors. However we acknowledge that climate change is a
global problem and we are committed to responsible
environmental practices throughout our business. With this in
mind, our environmental strategy covers three pillars: Licence to
Operate, Go-to-Market and Employee Engagement.
Licence to Operate: 
This aspect of our environmental policy covers our compliance
with local and international environmental legislation and our
commitment to measuring, monitoring and ultimately reducing
our carbon footprint. During the year we completed our first
submission to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP6) and have
finalised our Carbon Management Plan. Subsequent to year
end, Dimension Data was placed in the Leadership Index (CDLI)
for non-carbon-intensive sectors with a rating of 93. In 2009 we
intend to roll out an Environmental Management System
employing the ISO 14001 framework with a focus on energy
consumption, business travel and waste management.
Go-to-Market:
Dimension Data offers a range of solutions and services that
can significantly reduce business energy consumption and
business travel for our clients. These offerings support our
clients’ requirements to reduce their environmental impact and
include: data centre virtualisation and consolidation, data centre
power and cooling, data centre design and architecture, virtual
meeting options using a variety of visual communications
technologies, e-Procurement, and several bespoke services
including our recently released Office Sustainability Service.
Employee Engagement: 
Conservation of the environment is a cause that our employees
have taken to heart. We support this interest as the only way to
build a truly credible and sustainable programme for Dimension
Data. During the year we deployed Greenpoint, an
environmental site on our intranet, which includes topical
information, white papers and presentations. We also
established environmental thinktanks in most of the regions
where the voluntary participants include employees from all
divisions within Dimension Data and their charter is to ensure
the enhancement of our environmental strategy.

SOCIAL PROGRAMMES – MAKING A POSITIVE
DIFFERENCE TO THOSE IN NEED
The key themes of our social programmes are community
engagement, volunteering and stakeholder engagement, with
black economic empowerment (BEE) a pivotal part of the
programme in South Africa. 
Community engagement
This element of our policy incorporates our commitment to
various regional issues and causes, community involvement,
partnership with non-profit companies, charities and non-
governmental organisations and sponsorship of charitable
events. In addition, in some regions we provide the structures to
facilitate workplace giving – where employees can elect, with
matching Group support, to make payments to charities directly
from the payroll.
Some highlights from regional community engagement
projects during the year include:
Asia’s regional programme, Carecraft, focuses on sponsoring
children. It placed considerable focus on the Myanmar cyclone
disaster and the earthquake in China’s Szechuan province, and
all countries under the Datacraft brand contributed to these
two causes, raising over $90,000. Employees also volunteered
their services at the disaster sites and formed part of the
humanitarian effort. In addition, in Korea we participated in the
Love Loaf programme as a fundraising initiative; in Singapore
we supported the children of the Melrose Home; in Hong Kong
we were involved with the Salvation Army and St James
settlements for the elderly and homeless; and in India we
supported the SOS Children's Villages and the Red Cross. Our
Asian business has a relationship with WorldVision, and
‘adopted’ 142 children through WorldVision’s child
sponsorship initiative. 
In Australia, through our Heads Hearts and Hands programme,
we focus on three areas: environment, education and children.
Australian employees (matched by Dimension Data) donated
approximately $240,000 to a range of local and international
charities. One example is our involvement in the John Maclean
Foundation, which raises funds for equipment such as
wheelchairs to children with special needs. All six Australian
branch offices participated in Earth Hour 2008. We also have a
mature volunteering programme that is a strong and positive
element contributing to a vibrant corporate culture. A significant
proportion of Australian employees volunteered their time during
the year, estimated to be in excess of 600 working hours,
towards various charitable initiatives. 
At the instigation of our employees, our European operation
elected to support Unicef during the year. Various local
charitable organisations were supported throughout the region,
including for example Cancer Research UK and Oxfam, while
other individual country operations supported employee
education with the Red Cross and cultural exchange
programmes. 
In the United States our Corporate Responsibility initiatives are
co-ordinated under the banner of the Network of Hope. In
addition to contributing financially to local causes through the
United Way and City Year payroll deduction campaign, our
American employees volunteered for a range of causes with a
total of 613 hours being devoted to 28 projects across the
United States, including Thanksgiving food drives and
construction, renovation and decorating work on Habitat for
Humanity projects, and children’s and women’s shelters. 
In our Middle East and Africa business we support a range of
exciting community initiatives. Thirteen years ago, the business
in South Africa made a commitment to education as its
community focus. The Dimension Data Saturday School
harnesses the power of technology via an e-learning
management system, and currently reaches 6,000 students,
aiming to reach 40,000 children by 2015. In this way, the
children are afforded the opportunity to further their studies,
obtain life skills and become active participants in the
transformation of the country. The Dimension Data Saturday
School is supplemented by the Mentorship Programme, where
employees volunteer to mentor 50 learners and provide a
supportive relationship where knowledge and experience can
be shared. We also support the CIDA City Campus and its
Winter School programme, and have contributed to the building
of school libraries at underfunded schools.
Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) in South Africa
Dimension Data has based its BEE strategy on the South
African Department of Trade and Industry’s Codes of Good
Practice issued in terms of Section 9 of the Broad-Based Black
Economic Empowerment Act No. 53 of 2003 (the Codes). In
2008, we made further strides to achieving our BEE targets
through a continued focus on equity ownership, management
control, employment equity, skills development, preferential
procurement, enterprise development and socio-economic
development. 
Our BEE programmes aim to:
• Transform our employee profile at every level, as per our
employment equity plan, to reflect the demographics of
South Africa in the shortest possible time; and
• Create capacity in our broader industry, through facilitating
skills development from secondary to tertiary level and
capacity creation through preferential procurement and
entrepreneurship formation, facilitating access to capital,
joint ventures and investments. Dimension Data Annual Report 2008

Highlights of the advances we have made in 2008 in our BEE
programme include:
• Equity ownership. The appointment of an Executive Director:
Transformation proves Dimension Data’s commitment to
transformation. In accordance with the Codes, Dimension
Data (Pty) Limited is 25.4% black owned and its percentage
female ownership is 2.4%. In the year ended 30 September
2008 we achieved a Level Four Contributor BEE Rating and
a 125% BEE Procurement Recognition Level, qualifying
Dimension Data (Pty) Limited as a Value Adding Supplier.
• Management control. We continue to see operational
management participation as the heart of our BEE strategy.
The South African organisation has now exceeded our
commitment to achieving a set target of 40% black
executive directorship by mid-2006. In the year ended
30 September 2008, 77% of the executive directors of
Dimension Data (Pty) Limited represent previously
disadvantaged individuals (PDIs).
• Employment equity. The ultimate goal for Dimension Data is
to have a demographic profile that is reflective of our areas
of operation. This profile includes both racial and gender
complements. For the year ended 30 September 2008,
Dimension Data (Pty) Limited, South Africa, attained the
following percentages of PDI employees:
30% of employees at senior management level; 
22% of employees at middle management level; and 
53% of employees at junior management level.
Overall, 32% of employees were female and 47% of
employees were PDIs.
• Skills development. Ongoing training and skills development
form the bedrock of transformation, and is an imperative for
any company aiming to develop a competitive edge.
Dimension Data recognises the long term benefits of
keeping employees motivated and more adept. During the
year ended 30 September 2008 3,052 people were
provided with opportunities for further education, learning
and development activities.
• Preferential procurement. Various initiatives are in place,
including preferential payment terms for small, medium and
micro enterprises of 15 days and BEE vendor education to
ensure that our suppliers become BEE compliant. In the year
ended 30 September 2008, 19.1% of Dimension Data (Pty)
Limited's total procurement spend was channelled to BEE
suppliers.  Each supplier is vetted through B1SA to
determine their ‘Broad-Based Black Economic
Empowerment’ status.
• Enterprise development. Dimension Data acknowledges the
regional realities of the countries we work in. One of the key
realities in South Africa is the lack of BEE ICT companies
capable of supporting large enterprise and public sector
clients. We are committed to addressing this challenge
through our Enterprise Development Programme, and
contribute 3.8% of net profit after tax from Dimension Data
(Pty) Limited, South African, to this programme.
• Socio-economic development (corporate social investment).
Dimension Data has made the decision to focus the majority
of its socio-economic development spend on initiatives that
focus on education and access to ICT. Details of some of
these initiatives are included in the Social Programmes
section above. Dimension Data Annual Report 2008

Remuneration report
The Remuneration Committee presents its Remuneration
Report, which was approved by the Board of Directors on
11 November 2008.
INTRODUCTION
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors’
Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 (the ‘Regulations’). The
report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules
of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board
applies the Principles of Good Governance relating to directors’
remuneration. As required by the Regulations, a resolution to
approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General
Meeting of the Company, at which the financial statements will
be approved. The Regulations require the auditors to report to
the Company’s members on certain parts of the Directors’
Remuneration Report and to state whether in their opinion
those parts of the report have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985 (as amended by the
Regulations). The report has therefore been divided into
separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
UNAUDITED INFORMATION
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee members for the period under
review were as follows:
Wendy Lucas-Bull (Chairperson)
Dillie Malherbe
Rory Scott
Dorian Wharton-Hood (appointed 1 October 2008)
The members of the Remuneration Committee are considered
by the Company to be independent non-executives, with the
exception of Dillie Malherbe. The explanation for Dillie
Malherbe's appointment to the Remuneration Committee is set
out in the Corporate Governance Report. All members of the
Remuneration Committee are free from conflicts of interest in
considering matters relating to remuneration of executives. The
Remuneration Committee met three times during the period
under review. A table showing attendance at committee
meetings is available on page 41.
A copy of the full terms of reference for the Remuneration
Committee is available on the Company’s website
www.dimensiondata.com
No director or manager is involved in any decisions relating to
his or her own remuneration.
The Remuneration Committee has internal and external
resources available to it to assist in the performance of its
duties.
The Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer and the Group
Executive Human Resources provide information on current
remuneration and performance of directors and senior
management, and are available to the Remuneration
Committee to answer any questions that may arise. The Chief
Financial Officer assists the Remuneration Committee in
ensuring the affordability of the long term incentive schemes.
The Company Secretary provides assistance and advice to the
Remuneration Committee with respect to governance, the
operation of the long term incentive schemes and regulatory
compliance.
Towers Perrin have been appointed by the Committee to
provide benchmarking information in relation to base salaries of
the executive directors.
PricewaterhouseCoopers have been appointed by the
Committee to provide advice on the operation of the long term
incentive schemes.
Policy on executive and non-executive directors’
remuneration
The Group’s business depends on the attraction, retention and
motivation of high calibre executives and staff. With a presence
on five different continents our international scope is much
greater than many companies of a similar size, and we compete
to attract and retain top staff with large multinational
organisations. The Remuneration Committee has considered
the following principles in setting remuneration for future
financial years:
• Remuneration will be designed to support the Group’s
business strategy in line with best practice standards.
• Levels of reward will be competitive within the relevant
market and location.
• The remuneration structure will have a substantial
performance related element. At an on-target level, the
proportion of executive remuneration that is performance
linked will be not less than 45% of total remuneration,
including awards under any long term incentive schemes
(being the Share Appreciation Rights Scheme (‘SARS’) and
the Long Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) valued at ‘fair value’). 
• The fair value of combined grants under the SARS and LTIP
shall not exceed one times base pay per individual.
• Performance conditions attaching to the long term incentive
schemes will be challenging. LTIP conditions will normally
relate to performance against a peer group of companies. 
The policy relating to each component of remuneration for the
directors is summarised below:
Base salary
The base salary of the executive directors is subject to annual
review and is set with reference to external market data
provided by Towers Perrin relating to similar companies based
in South Africa, Europe, the UK and the US and taking into
account the primary location of the directors concerned.
Consideration is given to the size, market sector, business
complexity and international reach of the comparator Dimension Data Annual Report 2008
46
Remuneration report
(continued)
companies. Base salary is set in the third quartile in relation to
the comparator companies, ensuring an overall emphasis on
performance related remuneration is maintained.
Annual bonus plan
Each of the executive directors participates in an annual bonus
scheme. The annual bonus is designed to ensure that directors’
remuneration is aligned with the interests of the Company’s
shareholders and other stakeholders. The upper limit for the on-
target annual bonus plan for directors is 150% of base salary. In
addition, if there is an overachievement on performance targets
the Remuneration Committee may award a further bonus up to
an agreed maximum with each bonus above the on-target level
being considered on a case by case basis. 
During the 2008 financial year awards under the annual bonus
plan were made to executive directors as detailed on page 47.
For the financial year 2009, performance criteria will include
earnings per share and Group and regional operating profit,
together with an amount relating to the achievement of personal
key performance indicators (KPIs). 
Long term incentives
The Group has four long term incentive schemes. Awards are
no longer made under the two option schemes, although the
executive directors have options outstanding under these
schemes as detailed on page 49.
The two current long term incentive schemes are the Share
Appreciation Rights Scheme (SARS) and the Long Term
Incentive Plan (LTIP). No awards have been made under the
SARS in the year ended 30 September 2008.
The performance criterion for the 2008 LTIP award was Total
Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) over a three year period compared
to the TSR of a peer group. Vesting will commence if the TSR
ranks at the median TSR of the peer group, when 50% of the
LTIP awards may vest. Vesting will progress linearly as the rank
of the TSR increases, reaching 100% vesting at the upper
quartile ranking.
Details of the peer group for the LTIP can be found on the
corporate website www.dimensiondata.com
These performance conditions were chosen to align employee
benefits with Group performance and the interests of
shareholders. 
During the period LTIP awards were made to executive directors
as detailed on pages 47 and 48. 
Pensions and other benefits
The executive directors each receive life insurance, disability
insurance and medical cover benefits which reflect the practice
in the countries in which they are primarily resident. Other
benefits include payment of an annual club subscription, vehicle
expenses and income tax consultancy services. The cost to the
Group is shown in the table on page 47. Contributions are also
made for the executive directors to the Group’s provident fund,
which is a defined contribution pension scheme, in the amounts
as set out on page 47.
Service contracts
The executive directors have identical service contracts. These
contracts are rolling and contain a three month notice period. On
termination, except by reason of cause, illness, death, injury or
retirement, the executive director will be entitled to payments
equal to 12 months’ base salary plus a pro rata portion of bonus
(if all conditions applicable to the bonus have been
proportionately achieved, as determined by the Remuneration
Committee). The amounts will be payable in equal amounts over
the 12 months subsequent to termination, subject to the
director’s obligation to mitigate such costs by seeking alternative
employment and the Company being entitled to deduct, from the
amounts payable, all remuneration and fees received pursuant to
such alternative employment.

Brett Dawson 1 March 2004 Indefinite
Stephen Joubert 1 January 2003 Indefinite
Patrick Quarmby 1 January 2003 Indefinite
David Sherriffs 1 March 2004 Indefinite
Each non-executive director has a letter of appointment, of
three year duration, and containing a one month notice
provision. There are no compensation provisions for early
termination of non-executive director appointments.
Non-executive directors' fees
The remuneration of non-executive directors is a matter for the
executive members of the Board. 
The executive directors determine the remuneration of the non-
executive directors annually. The fees were reviewed and
increased with effect from 1 October 2007. Consideration is
given to fees payable to non-executive directors for comparable
companies.
Additional fees are paid to committee members and chairmen
of Board Committees to take account of the additional work
involved. Non-executive directors are not eligible to participate
in the Company’s long term incentive schemes.
External appointments
Executive directors may accept external appointments, subject
to Board approval.  Dimension Data Annual Report 2008

Awards under the LTIP were made to executive directors as detailed above.
On 13 December 2007 JP Morgan Equities Limited confirmed that Dimension Data’s TSR had ranked in second place in the Peer
Group over the three year period from 18 November 2004 to 12 December 2007. Accordingly the LTIP awards made on 15 February
2005 to executive directors and employees in the Group vested in full. 
The Company share price on 13 December 2007 was 58.50 UK pence. Accordingly the LTIP value on vesting received by the
Directors was $2.7 million (2007: nil).
The performance criterion for the LTIP is Total Shareholder Return ('TSR') over a three year period compared to the TSR of a Peer
Group. Vesting will commence if the TSR ranks at the median TSR of the Peer Group, when 30% to 50% of the LTIP awards may
vest. Vesting will progress linearly, as the rank of the TSR increases, until 100% vesting when the TSR has upper quartile ranking.
Details of the Peer Group are available on the Company’s website www.dimensiondata.com

Statement of directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, Directors' Remuneration Report and the financial statements in
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. The Directors are required by the IAS
Regulation to prepare the Group financial statements under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the
European Union and have also elected to prepare the parent Company financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by
the European Union. The financial statements are also required by law to be properly prepared in accordance with the Companies
Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
International Accounting Standard (IAS) 1 requires that financial statements present fairly for each financial year the Group and
Company's financial position, financial performance and cash flows. This requires the faithful representation of the effects of
transactions, other events and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income
and expenses set out in the International Accounting Standards Board's 'Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of
Financial Statements'.
In virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation will be achieved by compliance with all applicable IFRSs. However, Directors are also
required to:
• Properly select and apply accounting policies;
• Present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable
information; and 
• Provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity's financial position and financial
performance.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial
position of the Group and Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company's
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from
legislation in other jurisdictions.
We confirm to the best of our knowledge:
• The financial statements prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU, give a
true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the
consolidation taken as a whole; and
• The management report, which is incorporated into the Directors’ report includes a fair review of the development and
performance of the business and the position of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a
whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties they face. Dimension Data Annual Report 2008

Independent auditors’ report
To the members of Dimension Dimension Data Holdings plc
We have audited the Group and parent Company financial statements (the ‘financial statements’) of Dimension Data Holdings plc for
the year ended 30 September 2008 which comprise the consolidated Income Statement, the consolidated and parent Company
Balance Sheets, the consolidated and parent Company Cash Flow statements, the consolidated and parent Company Statements
of Changes in Equity and the related Notes 1 to 40 and (a) to (g) for the consolidated and parent Company financial statements
respectively. These financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited the
information in the Directors' Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our
audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them
in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to
anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we
have formed.
RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS AND AUDITORS
The Directors' responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, the Directors' Remuneration Report and the financial statements in
accordance with applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union are set
out in the Statement of Directors' Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the part of the Directors' Remuneration Report to be audited in accordance
with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements
and the part of the Directors' Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies
Act 1985 and, as regards the consolidated financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also report to you whether in our
opinion the information given in the Directors' Report is consistent with the financial statements. The information given in the Directors'
Report includes that specific information presented in the Chief Executive Officer’s Review and the Chief Financial Officer’s Review of
Operations that is cross referred from the Business Review section of the Directors' Report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the
information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors' remuneration and other
transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Report reflects the Company's compliance with the nine provisions of the 2006
Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are
not required to consider whether the Board's statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Group's corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report as described in the contents section and consider whether it is
consistent with the audited financial statements. The other information comprises only the Directors' Report, the unaudited part of
the Directors' Remuneration Report, the Chairman's Letter, the Chief Executive Officer’s Review, the Chief Financial Officer’s Review
of Operations and the Corporate Governance Report. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent
misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any further information
outside the Annual Report.
BASIS OF AUDIT OPINION
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices
Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements
and the part of the Directors' Remuneration Report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and
judgements made by the Directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are
appropriate to the Group's and Company's circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to
provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements and the part of the Directors'
Remuneration Report to be audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In
forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements and the part
of the Directors' Remuneration Report to be audited.  Dimension Data Annual Report 2008

Notes to the financial statements
For the year ended 30 September 2008
1. BASIS OF PREPARATION
The consolidated and company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU, and those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to those companies reporting
under IFRS.
In the current year, the Group has adopted all of the new and revised Standards and Interpretations issued by the International
Accounting Standards Board (‘IASB’) and the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (‘IFRIC’) of the IASB
that are relevant to its operations and effective for annual reporting periods beginning on 1 October 2007. The adoption of these
new and revised Standards and Interpretations has resulted in changes to the Group's accounting policies in the following areas
that have affected the amounts reported for the current or prior years:
– IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ was adopted with effect from 1 October 2006.
This has not had an impact on measurement, but has necessitated additional disclosures, which are set out in Note 38.
– IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ – amendment to add disclosures about an entity’s capital management was
adopted with effect from 1 October 2007. This has not had an impact on measurement, but has necessitated additional
disclosures, which are set out in Note 38.5.
– IFRIC 11 ‘IFRS 2: Group and Treasury Share Transactions’ was adopted from 1 October 2007. This had no impact on the
consolidated results at 30 September 2008.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the Directors to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at balance sheet date, and the
reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period. Whilst these estimates and assumptions are based on
the Directors' best knowledge of the amount, events or actions, actual results may differ from those estimates.
Restatements and new accounting policies
IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ 
This statement introduced new disclosures to improve the information about financial instruments. It requires the disclosure of
qualitative and quantitative information about exposure to risks arising from financial instruments, including specified minimum
disclosures about credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk, including sensitivity analysis to market risk. This standard has not
impacted the classification and valuation of the Group’s financial instruments, but has required expanded disclosures.
Restatements
The comparative consolidated cash flow statement for the year ended 30 September 2007 has been restated to reflect a
reclassification of shares purchased by The Employee Share Trust from investing activities to financing activities, to more
accurately reflect their nature.
The summarised financial information in respect of the Group’s associates presented in Note 18 has been restated to more
accurately reflect their nature.
Other information in respect of Geographic and Business Segments has been restated to include intangible additions as well as
capital additions. Other significant non-cash expenses have also been presented.
The weighted average number of shares for the year ended 30 September 2007 has been restated to take account of the shares
purchased by The Employee Share Trust. The diluted weighted average number of shares for the year ended 30 September
2007 has been restated to take account of attrition factors.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations, which have not been
applied in these financial statements, were issued but not effective:

Standards and Interpretations will have in future periods when the relevant standards come into effect for the Group.
2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The accounting policies set out below have been used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements and the Company
financial statements where applicable. The consolidated financial information has been prepared on the historical cost basis,
except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments and the investment property. The principal accounting policies adopted
are set out below.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities (including special
purpose entities) controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries). Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern
the financial and operating policies of an investee enterprise so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the
effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into
line with those used by other members of the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Minority interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity therein. Minority
interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination and the minority’s share of
changes in equity since the combination. Losses applicable to the minority in excess of the minority’s interest in the subsidiary’s
equity are allocated against the interest of the Group except to the extent that the minority has a binding legal obligation and is
able to make additional investment to cover the losses.
Business combinations
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the
aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments
issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of
acquisition, except for non-current assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 ‘Non-
Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations’, which are recognised and measured at fair value less cost to sell.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. 
Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired (i.e. discount on acquisition)
is credited to the income statement in the period of acquisition. Dimension Data Annual Report 2008
60
Notes to the financial statements
For the year ended 30 September 2008 (continued)
The interest of minority shareholders in the acquiree is initially measured at the minority’s proportion of the net fair value of the
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
When there is a change in shareholding in a subsidiary, the assets and liabilities are not remeasured to reflect their fair values at
the date of the transaction. The entire difference between the purchase amount and the change in minority interests is reflected
as goodwill.
Investments in associates
An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence, but not control, through
participation in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of
accounting except when classified as held for sale (see below). Investments in associates are carried in the balance sheet at
cost as adjusted by post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the
value of individual investments. Losses of the associate in excess of the Group’s interest in those associates are not recognised.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s share of the fair values of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent
liabilities of the associate at the date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill. Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the
Group’s share of the fair values of the identifiable net assets of the associate at the date of acquisition (i.e. discount on
acquisition) is credited in the income statement in the period of acquisition. The goodwill is included within the carrying amount
of the investment and is assessed for impairment as part of the investment.
Where a Group company transacts with an associate of the Group, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s
interest in the relevant associate. Losses may provide evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred, in which case
appropriate provision is made for impairment.
Non-current assets held for sale
Non-current assets (and disposal groups) classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value
less costs to sell.
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered through a sale
transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as being met only when the sale is highly probable
and the asset (or disposal group) is available for immediate sale in its present condition. Management must be committed to the
sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary or associate at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
For the purpose of the annual impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units expected
to benefit from the combination. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually,
or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating
unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any
goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset
in the unit. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
On disposal of a subsidiary or associate, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss
on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts
subject to being tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP has not been reinstated and
is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Share purchases
The Dimension Data Employee Share Trust purchases shares in the Company to be used for the settlement of its obligations
under its share incentive schemes. When such purchases occur, these amounts are deducted from share capital and share
premium, in line with common South African practice and not presented as a separate negative reserve, which is common
practice in the UK. Dimension Data Annual Report 2008
61
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods
and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales related taxes.
Sales of goods are recognised when goods are delivered and title has passed.
Revenue from contracts is recognised in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy on contracts (see below). 
Licence fees are brought to account over the relevant contract periods.
Maintenance revenue is brought to account over the relevant contract periods, on a straight line basis.
Where the Group acts as agent and is remunerated on a commission basis, the commission is included in revenue. Where the
Group acts as principal, the total value of business handled is included in revenue.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable,
which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that
asset’s net carrying amount.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders’ rights to receive payment have been established.
Contracts
All Services revenue is derived from contracts. 
Where the outcome of a contract can be estimated reliably, revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage of
completion of the contract activity at the balance sheet date. This is measured by the proportion that contract costs
incurred for work performed to date bear to the estimated total contract costs. Variations in contract work, claims and
incentive payments are included to the extent that it is probable that they will result in revenue, and they are capable of
being reliably measured.
Where the outcome of a contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised to the extent of contract
costs incurred that it is probable will be recoverable. Contract costs are recognised as expenses in the period in which they
are incurred.
When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised as an
expense immediately.
Revenue for maintenance contracts that are paid for in advance by customers is recognised as ‘deferred income’ in the
balance sheet. Revenue relating to these maintenance contracts is recognised on the straight line basis over the relevant period
of the contract. Related maintenance contract costs which the Group pays for in advance are expensed in the income
statement on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant contract. Costs which are not yet expenses are recognised on
the balance sheet as ‘prepayments’.
Contact centre revenue is recognised on a straight line basis over the period of the contract.
Leasing
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of
ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
The Group as lessor
Amounts due from lessees under finance leases are recorded as receivables at the amount of the Group’s net investment in the
leases. Finance lease income is allocated to accounting periods so as to reflect a constant periodic rate of return on the Group’s
net investment outstanding in respect of the leases.
Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease. Initial direct costs
incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised
on a straight line basis over the lease term. Dimension Data Annual Report 2008
62
Notes to the financial statements
For the year ended 30 September 2008 (continued)
The Group as lessee
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the
minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in
the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the
lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged
directly in the income statement.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight line basis over the
lease term.
Foreign currencies
The individual financial statements of each Group entity are presented in the currency of primary economic environment in which
the entity operates (its functional currency). For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial
position of each entity are expressed in US dollars, which is the functional currency of the Company, and the presentation
currency for the consolidated financial statements. The Group has elected to present its results in US dollars as this is the
currency predominantly used when the Group transacts.
Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on
the dates of the transactions. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign
currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair
value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was
determined. Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in the income statement for the period, except for exchange
differences arising on non-monetary assets and liabilities where the changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in foreign currency are not retranslated.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the Group enters into forward contracts and options (see below
for details of the Group’s accounting policies in respect of such derivative financial instruments).
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations are
translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average
exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly. Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as
equity and transferred to the Group’s translation reserve. Such translation differences are recognised as income or as expenses
in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Exchange differences on monetary items receivable from or payable to a foreign operation for which settlement is neither
planned nor likely to occur, which form part of the net investment in a foreign operation, are recognised in the translation
reserve.
The financial statements of foreign subsidiaries and associates that report in the currency of a hyperinflationary economy are
restated in terms of the measuring unit current at the balance sheet date before they are translated into US dollars.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign
entity and translated at the closing rate.

Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that
necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets,
until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. Investment income earned on the temporary
investment in specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible
for capitalisation.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Government grants
Government grants towards staff re-training costs are recognised as income over the periods necessary to match them with the
related costs and are deducted in reporting the related expense.
Government grants relating to property, plant and equipment are treated as deferred income and released to the income
statement over the expected useful lives of the assets concerned.
Operating profit
Profit from operations is stated after charging restructuring costs but before the share of results of associates, investment income
and finance costs.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items are those items of financial performance that are material and non-recurring in nature that the Group believes
should be disclosed separately within the financial statements to assist in the understanding of the financial performance of
the Group.
Retirement benefit costs
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit plans are charged as an expense as they fall due. Payments made to state-
managed retirement benefit schemes are dealt with as payments to defined contribution plans where the Group’s obligations
under the schemes are equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution retirement benefit plan.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income
statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes
items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted
for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to
the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition
(other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the
accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and
interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable
that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred
tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which
case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. Dimension Data Annual Report 2008
64
Notes to the financial statements
For the year ended 30 September 2008 (continued)
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current
tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its
current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Property, plant and equipment
Items of property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment
losses. Depreciation is charged so as to write off the depreciable value of the assets over their estimated useful lives, using the
straight line method, on the following basis:
Capitalised property finance lease 2% per annum 
Leasehold land, buildings and improvements Over the lease term 
Computer and workshop equipment 14% – 33% per annum
Motor vehicles 25% per annum 
Office furniture and equipment 10% per annum
Certain costs of purchase, development and installation of major information systems (including packaged software) are
capitalised and amortised over their expected useful lives (generally three to five years) on a straight line basis.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where
shorter, the term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds
and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement.
The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation methods are reviewed at each year end, with the effect of any
changes in estimates accounted for on a prospective basis.
Investment property
Investment property, which is property held to earn rentals and/or for capital appreciation, is measured initially at its cost,
including transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, investment property is measured at fair value. Gains and
losses arising from changes in the fair value of investment property are included in the income statement for the period in
which they arise.
Intangible assets
Acquired intangible assets
Purchased intangible assets, which include customer lists and intellectual property, are capitalised and amortised over their
useful economic lives on a straight line basis.
Computer software
Computer software is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and, where appropriate, provision for impairment in value or
estimated loss on disposal.
Acquired computer software is capitalised on the basis of costs incurred to acquire and bring into use the specific software.
Amortisation is provided to write off the cost of assets on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives of between three
to five years. The SAP software is written off over seven years. Costs associated with developing or maintaining computer
software are recognised as an expense as incurred, unless they increase the future economic benefits of the asset, in which
case they are capitalised.
Internally generated computer software is capitalised at cost if the project is technically and commercially feasible and the
economic benefits that are expected to be generated exceed one year. The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of
materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads. Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it
increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific assets to which it relates. Amortisation is provided to write off
the cost of assets on a straight line basis between three and seven years.
Internally-generated intangible assets – research and development
Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred. Dimension Data Annual Report 2008
65
An internally-generated intangible asset arising from the Group’s Solutions business is recognised only if all of the following
conditions are met:
• An asset is created that can be identified (such as software and new processes);
• It is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits; and
• The development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
Internally-generated intangible assets are amortised on a straight line basis over their useful lives, generally between three and
five years. Where no internally-generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised as an
expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Patents and trademarks
Patents and trademarks are measured initially at purchase cost and are amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated
useful lives.
The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation methods are reviewed at each year end, with the effect of any
changes in estimates accounted for on a prospective basis.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether
there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount
of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash
flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which
the asset belongs. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an
indication that the asset may be impaired. Management’s financial projections used for purposes of impairment testing do not
exceed five years.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future
cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the
time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying
amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an
expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is increased to the
revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that
would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (cash-generating unit) in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct
labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
Cost is calculated using the weighted average method.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in
marketing, selling and distribution.
Financial instruments
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the
contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the
effective interest rate method. Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in the income
statement when there is evidence that the asset is impaired. The allowance recognised is measured as the difference between
the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate
computed at initial recognition. Dimension Data Annual Report 2008
66
Notes to the financial statements
For the year ended 30 September 2008 (continued)
Investments
Investments are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where a purchase or sale of an investment is under a contract
whose terms require delivery of the investment within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are initially
measured at cost, including transaction costs.
At subsequent reporting dates, debt securities that the Group has the expressed intention and ability to hold to maturity
(held-to-maturity debt securities) are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less any
impairment loss recognised to reflect irrecoverable amounts. An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement
when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired, and is measured as the difference between the investment’s
carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate computed at
initial recognition.
Impairment losses are reversed in subsequent periods when an increase in the investment’s recoverable amount can be related
objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, subject to the restriction that the carrying amount of the
investment at the date the impairment is reversed shall not exceed what the amortised cost would have been had the impairment
not been recognised.
Investments other than held-to-maturity debt securities are classified as either investments held for trading or as available
for sale, and are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value. Where securities are held for trading purposes, gains
and losses arising from changes in fair value are included in the income statement for the period. For available for sale
investments, gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity, until the security is
disposed of or is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is
included in the income statement for the period. Impairment losses recognised in the income statement for equity
investments classified as available for sale are not subsequently reversed through the income statement. Impairment losses
recognised in the income statement for debt instruments classified as available for sale are subsequently reversed if an
increase in the fair value of the instrument can be objectively related to an event occurring after the recognition of the
impairment loss.
For investments where there is no active market, fair value is determined using valuation techniques. Such techniques include
using recent arm’s length market transactions, reference to the current market value of another instrument that is substantially
the same, discounted cash flows analysis or other valuation models.
Changes in various assumptions made in order to value these investments would not make material changes to the values
thereof.
Investments in subsidiaries are carried in the parent company balance sheet at cost less provisions for impairments.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, and other short term highly liquid investments that
are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Financial liabilities and equities
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost,
using the effective interest rate method. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the settlement or
redemption of borrowings is recognised over the term of the borrowings in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy for
borrowing costs (see above).
Convertible loan notes
Convertible loan notes are regarded as compound instruments, consisting of a liability component and an equity component. 
At the date of issue, the fair value of the liability component is estimated using the prevailing market interest rate for similar non-
convertible debt. The difference between the proceeds of issue of the convertible loan notes and the fair value assigned to the
liability component, representing the embedded option to convert the liability into equity of the Group, is included in equity. Dimension Data Annual Report 2008
67
Issue costs are apportioned between the liability and equity components of the convertible loan notes based on their relative
carrying amounts at the date of issue. The portion relating to the equity component is charged directly against equity.
The interest expense on the liability component is calculated by applying the prevailing market interest rate for similar non-
convertible debt to the liability component of the instrument. The difference between this amount and the interest paid is added
to the carrying amount of the convertible loan note.
On conversion of the instruments the value of the debt is transferred to equity reserves.
Trade payables
Trade payables are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest
rate method.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments (primarily foreign currency forward contracts) to hedge its risks associated with
foreign currency fluctuations relating to certain firm commitments and forecasted transactions. Such derivatives are initially
recorded at fair value, if any, and are remeasured to fair value at subsequent reporting dates. The Group does not use derivative
financial instruments for speculative purposes. The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies approved by
the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on the use of financial derivatives.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are
recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. If the cash flow hedge
of a firm commitment or forecasted transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, then,
at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been
recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability. For hedges that do not result in the recognition
of an asset or a liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the
hedged item affects the income statement.
Changes in the fair value of designated fair value hedges and derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge
accounting are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies
for hedge accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in
equity until the forecasted transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain
or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement for the period.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or non-derivative host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when
their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value
with unrealised gains or losses reported in the income statement.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation, as a result of past events, for which it
is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made for
the amount of the obligation. Where the effect of discounting to present value is material, provisions are adjusted to reflect the
time value of money.
Provisions for warranty costs are recognised at the date of sale of the relevant products, at the Directors’ best estimate of the
expenditure required to settle the Group’s liability.
Provisions for restructuring costs are recognised when the Group has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring that has been
communicated to affected parties.
Share-based payment
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payment’. In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2
has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005. Dimension Data Annual Report 2008
68
Notes to the financial statements
For the year ended 30 September 2008 (continued)
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are
measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based
payments is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of the shares that will
eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of a binomial model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on
management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
3. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of income, expenses, assets, liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
Management uses all available information and the application of judgement is inherent in the formation of estimates. Actual
results in the future could differ from these estimates, and any subsequent changes are accounted for with an effect in income
at the time such information becomes available.
Revenue and profit recognition
Revenue and profit on contracts are generally recognised on a percentage of completion basis when the outcome of a contract
can be estimated reliably. Management is required to use judgement in determining whether a contract’s outcome can be
estimated reliably. Management also makes estimates of total contract costs, which are used in determining the value of
amounts recoverable on contracts. Refer to Note 21.
Share-based payment
The expense for the share schemes is determined by estimating the fair value of the options granted. Details of the valuation
methods and assumptions used are set out in Note 37.
Provision for bad debts
Provision is made for bad debts based on management’s estimate of the prospect of recovering the debt. Where management
has determined that a debt is no longer recoverable, the amount is written off. Refer to Note 21.
Provision for inventory
Inventory is counted at least once a year and any shortages and obsolete stock identified are written off immediately. 
An allowance is made for slow moving and obsolete inventory based on historical trends. Provision against slow moving and
obsolete stock at 30 September 2008 amounted to $86.4 million (2007: $90.0 million).
Impairment of goodwill
Management is required to estimate whether or not goodwill has been impaired. This requires estimation of the value in use of
the cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated. The value in use calculation includes estimates about the future
financial performance of the cash-generating units, including management’s estimates of long term operating margins and long
term growth rates. Refer to Note 16.
Income taxes
Management makes estimates of the likely outcome of decisions by tax authorities on transactions and events whose treatment
for tax purposes is uncertain. When the final outcome of such matters is different, or expected to be different, from previous
assessments made by management, a change to the tax provision will be recorded in the period when that decision is made.
Residual value on property, plant and equipment
In general no residual values are attached to the Group’s property, plant and equipment due to the nature of these items.
However, management have applied a residual value to the Campus asset. Residual value is an estimate of the amount that the
Group would currently obtain from disposal of the asset, after deducting the estimated costs of disposal, if the asset were
already of the age and in the condition expected at the end of its useful life.
Valuation of investment property
The portion of the Campus property held to earn rentals or for capital appreciation has been classified as investment property
and is stated at fair value. Management have carried out a valuation based on a rental income yield. Refer to Note 15.
Litigation
The Group is subject to claims which arise in the ordinary course of business. Each claim is evaluated by management, together
with their legal advisers, and a decision made on whether financial settlement is probable, in which case appropriate provisions
are made. Dimension Data Annual Report 2008

*In the prior year, the portion of the Campus property held to earn rentals or for capital appreciation was reclassified as
investment property. This resulted in a revaluation of assets of $5.8 million and a transfer to investment property of $67.1 million
in 2007. The increase in the fair value of the property, prior to reclassification to investment property, has been recognised in
reserves in accordance with IAS 16, ‘Property, Plant and Equipment’.
The impairment loss reversed in 2008 was $0.5 million (2007: $2.3 million) and related to the Central segment.
Included in freehold and leasehold land, buildings and improvements is an amount of $2.4 million (2007: $2.9 million) being the

investment property at 30 September 2008 has been carried out by management and verified by an external valuator, based on
a forward rental yield of 9.2%.
Rental income of $15.0 million (2007: $13.0 million) including rentals charged to inter Group companies, was generated by the
Campus, comprising both the investment property and the operating asset included in property, plant and equipment.
All of the Group’s investment property is held under finance lease. Details of the finance lease payable relating to the investment
property are contained in Note 26.

95,820 90,557
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to cash-generating units (‘CGUs’) that are expected to benefit from
that business combination, and these identified CGUs are at a lower level than regional level. 
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment at the CGU level, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might
be impaired. There has been no impairment to goodwill recorded in 2008 or 2007.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for the value in use
calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes in selling prices and direct costs during
the period. Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value
of money and risks specific to the CGUs. The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts. Changes in selling prices
and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
The Group has prepared forecasts based on the most recent financial budgets approved by the Board, which look one year
hence. The discount rates used range between 10.1% and 15.1%. Growth factors applied to expected earnings were between
10% to 20%. These rates are consistent with growth rates of the industry in which the Group operates.
The most significant component of goodwill within the Middle East and Africa region relates to Internet Solutions. The CGU
recoverable amount in respect of that goodwill was determined using management’s budget for 2009, thereafter applying a
growth rate of 15% with a terminal growth rate of 10% at an equivalent discount rate.  Dimension Data Annual Report 2008

The average credit period provided on sale of goods was 59 days (2007: 60 days). 
Approximately 25% of the Group’s revenues are generated from business with Service Providers, and a similar proportion from
business with Financial Services orginisations. Trade receivables reflect a similar exposure to clients within these market sectors.
Finance lease receivables 
The Group enters into finance lease arrangements for the sale of certain computer equipment. All leases are denominated in the
functional currency of the relevant lessor. The average term of finance leases entered into is three years.
The interest rates inherent in the leases are fixed at the contract date for all of the lease term at an average inherent rate of
between 5% and 11.25%.
The Group considers the fair value of finance lease receivables to approximate their carrying amounts at 30 September 2008.

The finance leases relate mainly to land and buildings in South Africa. The 15 year lease arrangement was entered into on
3 February 2003 and terminates on 31 January 2018. The lease incorporates interest at 16.79%. The current monthly lease
payments of $1.4 million are payable in advance and escalate at 11% per annum. The Company acts as surety and guarantor
against any default. In addition, the obligation under finance lease is secured by the lessor’s title over the leased assets. On
repayment of the finance lease, Dimension Data will own these assets.
The minimum lease payments do not service the interest until 2010. Accordingly, no capital will be repaid until then.

Deferred tax assets 31,862 41,248
Deferred tax liabilities (715) (2,295)
31,147 38,953
At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of $807.3 million (2007: $845.8 million) available for offset against
future profits, predominantly in Europe and North America. A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of $3.4 million
(2007: $55.2 million) of such losses. No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining $803.9 million (2007:
$790.6 million) due to the unpredictability of future profit streams. Included in unrecognised tax losses are losses of $16.9 million
(2007: $15.3 million) that will expire within five years. The major portion of other losses expires in more than ten years.
At the balance sheet date, deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of deductible temporary differences of
$160.3 million (2007: $168.5 million) due to the unpredictability of future profit streams.
Deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised for taxable temporary differences totalling $651.9 million (2007: $593.4 million)
arising on investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures as the Group is in a position to control the
reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Dimension Data Annual Report 2008

consortium owns the remaining 30%. Moss Ngoasheng, a director of Dimension Data Holdings plc, is an indirect shareholder
of the consortium.
Part of the cost of acquisition of Datacraft Asia, which was completed on 7 November 2008, was financed by way of a share
issue of 136,121,909 shares, which took place in July 2008. VenFin Limited, a substantial shareholder in Dimension Data, took
up 98,375,347 of these shares at a price of 44.25 pence per share, which amounted to $86.8 million in total.
Details relating to Directors’ remuneration and shareholdings in the Company are disclosed in the Remuneration Report.
36. PENSION SCHEMES
In most countries, the employing company provides either defined contribution or insured retirement plans to their employees.
The relevant company, and in some cases employees, pay regular contributions to the plans. Once contributions are made, the
relevant company has no liability in respect of these plans.
Pension costs are disclosed in Note 7.
Employees in France, Italy, Japan and Korea are entitled to lump-sum termination indemnity payments upon leaving. Provisions
have been established in respect of these liabilities.

Share Appreciation Rights
The Share Appreciation Rights (‘SARS’) provide employees, at the date of vesting, the right to receive shares equal to the
appreciation in the share price since grant date. The SARS vest three years after the grant date. Vesting is subject to
various non-market performance criteria.
The SARS expire six years from grant date.

will receive an amount equal to the increase in value between the grant date and the exercise date.
Long Term Incentive Plan
The Long Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) provides employees, at the date of vesting, the right to receive a number of shares
as stipulated by the grant certificate. The LTIPs vest in one tranche, approximately three years after the grant date. 
The vesting of most of the LTIPs is subject to the total shareholder return (‘TSR’) of Dimension Data relative to that of a
group of peer companies.
All LTIPs expire on vesting date, approximately three years from date of grant.

Valuation methods
The fair value of the grants in terms of the Dimension Data Holdings plc share option scheme (post 2000) and SARS is
estimated using an actuarial binomial option pricing model.
For the LTIP valuation, the Monte Carlo Simulation process is used to model possible outcomes with stochastic
properties. An example of such a process is the movement in share prices. Share prices have an underlying distribution,
which can be estimated and used to calculate likely distribution of future share prices. Taking into account the expected
growth in share price, assuming a log-normal distribution, the model projects the future share prices.
Inputs into the model
The following inputs were used to value the options, SARS and LTIPS grants:
Weighted Exercise Expected Expected
average price at option Expected dividend Risk-free
Financial years ended share price grant date lifetime volatility yield interest rate
30 September years % % %

LTIPs 2008 £0.48 3 38.95 – 40.51 0.88 4.65 – 4.29
No changes in assumptions were made to the Share Option Scheme (Post 2000) subsequent to 2004.
The expected option lifetime was arrived at based on management’s best estimate for the effects of non-transferability,
exercise restrictions and exercise behaviour considerations. The estimated attrition rate for SARS and LTIPs was between
0% to 8% (2007: 4% to 8%).
The expected volatility was determined based on the rolling historical volatility over the expected option lifetime that
prevailed at the grant date.
The risk-free interest rate used is the yield on the zero-coupon South African government bonds and a UK gilt strip of a
term consistent with the expected option lifetime.
Modifications to share-based payments
For options which were originally granted on 21 November 2002 under the Dimension Data Holdings plc Share Option
Scheme (Post 2000), the vesting dates of 20,754,173 options were altered on 21 November 2003. These options vested
over three tranches, ending on 21 November 2006.
The incremental fair value of £1.8 million was the increase in the value under the new vesting terms as valued at the date
of modification. This incremental fair value was determined using the actuarial binomial model. Dimension Data Annual Report 2008

37(b) Datacraft Asia’s (‘Datacraft’) schemes
Datacraft option schemes
Datacraft Asia has two share option schemes, namely the Previous Scheme and the Scheme 2003. The Previous Scheme
was adopted in 1996. During the financial year ended 30 September 2003, the Previous Scheme was terminated and
replaced by the Scheme 2003. The termination of the Previous Scheme does not affect the rights of outstanding options
granted under the Previous Scheme. However, upon the termination of the Previous Scheme on 27 February 2003, no
further options were granted under the Previous Scheme.
Details of the share options under the Previous Scheme outstanding during the year are as follows:

Exercisable at the end of the year 7,472,000 2.254 10,654,000 2.139
The weighted average share price at the date of the exercise for share options exercised during the year was 
$1.25 (2007: $1.174). The options outstanding at the end of the year have a weighted average remaining contractual life
of 3.1 years (2007: 4.2 years).

37. SHARE-BASED PAYMENT (continued)
37(b) Datacraft Asia’s (‘Datacraft’) schemes (continued)
In FY2008, options were granted on 27 December 2007 and 1 April 2008. The estimated fair values of the options granted
on 27 December 2007 were between $0.24 and $0.35. The estimated fair values of the options granted on 1 April 2008
were between $0.16 and $0.23. In FY2007, options were granted on 15 March 2007. The estimated fair values of the
options granted on 15 March 2007 were between $0.24 and $0.35.
These fair values were calculated using the binomial option pricing model. The inputs into the model were as follows:
2008
27 December 2007 grant
Share price at date of grant 1.24
Exercise price 1.23
Expected volatility 34.5%
Expected dividend yield 2.7%
1 April 2008 grant
Share price at date of grant 0.89
Exercise price 0.885
Expected volatility 33.6%
Expected dividend yield 2.7%
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of Datacraft’s share price over the previous
three years.
It was assumed that employees who voluntarily resign would have exercised their options before they resign if the share
price at the point of exercise exceeds the exercise price. It was further assumed that employees will only exercise their
options if the share price at that moment exceeds the exercise price by 15% (2007: 15%).
Performance Share Plan
On 20 January 2006, the shareholders of Datacraft approved a new performance share plan (‘Datacraft Asia Performance
Share Plan’) under which awards of fully paid-up shares will be granted, free of payment, to selected employees, when
and after pre-determined performance targets and/or service conditions are accomplished. The awards may be settled
with new shares, treasury shares or cash or combinations thereof at the sole discretion of Datacraft. During FY2008,
1,098,000 share awards were granted on 28 March 2008. Details are as follows:

38.3 Risk management of financial instruments
The Board has approved and monitored the risk management processes, including treasury policies, counterparty limits
and reporting structures in relation to the management of financial instruments risk.
The principal risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are liquidity risk, credit risk and market risk, which
included currency and interest rate risk.
These risks, and the way they are managed, are detailed below.
38.3.1 Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will be unable to meet its obligations associated with financial liabilities. Liquidity
risk management within the Group focuses on working capital metrics, cash balances and cash flow planning, coupled
with liquidity support arrangements including access to on-demand funding. Individual entities within the Group
ultimately source their liquidity requirements from the Group’s Central treasury. Dimension Data Annual Report 2008

The Group considers its liquid resources to be adequate to meet its financial liabilities now and for the foreseeable future.
Cession of assets
The Group has ceded the Campus property as security for the finance lease liability (refer to note 26).
In South Africa, as security for a bank loan amounting to $3.5 million (2007: $4.2 million), the Group has ceded certain
Campus sub-lease agreements with a present value of $6.1 million (2007: $8.0 million).
In 2007 in South Africa, as security for a working capital loan of $20.4 million, trade receivables of $83.0 million and
bank balances of $99.1 million, were ceded. The loan was disclosed as current in 2007 because of a technical breach
of covenant. The loan was repaid in the current period.
In the US, in respect of an extended credit facility, the Group has ceded an amount of $122.7 million (2007:
$121.3 million) of trade receivables and $7.7 million (2007: $3.4 million) of inventory. The facility is subject to various
covenants relating to working capital and liquidity ratios.
The Group had undrawn borrowing facilities at 30 September 2008 of $134.6 million (2007: $70.7 million).
38.3.2 Credit risk
The Group's financial assets are investments , loans, trade and other receivables, finance lease receivables, derivatives
and cash and cash equivalents.
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its obligations in respect of these instruments to the Group.
With regard to trade receivables, Group policy is only to deal with counterparties with an appropriate credit rating.
Furthermore, credit risk relating to trade receivables is considered lower than average due to the nature of our
clients, mostly being large blue chip corporates and government organisations. Our clients are also spread across
diverse industries and geographical areas. Appropriate credit checks are undertaken on potential customers before
sales commence.
The credit crisis which has affected the global economy and which has heightened in the past few months, has
increased the generic risk associated with trade receivables. The Group has reviewed the trade receivables outstanding,
net of impairment provisions, and consider these to be collectible and fairly stated at period end. Dimension Data Annual Report 2008

The credit risk on cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments is considered low. Group policy is to
invest only with high quality banks and money market funds. At 30 September, 36% of Group cash was held with
JP Morgan Chase & Co. and a further 47% amongst HSBC, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ),
Standard Bank of South Africa, Nedbank Group and the State Bank of India.
The negative bank balances in Europe are disclosed in cash and cash equivalents as these form part of the cash
management system and the net balance held in the the related financial institution is positive.
Cash balances with JP Morgan are restricted for the sole use of acquiring the minority interests in Datacraft Asia.
Financial assets, other than those at fair value through profit and loss, are assessed for indicators of impairment at
each balance sheet date. Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or
more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the
investment have been impacted.
Other than trade receivables, no financial assets have been impaired. Refer to Note 21 for details of trade receivables
impairments.
Details relating to exposure to vertical revenue concentration is detailed in Note 21.
As the Group has no collateral in respect of financial assets, the maximum exposure to credit risk equates to the total
fair value of financial assets.
38.3.3 Market risk
This is the risk that financial instruments fair values will fluctuate owing to changes in market prices. The significant
market risks to which the Group is exposed are currency risk and interest rate risk. These are discussed below.
38.3.3.1 Currency risk
The reporting currency of the Group is the US dollar. Other major currencies are the South African rand, Sterling,
Australian dollar and the Euro. Financial assets and liabilities are generally economically hedged using forward
exchange contracts back to the local functional currency and therefore there are limited transactional exposures that
would give rise to currency gains and losses in the income statement.
Speculative use of financial instruments or derivatives is not permitted and none occurred during the period.
The currency profile of the Group's financial instruments was as follows: Dimension Data Annual Report 2008

$'000 $'000
Assets 12,173 2,505
Liabilities (10,269) (3,975)
1,904 (1,470)
In certain operations, hedges of firm commitments to purchase product are designated as cash flow hedges. Gains
on these forward exchange contracts that are designated as effective cash flow hedges amounting to $0.3 million
(2007: $0.2 million) have been deferred in equity. Gains of $0.7 million (2007: $0.2 million) have been recognised in the
income statement for the ineffective portion of these cash flow hedges.
The Group has a number of loans between its subsidiaries. Where settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in
the foreseeable future these loans are part of the Group's net investment in those subsidiaries and the exchange
differences arising on those loans are included in translation differences in the statement of changes in equity. When
these loans are settled, or the underlying operation disposed of, translation differences previously included in equity
are included in the income statement. During the year an amount of $1.8 million was recycled through the income
statement as that loan was settled in the period.
38.3.3.2 Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of
changes in market interest rates. Other than the Campus lease obligation, the Group is not exposed to significant fixed
rate financial assets or liabilities. The Group does not make use of interest rate derivatives. Dimension Data Annual Report 2008

1,561,260 (1,091,000) 1,278,474 (1,078,479)
Interest rates on floating rate bank deposits are based on the relevant interbank rate.
The fixed interest rate financial assets relate to fixed term cash deposits which are typically less than three months in
duration.
The fixed rate financial liabilities include the capitalised finance lease in respect of the Campus (refer to Note 26).
Floating rate financial liabilities relate to bank loans, overdrafts and loans. Interest is based on the relevant interbank
rate.
Non-interest bearing financial assets and liabilities consist mainly of trade receivables and trade payables, respectively.
38.4 Sensitivity analysis
38.4.1 Earnings sensitivity of financial instruments to fluctuations in foreign currencies
– Sensitivities are calculated as at the period end and will alter as financial instrument balances fluctuate during the
period;
– Translation of the results of Group subsidiaries into the reporting currency of the Group have been excluded from
the sensitivity analysis; and
– The sensitivity assumes all other variables are held constant. 
Subsequent to period end, the US dollar strengthened materially against most trading currencies, and accordingly the
table below provides indicative sensitivity of the Group’s financial instruments to these exchange rate movements
against the US dollar.

The Group generates its earnings in a variety of currencies other than the US dollar, the most important of which are
the Euro, Sterling, Australian dollar and the South African rand. The Group does not hedge its earnings to the US dollar.
As a result, reported earnings in US dollars will fluctuate in line with fluctuations in exchange rates. Dimension Data Annual Report 2008

38.5 Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while
maximising the return to shareholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of the Group consists of cash and cash equivalents, debt, which includes the borrowings
disclosed in Notes 25,26 and 30 and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital,
reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the Statement of Changes in Equity, and Notes 23 and 24.
The most significant debt is the finance lease obligation in respect of the Campus.
39. DIVIDEND
A final dividend of 1.5 cents per share was paid on 14 March 2008.
The proposed dividend of 1.7 cents per share is subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting and has not
been included as a liability in these financial statements. In terms of the definition of a dividend for SA tax purposes, there may
be Secondary Tax on Companies payable on payment of the dividend, amounting to a maximum of 10%.
40. POST BALANCE SHEET EVENTS
On 22 July 2008 Dimension Data and Datacraft Asia Limited (‘Datacraft’) jointly announced that they had entered into an
agreement whereby Datacraft would become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dimension Data.  On 15 October 2008 the Datacraft
shareholders voted in favour of the offer by Dimension Data to purchase the remaining 44.9% interest that it did not already own.
On 6 November 2008 the Court sanctioned the scheme and the Datacraft shares were delisted on 11 November 2008,
whereafter the cash consideration will be settled.
In terms of the transaction, which was effected by way of a Scheme of Arrangement under Singapore law, shareholders were
offered $1.33 per share – a 34% premium to Datacraft’s closing share price of $0.99 on 21 July 2008.  The total cost of the
acquisition is approximately $276 million, and is being financed by cash, part of which was raised by an equity issuance 
(refer Note 23).
Amendments have been made to the Datacraft Share Option Schemes as follows:
– In-the-money vested options: Dimension Data will pay a cash amount of the difference between the consideration payable
and the exercise price.
– Out-of-the-money vested options: Holders will receive Dimension Data shares, based on a formula derived from the
consideration payable and the Dimension Data share price on the effective date.  This will occur when the options are
exercised, which will only be once they are in-the-money.
– Unvested options: On vesting, holders will receive Dimension Data shares, based on a formula derived from the
consideration payable and the Dimension Data share price on the effective date.
– Awards under the Datacraft Performance Share Plan: On vesting, holders will receive Dimension Data shares, based on a
formula derived from the consideration payable and the Dimension Data share price on the effective date. Dimension Data Annual Report 2008

EXPLANATORY NOTES
The purpose of each of the resolutions proposed at the Annual General Meeting is as follows:
Resolution 1
To receive and adopt the Annual Financial Statements for the financial year which ended on 30 September 2008. The Chairman will
take questions from shareholders after proposing resolution 1.
Resolution 2 – Authority to pay dividend
The Directors recommend the payment of a dividend of 1.7 US cents per share to be paid on 13 March 2009 to shareholders
registered on the share register at the close of business on 13 February 2009.
Resolution 3
To approve the Directors’ Remuneration Report for the year ended 30 September 2008. In line with the Directors’ Remuneration
Regulations 2002 and Section 241A of the Companies Act 1985, the Company is required to put a resolution to approve the
Directors’ Remuneration Report for the financial year to shareholders in a general meeting. The Remuneration Report for the year
ended 30 September 2008 is set out on pages 45 to 50 of the Annual Report.
Resolutions 4 to 7 – Reappointment of Directors
These resolutions will be proposed reappointing Stephen Joubert, Wendy Lucas-Bull, Rory Scott and Dorian Wharton-Hood who
retire at the Annual General Meeting in accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association. Rory Scott and Dorian Wharton-Hood
are standing for election on an annual term to expire at the Annual General Meeting in 2010 as they will reach the end of their ninth
year of appointment as independent non-executive directors in July 2009. The remuneration committee will be reviewing the
succession planning for independent non-executive directors during 2009.
Biographical details of each of the above directors and the rest of the Board are set out on pages 32 and 33 of the Annual Report,
and other relevant information is contained in the Directors’ Report, the Corporate Governance Report and the Directors’
Remuneration Report.
Resolutions 8 and 9 – Auditors
Resolution 8 will, if passed, reappoint Deloitte & Touche LLP as auditors of the Company and resolution 9 will authorise the Directors
to determine their remuneration. Company law requires that, at each general meeting at which accounts are laid, the Company should
appoint auditors who will remain in office until the next general meeting at which accounts are laid.
Resolution 10 – Authority to allot shares
This gives Directors the general authority to allot up to 169,445,900 ordinary shares or other relevant securities (being an amount
approximately equal to one tenth of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company as at 30 September 2008 exclusive of treasury
shares held by the Company). The Company did not hold treasury shares at 30 September 2008. The Directors have no present
intention to exercise the authority, other than to satisfy share options under the existing share option scheme. This authority, if given,
will expire at the next Annual General Meeting or 28 April 2010, whichever is earlier. This resolution will be proposed as an ordinary
resolution.
Resolution 11 – Authority to allot the shares for cash without first offering them to existing shareholders on a pro rata basis
Shares allotted for cash must normally be first offered to shareholders in proportion to their existing shareholdings. However,
resolution 11 proposes that an authority be given to the Directors to allot shares or other equity securities for cash to persons other
than existing shareholders without first offering them to existing shareholders up to a maximum of the authority granted under
resolution 10. Where the allotment is made otherwise than in connection with a rights issue, the shares allotted shall be up to a
maximum of 5% of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital as at 30 September 2008. The authority, which will terminate on the
date of the next Annual General Meeting or 28 April 2010, whichever is earlier, gives the Directors flexibility to take advantage of
business opportunities which may arise and the 5% limit ensures that existing shareholder interests are protected. This resolution will
be proposed as a special resolution.
Resolution 12 – Purchase of own shares
This resolution enables the Company to purchase up to 84,722,900 of its ordinary shares, being 5% of the issued share capital as
at 30 September 2008 in the market, either for cancellation, or to hold as treasury shares. The total number of outstanding options Dimension Data Annual Report 2008
110
to subscribe for equity shares in the Company at 30 September 2008 is 84,669,225 which represents 5.0% of issued share capital
of the Company (excluding treasury shares). If the authority to buy back shares is fully exercised, these would represent 5.3% of
issued share capital of the Company (excluding treasury shares). The Directors would only use this authority after careful
consideration, taking into account market conditions prevailing at the time, other investment opportunities, appropriate gearing levels
and the overall position of the Company. The Directors would only purchase such shares after taking into account the effects on
earnings per share and the benefits for shareholders. This authority, if given, will expire at the next Annual General Meeting or 28 April
2010, whichever is earlier. This resolution will be proposed as a special resolution.
RECOMMENDATION
Your Directors believe that all the proposals to be considered at the Annual General Meeting are in the best interests of the Company
and its shareholders as a whole. They recommend that you vote in favour of the proposed resolutions. The Directors intend to vote
their own shareholdings in the Company in favour of the proposed resolutions.
ATTENDANCE AT THE ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
The Annual General Meeting is being held in London. Shareholders unable to attend the meeting may appoint one or more proxies
to attend and vote instead of him or her. A proxy need not be a shareholder. A Proxy Form is enclosed with this Notice. Details of
proxy votes received will be displayed at the meeting, and will be available to shareholders following the meeting. Should the results
of a vote by show of hands at the meeting produce a result that would be materially different to that according to the proxy votes
held, a poll will be called. A video-conference facility to view the meeting in London from South Africa will be set up at The Wanderers,
The Campus, 57 Sloane Street, Bryanston, Sandton, South Africa. Shareholders attending at the viewing facility will be able to view
but will not be able to participate in the meeting. Immediately following the meeting the Directors present in London will be available
via the video-conference facility to answer questions from shareholders attending the South African video-conference.
ACTION TO BE TAKEN
You will find enclosed with this document a Proxy Form for use at the Annual General Meeting. Members who are registered on the
principal register of members in the UK and certificated and own name dematerialised shareholders who are registered on the South
African register are requested, whether or not they intend to be present at the Annual General Meeting, to complete the Proxy Form
in accordance with the instructions printed on it and return it to Computershare Investor Services PLC, PO Box 82, The Pavilions,

Computershare Investor Services (Proprietary) Limited, 70 Marshall Street, Johannesburg 2001 or PO Box 61051, Marshalltown 2107
(for members registered on the Company’s South African register of members), as soon as possible, but in any event so as to be
received not later than 15h00 (UK time), 17h00 (SA time) on 26 January 2009. The return of the completed form will not prevent you
from attending the Annual General Meeting and voting in person, should you so wish.
DEMATERIALISED SHARES IN STRATE ON THE SOUTH AFRICAN REGISTER
Members who have dematerialised their Dimension Data shares in Strate must instruct their CSDP or broker of their voting
instructions. Members should contact their CSDP or broker with regard to the cut-off time for receiving their instructions. If, however,
such members wish to attend the Annual General Meeting in person, then they will need to request their CSDP or broker to provide
them with the necessary authority in terms of the custody agreement entered into between the dematerialised shareholder and the
CSDP or broker.

  Chairman’s Statement
2 Fenner PLC
Following a solid first half performance, Group profit before tax for the
year increased 88% to £12.0m. We have benefited from an
unprecedented worldwide demand for energy particularly in China.
Our capital expenditure and rationalisation programmes have created
opportunities for productivity improvements throughout our operations.  
The acquisition of Wellington Holdings plc (“Wellington”) in May
has provided a valuable addition to our niche precision polymer
businesses. Our strengthened balance sheet leaves us well placed to
exploit these opportunities.
We are encouraged by our
strong start to the year and 
by current positive
indications for the future.
Colin Cooke
Chairman
TURNOVER AND
PROFITS
Group turnover increased
20% to £313.0m (2004
£260.6m) which includes £10.8m from the former Wellington businesses acquired on 20 May
2005. Turnover growth in our underlying businesses amounted to 16% reflecting the strong
recovery in the heavyweight belting market driven by global energy demands.  
Group operating profit for the year before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items
amounted to £21.3m (2004 £16.1m) including £1.9m from the former Wellington businesses.
After goodwill amortisation and exceptional items, Group operating profit amounted to
£15.8m (2004 £8.7m).
Turnover for the second half year reached £171.7m (2004 £139.8m) generating an
operating profit before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items of £14.7m (2004 £10.6m)
reflecting a strong second half performance characteristic of the markets in which the Group
operates.
Following an improved first half performance, our heavyweight belting businesses made
further progress building on the significant volume recovery particularly in North America.
Despite intense raw material price pressures, profit margins have continued to improve. 
The Precision Polymers businesses in both the UK and North America have performed
well, benefiting from a recovery in levels of industrial activity. 
The former Wellington businesses outperformed our expectations during the final
quarter of our financial year.
Exceptional items of £3.5m (2004 £6.2m) principally arose from impairment costs,
giving a Group profit before tax of £12.0m (2004 £6.4m). As a result of the much improved
operating performance, Group earnings per share before goodwill amortisation and
exceptional items increased to 9.34p per share (2004 7.67p) and after goodwill amortisation
and exceptional items to 5.28p (2004 2.19p).
Improvements

our operations Fenner PLC  3
DIVIDENDS
The Board recommends a final dividend maintained at 3.85p, which, together with the
interim dividend of 1.975p, represents a total for the year of 5.825p (2004 5.825p). The
underlying dividend cover is 1.6 after adjusting for goodwill amortisation, exceptional items
and the element relating to shares that were only in issue for three months of the year.
CASH RESOURCES AND INVESTMENT
We have raised a net £56.3m from shareholders during the year. £45.7m was invested in the
Wellington acquisition. The balance was applied to reducing our
existing debt levels whilst we examine the opportunities available
for further investment. Net borrowings at the year end amounted
to £33.9m (2004 £39.4m).
PEOPLE
The progress in improving our margin returns is a demonstration of the commitment by all
our employees, whom I thank for their efforts in this regard.
Our AGM in January 2006 will mark the retirement from the Board of Tom Glucklich,
who has been a non-executive director of the Company for over 10 years. I would like to
take this opportunity to thank Tom for his support and intellectual contribution during that
period and to wish him every success for the future.
I am pleased to announce the appointment on 1 November 2005 of David Campbell as
a non-executive director of the Company.  David was formerly Chief Executive of British Vita
PLC and following the retirement of Tom Glucklich in January 2006, will chair the Company’s
Remuneration Committee.
OUTLOOK
We have made a strong start to the new year with many of our markets showing continuing,
robust strength. A buoyant energy sector has been a significant factor
in our recent growth and the confidence of our customers in this area is
an encouraging sign. Asian demand has provided the opportunity for
further new developments as the region becomes a more significant
part of the Group. Overall we look forward to another year of healthy
progress as we consolidate the benefits of our acquisition strategy.

year
Chief Executive Officer’s Review
4  Fenner PLC
Fenner Advanced Sealing Technologies service a wide range of
industries worldwide including mobile hydraulics, industrial
processing, materials handling, well servicing, forestry, aircraft fuel
systems, oil and gas, earthmoving and mining. 2005 saw a transformation in the Group with the acquisition of
Wellington Holdings plc in May. As a result we have now increased
the high-margin Precision Polymer’s turnover to a third of the Group’s.
We believe this also improves our profit and cash generating ability
and provides a further platform for growth.
Since the acquisition, the Wellington business, now renamed
Fenner Advanced Sealing Technologies, has performed above our
initial expectations and has already started to deliver the synergies
envisaged.
During the year we saw many of our markets strengthen as the combination of Chinese
demand and surging energy prices benefited many of our operations, both directly and 
indirectly. These developments have been particularly favourable to our Asia Pacific 
businesses, encouraging us to expand further our operations in China with three additional
new major projects in progress, which are detailed below.
ASIA PACIFIC
Our Chinese conveyor belting operation continued to gain momentum with strong sales
growth. As China’s burgeoning economy surged ahead on the strength of its exports and
insatiable demand for energy, coal producers
endeavoured to match the requirements. The
ensuing drive for coal productivity
improvements has proved beneficial for our
heavy duty products, as existing and new
customers realise the value of utilising higher
performance belting. This upward trend has
supported our capital investment to date with
further plant expansion planned to service our broadening customer base in this
increasingly important territory for the Group.
The hose operation in Shanghai received additional investment during the year to
accommodate output levels which are increasing as new business is gained. Slow but
steady progress is being made towards tighter truck emissions
legislation that requires changes to be made to original equipment
manufacturers’ designs, which in turn increases demand for our
products. These positive developments underpin our capital expenditure
programme for the commissioning of a dedicated world-class
manufacturing hose facility capable of meeting market demand.
The acquisition of Wellington Holdings plc brought numerous new
and exciting opportunities to the Group. These included the identification of gaps in their
geographical coverage in locations where we have existing knowledge and expertise. To
exploit these distinctive competencies, plans are underway for further penetration of seals’
markets in China with the construction of a new plant.

Chief Executive Officer
“...dedicated

manufacturing
hose facility...”
Above: Manufactured at the Fenner Shanghai facility, this Fenaplast conveyor belt is in operation underground
at the Shenhua Yujialiang mine in Inner Mongolia. Currently, over 100km of Fenner Chinese-manufactured
belting is running underground and constantly setting new records of service life and coal output. Production of computer peripherals has progressively migrated to South East Asia in recent
years, and the overwhelming majority of our mini-pitched timing belts are shipped into the
region. Accordingly, our presence has been strengthened in South East Asia to support
existing office equipment accounts and to identify and develop new business opportunities.
Australia recorded a solid return from both the heavyweight conveyor belting and 
service operations. Strong coal market
conditions, enhanced by lower Chinese
coal exports in order to serve their
domestic demand, facilitated a year-on-
year improvement in this sector. The
performance was particularly
encouraging in our network of national
service operations where the focus is
on the provision of solutions tailored to
meet our customers’ existing and future
requirements. This network was further
strengthened during the year through the acquisition of L&K Conveyor Services which has
enhanced our presence in Western Australia and provides a strong foundation for further
penetration of this territory.
Our Indian conveyor belting operation enjoyed a successful first full year as a wholly
owned subsidiary, following the prior year’s restructuring of the Group’s interest.
NORTH AMERICA
Our conveyor belting operations experienced a continuation of the market and productivity
improvements from the latter part of the previous year although rising oil prices caused
upward pressure on input costs. Sales to the mining sector were particularly strong as
reinvestment programmes commenced, underpinned by the buoyant global demand for
energy which has held coal prices at near record levels. Sales to industrial markets
improved through a combination of the recovery in the economic conditions and the
increasing value of our organisational support structure. A dedication to solving all
conveying challenges, with the use of the latest technology,
has uniquely positioned the business to develop key
partnerships with our customers.
Precision polymer operations encountered more
volatile demand patterns as US markets faced rising oil prices and consequent raw material
price inflation. Despite these effects, the industrial products group successfully continued to
deploy their strategy of product line expansion and channel exploitation. The development
programme included the launch of two new products in the year. The T-Max range of belt
and chain tensioners was expanded through the launch of the innovative, light-duty RT-3000
rotary tensioner. A new, patented variant of PowerTwist link belt has been developed
specifically to meet the market demand for roller conveyor systems to carry higher loads,
faster and more quietly.
“...key partnerships 
with our customers...”
6  Fenner PLC
Chief Executive Officer’s Review
Above: BHP Billiton iron ore blending and ship loading facility at Port Hedland, Western Australia, where
Apex Fenner Conveyor Services are contracted for condition monitoring and cleaning solutions for their
entire conveyor system. The contract was won in 2005, following the L & K Conveyor Services acquisition,
at a value A$6.8m The markets have responded favourably to both
of these carefully targeted product launches.
These, together with our marketing alliances, have
contributed to incremental sales growth. Market
demand in the office equipment segment was
slow in the first few months of the year, but
recovered considerably in the second half. Our
continuous improvement programme increased
production yields, but nevertheless, capacity was
flexed to meet customer demand for mini-pitch
timing belts. Planning is now well advanced for a
building extension to accommodate an increase in capacity with completion scheduled for
2006.
The newly-acquired seals operations benefited from buoyant energy markets. To
enhance growth further new applications, including the semi conductor processing industry,
were developed. The design of new sealing solutions, such as the patented SigmaSeal is
encouraging. This seal, which is generating interest in new markets, has unique
self-energising and low friction properties suitable to the control valve industry.
EUROPE
The environment for our UK based heavyweight conveyor belting operation became 
increasingly difficult during the year with declining demand from both the UK and German
coal industries. Against this, the demand from our worldwide potash customers remained
robust and further penetration of Eastern European, Ukrainian and Russian coal markets was
achieved. Whilst raw material prices increased significantly during the year, sales pricing
action coupled with improved purchasing enabled margins to be maintained. 
Weak economic conditions prevailed in most of our major European industrial markets,
which together with the threat from the competition
over an otherwise flat market, led to a difficult year for
our Dutch operation. As a consequence, action to
address the cost base was implemented in the
second half through a reduction in the workforce
whilst overall productivity improvements were
achieved through additional investment in new plant
and systems.
James Dawson at Lincoln built upon the solid
foundations established in recent years to record a
good performance overall. Demand from the speciality vehicle and business machine
markets was generally strong allowing the benefits from recent capital investment
programmes to be realised. Further recognition of the accomplishments of this operation
was gained in the year with the Queen’s Award for Enterprise in International Trade.

6 The Poynton (Cheshire) hose facility, which was acquired in February 2004, continued to
perform well. The projected market synergy between Poynton’s EPDM hose and Lincoln’s 
silicone hose products is now beginning to be realised and is expected to lead to continued
steady growth of sales of Poynton products.
Fenner Drives Europe, formerly BTL in Leeds, experienced a continuing reduction in
demand from traditional markets, reflecting the general decline in UK manufacturing.
However, this decline was more than offset as programmes of innovative marketing, product
line expansion and increased activity in Europe took effect.
At the end of the year, the UK operations of both James Dawson and Fenner Drives
were restructured. James Dawson now operates exclusively in the world markets for
commercial and speciality vehicles, focusing upon capitalising on recent investments in the
specialist hose business. The industrial rubber and business machine products of James
Dawson have been brought under the responsibility of Fenner Drives Europe.
Sales from our European seals operations exceeded expectations in the period since 
acquisition with strong demand from longwall mining
equipment and the oil and gas industry. As we enter the new
year, the planned relocation of the UK operation to a new 
facility is progressing satisfactorily. The factory and offices
which are currently under construction at Hampton will
replace the existing network of 1920’s buildings. The benefits of the move will follow the
completion which is scheduled for the second half of 2006.
AFRICA
An increase in demand for energy in South Africa caused a heightened activity in the
region’s coal mining industry and the
commissioning of previously mothballed power
generation plants. This environment enabled the
achievement of a further successful year by our
conveyor belting operation, despite the keen
competition within the local market.
The Group’s other South African operation,
KSB, improved as the year progressed 
following softer volumes into agricultural markets
in the early months and higher contract volumes
in the second half-year.
Significant progress has been made during the last year with an increasingly encouraging
trend in performance. As we enter the new financial year we do so with confidence that most
of our businesses are seeing healthy market conditions with opportunities for growth.

10  Fenner PLC
The Group advanced significantly during the year with the acquisition
of Wellington Holdings plc. Our integration of the business has
progressed satisfactorily and an excellent performance has been
achieved in the initial period of ownership. With the improved
performance of our existing businesses, the overall result is most
encouraging. 
OPERATING CASH FLOW 
A robust operating profit before goodwill amortisation and exceptional
items of £21.3m (2004 £16.1m) facilitated a healthy operating cash
inflow. Working capital levels did increase with higher stock and debtors which reflected the
increase in trading activity, coupled with tighter credit terms arising from capacity constraints
in our supplier base.
Exceptional items of £3.5m (2004 £6.2m) largely related to property and plant
impairments. Of this amount, £1.0m resulted in a cash outflow in the period.
Overall the Group generated a cash inflow from operations of £21.3m (2004 £14.2m).
ACQUISITIONS AND GOODWILL
During 2005 the Group acquired the entire issued share capital of Wellington Holdings plc
for a consideration of £45.7m (including acquisition expenses) and made two smaller
acquisitions for £0.3m.
Goodwill arising on these transactions amounted to £41.6m.
FUNDING AND RESOURCES
During the year the Company raised £56.3m from shareholders in a placing and open offer
of new ordinary shares. The proceeds were principally used to fund the purchase of
Wellington Holdings plc.
The acquisition necessitated our having to formally anticipate the repayment of the
US$50m Private Placement Note in March 2006. This, together with the continuing capital
expenditure programme and potential for further bolt-on acquisitions, required us to secure a
new £60m five year committed Revolving Credit facility with three leading UK banks. This
has also replaced several uncommitted bank lines and gives us more flexibility for the
Company’s future debt financing options.
The Group’s gross borrowings at 31 August 2005 were £86.0m offset by cash and
deposits of £52.1m, giving net borrowings of £33.9m. Approximately 48% of the gross
borrowings is currently at a fixed interest rate.
PENSIONS
The Group has continued to account for pensions in accordance with SSAP 24. Following the
acquisition of Wellington Holdings plc, the Group has inherited further pension obligations.
The major scheme relates to the UK; a defined benefit arrangement which on 31 March 2000
was closed to new members. Existing members’ pensions continue to be accrued on a final
salary basis for the qualifying service up to 31 March 2000, with eligibility to participate in a
defined contribution scheme thereafter.
In accordance with the principles of FRS 7 “Fair Values in Acquisition Accounting” the deficit

Group Finance Director Fenner PLC  11
of £2.1m in this scheme has been included within the provisional fair value of net assets
acquired.
The manner in which pension arrangements are reflected in the Group’s accounts will
change when the substantive requirements of FRS 17 “Retirement Benefits” are adopted
under International Financial Reporting Standards. Note 27b of the accounts gives the
funding position and pension cost in accordance with FRS 17 principles.
TAXATION 
The Group’s taxation charge for the year was £4.5m (2004 £3.1m) after offsetting a tax credit
of £0.4m in respect of exceptional items. Before exceptionals and goodwill amortisation, the
tax rate was 28% (2004 29%).
TREASURY POLICY
The Group has a central treasury function which operates in accordance with Board
approved policies. Its principal objective is to minimise financial risk. Where appropriate,
derivative transactions are undertaken to reduce interest rate and currency rate risks arising
from the Group’s operations and sources of finance. No speculative trading is undertaken.
The interest cost arising on borrowings is managed on a net basis through the use,
where appropriate, of swaps to reduce the interest rate risk.
Deposits of funds are made with banks and financial institutions approved by the Board
and within set credit limits. Bank and loan facilities are monitored on a regular basis and
maintained at a level which provides adequate funding for seasonal variations in borrowings
whilst allowing for acquisitions and organic expansion.
The Group’s principal foreign currency exposures arise on the translation of overseas
profits and net assets into sterling, the translation of intra-group lending (principally from the
UK to overseas subsidiaries) and from trading transactions in foreign currencies. The Group
normally only hedges the accounting exposure on the translation of overseas profits to the
extent that such profits are offset by interest charges on foreign currency borrowings.
Where cost effective, overseas net assets are hedged by foreign currency borrowings and
intra-group lending is matched by external borrowings in the same currency. Currency
exposures arising from trading transactions are continually monitored and material
exposures are hedged once cash flows can be identified with sufficient certainty.
During the year the derivatives used by the Group have been forward foreign exchange
contracts, options and interest rate swaps.
INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS (IFRS)
For accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2005 all European listed
companies are required to use IFRS to prepare their consolidated financial statements. For
Fenner this means that the 2006 Interim Report, the 2006 Annual Report and all subsequent
reports including all comparative information will be prepared using IFRS. The Group has
continued its preparatory work to ensure full compliance with these requirements.

The Group is committed to comply with the Principles of Corporate Governance as set out in the 2003 Financial
Reporting Council’s Combined Code as incorporated into the FSA Listing Rules (“Combined Code”) and continues to
recognise the importance of high standards of corporate governance. This statement explains how the Principles of
Corporate Governance are applied within the Group and areas of non compliance are explained.
Directors & Directors’ Independence
The Board usually comprises the non-executive Chairman, two executive directors and two non-executive directors and
is responsible to shareholders for the proper management of the Group. Speciﬁc matters are reserved for the Board’s
consideration under a formal schedule including Group strategy, reviewing trading performance, considering senior
management appointments, formulating policy on key issues including the approval of signiﬁcant capital expenditure,
acquisitions and disposals and reporting to shareholders.
The Board is headed by a non-executive Chairman who was independent upon appointment and whose role is distinct
and separate from that of the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer. The other non-executive directors are also independent. Thomas
Glucklich, a non-executive director is the senior independent director of the company and is considered by the Board
to be independent in both character, judgement and contribution despite having served for 10 years. Thomas Glucklich
will be retiring from the Board at the forthcoming AGM. David Campbell was appointed to the Board on 1st November
2005 and was independent upon appointment. The Chairman and the non-executive directors are independent of
management and do not have any business relationships which could interfere with the exercise of their judgement.
Biographical details of the directors are set out on page 12.
Non-executive directors receive appropriate brieﬁngs on the Group and its operations when they are appointed to the
Board. They are encouraged to visit the Group’s ofﬁces and factories whenever the opportunity presents itself, where
they are briefed on local business operations. All directors have access to the Company Secretary, who is responsible
for ensuring that Board procedures are followed and that the Group complies with all applicable rules, regulations and
obligations governing its operations. A procedure exists for directors to take independent professional advice, at the
Group’s expense, if necessary, in the furtherance of their duties. The Board is provided with timely and appropriate
information prior to each Board, Committee or General Meeting covering the items on the agenda for such meetings.
The Board is in the process of identifying a suitable and meaningful board evaluation process. The Nomination
Committee appraised the requirements of the Board during the year as part of the recruitment process for a new non
executive director.
All directors are subject to election by shareholders at the ﬁrst Annual General Meeting following their appointment and
to re-election thereafter at intervals of no more than three years. 
The Board has a number of committees consisting of directors and senior executives. Details of their composition and
purpose are outlined below. In addition the Chairman and the non-executive directors meet from time to time without
the executive directors being present.
Group Executive
The Executive Committee is chaired by Mark Abrahams. It consists of the two executive directors, the Company
Secretary and ﬁve members of the Group’s senior management. The Executive Committee meets at least 6 times a year
and deals with the daily management of the Group through powers delegated to it by the Board.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises the Chairman and the non-executive directors and is chaired by David Buttﬁeld who
has recent and relevant ﬁnancial experience. Due to the size of the Company and the number of non-executive
directors, the Board has decided that the Chairman of the Company should remain a member of the Committee.
The terms of reference of the Audit Committee cover all the main points recommended by the Combined Code. Its
principal duties are to monitor the integrity of the ﬁnancial statements, to review the internal controls and risk
management systems, to review the work of internal audit and to consider all aspects of the relationship with the
external auditor. The Committee has the authority to obtain external legal or other professional advice on any matter
within its terms of reference. 
Corporate Governance
  There is a policy on the provision of non-audit services by the external auditor. Certain services such as due diligence
in relation to acquisitions and disposals, taxation and actuarial advice are permitted but others, for example, internal
audit, information technology and HR consultancy are generally considered inappropriate. Non-audit fees are reported
to the Committee.
The Committee has received and reviewed written conﬁrmation from the external auditor on all relationships that in their
judgement may bear on its independence. The external auditor has also conﬁrmed that it considers itself independent
within the meaning of UK regulatory and professional requirements.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee, which consists of the Chairman, the non-executive directors and the Group Chief
Executive Ofﬁcer, is chaired by Colin Cooke. The duty of the Committee is to make recommendations to the Board
regarding the appointment of new Board members. Given the size of the Board and the Company, it is felt both
appropriate and prudent to have Mark Abrahams on the Committee to work with the Chairman and non-executive
directors on senior recruitment issues. Written terms of reference were adopted during the year clearly setting out the
role and scope of the Committee. There were three meetings during the year to identify and recruit a new non-executive
director to replace Thomas Glucklich when he retires at the forthcoming AGM. The Committee was assisted by
Spencer Stuart Consultants in identifying a short list of candidates who met the proﬁle being sought by the Board.
David Campbell was subsequently selected and joined the Board on 1 November 2005.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee consists of the Chairman and non-executive directors and is chaired by Thomas
Glucklich. David Campbell will become the Chairman of the Committee when Thomas Glucklich retires. The Group
Chief Executive Ofﬁcer also attends the meetings by invitation.
The Committee is responsible to the Board for determining the remuneration packages of the executive directors and
other senior executives and advises on executive remuneration policy issues. It also approves the granting of share
options to employees within the Group and administers the Group’s Long Term Share Incentive Plan (LTIP).
The Remuneration Committee during the year received advice from MM&K Ltd who assisted the Committee in
consideration of matters relating to directors’ incentives and Mercer Human Resource Consulting, who conducted a
review of executive directors’ remuneration.
Directors’ remuneration
The Board Remuneration Report is set out on pages 17 to 22.
Relations with shareholders
The Company encourages regular dialogue with its institutional shareholders and also with private investors at the
Annual General Meeting. Update meetings are held with institutional shareholders following the announcement of
interim and ﬁnal results and as requested throughout the year. Similar meetings are held with private client brokers so
that the same information can be disseminated to private investors. Recent analyst presentations are also made
available on the www.fenner.com website. The Group website was revised during the year and now provides
comprehensive investor relations information for shareholders to view. The website includes the current share price,
regulatory announcements, ﬁnancial performance information, shareholder information and an investor relations
contact address.

Annual General Meeting
In relation to the Company’s Annual General Meeting:
- the proxy count in respect of each resolution is announced after it has been dealt with on a show of hands;
- a separate resolution is proposed for each substantially separate issue, including the receipt of the annual 
report and accounts;
- all executive and non-executive Board members normally attend the Meeting; and
- the Notice of the Meeting, the annual report and accounts and any other related papers are normally sent to 
shareholders more than one month before the Meeting.
Accountability and audit
Directors’ responsibilities in respect of the ﬁnancial statements
Company law requires the directors to prepare ﬁnancial statements for each ﬁnancial year which give a true and fair
view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group and of the proﬁt or loss of the Group for that period. In
preparing those ﬁnancial statements, the directors are required to:
- select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
- make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
- state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the ﬁnancial statements; and
- prepare the ﬁnancial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the 
Company and the Group will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any
time the ﬁnancial position of the Company and the Group and enable them to ensure that the ﬁnancial statements
comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the
Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The maintenance and integrity of the Fenner PLC website is the responsibility of the directors; the work carried out by
the auditors does not involve consideration of these matters and accordingly, the auditors accept no responsibility for
any changes that may have occurred to the ﬁnancial statements since they were initially presented on the website.
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of ﬁnancial statements may differ from legislation in
other jurisdictions.
Going concern
After making enquiries, the directors have formed a judgment at the time of approving the ﬁnancial statements that
there is a reasonable expectation that the Company and Group have adequate resources to continue in operational
existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, the directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in
preparing the ﬁnancial statements.
Internal control
The Board continues to review the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal control and evaluates the Internal
Control report at least twice a year. This review covers all controls, including operational, ﬁnancial, compliance and risk
management.
As required by the UK Listing Authority, the Group has complied with the Combined Code provisions on internal control
having established the procedures necessary to implement the guidance contained in “Guidance for Directors on the
Combined Code” issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales and by reporting in
accordance with that guidance.
The directors are responsible for the Group’s system of internal control which, like any system of internal control, can
only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
The directors have reviewed the effectiveness of the system of internal control in operation during the year and up to
the date of approval of the annual report. Corporate Governance
continued
16   Fenner PLC
The key procedures within the control structure are:
- the identiﬁcation of major business and insurance risks faced by the Group’s operations, by both the Board and 
senior management, and the determination of the most appropriate course of action to deal with these risks;
- central review and approval procedures in respect of major areas of risk, such as acquisitions and disposals, 
litigation, treasury management, taxation and environmental issues;
- a clear management structure with well deﬁned lines of responsibility and the appropriate levels of delegation;
- regular review of the Group’s business units by operational and executive management;
- a structured process for appraising and authorising capital projects. This process includes clearly deﬁned 
authorisation levels. Projects are subject to post investment appraisals;
- well established consolidation and reporting systems for both the statutory and monthly management accounts, 
with all Board members receiving a monthly statement of the ﬁnancial results;
- comprehensive budgeting systems with an annual budget approved by the Board. Monthly results are reported 
against budget and revised forecasts for the year are prepared regularly; and
- an internal programme of monitoring visits by the Internal Audit team was agreed with the Audit Committee, 
which review the compliance of each business unit with standard internal ﬁnancial control procedures adopted 
by the Group.
Compliance with the Combined Code
The Group has complied with the main provisions of the Combined Code in force during the year ended 31 August
2005 that are appropriate for a Group of this size. The Group has sought to explain non-compliance with the Board
evaluation process, the inclusion of the Chief Executive on the nomination committee and the inclusion of the Chairman
on the audit committee and will continue to work towards full compliance with the spirit of the Combined Code. Board Remuneration Report
The Board presents its report on directors’ remuneration which has been prepared following the provisions of
Schedule B of the Combined Code issued in July 2003 and the provisions of the Directors’ Remuneration Report
Regulations 2002. Details of the Remuneration Committee’s responsibilities are given on page 14.
The parts of this report covering directors’ detailed emoluments, share schemes and pensions are audited.
Members of the remuneration committee
The members of the remuneration committee during the year were: Thomas Glucklich (Chairman), Colin Cooke and
David Buttﬁeld 
During the year the Remuneration Committee took advice from an independent external source, as noted on page 14.
Remuneration policy
Executive directors
The Company’s policy on remuneration is to attract, retain and incentivise executives with the experience and
necessary skills to operate and develop the Company’s businesses to their maximum potential, thereby delivering the
highest level of return for shareholders.
Consistent with this policy, beneﬁt packages awarded to executives are intended to be competitive and comprise a
mix of performance-related and non-performance related remuneration designed to incentivise them, but not to detract
from the goals of Corporate Governance.
During the year, Mercer Human Resource Consulting was commissioned to produce a report on comparative pay for
executive directors of companies similar to Fenner. The report conﬁrmed that the pay levels of the executive directors
were not above those of their peers.
The Committee also takes account of the pay levels of senior management of the Fenner Group when establishing the
executive directors’ remuneration. 
It is the Committee’s current intention to continue to reward the executive directors with an annual performance related
bonus plan, linked to operating proﬁt, earnings per share and cash targets, and a long-term share incentive plan
(LTIP). The shares allocated under the LTIP will be awarded to an executive after a period of three years and will be
dependent on the comparative performance of the Company’s  total shareholder return (TSR) against the TSR of
companies comprising the FTSE All Share Engineering and Machinery sector (The Peer Group) over the period from
the provisional allocation date to the ﬁnal award date. The Committee considers that TSR, which comprises of inter alia
dividend yield and share price movement in comparison with The Peer Group, is the best measure of long term
performance as it aligns the interests of executives with shareholders and recognises market conditions in the Group’s
industrial sector.
The targeted composition of each director’s remuneration is as follows:
Non-performance related Performance related
Mark Abrahams  60%  40%
Richard Perry 60%  40%
Chairman and Non-executive directors
The Chairman and non-executive directors are usually appointed for a ﬁxed three year term.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined by the Board as a whole, having regard to the
packages awarded by other UK listed companies of similar size and complexity.
The non-executive directors do not participate in any of the Group’s bonus, share option or incentive schemes, nor do
they accrue any pension entitlement.

Directors’ service contracts
The executive directors have rolling 12 month contracts, in addition the Company has agreed to the payment of a
prescribed sum equivalent to 12 months salary and contractual beneﬁts if there is a change of control or termination of
their contracts by the company other than for cause. 
The service contracts do not contain any provision for compensation on early termination other than the notice period,
and the provision noted above, however the Committee will seek to mitigate cost to the Company whilst dealing fairly
with each individual case.
The details of the service contracts in relation to the executive directors and letters of appointment in relation to the
Chairman and non-executive directors, who served as directors during the year are:

* Colin Cooke’s services are provided by way of an agreement between the Company, Steels Management Limited and
Colin Cooke.
External appointments
Fenner recognises that its executive directors are likely to be invited to become non-executive directors of other
companies and that such appointments can broaden experience and knowledge, which may beneﬁt Fenner. Therefore
executive directors may, subject to approval by the Board and providing there is no conﬂict of interest, be allowed to
accept appointments as a non-executive director of another company and are normally allowed to retain the fees paid
from such appointments. In normal circumstances, they may not accept more than one appointment. Currently the
Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, Mark Abrahams, is non-executive Chairman of Inditherm plc and retained fees of £35,000 in
relation to Inditherm plc’s year ending 31 December 2004. The Group Finance Director, Richard Perry, was appointed
as a non-executive director of Scapa Group plc on 1 June 2005 and will retain the fees.
Remuneration components for executive directors
The major components of the executive directors’ remuneration are:
Basic annual salary and beneﬁts
The basic annual salary is subject to an annual review which takes into account the performance of the Group and the
individual and salary trends in comparable companies. In addition, a car allowance, healthcare insurance and other
beneﬁts are available in line with normal corporate practice.
Annual performance related bonus
Performance related cash bonuses are reviewed annually. Demanding performance targets are set, which must be
achieved before the maximum bonus is payable. The conﬁrmed criteria include targets linked to the Group’s
performance in terms of operating proﬁt and earnings per share. The target bonus for achievement of the annual
budget for these measures is 35% of basic annual salary and the maximum potential payment for the annual bonus is
60% of basic annual salary, excluding beneﬁts in kind and pension contributions. 
Long Term Share Incentive Plan
The Long Term Share Incentive Plan (LTIP) is designed to encourage its participants to deliver sustained long term
performance. Rewards under the LTIP are linked to the Company’s performance over three year periods (Plan Cycles). As near as
practicable to the start of a Plan Cycle, the Remuneration Committee notiﬁes each participant of the provisional
allocation of ordinary shares which could be distributed to him after the end of the Plan Cycle if the performance target
is met. The performance target is intended to be demanding. The provisional allocation of ordinary shares is based on
a percentage (maximum 100%) of the participant’s basic annual salary and the value of the Company’s ordinary shares
at the start of the Plan Cycle.
The performance measurement for each of the Plan Cycles is the Company’s TSR which is compared with the TSR of
The Peer Group. In the opinion of the Remuneration Committee, the FTSE All Share Engineering and Machinery Index is
the most appropriate index against which the TSR of the Company should be measured because it is an index of
businesses similar in nature to Fenner and which represent alternative investment options for our shareholders.
100% of the provisional allocation of ordinary shares may be distributed only if the Company’s performance places it
within the top 16 per cent of the companies in The Peer Group. Participants will not receive any ordinary shares if the
Company’s ranking is below the median (i.e. the point which divides The Peer Group into two equal halves such that
50% of the companies are above this point and 50% are below it). Between these two points there is a piecewise linear
relationship between the number of shares vesting and the percentile ranking of Fenner amongst the Peer Group.
There have been no departures from the Company’s policy on awarding beneﬁts under long-term incentive schemes
during the year. In the event that a director resigns, the awards will lapse.
The performance chart below illustrates the Company’s total shareholder return over the past ﬁve years compared to
the performance of The Peer Group. In addition to the statutory requirement to plot data over ﬁve ﬁnancial year ends,
the graph and table below reﬂect data for each of the Plan Cycle dates for the LTIP. The Plan Cycle dates are aligned
with the Group’s Preliminary Announcement, which the Remuneration Committee believes are the most appropriate
points for benchmarking the LTIP. This is because at these dates there is full disclosure of relevant price sensitive
information to the market as a whole.
Share options
Since the creation of the LTIP no options have been granted to the executive directors and they are no longer eligible to
participate in the Share Option Scheme for new options.
Pensions
The executive directors participate in the deﬁned beneﬁts section of the Fenner Pension Scheme, an Inland Revenue
approved mixed beneﬁts scheme, on the same terms as other senior executives. The Scheme provides for a maximum
pension of two-thirds of remuneration at or near retirement age of 62. For both of the executive directors, pensionable
salary and beneﬁts from the Fenner Pension Scheme are restricted by the Inland Revenue earnings cap, consequently
payments are made to funded unapproved retirement beneﬁt schemes (FURBS) to provide top-up pension beneﬁts in
excess of the Inland Revenue limits.

***By an agreement between the Company, Steels Management Limited and Colin Cooke dated 24 June 1993, as
amended by subsequent supplemental agreements between the same parties the last one being dated 21 December
2004, Steels Management Limited agreed to provide the services of Colin Cooke as a non-executive director and 
Chairman of the Company until the AGM 2008. Steels Management Limited may at any time terminate the agreement by
giving 12 months notice in writing to the Company. In the year ended 31 August 2005 £90,100 (2004 £90,100), including
a £5,100 car allowance, was payable under this agreement. No remuneration was paid directly to Colin Cooke, nor were
any pension contributions paid on his account. The non-executive directors do not participate in any Company pension
scheme, nor do they receive beneﬁts in kind.
No director waived emoluments in respect of the year ended 31 August 2005.

Total of awards in year 63,645 76,374
The number of shares provisionally allocated was adjusted under the rules of the long term incentive plan following the
Share Placing and Open Offer.
The performance criteria attached to the shares that were awarded on 16 November 2004 and those provisionally
allocated on 10 November 2004 relate to the Company’s TSR, which is compared with the TSR of The Peer Group.
There have been no variations in the terms and conditions of scheme interests during the year. All awards under long-term
incentive plans were in respect of qualifying services.
The Plan Cycle ending on 16 November 2004 was independently evaluated and an award of shares made representing
24% of the original award of shares was made on 14 December 2004. The market value (as deﬁned in the Rules of the
Plan) of an Ordinary Share of the Company at the beginning of the Plan Cycle was 103.9p, at the end of the Plan Cycle
was 120.00p and the market value used on 16 November 2004 for the new Plan Cycle was 127.7p (125.16p after
adjustment for the Share Placing and Open Offer).
The Performance Graph on page 18 showing TSR gives an indication of whether each LTIP Plan Cycle will achieve the
performance criteria, based upon the share price at 31 August 2005.
Given the nature of the performance calculation, it could be misleading to indicate a likely outcome for future share
awards.

Additional accrued beneﬁts earned in year earned in year less directors’ contributions
£ £
Mark Abrahams  2,700  26,400
Richard Perry    3,500  36,200
The accrued pension entitlement is the amount that the director would be paid annually on retirement based on service
to 31 August 2005. The Listing Rules require the increase in this amount to be disclosed excluding inﬂation. The
beneﬁts do not allow for any retained beneﬁts which the directors may have relating to previous employment. The
pension beneﬁts exclude any additional pension purchased by additional voluntary contributions.
The increase in the accrued entitlement is the difference between the accrued entitlement at the year end (31 August
2005) and the accrued entitlement at the previous year end (31 August 2004).
The pension beneﬁts are based on the directors’ pensionable salaries which are limited to the Inland Revenue earnings
cap (currently £105,600 per annum).
All transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note
GN11. The transfer values of the accrued entitlement represent the value of assets that the pension scheme would
need to transfer to another pension provider on transferring the scheme’s liability in respect of the directors’ pension
beneﬁts. They do not represent sums payable to individual directors and, therefore, cannot be added meaningfully to
annual remuneration.
The transfer value of the increase in accrued beneﬁts, required by the Listing Rules, discloses the current value of the
increase in accrued beneﬁts that the director has earned in the period, whereas the change in his transfer value,
required by the Companies Act discloses the absolute increase or decrease in his transfer value and includes the
change in value of the accrued beneﬁts that results from market volatility affecting the transfer value at the beginning of
the period, as well as the additional value earned in the year.
The Company also makes contributions to funded unapproved retirement beneﬁt schemes (FURBS) in respect of the
executive directors. The contributions made by the Company, excluding the annual performance related bonus, were:

Directors’ Report
Fenner PLC   23 Supplier payment policy
Given the international nature of the Group’s operations, the Group does not operate a standard code in respect of
payments to suppliers. Individual operating businesses are responsible for agreeing the terms and conditions under
which transactions with their suppliers are conducted, including the terms of payment. It is the Group’s policy that
payments to suppliers are made in accordance with these terms. The average creditor days for the Group during the year
ended 31 August 2005 was 52 days (2004 54 days). The Company does not have any trade creditors.
Employment policy
The Group operates worldwide and its employment policies are designed to meet local conditions and requirements but
are established on the basis of the best practices in each country. Wherever the Group operates, it encourages the
provision of equal employment opportunities regardless of sex, race, religion or age. 
The Group’s policy is to secure good relations between management and all employees, to promote a better
understanding of all the issues, both internal and external, that inﬂuence the Group’s business performance and to
improve performance and productivity. Formal and informal meetings are used to consult employees and to keep them
informed about the performance of the Group. The practices of consultation and involvement vary from country to
country according to local customs, legal considerations and the size of the operation. The regular worldwide issue of a
Group newspaper assists the process of communication, as do brieﬁng meetings, information bulletins and meetings
with employee representatives.
The Group continues to recognise its social and statutory duty to employ disabled persons and does all that is
practicable to meet this responsibility. Full and fair consideration is given to the recruitment, training, career
development and promotion of disabled persons bearing in mind the aptitude and ability of the individual concerned.
If an employee becomes disabled while employed by the Group, wherever possible, he or she will continue to be
employed in the same job. If this action is not practicable or possible then every effort will be made to ﬁnd suitable
alternative employment. In these circumstances retraining would be made available using Group resources as well as
by contact with the local disabilities employment adviser.
Environmental policy
Fenner PLC recognises and accepts that concern for the environment is an integral and fundamental part of the
Company's corporate business strategy.
The Company actively seeks to reduce its impact on the environment to the lowest practical level by ensuring that all
operations and activities within the Group exemplify best contemporary practice in respect of the environment. Any
threat of pollution from the Group’s activities is identiﬁed and either eliminated or controlled effectively.
Independent auditors
A resolution to re-appoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as independent auditors to the Company will be proposed at the
Annual General Meeting.
Annual General Meeting
As special business at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting resolutions will be proposed to renew the directors’
authority to allot relevant securities, to disapply the statutory pre-emption rights to a limited extent and to make market
purchases of Ordinary Shares in the Company subject to deﬁned limits. The proposed resolutions and further details
regarding these proposals are set out in the Chairman’s explanatory letter accompanying the Notice of the Annual
General Meeting.

Directors’ Report
continued
24 Fenner PLC Independent Auditors' Report to the members of Fenner PLC
We have audited the ﬁnancial statements which comprise the Group proﬁt and loss account, the balance sheets,
Group cash ﬂow statement, the statement of total recognised gains and losses, and the note of historical cost proﬁts
and losses, the reconciliation of movements in shareholders’ funds and the related notes. We have also audited the
disclosures required by part 3 of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 contained in the Board Remuneration Report
(“the auditable part”).
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report and the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with
applicable United Kingdom law and accounting standards are set out in the statement of directors' responsibilities. The
directors are also responsible for preparing the Board Remuneration Report. 
Our responsibility is to audit the ﬁnancial statements and the auditable part of the Board Remuneration Report in
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and United Kingdom Auditing Standards issued by the
Auditing Practices Board. This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s
members as a body in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose. We do not,
in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report
is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view and whether the ﬁnancial
statements and the auditable part of the Board Remuneration Report have been properly prepared in accordance with
the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the Directors' Report is not consistent with the
ﬁnancial statements, if the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information
and explanations we require for our audit, or if information speciﬁed by law or the Listing Rules regarding directors'
remuneration and transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the annual report and consider the implications for our report if we become
aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the ﬁnancial statements. The other information
comprises the Directors' Report, the ﬁnancial highlights, the Chairman's Statement, the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer's
Review, the Group Finance Director's Review, the Corporate Governance statement and the unaudited part of the
Board Remuneration Report
We review whether the Corporate Governance statement reﬂects the Company's compliance with the nine provisions of
the 2003 FRC Combined Code speciﬁed for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we
report if it does not. We are not required to consider whether the Board's statements on internal control cover all risks
and controls, or to form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s or Group's corporate governance procedures
or its risk and control procedures. 
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements
and the auditable part of the Board Remuneration Report. It also includes an assessment of the signiﬁcant estimates
and judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the ﬁnancial statements, and of whether the accounting
policies are appropriate to the Company and Group’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered
necessary in order to provide us with sufﬁcient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the ﬁnancial statements
and the auditable part of the Board Remuneration Report are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud
or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of
information in the ﬁnancial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
 the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group at 31 August 
2005 and of the proﬁt and cash ﬂows of the Group for the year then ended; 
 the ﬁnancial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
 those parts of the Board Remuneration Report required by Part 3 of the Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 
have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

1 Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The accounts have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom, the Companies Act 1985 and
under the historical cost convention, as modiﬁed  by the revaluation of certain ﬁxed assets, and have been applied consistently.
The disclosures required to comply with the transitional arrangements of Financial Reporting Standard (FRS) 17 Retirement Beneﬁts are made in
note 27.
As allowed by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, a separate proﬁt and loss account dealing with the results of the parent company has
not been presented.
Basis of consolidation
a) The Group accounts consolidate the accounts of Fenner PLC and its subsidiary undertakings.
b) In the Group balance sheet, investments in associated undertakings are stated at cost plus an appropriate share of post acquisition reserves
attributable to the Group, including the revaluation of land and buildings. An associated undertaking is an undertaking in which the Group has
a participating interest and exercises a signiﬁcant inﬂuence over operating and ﬁnancial policy and which is neither a subsidiary undertaking
of the parent company nor a joint venture accounted for by the gross equity method.
c) The results of businesses acquired during the year are incorporated from the date on which control passes.
d) The results of businesses sold during the year are incorporated up to the date on which control passes.
Goodwill
Prior to 1 September 1998, goodwill arising on consolidation, representing the excess of the fair value of the consideration over the fair value of
the net assets acquired, was written off directly to reserves. Subsequent to that date, in accordance with FRS10, Goodwill and Intangible
Assets, goodwill is capitalised and amortised through the proﬁt and loss account over its estimated useful economic life.
Where a subsequent disposal occurs any goodwill which has not been amortised through the proﬁt and loss account or which was previously
written off directly to reserves is taken into account in determining the proﬁt or loss on disposal.
Tangible ﬁxed assets
Fixed assets are stated at their cost (purchase price or production cost and any cost directly attributable to bringing the ﬁxed asset into
working condition for its intended use) or at subsequent valuation less any provision for depreciation or diminution in value where required.
In prior years certain of the Group’s and the Company’s freehold and leasehold properties have been revalued by independent qualiﬁed
professional valuers on the basis of open market value for their existing use. As permitted by FRS15 Tangible Fixed Assets these valuations
have been frozen.
Freehold land is not depreciated. Depreciation is provided by reference to cost or valuation at rates estimated to write off the relevant assets by
equal instalments over their estimated useful economic lives. The lives most widely applied are:
Freehold buildings 40 years
Leasehold land and buildings Unexpired term of lease
Plant, machinery and equipment 3-10 years
Patents Unexpired life of patent
Properties
Where the Group disposes of properties, the difference between the carrying value and the net proceeds is dealt with through the proﬁt and
loss account and any realised revaluation surplus is transferred from the revaluation reserve to the proﬁt and loss account reserve.
Government grants
Grants in respect of capital expenditure are treated as deferred credits in the balance sheet. An annual transfer is made to the proﬁt and loss 
account reﬂecting the beneﬁt over the useful lives of the assets concerned. Grants in respect of revenue expenditure are credited to the proﬁt and 
loss account in the period in which the related expenditure is incurred.
Research and development expenditure
All expenditure on research and development is charged against proﬁts in the year incurred except expenditure of a capital nature which is
included in the balance sheet and depreciated as noted above.
Other investments
Other investments are stated at cost or valuation less provision for any diminution in value.
30 Fenner PLC Stocks
Stocks and work in progress are valued at the lower of cost, including an addition for overheads where appropriate, and net realisable value.
Turnover
Turnover is recognised when goods are dispatched and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course
of business, net of trade discounts, VAT and other sales related taxes.
Foreign currencies
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange on the day the transaction occurs or at the contracted
rate if the transaction is covered by a forward exchange contract. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the
exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date or if appropriate at the forward contract rate. Exchange differences arising in the accounts of
individual companies are included in the proﬁt and loss account except that, where ﬁnancial instruments have been used to ﬁnance equity
investments in foreign currencies, exchange differences arising on the instruments are dealt with through reserves to the extent that they are
covered by exchange differences arising on the net assets represented by the equity investments.
The accounts of overseas subsidiaries and associated undertakings are translated into sterling on the following bases:
- Assets and liabilities at the rate of exchange at the end of the ﬁnancial year.
- Proﬁt and loss account items at the average rate of exchange during the ﬁnancial year.
- Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of opening net assets into sterling are recorded as movements on reserves in the Group
balance sheet.
Financial instruments
The Group uses derivative ﬁnancial instruments to manage its exposures to ﬂuctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates.
Receipts and payments on interest rate instruments are recognised on an accruals basis in the proﬁt and loss account over the life of the
instrument. Changes in the fair value of derivative ﬁnancial instruments used to manage foreign exchange exposures are dealt with in the proﬁt
and loss account if they relate to trading exposures or deferred until the underlying transaction occurs. Any gain or loss on instruments used to
hedge an exposure on the net investment in overseas territories is dealt with through reserves.
Leased assets
For assets acquired under ﬁnance leases the amount representing the outright purchase price of such assets is included in tangible ﬁxed
assets. Depreciation is provided at rates designed to write off the cost in equal annual amounts over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of
the assets (which are the same as those for assets purchased outright) and the period of the leases. Assets acquired under a hire purchase
contract which has the characteristics of a ﬁnance lease are depreciated over their estimated useful economic lives.
The capital element of future rentals is treated as a liability and the interest element is charged to the proﬁt and loss account over the period of
the leases in proportion to the balances outstanding.
Operating lease rentals are charged to the proﬁt and loss account when incurred.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date and is
determined using the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse.
Timing differences are differences between the Group's taxable proﬁts and its results as stated in the ﬁnancial statements that arise from the
inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in the periods different from those in which they are recognised in the ﬁnancial statements.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only when it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable proﬁts from which
the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted. 
Deferred tax is not recognised when ﬁxed assets are revalued unless by the balance sheet date there is a binding agreement to sell the
revalued assets. Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
Pensions and other post-retirement beneﬁts
Employees are provided with retirement and death beneﬁts under pension schemes adapted to suit social conditions in the countries where the
Group operates. The schemes are subject to an actuarial review where appropriate.
Throughout the Group, for both deﬁned beneﬁt schemes and deﬁned contribution schemes, contributions are charged to the proﬁt and loss
account so as to spread the cost of pensions over the employees’ working lives with the particular operating company.
The cost of providing other post-retirement beneﬁts, principally private healthcare, is charged to the proﬁt and loss account so as to spread the
cost over the service lives of relevant employees in accordance with the advice of qualiﬁed actuaries.

as explained below
Proﬁt on ordinary activities before taxation
Proﬁt on ordinary activities before taxation multiplied by the standard
rate of corporation tax in the UK of 30%
Effects of
Expenses not deductible for tax purposes
Timing differences
Effect of overseas tax rates and overseas tax suffered
Adjustments in respect of earlier years
Current taxation charge for the year
c) Factors that may affect future tax charges   
The taxation charge in future years may be affected by the utilisation of losses and other potential deferred tax assets, which in the current year 
amount to an unrecognised deferred tax asset of £6.4m (2004 £4.6m). On the basis of current available evidence it is considered unlikely that 
suitable taxable proﬁts will be generated in the near future.
In addition, there are unprovided net capital losses of £0.7m (2004 £0.7m) which would arise if revalued properties we dispose of at their 
revalued amounts, together with unprovided UK capital losses carried forward of £0.6m (2004 £0.8m). Such losses would only affect the tax 
charge if suitable capital gains were available, and it is not envisaged such proﬁts will be available in the foreseeable future.

Equity investments Approximates to book value.
Floating rate borrowings                                                      Approximates to book value where rates are reset to market rates at intervals of less

date with borrowings with similar terms to the remaining life of the loans.
Forward foreign currency contracts Based on the contracts being terminated at the balance sheet date at spot exchange 
rates.
Interest rate swap and currency options Market value of comparable instruments at the balance sheet date.
17 Financial assets and liabilities continued
The table above takes into account any derivatives used to hedge ﬁnancial assets and liabilities.
Financial assets of £262,000 (2004 £262,000) represent equity investments and £49,000 (2004 £8,000) trade and other debtors and as
such are not interest bearing. Sterling ﬁnancial liabilities of £144,000 (2004 £25,000) represent other creditors falling due after more than
one year and are non interest bearing. The ﬁxed rate debt relates to two US dollar private placements. The ﬁrst is $50,000,000 of Senior
Notes which bear interest at 6.6% per annum and is repayable on 1 March 2006. The second relates to $47,727,272 (2004 $54,545,454)
of Senior Notes which bear interest at 7.29% per annum. $6,818,182 is repayable on June 1 each year until 2012. Interest on $25,000,000 of
this debt was swapped to a ﬂoating rate liability.
The interest rate on ﬂoating rate assets and liabilities is principally linked to either the local currency base rate or LIBOR.
Gains and losses on hedges
The Group enters into forward foreign exchange currency contracts to reduce the currency exposures that arise on sales and purchases
denominated in foreign currencies. It also enters into interest rate swaps to manage exposures to changes in interest rates. Changes in the
fair value of instruments used as hedges are not recognised in the ﬁnancial statements until the hedged position matures. An analysis of
these unrecognised gains and losses is as follows        
Unrecognised gains and losses on hedges at 1 September 2004
Gains and losses arising in previous years which were recognised in 2005
Gains and losses arising before 1 September 2004 which were not recognised in 2005
Gains and losses arising in 2005 which were not recognised in 2005

excluded.

Share premium, Revaluation and Other reserves are non-distributable.
Included in the proﬁt and loss account for both Group and Company is £121,000 (2004 £121,000) of ‘own shares’ being the cost of 131,859
(2004 131,859) Fenner PLC ordinary shares of 25p each held by the Fenner PLC 1992 Employees Share Ownership Plan Trust. The market value
of the shares at 31 August 2005 was £192,000 (2004 £144,000). Dividend income has not been waived. The Trustees, who are based in Jersey
and are independent of the Company, have wide powers to invest the Trust Fund and to apply the income and capital of the fund for the beneﬁt
of the beneﬁciaries, being the employees of the Group. Income from the Plan, net of operating costs, is included in the Group proﬁt and loss
account on an accruals basis. At 31 August 2005 the Plan also had cash on deposit of £341,000 (2004 £326,000). As at that date there was no
loan from the Company to the Plan nor had the Company guaranteed any borrowings of the Plan.  
Subsequent to the placing and open offer on 20 May 2005, £19,874,000 has been transferred from the Other reserve to the Proﬁt and Loss
reserve on the basis that this amount is now distributable.
The Company has taken advantage of merger relief in respect of the share premium of £1,122,000 on the shares issued in part consideration
for the shares acquired in Wellington Holdings plc, and has consequently credited the premium to the other reserve.

25 Contingent assets and liabilities
The Group has disposed of certain businesses in prior years, which included obligations under certain property leases and grants. Should the 
purchasers of the businesses default on these commitments, the future obligation could revert to the Group.
In the normal course of business the Group has given guarantees and counter indemnities in respect of commercial transactions and has entered 
into forward contracts for the sale and purchase of foreign currencies by reference to its forecast requirements.
Proceedings have continued against the Welsh Development Agency (“WDA”), claiming substantial damages in relation to the provision by the 
WDA of defective manufacturing facilities. The proceedings are now the subject of litigation.
The Group is involved as defendant in a number of potential and actual litigation cases in connection with its business, primarily in North
America. The directors believe that the likelihood of a material liability arising from these cases is remote. 
In early October 2004, our conveyor belt operations in Charlotte and Atlanta received notiﬁcation from the Anti Trust Division of the US
Department of Justice of their intention to enquire into possible anti trust violations by Fenner. Every co-operation is being given in order to
clarify and expedite the process.
The Company has guaranteed the borrowings of certain subsidiary undertakings which at 31 August 2005 amounted to £89,229,000          
(2004 £71,641,000).

companies at a fair value in accordance with Group accounting bases were £3,469,000, details of which are set out below together with the 
amount of goodwill arising. This purchase has been accounted for as an acquisition.

Notes continued b) The valuation on which the FRS17 disclosures are set out below, has been prepared by a qualiﬁed actuary and is based on the most 
recent actuarial valuations of the UK schemes. Scheme assets are stated at their market value at 31 August 2005. During the year ended 
31 August 2005, the Group paid contributions to the Fenner Scheme at the rate of 12% of the pensionable salaries together with an additional 
payment of £1.25m and members contributed at the rate of 8.0% of pensionable salaries. In addition, contributions were paid to the Wellington
Scheme of £0.3m.
The main ﬁnancial assumptions used to calculate the UK schemes liabilities under FRS17 were as follows
Price inﬂation
Rate of increase in salaries 
Rate of increase of pensions in payment subject to Limited Price Indexation increases* 
Rate of increase for deferred pensioners subject to statutory revaluation
Discount rate
* Some elements of pension increase at either 0% pa or 3% pa

27 Pensions and other post-retirement beneﬁts
The Group has continued to account for pensions in accordance with Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 24 and the disclosures given in 
a) below are those required by that accounting standard. The transitional disclosures required for FRS17, Retirement Beneﬁts, to the extent not 
given in a) are, for the UK pension schemes (the Group’s only signiﬁcant deﬁned beneﬁt arrangements), set out in b) below.
a) The Group operates a number of post-retirement deﬁned beneﬁt arrangements, including pension schemes and post-retirement medical 
plans, around the world. Some of the arrangements are funded and some are unfunded. The assets of these schemes are held in 
separate trustee administered funds. Since the overseas arrangements are all relatively small compared with the UK pension schemes detailed 
below, a more limited disclosure has been included.
The total pension cost for the Group in the year ended 31 August 2005 was £5,801,000 (2004 £5,407,000).
The pension cost relating to the UK amounted to £2,517,000 (2004 £2,460,000). 
Following the acquisition of Wellington Holdings, there are now two UK deﬁned beneﬁt schemes - the Fenner Pension Scheme and the Wellington
Pension Scheme. The cost of these schemes is assessed in accordance with the advice of a qualiﬁed actuary, who is not an employee of the
Group, using the Projected Unit Credit method. The last actuarial valuations of the UK schemes were carried out as at 31 March 2005 and 5 April
2005.
The assumptions that have the most signiﬁcant effect on the results of the valuation are those relating to the rate of return on investments and the
rates of increase in salaries and pensions. It was assumed that the investment return would on average exceed both salary increases by 2.05%
p.a. and future pensions, which are entitled to increases, by 3.8% p.a. 
At the dates of the latest full actuarial valuations, the combined value of the assets of the UK schemes (excluding insured pensions and the
deﬁned contribution section) was £89,800,000 and on the assumptions above, was sufﬁcient to cover 87% of the beneﬁts that had accrued to
members, after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The element of the total pension cost in the year ended 31 August 2005 relating to foreign schemes amounted to £3,284,000 (2004 £2,947,000).
This charge has been determined in accordance with local best practice and regulations.

Nostrum at a glance
Overview
Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC is an 
independent multi-field oil and 
gas company engaging in the 
production, development and 
exploration of oil and gas in the 
pre-Caspian Basin.
We are a simple, sustainable 
and successful company and, 
by employing these core values, 
we aim to become one of the 
leading independent oil and gas 
exploration and production 
companies in the Former Soviet 
Union (FSU). 
We pursue our financial and 
operational targets in a 
responsible way, maintaining 
a track record that clearly 
demonstrates the successful 
achievement of our strategic 
goals. 
Whilst we continue to make 
progress towards our financial 
and operational goals, we have 
developed a simple strategy 
that will allow us to successfully 
deliver the near-term growth 
we have targeted, combined 
with long-term, sustainable 
value creation.
Nostrum is listed on the London 
Stock Exchange, with operations 
in Kazakhstan as well as offices in 
Amsterdam, London, Brussels and 
St. Petersburg. 
We focus on creating long-term 
shareholder value through the 
development and discovery 
of oil and gas reserves, as well 
as the production and sale of 
crude oil, stabilised condensate, 
LPG and dry gas. Our experienced 
management team has overseen 
the investment of more than 
US$1.5 billion in our licence 
area since 2004, delivering 
on a number of infrastructure 
projects, as well as significantly 
expanding the reserve base 
over the last ten years through 
our own appraisal work 
combined with successful 
M&A activity. 
Who we are
What we do
Our range of products at 
Nostrum are crude oil, stabilised 
liquid condensate, LPG and dry 
gas. Currently all our production 
comes from the Chinarevskoye 
licence. We have invested 
in developing our own 
infrastructure to control the 
transportation of our products 
until they reach the final off-taker, 
serving a wide network of 
destinations and off-takers and 
helping to ensure we always 
obtain the best possible prices.

Annual Report 2015 03
We have successfully grown our 
production every year from 2004–2013 
when full capacity of our processing 
facilities was achieved. We have since 
targeted an average daily production 
of 45,000 boepd and expect to double 
our production capacity in 2017 to 
100,000 boepd. With this increased 
nameplate capacity we will fortify our 
competitive advantage in the market 
and deliver substantial value to 
our shareholders.
We are in a unique position in the 
market, with our front-loaded 
investment programme meaning 
we are now a leader in terms of 
infrastructure in the region. Our 
location in the north-west of 
Kazakhstan places us close to our final 
off-take destinations, including the 
Black Sea ports and Finland. We are 
able to process and export both 
liquids and gas using our wholly-owned 
treatment facilities and transport links. 
Nostrum has a simple and effective 
operating structure. It has a board of 
directors led by the chairman and an 
Executive Committee led by the CEO. 
The Executive Committee manages all 
major units involved in operations 
according to the interaction charts and 
key management principles described 
on pages 70 to 80. The team has 
a breadth of expertise as well as deep 
sector experience, which has led to 
the successful oversight of Nostrum’s 
operations throughout the challenging 
oil price environment seen over the 
last year.

Our investment case
A simple investment case
Nostrum has developed a world-class portfolio of assets in the reserve rich area  
of north-west Kazakhstan. The front-loaded investment programme has been 
the foundation upon which strong production growth has been built.  
1  Cash on the balance sheet is defined as cash and cash equivalents including current and non-current investments.
Nostrum generated US$153.26m 
of operating cash flow in 2015. 
In addition, the Group ended the 
year with over US$165.56m of cash
1
 
on its balance sheet. Nostrum 
announced in January that it had 
signed a new hedge of 15,000 bopd 
for US$49.16 per barrel, with a 
24 month tenor. The hedge and 
cash position give Nostrum the 
financial flexibility to actively manage 
the pursuit of our operational 
goals accordingly as the oil price 
environment fluctuates. We believe 
that the prudent management of our 
liquidity has given us a competitive 
advantage and leaves us in a strong 
position despite the challenging oil 
price environment seen over the 
last year, reflecting our core values 
of simplicity and sustainability. 
Stable financial platform 
with strong cash flows 
and flexibility
With 470 mboe of 2P reserves 
and production of more than 14 million 
barrels of oil equivalent per year, 
we provide a unique combination 
of significant production and reserve 
upside along with consistent 
operational cash flow.
Over 450 million 
of 2P reserves
2015’s average daily production was 
40,391 boe, down marginally on last 
year due to one-off repair work on the 
pipeline used to transport Nostrum’s 
gas. We will target an average daily 
production of over 40,000 boe in 2016 
as we continue the construction of 
our new Gas Treatment Facility. 
Targeting steady levels 
of production Strategic report Corporate governance Financial report Regulatory information Additional disclosures
Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC 
Annual Report 2015 05
We have four licence areas, all located 
in the Pre-Caspian Basin towards the 
north of Uralsk. Nostrum’s current 
producing asset is the Chinarevskoye 
field and the three additional licences 
are all located within 60-120km of 
the field. 
World-class assets
We are committed to achieving 
an excellent standard of corporate 
governance and social responsibility 
and are aiming for a positive and 
lasting contribution to the areas in 
which we operate, with a focus on 
delivering long-term shareholder 
value for a sustainable future.
Strong governance 
and responsibility
We are confident in the ability of 
our experienced and dedicated 
management team, who have 
expertise in operating in Kazakhstan, 
to deliver on our clear strategy.
Experienced 
management team
We have a clear strategy, based 
on a solid financial foundation and 
compelling business case. We 
will deliver near-term production 
growth, with preparations to double 
production upon completion of 
the new Gas Treatment Facility.
In addition, with our continued 
appraisal of the existing Chinarevskoye 
field and our three additional licences 
we are continually transferring 
reserves to the 1P category, aiming 
for 700 mboe of proved reserves over 
the longer-term. This will allow us 
to maintain production above 
100,000 boepd up until the end of the 
Chinarevskoye licence (2031-2033). 
We monitor all opportunities for 
acquisitions both within our operating 
region of north-west Kazakhstan as 
well as further afield within the FSU 
that would enable us to expand our 
reserve base and facilitate sustained 
production through to the end of our 
licence. 
Simple business case, successful model and sustainable strategy
With low operating costs, we have been able to maintain an average daily production 
of over 40,000 boe throughout the challenging conditions of 2015, sustaining positive 
cash flow and progressing towards our operational target of doubling production 
capacity. Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC 
Annual Report 2015 06
Where we operate
Advantageous location of assets
Crude
Crude oil is transported through our 
own liquids pipeline directly from the 
field site. 15% is sold domestically 
and the remainder is sold through for 
export to two main buyers, Neste Oil 
in Finland and SOCAR in Azerbaijan. 
Condensate
Condensate is transported through 
our own oil pipeline from the field site 
and then 100% is exported by rail to 
the Russian Black Sea port of Taman. 
LPG
LPG is transported on trucks from 
the field site to the rail terminal where 
it is loaded on to special trains and 
then transported to the off-taker. The 
majority of our LPG is sold at Black Sea 
ports and distributed by traders to 
Eastern Europe and Turkey.

 Oil/condensate
Our main operational facilities are located at  
the 274 square kilometre Chinarevskoye field  
in north-west Kazakhstan. We now have three 
additional licences, all within a 120km radius 
of this location. This advantageous location is 
core to our business case, allowing us to leverage 
our existing infrastructure and experienced 
operating and development teams. Strategic report Corporate governance Financial report Regulatory information Additional disclosures
Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC 
Annual Report 2015 07
Dry gas
Dry gas is transported from the 
Chinarevskoye field through the 
Company’s own 17km gas pipeline, 
which connects to the InterGas Central 
Asia pipeline. 25% of gas produced 
is sold domestically at this connection 
point and the remaining 75% 
is exported.
Expanding for the future
With the preparatory work to 
double production capacity nearing 
completion, all of the related 
infrastructure, upon completion of 
GTU3, will be able to accommodate 
increased levels of production. This will 
further improve our efficiencies and 
effective use of existing infrastructure. 
Nostrum is continually evaluating the 
destinations to which we sell in order 
to achieve the best possible netbacks 
for the company. At present, however, 
transportation routes and destinations 
are expected to remain unchanged.

Key performance indicators
Resilient financial performance 
Financial KPIs 
Nostrum has maintained high operational margins and positive cash flows for the year from our processing facilities 
despite the volatile oil price environment of 2015. We come to the end of the year in a strong financial position, fully 
funded to complete GTU3 on schedule, and with US$165.56m in cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet. 
Non-financial KPIs
In order for Nostrum to achieve 
sustainability and success in the longer 
term, we remain conscious that our 
performance must be measured not 
only in financial terms, but also with 
regards to our operational and 
social output. We therefore target 
non-financial KPIs to ensure that 
we maintain our focus in these areas.

Strategic Financial Operational
GTU3 – following the continued fall 
in the oil price Nostrum has taken 
the decision to phase the payments 
of GTU3 over 2016 and 2017. 
Completion will now be during 
2017. The phasing of payments 
will involve no additional cost for 
Nostrum and the total budget 
remains at US$500m. The phasing 
of the payments will now match 
the new hedge and will allow for 
a continued preservation of cash 
on Nostrum’s balance sheet over 
the next 24 months.
Hedging – 15,000 barrels of oil 
per day hedged at US$49.16 until 
December 2017. The previous 
hedge value of US$92m was used 
to purchase put options with a strike 
price of US$49.16 per barrel in 
December 2015. The put options 
are settled in cash on a quarterly 
basis and mature in December 2017. 
The options mean that Nostrum 
is receiving US$49.16 per barrel 
on at least 1.35m barrels of oil each 
quarter. This represents over two 
thirds of its liquids production. 
There is no cost to Nostrum if the 
oil price goes above US$49.16 as 
Nostrum has only bought put 
options and has not given away 
any upside with this hedge. 
 Unexpected repair work on export 
gas pipeline – during October the 
pipeline Nostrum uses for the sale 
of export gas was closed by its 
operator for unforeseen repair work. 
The result of this unexpected repair 
work was that the annual average 
production was lower than initially 
expected, at 40,391 boepd.
Production ramp up – as a result 
of completion of GTU3 being 
moved back in to 2017 production 
guidance has been revised down 
from 70,000 to a range between 
40,000 boepd and 60,000 boepd 
for 2017. 
Export gas paid in US Dollars – at 
the start of 2015 Nostrum entered 
in to an agreement to sell 75% of 
its dry gas for export at prices 
denominated in US$. 
Successful GTU1&2 maintenance –  
the semi-annual scheduled 
shutdowns for maintenance were 
completed within the expected 
timeframe budgeted for the year. 
Total shut down time for planned 
maintenance did not exceed 
15 days over 2015.
First appraisal well on 
Rostoshinskoye field – the first 
appraisal well on Rostoshinskoye 
has been started and will be 
completed during 2016. 
Rostoshinskoye is the largest of 
the three fields adjacent to 
Chinarevskoye. Together, the 
three fields contain an estimated 
87m 2P barrels. 
Dividend – a dividend of US$0.27 
per ordinary share was paid in 
June 2015.
Producing wells – 21 oil wells and 
18 gas wells were producing at 
the Chinarevskoye field. In 2015 
Nostrum had three rigs working at 
Chinarevskoye and in the second 
half of 2015 this was reduced to 
one rig. At the start of 2016 this is 
scheduled to increase to three rigs. 
Offer for Tethys Petroleum – Nostrum 
made an all share offer for Tethys 
Petroleum during 2015. The offer 
was later withdrawn by Nostrum and 
subsequently no further offer has 
been made.
 Eight wells completed – during 
2015 eight wells were completed 
at Chinarevskoye. During 2016 
four wells are scheduled at 
Chinarevskoye plus one to be 
completed at Rostoshinskoye.

Chairman’s statement
Steady progress amidst falling oil prices
Our vision
Nostrum’s vision is to grow production 
to over 100,000 boepd and to 
build a reserve base that allows the 
Company to continue to produce at 
this level far into the future. This goal 
is now less than 24 months away from 
being realised, with the new gas plant 
due for delivery in 2017. Our target 
remains to become one of the leading 
companies in the FSU.
Nostrum intends to realise its vision 
through a clearly defined strategy, 
balancing organic development 
with carefully considered expansion 
through acquisitions. Its main priority 
remains, as always, to continue to 
deliver growth and shareholder value 
in a responsible and efficient way. 
Resilient financial and 
operational performance
Nostrum delivered a steady 
performance in 2015 with production 
averaging over 40,000 boepd for the 
entire year. The falling oil price meant 
that the Group’s financial results for 
the year were not as strong as in 2014, 
but with the continuation of our cost 
reduction programme and an increase 
in gas revenue from our new export 
contract for 75% of our gas, we 
maintained a resilient EBITDA margin 
of over 50%. We made good progress 
this year on our new gas plant and look 
forward to its completion next year, 
enabling us to double our production 
capacity to 100,000 boepd. I believe 
that Nostrum is uniquely placed to 
not only survive the current fall in oil 
prices but also to prosper once we 
have completed our new gas plant. 
Our ambitions to build one the leading 
independent E&P companies in the 
FSU remain as strong as ever and 
I believe the current environment can 
provide us with growth opportunities, 
rather than limitations. 
Flexible financial position
We continue to manage our cash 
position prudently and have ended 
the year with over US$160m of cash on 
our balance sheet. Given the volatile oil 
price, we also took steps to further 
protect the liquidity position of the 
Company. A new hedge was entered 
into that covers the Company over 
2016 and 2017 and locks in US$49.16 
per barrel on 15,000 boepd. The cost 
of the new hedge was paid for entirely 
by the proceeds of the previous 
hedge. In addition we have decided to 
phase the payments for the 
construction of our gas plant over the 
next 24 months to match the cash we 
will receive under our hedge. This 
ensures that the Company can execute 
its business plan under any oil price 
over the next 24 months.
With oil prices falling to around 
US$30 and the devaluation of the 
Tenge in 2015 we are focusing our 
efforts to further reduce operating 
costs as part of our cost reduction 
programme. Given the low operating 
costs of our field we can continue to 
generate positive cashflow even at 
the current low oil prices. Whilst cost 
cutting and liquidity management 
are the short-term focus, we remain 
committed to creating value through 
the construction of our new gas plant, 
the doubling of production capacity 
and expanding our reserves base. 
2016 dividend
As a result of the falling oil prices in 
2015, we are not proposing a dividend 
payment for 2016. We believe that in 
the current environment maintaining 
short-term liquidity will ultimately lead 
to greater shareholder value in the 
longer term. This is a tough decision 
to make as we had established a track 
record of distributing a small portion 
of cash to shareholders. However the 
Board believes that cash preservation 
is paramount in these uncertain times. 
Stable production levels
The financial performance of the 
Company was built on another steady 
year of operational results. Production 
of 40,391 boepd was below our 
guidance due to unforseen repair 
works to the pipeline through which 
gas is exported. Excluding the period 
of maintenance we would have met our 
target guidance figure for production 
for the year. Along with our new 
hedge, this steady production and 
associated cash flow continues to allow 
Nostrum to fully finance its investment 
in further infrastructure to double our 
production capacity.  Strategic report Corporate governance Financial report Regulatory information Additional disclosures

Multi-field asset base established
Nostrum has started the appraisal 
programme on the three additional 
licences acquired in 2013 which are 
estimated by Ryder Scott to hold 
87 mboe equivalent. We have adopted 
the same approach with our additional 
fields that we undertook with 
Chinarevskoye. The first step is to fully 
understand the geology and de-risk 
the development progamme as much 
as possible. We have carried out new 
3-D seismic on each field and have 
now interpreted it, allowing us to 
have a much better understanding 
of  where to position our first appraisal 
wells. We started drilling the first 
appraisal well in the largest field, 
Rostoshinskoye, in 2015, and its initial 
results are looking promising We look 
forward to developing these fields and 
to bringing them into production to 
utilise our infrastructure development. 
Governance and the Board
The Board understands the 
importance of providing effective 
and clear leadership and direction 
on all matters relating to corporate 
governance and places great 
significance on achieving high 
standards of governance to underpin 
the Group’s good business conduct 
and strong ethical culture. With this in 
mind I am very pleased with how the 
Company has handled its first full year 
since its regulatory obligations were 
increased as a result of the Company’s 
admission to the premium listing 
segment of the Official List of the 
Financial Conduct Authority and to 
trading on the London Stock Exchange 
PLC’s main market for listed securities 
in June 2014. I believe the Company 
has handled this transition very well. 
During 2015 the Board continued 
to work closely with management to 
maintain high standards of corporate 
governance and to ensure the 
Company’s continued compliance 
with the rules imposed by the Financial 
Conduct Authority and associated 
guidance under the UK Corporate 
Governance Code.
Our commitment to corporate 
responsibility
At Nostrum we strive to be a 
responsible and transparent business. 
Our corporate responsibility 
approach covers the relationships 
we have with all our stakeholders 
including shareholders, employees, 
contractors, local communities and 
host governments, as well as the 
environments in which we work. 
Nostrum’s strategy on Corporate 
Responsibility focuses around three 
key areas – people, planet, and profit –  
and includes the following initiatives:
 Nostrum has made it a priority to 
communicate its approach to its 
various stakeholders, emphasising 
its stringent corporate governance 
provisions and business ethics;
 Nostrum monitors and reports on 
the wellbeing of its employees, 
health and safety measures, working 
environment specifics and overall 
benefits. Nostrum also reports on its 
direct involvement in the community 
through programmes providing 
social infrastructure, sponsoring 
activities and charitable work; and 
 Nostrum manages its environmental 
footprint carefully and adheres fully 
to relevant legislation. The Company 
is also proactive in linking its 
environmental objectives to the 
highest possible standards and 
ensuring stringent compliance and 
progress monitoring.
In 2015, we believe Nostrum’s actions 
have had a positive impact on its wide 
range of stakeholders, including 
investors, business partners, 
regulators, employees, customers, 
local communities, the environment 
and society more generally. 
Our people
Nostrum’s growth and success revolves 
around the quality and commitment 
of our people and we believe we have 
an excellent team that can deliver our 
strategy notwithstanding a lower oil 
price. Our global workforce now totals 
more than 1,000 people. We remain 
committed to developing local content 
and 98% of the people employed in 
our activities in Kazakhstan are Kazakh 
nationals as at the end of 2015. We will 
continue to develop our employment 
practices and policies to ensure we can 
attract and retain the best talent. At the 
same time we are implementing a cost 
reduction programme to adapt to 
the new low oil price environment 
which will ensure we do not carry 
unnecessary excess costs into 2016.
The future
2015 was a challenging year for 
Nostrum as we adapted to the falling 
oil price. We reacted quickly in cutting 
costs and took steps to protect the 
financial stability of the Company 
whilst not deviating from our strategy 
to double our processing capacity 
and reach a production level in excess 
of 100,000 boepd in the near future. 
In 2016 we need to remain vigilant 
on cost cutting and ensure that each 
dollar we invest will deliver future 
returns for shareholders in the new oil 
price environment. Whilst the industry 
is still adapting to the low oil prices 
I believe at Nostrum we have made 
quick decisive decisions that will 
protect our stakeholders under all 
possible oil price scenarios. With these 
solid foundations I look forward to 
completing our near-term initiatives 
and seeing Nostrum prosper under 
any recovery in the oil price in 
the future.

Chief Executive’s review
Maintaining financial stability to 
secure future production growth
How we performed in 2015
2015 was a stable year from an 
operational perspective. It saw the gas 
treatment facility continue to operate 
at full capacity with a complete range 
of hydrocarbon products being 
delivered to a range of customers and 
destinations outside Kazakhstan. We 
suffered an unexpected downtime in 
October due to unforeseen repair 
work made to the pipeline through 
which we export our gas. Outside of 
this downtime production was stable. 
Nostrum is now deep into its second 
development phase, which will entail 
the construction and commissioning of 
the new gas plant in combination with 
a scalable drilling programme in order 
to ramp up the plant as quickly as 
possible. 
Our performance against the three 
key objectives for the Company in 
2015 was as follows:
1. Ensure that the financial position 
of the Company remains stable:
The financial position of the Company 
remained stable despite the 
challenging oil price environment 
and we have ended the year with 
over US$160m of cash on our balance 
sheet. Given the severity of the oil 
price fall we have ensured that 
Nostrum has the financial security to 
survive any fall in the oil price during 
the next 24 months and still complete 
all its committed capex without the 
need for additional funding.
2. Ensure construction of the new 
gas plant remains on track for 2016:
Significant steps have been made in 
the construction of our next GTU, 
which will allow us to double our 
production capacity during 2017. We 
have spent over US$250m and expect 
the total cost to be below US$500m. 
Due to the falling oil price environment 
we decided in 2015 to phase the 
remaining payments on GTU3 across 
2016 and 2017. This means the 
scheduled completion date has been 
pushed back into 2017 as it allows us to 
preserve the liquidity position of the 
Company and match the hedging 
payment profile we have put in place. 
The phasing of payments on GTU3 in 
this way allows the Company to remain 
fully financed for the next 24 months 
whilst it completes the gas plant.
3. Optimise the drilling programme 
to ensure that we can fill the GTU3 
as quickly as possible whilst not 
jeopardising the Company’s financial 
position: 
We have closely monitored the drilling 
schedule during 2015 to ensure it is 
kept in balance with the falling oil 
price and corresponding reduction in 
operating cash flow. We reduced the 
number of rigs on the Chinarevskoye 
field in the second half of 2015 to one 
rig before increasing this to start 2016 
with three rigs. We are continually 
analysing and adjusting the drilling 
programme to optimise the current 
drilling capex as well as to maximise 
the speed of the ramp up once 
GTU3 is complete. The main driver for 
the speed of ramp up is the oil price 
during 2017. The oil price will dictate 
how many additional wells we can 
drill over our base case of simply 
maintaining production during 2017. 
Steady production levels
The Chinarevskoye field is now in 
stable production with all facilities 
running smoothly. Nostrum expects 
a daily total production average of at 
least 40,000 boepd for 2016 and 
2017. All products – crude oil, stabilised 
condensate, LPG and dry gas – are 
sold at the best possible prices on the 
world markets, and our operations 
are running at stable levels. We are 
targeting the doubling of production 
capacity during 2017. 
Future drilling programme at 
Chinarevskoye
In 2015, we completed eight wells, in 
line with the number we set out to 
complete at the start of the year. Our 
drilling programme has always been 
designed to be scalable and the falling 
oil prices have resulted in us scaling 
down the proposed drilling schedule 
for 2016 as we will only drill three 
production wells and one appraisal 
well at Chinarevskoye in addition to  Strategic report Corporate governance Financial report Regulatory information Additional disclosures

completing the appraisal well at 
Rostoshinskoye. Our current drilling 
programme allows us to maintain 
production above 40,000 boepd 
without jeopardising our liquidity 
position. We plan to increase drilling 
as we get closer to GTU3 completion  
in 2017 so that we can start to ramp up 
production as we increase our 
production capacity. The speed of 
the ramp up will be contingent on oil 
prices – the higher the oil price the 
quicker the ramp up. 
Construction of second Gas Plant
During 2015 we have made significant 
steps towards the construction of our 
new gas plant. The rationale behind 
the plant is that it will allow faster 
monetisation of reserves, by increasing 
treatment capacity by an additional 
2.5 bcm of raw gas per year, bringing 
total capacity to 4.2 bcm of raw gas 
per annum. Over US$250m has already 
been invested in the plant. We have 
revised the targeted completion 
date to 2017 as we have decided to 
phase construction payments to match 
the proceeds of our hedge position, 
which protects us against the current 
low oil prices. We are now on track 
to deliver the plant on time and on 
budget, below US$500m, during 2017.
Building up further reserves 
As a result of the falling oil price we 
have seen a reduction in the amount 
of proved and probable reserves over 
and above the amount produced 
during the year 2015. I am confident 
that we will recover these reserves 
under a higher oil price environment 
as the field remains in good condition 
and hydrocarbons in place remain 
broadly unchanged. I am therefore 
optimistic that any recovery in oil price 
can drive an increase in 2P reserves 
without having to undertake any 
additional exploration work on 
Chinarevskoye.
By virtue of its size, development stage 
and production track record, Nostrum 
has acquired high visibility both 
locally and internationally. As a result 
it regularly monitors further M&A 
opportunities. Its approach is to 
remain both pragmatic and prudent 
as it considers these options. 
Nostrum’s core focus remains on 
north-west Kazakhstan, where it knows 
the landscape and is already operating 
successfully. 
Key priority tasks for 2016
Our four key objectives for the 
Company in order to continue to 
deliver on our strategy are as follows: 
1.  Ensure that the financial position 
of the Company remains stable
2.  Ensure construction of the next 
gas plant remains on track for 2017
3.  Optimise the drilling programme 
to ensure that we can fill the GTU3 
as quickly as possible whilst not 
jeopardising the Company’s 
financial position
4.  Implement the cost reduction 
programme
I believe that these objectives, if 
successfully achieved, will provide the 
platform to enhance shareholder value 
in the future. We have demonstrated in 
the past that we can deliver on all 
these objectives and I am therefore 
confident as we enter 2016 that we 
are well placed to achieve our goals. 
I believe that we are well positioned 
to successfully execute the next phase 
of infrastructure, whilst also ensuring 
that we can maximise the value of our 
processing facilities by adding reserves 
over the coming years.

of Kazakhstan, the Ministry of Finance of Kazakhstan, the Competent Authority and other public sources. 
  Some of the market and competitive position data has been obtained from US government publications and other third-party sources, including publicly available data from 
the World Bank, the Economist Intelligence Unit, the annual BP Statistical Review of World Energy for 2015, as well as from Kazakh press reports and publications, and edicts and 
resolutions of the Kazakh government. In the case of statistical information, similar statistics may be obtainable from other sources, although the underlying assumptions and

  Certain sources are only updated periodically. This means that certain data for current periods cannot be obtained and we cannot assure you that such data has not been revised 
or will not be subsequently amended.
To date, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan are 
the two significant crude oil producing 
countries in the Caspian region. It is 
expected that these countries will 
continue to lead the region in crude 
oil production in the near future, driven 
by production growth from existing 
fields and the development of recently 
discovered fields. Turkmenistan and 
Uzbekistan are the predominant gas 
producers in the region. Russia plays 
an important role in the region by 
providing a transportation corridor 
between the Caspian Sea and the 
Black Sea, however this part of Russia 
is not a source of substantial crude.
Overview – The larger 
Caspian Region
Since 2000, Kazakhstan has experienced 
significant economic growth mainly 
through economic reform and foreign 
investment. Exports of crude oil 
have grown significantly and, due to 
Kazakhstan being landlocked, most 
of the oil from Kazakhstan is currently 
delivered to international markets 
using pipelines, which run through 
Russia, to shipping points on the 
Black Sea. 
International investment into the 
Kazakh oil and gas sector has largely 
taken the form of joint ventures, 
including cooperation with the 
state-owned oil and gas company 
NC KazMunayGas JSC (“NC KMG”), 
as well as production sharing 
agreements and direct grants of 
exploration/production rights to 
subsoil users. Major projects in 
Kazakhstan include the Tengiz, 
Karachaganak and Kashagan fields. 
Economic growth and 
investment in Kazakhstan’s 
oil and gas Industry
According to BP’s Statistical Review of 
World Energy 2015, as at 31 December 
2014 Kazakhstan ranked twelfth in the 
world by oil reserves and twentieth in 
the world by gas reserves. Kazakhstan 
is the second largest oil producer 
(after Russia) among the former 
Soviet Republics and has the Caspian 
region’s largest recoverable oil 
reserves. Kazakhstan’s proved oil 
and gas reserves were 3.9 billion 
tonnes and 1.5 trillion cubic metres 
respectively, as at 31 December 2014.
The Kazakh government has stated 
that it expects oil and gas production 
in 2016 to amount to 77 million tons, 
followed by an increase in oil output 
to 92 million tons in 2020. Most of this 
growth is expected to come from the 
Tengiz, Karachaganak and Kashagan 
fields.
There are three major refineries in 
Kazakhstan supplying the northern 
region (at Pavlodar), the western 
region (at Atyrau) and the southern 
region (at Shymkent). All three major 
refineries are either under the control 
or joint control of NC KMG. 
Oil supply and demand
The continued volatility and decline 
in oil prices throughout 2015 has led 
to the Group taking a number of 
strategic decisions to mitigate the 
impact of continued volatility and 
depressed prices. As such, Nostrum 
is well positioned to withstand 
continued low oil prices over the short 
to medium term and to deliver growth 
at a US$50.0/bbl long-term oil price.
Oil price outlook Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC 
Annual Report 2015 18
Market overview continued
The oil and gas market in Kazakhstan
Increases in Kazakhstan’s gas 
production are expected to come 
primarily from associated gas at the 
Tengiz, Karachaganak and Kashagan 
fields. Most of Kazakhstan’s gas 
reserves are located in the west of 
the country and over half are located 
in the Karachaganak field. 
Gas production has increased 
significantly since 2004 when the 
Parliament passed a law prohibiting 
the industrial production of oil and 
gas deposits without the utilization 
of natural and associated gas.
Gas supply and demand
An important aspect of increasing 
hydrocarbon production in Kazakhstan 
has been the development of 
transportation infrastructure, as this 
in turn has raised Kazakhstan’s export 
capacity.
Transportation
Currently over 7,920km of Kazakhstan’s 
20,238km of pipeline are used in 
oil transportation. The three main 
pipelines are the Uzen-Atyrau-Samara 
(“UAS”) pipeline, the CPC pipeline, and 
the Kazakhstan-China pipeline. 
Other pipeline routes from Kazakhstan 
are being considered, such as routes 
through the Caucasus region to 
Turkey and routes through Iran and 
Afghanistan.
Crude oil
Most of the gas pipelines in western 
Kazakhstan, with the exception of 
Makat-Atyrau-Astrakhan, are designed 
to provide gas to CAC. The pipeline 
has two branches that meet in the 
south-western Kazakh city of Beyneu 
before crossing into Russia and 
connecting with the Russian pipeline 
system.
The construction of the 
Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent gas pipeline 
designed to transport gas from west 
Kazakhstan for use in the southern 
regions of Kazakhstan and export 
to China, started in 2010.
The Bukhara Urals gas pipeline 
was initially built to supply gas from 
Uzbekistan to north-east Kazakhstan 
and Russia’s southeast Urals region. 
Bukhara-Tashkent-Bishkek-Almaty 
is a transit pipeline that provides gas 
from Uzbekistan to Kazakhstan’s main 
southern population centre.
Natural gas
Macro economic and micro economic 
changes that occurred in the reporting 
period and their impact on results:
 With effect from 1 January 2016, 
Kazakhstan reduced export duties 
for crude oil from US$60 to US$40 
per tonne
 With effect from 1 February 2016, 
Kazakhstan introduced floating rates 
of export duties for crude oil based 
on average market prices
 The average price of Brent crude oil 
for the year ended 31 December 
2015 fell to US$53.6 per barrel, 46% 
lower than the average price the 
previous year 
 In August 2015 the Kazakh Tenge 
abandoned its peg against the US 
Dollar allowing the market to set the 
price. In initial response to the 
change in policy the Tenge devalued 
by c.25%. Throughout the remainder 
of 2015 the currency continued to 
devalue with the exchange rate at 
year end being 345.0 per US Dollar  
(a devaluation since the de-pegging 
of c.45%)
Macro economic and micro economic changes 
 The major part of the Group’s tax 
bases of non-monetary assets and 
liabilities is determined in Kazakh 
Tenge. Therefore, any change in the 
US Dollar/Tenge exchange rate 
results in a change in the temporary 
difference between the tax bases of 
non-current assets and their carrying 
amounts in the financial statements. 
During the twelve months to 
31 December 2015, the devaluation 
of the Tenge resulted in an increase 
of the temporary differences on 
non-current assets which was 
recognised as a deferred tax 
expense for the period
 A large proportion of the Company’s 
operating expenses in Kazakhstan 
are denominated in Tenge, whereas 
only a small proportion of the 
Company’s revenues are received 
in Tenge. As such, the Tenge 
devaluation has brought about 
some cost savings in US Dollar terms

the Tenge devaluation was broadly

Major oil and gas projects in Kazakhstan
TCO
The TCO joint venture was created in 
1993 with the aim of developing the 
Tengiz and Korolev fields that have 
estimated recoverable reserves 
of between 5.5 billion barrels and 
8.1 billion barrels of oil. The 
participants in the joint venture 
are Chevron Overseas Company, 
ExxonMobil, NC KMG and LukArco. 
Karachaganak project
The Karachaganak field is a 280 square 
kilometre gas condensate field located 
in north-west Kazakhstan which 
was discovered in 1979. BG Group and 
ENI are joint operators and each hold 
a 29.25% interest in the venture. 
The Karachagank field is Kazakhstan’s 
main gas field, holding an estimated 
9 billion barrels of gas condensate 
and 48 trillion cubic feet of gas.
North Caspian project
The Kashagan field is located off the 
northern shore of the Caspian Sea, 
near the city of Atyrau. In 1997, 
a consortium of companies signed 
a 40-year production sharing 
agreement covering five structures. 
The structures consist of 11 offshore 
blocks over an area of 5,600 square 
kilometres. The North Caspian 
Operating Company (NCOC), a 
consortium that includes ENI S.p.A.,

Chinarevskoye field
Exploration and production licence
We were granted an exploration 
and production licence for the 
Chinarevskoye field in May 1997, 
which was extended in 2008, to 2033 
for all oil and gas bearing reservoirs 
and horizons covering 185 square 
kilometres of the licence area. The 
licence for the north-eastern 
Tournaisian reservoir is valid until 2031. 
Production Sharing Agreement 
(PSA)
Nostrum operates under a 
grandfathered PSA with the 
Government of Kazakhstan, which sets 
the parameters for the exploration and 
development of the Chinarevskoye 
field, and the respective royalties, 
profit share and tax liabilities payable 
to the government.
Outlook
The licence and the PSA are currently 
valid until 2031 (with respect to the 
north-eastern Tournaisan reservoir) 
and 2033 (for the rest of the 
Chinarevskoye field), and we must 
comply with the terms of the 
exploration permit, the production 
permit and the development plans 
during this period. To date, Nostrum 
has met all of its capital investment 
obligations under the PSA.
Geology
Multi-layered
structure
Stable business environment
Geology
The Chinarevskoye field is a multi-layer 
structure with ten reservoirs and 
44 compartments spread over three 
areas: the western area contains 
16 compartments; the northern 
area has 24 compartments and the 
southern area has four compartments. 
Commercial hydrocarbons have 
been found in the Lower Permian, 
Bashkirian, Bobrikovski, Tournaisian, 
Famennian, Mulinski, Ardatovski, 
and Biski-Afoninski reservoirs. 
Reserves
Based on the Ryder Scott report, 
dated December 2015, the proved 
and probable reserves for the 
Chinarevskoye field amount to  
383 mboe (2014: 473 mboe). Proven 
reserves amount to 147 mboe 
(2014: 192 mboe) and probable 
reserves to 236 mboe (2014: 281 mboe). 
Oil and condensate amount to  
148 mbbl of proven and probable 
reserves (2014: 198mbbl), LPG to 
51 mbbl (2014: 68mbbl) and gas to  
184 mboe (207 mboe). The decrease 
in reserves from 2014 was primarily 
a result of the fall in oil price, but was 
also impacted by a number of other 
factors, including production in 2015, 
the deferral of development projects. 
Drilling
Hydrocarbons were first discovered 
in the Chinarevskoye reservoirs during 
the drilling of nine wells in the Soviet 
era. Between 2004-2015, 72 wells and 
side-tracks have been drilled under 
the PSA.
We completed our drilling 2015 
programme, successfully completing 
six production wells and two appraisal 
wells. 
Our 2016 drilling programme will 
initially be set targeting the addition 
of three new production wells and 
the completion of an appraisal well 
on the Rostoshinskoye field. This will 
allow production to be maintained at 
approximately 40,000 boepd during 
2016. The drilling programme is 
reviewed on a quarterly basis and 
can be scaled up at short notice.

Location
All our facilities are close to major 
international railway lines, as well as 
several major oil and gas pipelines. 
This advantageous location provides 
access to flexible transportation 
links for the off-takers of our products. 
Our on-site facilities have grown 
substantially, with our second 
US$1.2 billion capital investment 
phase currently underway.
Crude oil infrastructure
Our oil infrastructure consists of an oil 
treatment and gathering facility (OTF), 
capable of processing 400,000 tonnes 
of crude oil per year; a 120km 
oil pipeline; oil gathering and 
transportation lines; an oil-loading 
facility at the rail terminal; oil storage 
facilities for up to 30,000 cubic metres 
of oil and railway cars for the 
associated crude oil and stabilised 
liquid condensate.
Oil and stabilised condensate 
pipeline and railway loading 
terminal
Our 120km oil pipeline and 
railway-loading terminal, at Rostoshi 
near Uralsk, were successfully 
completed in 2008. Since 2009, our 
crude oil has been transported via the 
pipeline from the Chinarevskoye field 
site to the railway-loading terminal 
where it is stored and transported 
by rail car to final off-takers. 
Our stabilised liquid condensate is also 
transported through the same pipeline 
using a “PIG” system, which separates 
the crude oil from the stabilised 
condensate. This protects the 
product’s quality from being reduced 
as it would in a multi-purpose pipeline 
and ensures the ability to command 
higher export prices.
On-site facilities
Our oil pipeline has a maximum 
throughput of 3 million tonnes per 
year. The rail-loading terminal, which 
receives the crude oil and condensate, 
has a capacity of 3-4 million tonnes 
per year. 
Our infrastructure also includes crude 
oil storage tanks on site and at the rail 
terminal; condensate tanks on site and 
at the terminal and a loading facility 
at the railway terminal. The loading 
terminal allows for 32 railcars to be 
loaded simultaneously. The facility is 
also equipped with a vapour recovery 
unit – the first in Kazakhstan’s history.
All of our infrastructure has the 
capacity to accommodate the planned 
increase in throughput, in line with 
our strategy to double production. 28 28

Subsoil rights acquisition 
completed
In 2013, Nostrum signed an asset 
purchase agreement to acquire 
100% of the subsoil use rights 
related to three oil and gas fields 
in the pre-Caspian Basin to the 
north-west of Uralsk. The signing 
of the supplementary agreements 
by the Ministry of Oil & Gas became 
effective from 1 March 2013.
Geology
Exploration activities over the past 
decades have successfully shown 
that the three fields contain 
hydrocarbons suitable for commercial 
production in several reservoirs 
of Permo-Carboniferous age. 
More specifically, the bulk of the 
hydrocarbons are located in the 
Bashkirian stage of the Carboniferous. 
Significant appraisal of the existing 
accumulations and exploration of 
deeper intervals is still required prior 
to their development. 
Appraisal programme
The cost of the appraisal programme 
for the next 2-3 years is expected 
to be approximately US$85 million. 
During 2014, we processed and 
interpreted the 3-D seismic survey 
of Rostoshinskoye, and completed 
the re-processing and re-interpretation 
of the Darjinskoye 3-D and 
Yuzhno-Gremyachenskoye 3-D seismic 
surveys. A new reserves report will be 
prepared after drilling of new appraisal 
wells. The results of the reserves report 
will determine the development 
programme as well as provide greater 
detail on reservoir size and fluid 
composition. 
Rostoshinskoye, Darjinskoye & Yuzhno-Gremyachenskoye fields
Total combined reserves
At Nostrum, we have an outstanding 
track record of converting reserves. 
An updated reserve report by 
Ryder Scott, as at December 2015, 
has shown 470 mboe of proved 
and probable reserves for the 
Chinarevskoye and adjacent fields.
In line with our strategy, we will 
continue to look to increase our 
reserve base and secure production 
growth.  Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC

Market share, sales 
and pricing policy
We closely monitor the production, 
marketing and transportation of our 
liquids as this makes up the largest 
proportion of our revenues. We are 
able to achieve a relatively high 
netback for our export production due 
to the transportation of our products 
through our own infrastructure and 
the resulting quality guarantees. 
The commercial production of dry gas 
adds significant benefits through the 
easy off-take of dry gas volumes using 
straightforward pipeline logistics, the 
generation of our own power supply, 
and the partially sponsored supply of 
dry gas to neighbouring communities.
Marketing and sales
Our sales and marketing department 
employs experienced traders. The 
team is constantly working towards 
negotiating new off-take contracts 
and identifying efficient transportation 
options for these new products.
Development of infrastructure
The gas treatment facility uses a gas 
utilisation concept, and was designed 
to treat raw gas from gas condensate 
reservoirs (and the associated gas 
coming from the OTF) into three 
separate products – stabilised 
condensate, LPG and dry gas. The GTF 
associated infrastructure includes a 
power generation station, an LPG 
storage tank farm, an LPG loading 
facility at the rail terminal, LPG railcars 
and a 17km dry gas pipeline.
GTU1&2
This included the construction of 
two gas treatment units, each with 
the capacity to treat approximately 
850 million cubic metres of raw gas. 
The gas treatment facility is now 
producing at capacity with an average 
annual production of 40,391 boepd 
for 2015.
GTU3
The third unit of the gas treatment 
facility will add 2.5 billion cubic metres 
of processing capacity, bringing the 
total to 4.2 billion cubic metres and 
consequently more than doubling 
production capacity. GTU3 is due 
to be completed in 2017.
Power generation plant 
The gas-fired power generation plant 
is linked to the gas treatment facility 
with an output of 15 megawatts 
and provides the field site with the 
electricity it requires.
Gas pipeline
Nostrum has its own 17km gas pipeline 
that was completed in 2011 and is 
linked to the Orenburg-Novopskov 
gas pipeline. The maximum annual 
throughput of this pipeline is several 
billion cubic metres.

in accordance with Kazakh regulations: 
 Air pollution controls;
 Water resources protection and rational use;
 Land protection;
 Control and sustainable subsurface use;
 Flora and fauna protection;
 Radiological, biological and chemical safety;
 Ecological education and information; and 
 and other works.
In 2015, specific monitoring activities were carried out in 
these areas in order to establish benchmarks which are/will 
be integrated into our environmental targets. These include 
the monitoring of the atmosphere, surface water, soil and 
the control of pollutant emissions sources and sewage 
works. 
Nostrum has developed a Site Monitoring Programme, to 
monitor our environmental activities, identify any potential 
operational environmental impact and enable us to take 
prompt corrective measures in case of any incident. 
Programme aims:
 Obtaining relevant information for environmental policy 
decision-making, including environment quality target 
values and information on regulatory instruments 
applicable to environmental impact of production 
processes;
  Ensuring full compliance with the environmental 
legislation of the Republic of Kazakhstan;
 Reducing the impact of production processes on the 
environment; 
  Increasing the efficiency of natural and energy resource 
use;
 Developing a pre-emptive operational emergency 
response;
 Increasing environmental awareness and responsibility 
among managers and employees;
 Reporting on environmental activities and community 
health risks;
  Increasing compliance with environmental requirements;
 Increasing the efficiency of the QHSE management 
system; and
 Taking account of environmental risks in investment and 
finance decisions.
Programme methods and controls:

Compliance with legislation
The “Health, Safety and Environmental Compliance Audit 
(2015)” submitted by AMEC, an independent auditor, 
is a comprehensive document detailing the content, 
methodology and results of the environmental efforts 
at Nostrum. It shows that the environmental monitoring 
programme activities were carried out according to the 
established scope. 
Based on the results of the audit the following main 
conclusions were:
 Production activities of the Company generally comply 
with high standards of environmental, industrial and 
occupational safety;
 During 2015 conversion to full self-sufficiency in electric 
energy supply has been prepared, a gaslift system was 
introduced, a unit for processing of drilling cuttings into 
construction materials was installed and main camps were 
relocated outside the sanitary protection zone of ChOGF. 
All these greatly improve economic, environmental and 
safety performance of the Company and accord with the 
sustainability principles; Strategic report Corporate governance Financial report Regulatory information Additional disclosures
Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC 
Annual Report 2015 45
 At the audited facilities of the Company no serious 
violations of the requirements of legal, regulatory acts 
and international standards have been observed;
 Recommendations of the previous audit have been largely 
fulfilled, including improvement of the environmental, 
health and safety management system;
 At the same time a number of shortcomings have been 
noted. Their correction will allow even greater 
improvement of the Company’s achievements in this area.
Industrial waste management and contaminated 
soil reclamation
Nostrum complies with all current Kazakh legislation with 
regard to industrial waste management and contaminated 
soil reclamation.
Our greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting 
Nostrum has been monitoring and reporting its GHG 
emissions since 2011 in accordance with Kazakh 
regulatory requirements. Starting in 2013, the Company 
has also developed its GHG reporting in line with the new 
regulations amending company law requirements in the UK. 
The data is reported from all emission sources, as required 
under the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and 
Directors’ Report) – Regulations 2013. The period for which 
the Company is reporting the information matches the 
periods in respect of which the Directors’ Report is 
prepared. No responsibility is taken for any emission 
sources, which are not included in the consolidated financial 
statements. The results of the GHG emissions inventory 
are presented in the format recommended by the 
GHG Protocol. 
Direct GHG emissions (Scope 1) 
The baseline in the GHG emissions allocation plan was 
set as the mean value of the total emissions for the years 
2011–2012 (in carbon dioxide emissions equivalent.) 
The quota allocated for 2015 is calculated based on 
commitments to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 
1.5% from this baseline.
The following direct GHG emissions (Scope 1) sources have 
been identified: flares, heaters, incinerators, boilers, gas 
turbine plants, electric power stations, compressors and 
fugitive emissions.
Historically, the major part of stationary combustion 
emissions was attributed to flaring of associated gas at the 
Oil Treatment Unit (OTU) and at the Gas Treatment Facility 
(GTF). The situation has changed considerably since the 
GTF was completed. 
Total direct GHG emissions (Scope 1) subdivided by 
gas types and by source types are summarised in

Indirect GHG emissions (Scope 2) 
Nostrum does not use purchased steam, heating or cooling. 
The only purchased power related to indirect GHG 
emissions is electrical power, which is supplied to 
Nostrum facilities via the Zelenovskaya distribution 
network (ZapKazREK JSC), through its subsidiary Batys 
Energoresursy LLC. The regional emission factor 
(0.27086 tCO

/MWh) was calculated using Methodological 
Guidelines for the Calculation of GHG Emissions from 
Electrical Power Stations and Boiler Houses (Astana, 2010) 
and regional net thermal efficiency of Urals Natural Gas 
Fired Power Plants (73.3%).

Developing a GHG reduction capacity
According to its GHG emissions reduction strategy, 
Nostrum evaluates the potential for GHG emissions 
reductions yearly to plan for the subsequent introduction 
of energy and resource saving measures. To establish this 
reduction potential we go through the following steps: 
 Create a conceptual framework for our greenhouse gas 
emissions enterprise management system (GHG EMS);
 Create a consistent information system for GHG emissions 
monitoring;
 Perform an energy audit at the Company’s production 
facilities;
 Develop an action plan to improve energy efficiency 
at industrial sites;
 Develop the concept of transition to low-carbon 
development;
 Consider the participation of the Company in carbon 
finance activities; and
 Demonstrate the efficiency of the Company’s GHG 
emissions reduction measures.
To meet these ambitious targets, Nostrum has developed 
the commitment of its managers and contractors to provide 
effective assistance in improving energy efficiency and 
reducing GHG emissions.  Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC

Maintaining strong margins and building 
financial flexibility in response to adverse 
macroeconomic circumstances
Effect of realised loss on the structure of assets, capital, liquidity and liability
The loss realised is appropriated to equity. The loss does not impair the Group’s ability to finance its ongoing investment 
in oil & gas assets. The Group at all times maintains an adequate level of liquidity and net debt is kept at defined levels. 
As a result of the realized loss the Group will not pay a dividend in 2016. Reference is made to KPIs on page 8.

General note
For the year ended 31 December 2015 (the ‘reporting period’) realised profit decreased by US$241.2 million to 
US$94.8 million loss (FY 2014: US$146.4 million), which was mainly driven by decrease in the Group’s revenue.
Revenue
The Group’s revenue decreased by 42.6% to US$448.9 million for the reporting period (FY 2014: US$781.9 million). This 
is mainly explained by the decrease in the average Brent crude oil price from 99.7 US$/bbl during 2014 to 53.6 US$/bbl 
on average during the reporting period. The pricing for all of the Group’s crude oil, condensate and LPG is, directly 
or indirectly, related to the price of Brent crude oil.
Revenues from sales to the Group’s largest three customers amounted to US$141.4 million, US$105.0 million and 
US$86.0 million respectively (FY 2014: US$321.8 million, US$124.8 million and US$77.0 million).

Financial review continued
Cost of sales decreased by 15.9% to US$186.6 million for the reporting period (FY 2014: US$221.9 million). The decrease 
is primarily explained by the change in royalties, repair, maintenance and other services and depreciation, depletion 
and amortization, referred to below. On a boe basis, cost of sales decreased marginally by US$1.0 or 7.6% to US$12.7 
for the reporting period (FY 2014: US$13.7) and cost of sales net of depreciation per boe decreased by US$1.5, or 22.2%, 
to US$5.4 (FY 2014: US$6.9).
Depreciation, depletion and amortisation for the reporting period is in line with prior year. Depreciation is calculated with 
units of production method. The fact that depreciation is lower in the reporting period when compared to FY 2014 is 
a consequence of the ratio between the volume produced and the proven developed reserves decrease in the reporting 
period when compared to prior year.
Repair, maintenance and other services decreased by 25.9% to US$26.6 million for the reporting period (FY 2014: 
US$35.8 million). These expenses include maintenance expenses related to the gas treatment facility and other facilities 
of the Group, engineering and geophysical study expenses. These costs fluctuate depending on the planned works on 
certain objects.
Royalties, which are calculated on the basis of production and market prices for the different products, decreased by 
41.0% to US$14.4 million for the reporting period (FY 2014: US$24.3 million). This decrease follows the decline of revenues 
for sold products.
Materials and supplies expenses decreased by 28.3% to US$7.8 million for the reporting period (FY 2014: US$10.9 million). 
This decrease resulted from less need for spare parts and other materials for repairs and maintenance of the facilities, 
specifically for the gas treatment facility and wells.
Well workover costs decreased by 17.7% to US$5.2 million for the reporting period (FY 2014: US$6.3 million). The decrease 
resulted from adjustments to the drilling and workover programme.
Costs for government profit share decreased by US$2.7 million to US$1.9 million for the reporting period (FY 2014: 
US$4.6 million). This decrease follows the decline of revenues for sold products.

General and administrative expenses decreased by 10.1% to US$49.3 million for the reporting period (FY 2014: 
US$54.9 million). This was primarily due to decrease in professional services, in particular audit fees, legal services and 
other consultancy fees, offset by an increase in payroll and related taxes driven partly by the agreement on 19 May 2014 
to acquire Nostrum Services BVBA (formerly Prolag BVBA) and Nostrum Services Central Asia LLP (formerly Amersham 
Oil LLP), which led to the elimination of intercompany management fees, decrease in consultancy fees and recognition 
of those expenses as payroll and related taxes. Strategic report Corporate governance Financial report Regulatory information Additional disclosures

Selling and transportation expenses decreased by 24.0% to US$93.0 million for the reporting period (FY 2014: 
US$122.3 million) being combination of lower sales quantities of liquid products in the reporting period, lower rail tariffs 
and rail tank car (RTC) leasing costs offset, however, by transportation costs incurred in relation to export gas sales in the 
reporting period under new sales contract.

Finance costs decreased by 25.7% to US$46.0 million for the reporting period (FY 2014: US$61.9 million). These costs 
were higher in H1 2014 due primarily to the expenses relating to the early redemption of the Notes issued in 2010 and 
the amortisation of the remainder of transaction cost, incurred for the issuance of these Notes. 
Finance costs – reorganisation
The ‘finance costs – reorganisation’ are represented by the costs associated with the introduction of Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC 
as the new holding company of the Group and respective reorganisation that took place in June 2014.
Other
Foreign exchange losses amounted to US$21.2 million for the reporting period (FY 2014: US$4.2 million). Higher losses 
in 2015 are explained by the fact that on 20 August 2015 the Tenge was devalued against the US Dollar and other 
major currencies due to decision of Kazakhstan to switch to free-float, triggering a 23% slide in the Tenge to a record  
257,21 Tenge for 1 US Dollar. As per 31 December 2015 the exchange rate made up 340,6 Tenge for 1 US Dollar. Since 
the Group had a net asset position of Tenge denominated accounts around this date, the devaluation of the Tenge resulted 
in a significant foreign exchange loss recognised in the reporting period.
Gain on derivative financial instruments amounted to US$37.1 million for the reporting period. Movement in the fair value 
of the derivative financial instruments is disclosed in the Note 29 of the Consolidated financial statements included in 
this report. 
Other expenses decreased marginally by 38.7% to US$30.6 million for the reporting period (FY 2014: US$49.8 million) 
mainly due to lower export custom duties, compensation for social gas and expenses for accruals under subsoil use 
agreement. 
Income tax expense increased by 0.8% to US$166.6 million for the reporting period (FY 2014: US$165.3 million). The 
decrease in income tax expense was primarily driven by lower taxable profit offset by additional deferred tax expenses 
due to decrease of the tax base due to effect of exchange rates changes. Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC

Profit for the year 146,425 18.7 219,519 24.5
For the year ended 31 December 2014 (the “reporting period”) realised profit of the Group decreased by US$73.1 million 
to US$146.4 million (FY 2013: US$219.5 million). The decrease in realised profit is mainly driven by a decrease in the oil 
prices during the second half year of 2014, resulting in a decrease in revenue combined with an increase in other operating 
costs and income tax expenses, partially offset by a gain on derivative financial instruments.
Revenue
The Group’s revenue decreased by 12.6% to US$781.9 million for the reporting period (FY 2013: US$895.0 million). The 
decrease in Group revenue was driven primarily by a significant decrease in the overall oil prices during the second half 
of 2014.

Total 781,878 895,014 (1 13,136) (12.6)
Cost of sales
Cost of sales decreased by 22.5% to US$221.9 million for the 
reporting period (FY 2013: US$286.2 million). The decrease 
is primarily explained by a decrease in depreciation, 
depletion and amortisation, royalties, government profit 
share, repair, maintenance and other services, materials 
and supplies expenses, although this is partially offset by 
an increase in payroll and related taxes, well workover costs 
and other expenses. On a boe basis, cost of sales decreased 
by US$3.29 or 19.4% to US$13.69 for the reporting period 
(FY 2013: US$16.98) and cost of sales net of depreciation 
per boe decreased by US$3.05, or 30.7%, to US$6.88 
(FY 2013: US$9.92).
Depreciation, depletion and amortisation decreased by 
7. 1% to US$110.5 million for the reporting period (FY 2013: 
US$119.0 million). The decrease is mainly due to an increase 
in proved developed reserves starting from 31 August 2013, 
which was partially offset by an increase of production 
volumes.
Repair, maintenance and other services decreased by 
31.6% to US$35.8 million for the reporting period (FY 2013: 
US$52.4 million). These expenses include maintenance 
expenses related to the gas treatment facility and other 
facilities of the Group, and engineering and geophysical 
study expenses. These costs fluctuate depending on the 
planned works on certain objects.
Royalties, which are calculated on the basis of production 
and market prices for the different products, decreased 
by 38.2% to US$24.3 million for the reporting period 
(FY 2013: US$39.4 million). This decrease resulted from the 
reversal of royalty expenses from prior periods amounting 
to US$5.5 million. The reversal was due to the adoption of 
a new work programme for oilfield operations and a change 
in the coefficients used for converting condensate, sales 
gas and LPG volumes into natural gas equivalent volumes.
Costs for government profit share decreased by 
US$26.2 million to a credit of US$4.6 million for the 
reporting period (FY 2013: US$30.7 million). The decrease 
resulted from the adoption of a new work programme 
for oilfield operations and a change in the coefficient of 
natural gas equivalent which resulted in a reversal of the 
government profit share expense from prior periods 
amounting to US$17.8 million.
Materials and supplies expenses decreased by 10.9% 
to US$10.9 million for the reporting period (FY 2013: 
US$12.3 million). This decrease resulted from less need 
for spare parts and other materials for repairs and 
maintenance of the facilities, specifically for the gas 
treatment facility and wells. 
Well workover costs increased by 125.3% to US$6.3 million 
for the reporting period (FY 2013: US$2.8 million). The 
increase resulted from the scheduled work on several wells.
Management fees are absent in cost of sales for the 
reporting period (FY 2013: US$3.6 million). The fees 
incurred by the Group relate to the services provided 
by Probel Capital Management N.V., which was acquired 
by the Group on 30 December 2013 and is now being 
consolidated. The related costs of this entity are included 
in general and administrative expenses for the reporting 
period as professional services (related to the rendering 
of geological, geophysical, drilling, technical and other 
consultancy services) and payroll and related taxes.
General and administrative expenses
General and administrative expenses decreased by 
2.0% to US$54.9 million for the reporting period (FY 2013: 
US$56.0 million). This was primarily due to an increase in 
expenses for professional services, payroll and related 
taxes, which was partially offset by decreased management 
fees, other taxes and training. The change in the structure 
of general and administrative expenses can be explained 
by the acquisition of Probel Capital Management N.V. 
on 30 December 2013, which led to the elimination of 
intercompany management fees, and the recognition 
of its expenses as professional services and payroll and 
related taxes.
Selling and transportation expenses
Selling and transportation expenses increased by 0.5% 
to US$122.3 million for the reporting period (FY 2013: 
US$121.7 million). The significant decrease in transportation 
costs and increase in loading and storage costs is primarily 
due to transportation costs including certain loading and 
storage costs for the prior year. Part of the increase in 
loading and storage costs was driven by a rise in sales 
volumes for LPG and condensate. Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC 
Annual Report 2015 54
Financial review continued
Finance costs
Finance costs increased by US$18.3 million to US$61.9 
million for the reporting period (FY 2013: US$43.6 million). 
The increase in these costs was primarily driven by the 
expenses relating to the early redemption of the 2010 
Notes and the amortisation of the remainder of the 
transaction cost, incurred for the issuance of 2010 Notes. 
Finance costs – reorganisation
The “finance costs – reorganisation” represent the costs 
associated with the introduction of Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC 
as the new holding company of the Group and respective 
reorganisation.
Derivative financial instruments
The “gain on derivative financial instruments” represents 
the fair value of the hedge that the Group entered into on 
3 March 2014 and which runs through 29 February 2016. 
Other
Foreign exchange losses amounted to US$4.2 million for 
the reporting period (FY 2013: US$0.6 million). This is 
explained by the fact that on 11 February 2014 the Tenge 
was devalued against the US Dollar and other major 
currencies. The exchange rates before and after devaluation 
were 155 Tenge/US Dollar and 185 Tenge/US Dollar 
respectively. Since the Group had a net asset position 
of Tenge denominated accounts around this date, the 
devaluation of the Tenge resulted in a significant foreign 
exchange loss recognised in the reporting period.
Other expenses increased by 94.8% to US$49.8 million 
for the reporting period (FY 2013: US$25.6 million). Other 
expenses mainly represent export duties paid by the Group. 
The export duties represent custom duties for the export 
of crude oil and customs fees for services such as 
processing of declarations, temporary warehousing etc. 
Other expenses for the reporting period also include fines 
and penalties amounting to US$2.6 million, which were 
the result of court decisions. 
Income tax expense increased by 16.0% to US$165.3 million 
for the reporting period (FY 2013: US$142.5 million). 
The increase in income tax expense is primarily due to an 
increased deferred tax for the reporting period. This was 
driven by the Tenge devaluation in February 2014, which 
led to a significant decrease in the tax base of property, 
plant and equipment, which is denominated in Tenge.

During the period under review, Nostrum’s principal 
sources of funds were cash from operations and amounts 
raised under the 2012 Notes and the 2014 Notes. Its 
liquidity requirements primarily relate to meeting ongoing 
debt service obligations (under the 2012 Notes and the

Net cash flows from operating activities
Net cash flow from operating activities was US$153.3 million 
for the reporting period (FY 2014: US$349.1 million) and 
was primarily attributable to:
 profit before income tax for the reporting period of 
US$72.3 million (FY 2014: US$311.7 million), adjusted 
by a non-cash charge for depreciation, depletion 
and amortisation of US$109.4 million (FY 2014: 
US$111.9 million), finance costs of US$46.0 million 
(FY 2014: US$61.9 million) and gain on derivative financial 
instruments of US$ 37.1 million (FY 2014: US$60.3 million).
 a US$9.3 million change in working capital (FY 2014: 
US$19.5 million) primarily attributable to an increase in 
trade receivables of US$1.2 million (FY 2014: a decrease 
of US$36.5 million), a decrease in prepayments and other 
current assets of US$12.2 million (FY 2014: an increase 
of US$7.7 million), a decrease in trade payables of 
US$7.3 million (FY 2014: a decrease of US$5.6 million)

(FY 2014: an increase of US$0.3 million).
 income tax paid of US$41.2 million (FY 2014: 
US$118.2 million).
Net cash used in investing activities
The substantial portion of cash used in investing activities 
is related to the drilling programme and the construction 
of a third unit for the gas treatment facility.
Net cash used in investing activities for the reporting 
period was US$245.3 million (FY 2014: US$304.5 million) 
due primarily to costs associated with the drilling of 
new wells of US$58.7 million for the reporting period 
(FY 2014: US$126.8 million), costs associated with the 
third gas treatment unit of US$112.4 million (FY 2014: 
US$142.8 million), costs associated with Rostoshinskoye, 
Darjinskoye and Yuzhno-Gremyachenskoye fields of 
US$7.6 million (FY 2014: US$10.4 million) and placement 
of US$17.0 million of bank deposits, partially offset by 
the redemption of US$42.0 million of cash deposits 
(FY 2014: redemption of US$55.0 million and placement 
of US$25.0 million of bank deposits).
Net cash (used in)/provided by financing activities
Net cash used in financing activities during the reporting 
period was US$115.9 million, and was mainly represented 
by the payment of US$49.1 million in distributions and the 
finance costs paid on the Group’s 2012 Notes and 2014 
Notes. Net cash provided by financing activities during 
FY 2014 was US$147.5 million, which was primarily 
attributable to the issue of the 2014 Notes amounting 
to US$400.0 million, offset by an early redemption of the 
2010 Notes amounting to US$92.5 million, payment of 
US$64.6 million in distributions and the finance costs paid 
on the Group’s 2010 Notes, 2012 Notes and 2014 Notes. Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC

Commitments
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty raising funds to meet commitments associated with its 
financial liabilities. Liquidity requirements are monitored on a regular basis and management seeks to ensure that sufficient 
funds are available to meet any commitments as they arise. The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Group’s

Capital commitments
During the reporting period, Nostrum’s cash used in capital expenditures for purchase of property, plant and equipment 
(excluding VAT) was approximately US$256.1 million (FY 2014: US$325.5 million). This reflects drilling costs, field 
infrastructure development projects and development costs for the oil treatment unit and the gas treatment facility. 
Drilling
Drilling expenditures amounted to US$58.7 million for the reporting period (FY 2014: US$126.8 million).
Gas Treatment Facility
Following the successful completion of the first phase of the gas treatment facility, consisting of two units, the Group is 
constructing a third unit for it. The construction of GTU3 is important for implementing the Group’s strategy to increase 
operating capacity and production of liquid hydrocarbons. Management estimates, based on the production profile 
of both proved and probable reserves reported in the 2015 Ryder Scott Report and assuming the successful completion 
of the gas treatment facility in 2017, that the Company’s annual production will more than double from the 2015 annual 
production (with an average of 40,391 boepd in 2015) by the end of 2018. 
Total costs for the completion of GTU3 are estimated to be not more than US$500 million, of which US$250 million have 
been spent as of the end of the reporting period.  Strategic report Corporate governance Financial report Regulatory information Additional disclosures

Annual Report 2015 59
Identification and assessment of the Group’s key risks 
The Board acknowledges its responsibility for determining 
the significant risks which may potentially affect the Group 
in achieving its strategic objectives. A Group-wide risk 
assessment is performed periodically to identify the nature 
and extent of such risks and determine appropriate 
mitigating actions.
In 2013 the Group formalised the Director’s Risk Register, 
which identified the risks and associated mitigating 
control activities and future actions. These identified 
risks were aggregated and categorised into the following 
risk categories:
 strategic;
 operational; 
 financial; and
 compliance.
Based on this risk register and further analysis and 
discussions the executive management and the Board 
periodically review previously identified significant risks, 
update their likelihood of occurrence and potential impact, 
and identify potential new significant risks emerging as a 
result of the changing environment. These significant risks 
are discussed in more detail below in the section “Principal 
risks and uncertainties”.
Risk assessment and management
The Group has in place risk management processes and 
procedures which are formalised in the Risk Management 
Policy, reflecting the following process:
The Risk Management Policy contains a description of the 
risk management process consisting of the following cycle 
of coordinated activities:



 
to mitigate;
 of occurrence;

 Risk assessment and management
Board
Audit Committee
Executive Committee
Internal audit manager
Review and confirmation by the Board
Risks and mitigation measures validated with 
the executive management and presented to 
the Audit Committee for review
The Audit Committee 
performs an ongoing review 
of the significant risks as 
well as controls put in place 
to mitigate those risks 
by management
Senior management of 
Group functions
Senior management identify the key 
risks and develop mitigation actions
Senior management of 
operating companies
Local management create a register 
of their top ten risks and mitigation 
actions
As from January 2015 for the purposes of 
internal risk management procedures, the 
Company’s Executive Committee replaced 
the executive management
The internal audit manager, who is also 
acting as the Group’s Risk Manager, 
consolidates the operating companies’ and 
Group risks to compile the Group’s risk 
register and key risks
Risk management Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC 
Annual Report 2015 60
Risk management continued


In 2015, the processes related to risk management and 
internal control systems were consistent with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code and the Guidance on Risk 
Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and 
Business Reporting issued in September 2014.
Changes from prior year risk assessment
During 2015 the Board and senior management remained 
conscious of the same principal risks and uncertainties 
which were identified and disclosed in the 2014 Annual 
Report and the related risk assessments did not significantly 
change. However, particular attention was paid to the 
following areas:
 oil price environment and related impact on future 
performance and investments of the Group;
 programme;
 the Group (similar to the instance which occurred in 2015), 
which is considered as part of the principal risk of 
“single revenue source and business interruption”;
 US Dollar on income taxes and related future cash flows;
The principal risks and uncertainties are presented on the 
following pages grouped into the four above-mentioned 
categories.
In addition, in line with the requirements of the 2014 UK 
Corporate Governance Code the Board made a robust 
assessment of the principal risks and uncertainties faced by 
the Group, including those that would threaten its business 
model and future performance, also included as part of a 
longer-term viability assessment.
Viability statement
The Group’s corporate planning process includes 
medium- and long-term financial projections and analysis as 
well as annual budgeting and forecasting. The long-term 
financial model extends through 2032, i.e. the licence term 
of the Chinarevskoye field, currently the main production 
source of the Group. The long-term model supports the 
Board’s activities described on pages 71 to 72, including 
annual strategic planning and decision-making processes. 
For the purpose of monitoring the Group’s performance in 
terms of strategic objectives, related KPIs and risks, as well 
as medium-term development plans (as described on  
pages 22-23) the Board assesses its five-year financial 
projections. In addition, such financial projections are 
supported by the five-year drilling program (mentioned 
in the Chief Executive’s review on page 14). Finally, these 
medium- and long-term planning processes are cascaded 
down to a budgeting and forecasting process, which 
incorporates preparation of the draft annual budget for next 
year in the fourth quarter of every calendar year, which is 
reviewed and approved by the Board, and preparation of 
quarterly forecasts during the year for the Board’s review.
The Board has chosen a five-year period to December 2020 
as a reasonable time-frame, over which it is possible to form 
a reasonable expectation as to the Group’s longer-term 
viability, given the inherent uncertainty involved. This period 
representing the period used for the Group’s mid-term 
business plans has been selected because it provides the 
Board and therefore readers of the annual report with 
a reasonable degree of confidence whilst still providing 
an appropriate longer-term outlook.
The corporate planning process is closely linked with the 
risk management process described on pages 58-59. 
For the purpose of the Group’s viability assessment various 
scenarios are considered on the basis of the five-year cash 
flow model for the purpose of testing its sensitivity to the 
significant risks listed on pages 60-61 (to the extent such 
assessment of the risks is practicable), also including a 
severe but plausible scenario, resulting from a combination 
of those risks. The scenarios take into account the availability 
and likely effectiveness of the mitigating actions that could 
be taken to avoid or reduce the impact or occurrence of the 
underlying risks and that realistically would be open to the 
Group in the circumstances. In considering the likely 
effectiveness of such actions, the conclusions of the Board’s 
regular monitoring and review of risk and internal control 
systems are taken into account. The assumptions used for 
the purpose of the assessment of longer-term viability are 
consistent with the assumptions used in the budgeting & 
forecasting process and include assumptions about the 
results of the drilling program, the completion of GTU3, the 
subsequent uptake of production, the ability to refinance 
debt as it falls due and consistent sales performance.
The directors paid particular attention to the risks 
associated with development projects as well as commodity 
price risk, which may impact the Group’s ability to meet its 
liabilities, including the repayment of its Notes due in 2019.
Based on these assessments and other matters considered 
by the Board during the year, the Board has a reasonable 
expectation that the Group will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the 
period to December 2020. Strategic report Corporate governance Financial report Regulatory information Additional disclosures

Annual Report 2015 61
Principal risks and uncertainties
Strategic risks Description of risk Risk management
Development 
projects
The Group’s planned development 
projects, in particular GTU3 and well 
drilling, are subject to customary risks 
related to delay, non-completion and cost 
overruns, which could impact future 
production and the Group’s performance. 
The Group has formed an experienced 
project management team and expects to 
benefit from the technical expertise and 
significant experience gained from the 
construction of GTU-1 and GTU-2 in the 
construction of GTU-3. The project 
management team reports on a monthly 
basis to senior management and the Board 
on the progress of engineering, procurement 
and construction. 
The Group has concluded the majority of the 
procurement process in relation to GTU3 and 
monitors logistics, engineering, expedition 
of materials and equipment on an ongoing 
basis. JSC “OGCC KazStroyService” has been 
engaged to construct GTU-3, having gained 
experience on similar projects including 
GTU-1 and GTU-2 and other large projects in 
Kazakhstan. 
Senior management and the Board constantly 
monitor the timing, scope and performance 
of the drilling programme and tailor it taking 
into account the status of the GTU3 project 
and current oil prices. For each well a detailed 
drilling programme is approved by senior 
management, which is the basis against which 
the progress of works and costs are reported. 
Commodity 
price risk
The Group is exposed to the risk that 
its future earnings will be adversely 
impacted by changes in the market price 
of crude oil, given that all sales prices of 
crude oil and condensate are based on 
market prices. Crude oil prices are 
influenced by factors such as OPEC 
actions, political events and supply and 
demand fundamentals. 
The Group could also be compelled by 
governmental authorities, purportedly 
acting based on Kazakh legislation, to sell 
its gas domestically at prices determined 
by the Kazakh government, which could 
be significantly lower than prices which 
the Group could otherwise achieve. 
The Group’s hedging policy is that, upon 
entering into longer-term non-scalable capital 
expenditure commitments, it will hedge its 
liquids production. 
In January 2016, Nostrum announced that it 
had rolled its pre-existing hedge into a new 
hedge of 15,000 bopd with a strike price of 
US$49.16 per barrel. The cost of the hedge 
was paid entirely from the sale of the 
Company’s previous hedge for US$92m. 
The new hedge has 24-month tenor, maturing 
in December 2017, with cash settlement on 
a quarterly basis. 
Senior management and the Board 
continuously monitor the timing, scope and 
performance of the drilling programme taking 
into account the oil price environment. 
Additionally, in 2015 the Group started 
exporting the majority of its dry gas under a 
new contract. The export prices are usually 
substantially higher than domestic prices.  Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC 
Annual Report 2015 62
Principal risks and uncertainties continued
Operational risks Description of risk Risk management
Single revenue 
source and 
business 
interruption
The Group’s activities in the Chinarevskoye 
oil and gas condensate field are currently 
the Group’s sole source of revenue.
The Group has a team of dedicated specialists 
who assess possible acquisitions of oil and 
gas fields and assets. In 2013 the Group 
acquired subsoil use rights for three oil and 
gas fields near the Chinarevskoye field. In 
2016, the drilling programme will initially be 
set targeting the addition of three new 
production wells at Chinarevskoye as well as 
the completion of an appraisal well on the 
Rostoshinskoye field. The drilling programme 
is reviewed on a quarterly basis and can be 
scaled up at short notice. A supplementary 
agreement for the Rostoshinskoye field has 
been signed extending the exploration 
period until February 2017. 
In addition, Nostrum’s approach made during 
2015 to the board of Tethys Petroleum Limited 
regarding a possible offer to acquire the 
company represents an example of the 
Group’s further efforts towards diversification 
of the Group’s portfolio of assets. This offer 
was subsequently withdrawn by Nostrum.
Estimation of  
oil and gas 
reserves
The Group is subject to the risk that if 
there are inaccurate assessments and 
overstatement of the oil and gas reserves 
the Group’s non-current assets and 
goodwill may be overstated or impaired. 
This may also be a consequence of 
unsuccessful exploration of the new fields 
and may also result in inappropriate 
decision-making.
The Group has a department of highly skilled 
geologists, who perform periodic 
assessments of the oil and gas reserves 
in accordance with international standards 
on reserve estimations. The results of the 
assessments are reviewed by the Group’s 
independent reserve consultant, Ryder Scott. 
Compliance risks Description of risk Risk management
Subsoil use 
agreements
The Group may have disagreements with 
the Kazakh government regarding its 
subsoil operations or compliance with 
the terms of its subsoil use agreements. 
The Group believes that it is in full compliance 
with the terms of its PSA for the Chinarevskoye 
field and maintains an open dialogue with 
Kazakh governmental authorities regarding all 
of its subsoil use agreements. In the event of 
non-compliance with a provision of any such 
agreement the Group endeavours to have 
such terms modified and pays any penalties 
and fines that may apply. Strategic report Corporate governance Financial report Regulatory information Additional disclosures
Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC 
Annual Report 2015 63
Compliance risks Description of risk Risk management
Environmental 
compliance
The legal framework for environmental 
protection and operational safety is not 
yet fully developed in Kazakhstan and, 
given the changing nature of 
environmental regulations, there is 
a risk that the Group will not be in full 
compliance with all such regulations 
at all times. 
The Group has further strengthened its 
QHSE department during 2015. The Group’s 
QHSE policies are periodically revised to 
ensure compliance with changes and new 
requirements in this area. Key indicators such 
as GHG emissions, lost-time injuries, waste 
management, etc., as well as progress of 
work is reported to senior management on 
a monthly basis. Periodic training on the 
requirements of policies and regulations are 
held for employees. The Group is working 
towards obtaining ISO 14001 Environmental 
Management Systems and ISO 50001 
Energy Management Systems certification. 
The Group also regularly commissions 
independent environmental audits to monitor 
its compliance and best practice in this area. 
Perceived risk of 
non-compliance 
with anti-bribery 
legislation
There is a risk that the Group’s employees 
will unintentionally or deliberately take 
actions prohibited by anti-bribery 
legislation given the perceived 
heightened risk in the jurisdiction in 
which the Group operates.
The Group has adopted an anti-bribery 
and corruption policy, and has included a 
provision on this subject in the Group’s Code 
of Conduct and conducted training for 
employees in relation to their obligations 
in this area. 
Financial risks Description of risk Risk management
Tax law 
uncertainty
The uncertainty of application, including 
retroactive application, of tax laws and 
the evolution of tax laws in Kazakhstan 
create a risk of additional payments of 
tax from assessments which the Group 
believes are inapplicable to it. 
The Group regularly challenges, either with 
the Kazakh tax authorities or through the 
Kazakh courts, tax assessments that it believes 
are inapplicable to it, either pursuant to the 
terms of its subsoil use agreements or 
applicable law. 
Going concern 
and liquidity risk
The Group is subject to the risk of 
encountering difficulties in raising funds 
to meet commitments associated with 
its financial liabilities and respective 
inappropriateness of going concern 
assumptions. 
Liquidity requirements are monitored on a 
monthly basis and management ensures that 
sufficient funds are available to meet any 
commitments as they arise. The treasury 
policy provides for the Group to maintain a 
minimum level of cash of US$50 million.
The risks listed above do not comprise all those associated with the Group’s business and are not set out in any order of 
priority. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to management, or currently deemed to be less material, 
may also have an adverse effect on the Group’s business. The risks listed above are continuously monitored by the 
management team and assessed when making business decisions.
This strategic report is approved by the Board.

Chairman’s overview
Dear shareholder
Nostrum is a simple, sustainable and successful business –  
these are our values and we apply them not only to our 
operational and financial goals, but also to our corporate 
governance. Adopting and implementing good corporate 
governance is a core principle of the Group’s relations 
with each and all of our stakeholders. We strive to govern 
the business in a manner that is both straightforward 
and effective, and which promotes the long-term success 
of the Group. 
The Group continues to embrace and address the 
demands of the additional regulatory obligations that 
are applicable to the Group as a result of Nostrum moving 
to a premium listing on the LSE in 2014. We highlight 
on our website the few areas where the Group does not 
fully comply with the UK Corporate Governance Code 
and explain the reasons behind such non-compliance. 
For further information, please see page 76 and the 
governance section of Nostrum’s website http:// 
www.nostrumoilandgas.com/en/corporate-governance.
While our Company evolves in the short and the long 
term, both organically and through potential M&A activity, 
we will seek to place issues of corporate governance at the 
core of our decision-making processes. We also continue 
to review and develop our corporate governance 
practices to ensure full compliance with regulatory 
requirements and to promote the success and 
sustainability of our business. 
One of the products of our continuous efforts to excel in 
corporate governance is the new Executive Committee, 
which was established earlier this year. The Executive 
Committee is comprised of all of the executive directors 
together with Thomas Hartnett, Gudrun Wykrota and 
Heinz Wendel and was formed in order to better align 
the goals and objectives of each business function and 
to simplify the way in which we manage our business. The 
biographies of each member of the Executive Committee 
can be found on pages 66 to 69.
We also look to achieve a better balance in the gender 
diversity of our Board. Together with the Nomination and 
Governance Committee, I have been working to recruit 
a suitable female Board member to replace one of the 
Company’s current non-executive directors. I hope to 
be able to report on this shortly. 
Alongside this, we will continue to foster Board diversity 
in all regards in order that Nostrum’s directors have the 
appropriate mix of skills, experience, independence and 
knowledge to enable them to discharge their duties and 
responsibilities effectively. 
During the coming year we will conduct an externally- 
facilitated Board evaluation and we look forward to 
deriving concrete benefits from that evaluation process. 
I look forward to updating you on the progress of our 
ongoing efforts to achieve excellence in corporate 
governance during the year ahead.

Corporate governance approach
Corporate governance is very important to Nostrum and the 
Board promotes high standards of corporate governance 
as a key component of its activities. The Company is now 
subject to the provisions of the September 2014 version 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”). The 
Code is publicly available on the website of the UK Financial 
Reporting Council (www.frc.co.uk). 
Please refer to pages 77 to 80 for a detailed explanation 
of the ways in which the Company complies with each 
provision of the Code. The Company fully complies with all 
provisions of the Code with the exception of those matters 
set out on page 76, in respect of which the reasons for 
a divergence from the Code position is explained.
The Board considers all of its non-executive directors, 
other than Piet Everaert and Pankaj Jain, to be independent 
within the meaning of such term as defined in the Code.  
Piet Everaert and Pankaj Jain are not deemed to be 
independent as a result of having been nominated by 
Claremont Holdings C.V. (a Dutch limited partnership 
indirectly controlled by Frank Monstrey, the chairman of 
the Company, and his spouse) and Mayfair Investments B.V. 
(“Mayfair”), respectively, who are the two largest 
shareholders in the Company.
The Code recommends that the Board should appoint one 
of its independent non-executive directors to act in the 
capacity of senior independent director. Eike von der Linden 
serves in such capacity as the Board’s senior independent 
director.
The Board has appointed an audit committee, 
a remuneration committee and a nomination and 
governance committee. The members of these committees 
are appointed principally from among the independent 
directors and all appointments to these committees are 
for a period of one year. The terms of reference of the 
various committees have been drawn up in accordance 
with the provisions of the Code.
Each committee and each director has the authority to 
seek independent professional advice where necessary 
to discharge their respective duties, in each case at the 
Company’s expense. In addition, each director and 
committee has access to the advice of the Company 
Secretary, Thomas Hartnett.
Changes in the operating structure: the 
Executive Committee
In February 2015 the Group established an executive 
committee comprised of all of the executive directors, 
whose details are provided on page 66, together 
with Thomas Hartnett, Heinz Wendel and Gudrun Wykrota, 
whose details are provided on page 68. 
Subject to Kai-Uwe Kessel’s overall responsibility as Chief 
Executive for executive management, each member of the 
Executive Committee has oversight responsibility for 
particular functional areas as follows:

How the Board works

and report to shareholders.
The Board has a formal schedule of matters reserved for 
its decision which cover decisions relating to:

Board activities in the 2015 financial year
The Board is responsible for considering all important

and the Group and has the powers and duties set out in 
the relevant laws of England and Wales and the Company’s 
articles of association. 
The key responsibilities of the Board include:

Annual Report 2015 73
Board composition
The Board consists of nine directors. As at 31 December 
2015, in addition to the Chairman, Frank Monstrey, there 
were two executive directors and six non-executive 
directors.
Within the Board, the roles of chairman and chief executive 
are separate, with each having distinct and clearly defined 
responsibilities. The chairman, Frank Monstrey, is 
responsible for leadership of the Board and for ensuring its 
effectiveness in all aspects of its role. The chairman sets the 
agenda for Board meetings in consultation with the chief 
executive, the chief financial officer and the general counsel 
and company secretary. The chairman is also responsible for 
ensuring that the directors receive accurate, timely and clear 
information and that there is effective communication with 
the directors. The chief executive provides leadership to the 
Group, which enables the successful planning and 
execution of the objectives and strategies agreed by the 
Board. The chief executive is also responsible for care of the 
Group’s assets and, jointly with the chairman, representation 
of the Group to third parties.
Eike von der Linden as senior independent non-executive 
director provides a sounding board for the chairman and 
serves as an intermediary for the other directors when 
necessary. He is available should the need arise to convey 
concerns to the Board other than through the chairman or 
the chief executive.
The Board’s Nomination and Governance Committee keeps 
the balance, independence and succession plans of the 
Board under review so as to maintain an appropriate 
balance of skills and experience within the Company and on 
the Board in accordance with the Code. 
Board diversity
The Board has due regard for the importance of, and 
benefits from, diversity in its membership, including gender 
diversity, and strives to maintain an appropriate balance 
on the Board. The Board is comprised of individuals with 
diverse sectoral experience, ages and geographic and 
ethnic origin. 
Whilst there are currently no women on Nostrum’s Board, 
gender diversity is important to us and the Nomination and 
Governance Committee is currently working together with 
the chairman to source a suitable female Board member 
to replace one of the Company’s current non-executive 
directors in 2016.
Appointment and tenure
All executive directors have service agreements with the 
Company and all non-executive directors have letters of 
appointment with the Company. For all executive directors 
there is no term limit on their services, as the Company 
proposes all executive directors for annual re-election at 
each subsequent Annual General Meeting of the Company. 
The appointment of each of the non-executive directors 
commenced on 19 May 2014. Each appointment is for an 
initial term of three years, subject to being re-elected as 
a director at each subsequent Annual General Meeting of 
the Company. The letters of appointment for non-executive 
directors do not set a fixed time commitment as it is 
anticipated that the time required of directors may fluctuate 
depending on the demands of the Company’s business 
and other events. It is expected that directors will allocate 
sufficient time to the Company in order to discharge their 
duties effectively. 
Copies of the service agreements of the executive directors 
and the letters of appointment for the non-executive 
directors are available for inspection at the Company’s 
registered office and will also be available for inspection 
at the Annual General Meeting.
Company Secretary
The Company Secretary is responsible for advising the 
Board, through the Chairman, on all governance matters. All 
directors have access to the advice and services of the 
Company Secretary, who is responsible for ensuring Board 
procedures are complied with and that there is a good flow 
of information between the Board and its committees. The 
appointment of the Company Secretary is a matter reserved 
for the Board as a whole. Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC 
Annual Report 2015 74
Corporate governance approach continued
Board evaluation 
In line with the requirements of the Code, the Company 
aims to review Board effectiveness annually, with Board 
effectiveness also being reviewed through an external 
performance evaluation every three years. 
In 2015 a detailed questionnaire was prepared by the 
Company Secretary and distributed to each director for 
their feedback regarding the Board’s performance and 
effectiveness. The directors were asked to provide their 
views on a range of subjects, including multiple questions in 
four principal areas: leadership, effectiveness, accountability 
and engagement.
Key findings and action items coming out of the 
self-evaluation include the following:
 a board portal across the Group designed to improve 
the efficiency of information sharing and the distribution 
of Board and committee materials has improved 
communications between the executive and 
non-executive directors and the timeliness of the 
dissemination of information to the Board.
 Board be addressed when appropriate. This has been 
adopted as an action item for the Nomination and 
Governance Committee which is currently in the process 
of identifying a suitable female Board candidate to replace 
one of the non-executive directors in 2016.
 with shareholders and shareholder representative 
groups could be developed further and feedback from 
management to the non-executive directors regarding 
any shareholder concerns could be improved. Whilst 
the Company regularly engages with shareholders it 
does so mainly via its investor relations team and 
executive directors. Going forward the aim is to expand 
this engagement to the non-executive directors by 
arranging meetings with shareholders and/or shareholder 
representative groups as and when requested or appropriate. 
 be discussed at Board level at an earlier stage and this 
suggestion is being considered further by the Board 
and senior management.
 should be considered to keep the Board up-to-date 
on values and standards. In addition to training that the 
Company organises for directors, all directors are regularly 
encouraged to discuss any training and development 
needs at Board meetings and to make recommendations 
to the chairman outside of such meetings. However, 
to ensure that all directors feel able to make such 
suggestions going forward consideration will be given 
to adding the discussion of director training as 
a fixed agenda item at all quarterly Board meetings 
of the Company. 
Director induction and training
Each individual joining the Board receives a full, formal 
induction package with materials on the Group’s business 
and operational, financial and legal matters. They also 
participate in discussions with members of the Board and 
representatives of major shareholders in order to obtain 
a good understanding of the challenges and opportunities 
faced by the Group. Directors are often given the 
opportunity to discuss their training and development 
needs and to make recommendations to the chairman 
regarding topics on which they would like to receive 
training. 
In response to requests from directors, a site visit for the 
Board to the Group’s Chinarevskoye field operations in 
Kazakhstan was arranged in 2015. Geology and reservoir 
training was given as part of the site visit and covered topics 
such as certain regional field studies, production forecasts 
and exploration and appraisal activities. 
The directors regularly attend training events organised 
by third parties and the Company actively encourages 
directors to attend such events. During 2015, members 
of the Audit Committee have been attending various 
workshops hosted by third parties regarding the new 
requirement under provision C.2.2 of the Code for the 
Company to include a viability statement in its Annual 
Report and the Audit Committee has regularly reported 
to the Board on such matters and requested additional 
meetings with the chairman to discuss this new requirement.
Shareholder engagement 
Nostrum is in regular contact with its shareholders and 
sell-side analysts and has maintained an active and 
transparent dialogue throughout the year. We keep all 
existing and prospective investors abreast of company 
news by issuing regular operational and financial press 
releases via the London Stock Exchange’s Regulatory 
News Service, as well as on Nostrum’s website. Additionally, 
each of our quarterly, half-yearly and annual financial results 
are accompanied by a conference call for investors and 
analysts to hear from Nostrum’s senior management. 
Russian translations of all press releases and financial 
reports together with a variety of other shareholder 
information are also available on our website. Strategic report Corporate governance Financial report Regulatory information Additional disclosures
Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC 
Annual Report 2015 75
We respond to daily queries from existing and prospective 
shareholders and sell-side analysts through our Investor 
Relations team. Our registrars, Capita Asset Services, also 
have a team who respond to any technical queries 
shareholders have regarding their holdings in the Company. 
Extensive information is available on our website, where 
shareholders or those with an interest in the Group can 
log their details to receive email updates. 
Nostrum attends investor conferences and industry forums 
throughout the year and we publish a list of these in 
advance on the investor relations section of our website. 
We are available for ad hoc shareholder meetings with 
management and welcome enquiries. Over the year, the 
Investor Relations team and management met with over 
100 institutions internationally.
Shareholders are encouraged to attend the Annual General 
Meeting to discuss the progress of the Group. Our Annual 
General Meeting is open to all our shareholders to attend 
and advance notice of the time, date and location is given. 
It provides an opportunity for shareholders to meet 
with and ask questions of the Board in a more informal 
environment. 
Policies
The Company has adopted a share dealing code, which 
incorporates the Model Code as published in the Listing 
Rules and applies to the directors, senior management 
and other relevant employees of the Group. The Company’s 
share dealing code will be updated to take account of the 
new market abuse rules which come into force in July 2016.
Bribery and corruption are significant risks in the oil and gas 
industry and as such the Company operates a Group-wide 
anti-bribery and corruption policy, which applies to all 
Group employees and contractor staff. The policy requires 
annual bribery and corruption risk assessments; risk-based 
due diligence on all parties with whom the Company does 
business; appropriate anti-bribery and corruption clauses 
in contracts; and the training of personnel in anti-bribery 
and corruption measures. In addition, the Company’s code 
of conduct requires that employees or others working on 
behalf of the Company do not engage in bribery or 
corruption in any form.
In addition, the Company has adopted a whistle-blowing 
policy that takes account of the Whistle-blowing 
Arrangements Code of Practice issued by the British 
Standards Institute and Public Concern at Work.
Board Committees
The Board has established a nomination and governance 
committee, an audit committee and a remuneration 
committee. Further details on each of these committees 
can be found in their reports on pages 88 to 97. The terms 
of reference of each of these committees can be found 
on our website at www.nog.co.uk.
The committees are provided with all necessary resources 
to enable them to undertake their duties in an effective 
manner. The company secretary acts as secretary to the 
committees. The minutes of committee meetings are 
circulated to all directors.
Meetings of the Board and its committees are scheduled 
for March, May, August and November each year. Directors 
unable to attend a Board meeting because of another 
engagement are provided with the briefing materials and 
can discuss issues arising in the meeting with the chairman 
or the chief executive. In addition to scheduled Board 
meetings, there are other ad hoc meetings called to deal 
with specific matters as and when they arise.

Corporate governance approach continued
Compliance with the 2014 UK Corporate 
Governance Code
Nostrum fully complied throughout 2015 with the provisions 
of the 2014 version of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
(the “Code”) except in the following respects:
A.3.1 The chairman does not meet the independence 
criteria set out in B.1.1 of the Code, in part given his 
executive position in the Company. Companies owned and 
controlled by the chairman acquired the Group’s assets 
outright in 2004 and the chairman has been a leading driver 
behind the successful development of the business since 
that date. As such, the other members of the Board consider 
that the chairman’s continued involvement as an executive 
director is important for the future of the business, 
given the chairman’s experience and expertise in the 
development of the Group’s oil and gas assets in 
Kazakhstan.
B.1.2 Given that the chairman fulfils an executive role and 
Piet Everaert and Pankaj Jain are not categorised as 
independent directors as a result of having been nominated 
by Claremont Holdings C.V. and Mayfair Investments B.V. 
(“Mayfair”), respectively, five of the nine directors on the 
Board are not considered independent for the purposes 
of the Code. Mayfair, whilst not considered independent for 
the purposes of the Code, is independent of the other 
shareholders in the Company. Mayfair has no alignment 
with any other major shareholder and hence Mayfair’s 
nominee to the Board is considered to be independent in 
character and judgement with no relationships that directly 
affect his judgement and no single group is therefore able 
to exercise majority influence over the Board as a whole. 
In order to provide additional protections to the Company 
in respect of these areas of non-compliance with the Code, 
the Company has entered into relationship agreements 
with each of Claremont Holdings C.V. and KazStroyService 
Global B.V. (“KSS Global”). On 30 January 2015 Mayfair (an 
affiliate of KSS Global) acquired 48,333,300 ordinary shares 
in the Company from KSS Global and pursuant to a deed 
of adherence of the same date undertook to the Company 
to be bound by the terms of the relationship agreement 
previously signed between the Company and KSS Global 
and to observe and perform all of the provisions and 
obligations of such relationship agreement in so far as 
they fall to be observed or performed on or after the date 
of the transfer.
D.2.1 The Company’s Remuneration Committee consists 
of three independent non-executive directors (Mark Martin, 
Eike von der Linden and Sir Christopher Codrington, Bt.) 
and one non-independent non-executive director 
(Piet Everaert).
Provision D.2.1 of the Code provides that the Remuneration 
Committee must include at least three independent 
non-executive directors and the Company’s remuneration 
committee meets such requirement. However, the 
Company understands that the most common 
interpretation of provision D.2.1 of the Code is that 
any additional director appointed as a member of the 
committee must also be an independent non-executive 
director. If such interpretation is correct, Mr Everaert’s 
membership in the Remuneration Committee does 
not comply with provision D.2.1 of the Code.
In order to ensure there would be no conflict of interest, 
the committee decided in 2015 that Mr Everaert would not 
participate in any discussions, or vote on any resolutions, 
regarding Frank Monstrey’s remuneration. In addition, on 
22 March 2016 Mr Everaert resigned from the Remuneration 
Committee so that the composition of the committee would 
comply with Provisions D.2.1of the Code.
E.2.3 All directors did not attend the 2015 Annual General 
Meeting, however those directors who did not attend were 
available by teleconference to answer questions from 
shareholders.
We describe how we have applied the main principles of 
the 2014 Code in the following table, cross-referencing 
to other parts of this annual report. The table helps us to 
evaluate our compliance during the year and should be 
read in conjunction with the Corporate Governance section 
as a whole. Headings in the table correspond to the 
headings in the Code. Strategic report Corporate governance Financial report Regulatory information Additional disclosures

A. Leadership
A.1 The role of the Board
The Board’s responsibilities are set out in the section 
entitled “How the Board Works” on page 71 of the 
Annual Report. 
The Board met formally seven times during 2015. All 
directors are, where possible, expected to attend all Board 
and relevant Committee meetings. Details of Board 
meeting attendance for the year are set out on page 75 
of the Annual Report.
The Board has approved certain policies including a 
formal schedule of matters reserved for the Board, a 
delegation of signature authority policy and an internal 
approvals policy which delegates the approval of certain 
matters to the Executive Committee and/or certain of its 
members. Further information can be found on page 75 of 
the Annual Report.
A.2 Division of responsibilities
Frank Monstrey, the chairman, is responsible for leading 
the Board while Kai-Uwe Kessel, the chief executive, is 
responsible for the day-to-day management of the Group. 
Further details of the roles of chairman and chief executive 
can be found on page 73 of the Annual Report.
A.3 The chairman
The chairman sets the agenda for Board meetings and 
promotes a culture of openness and debate by ensuring 
there is effective communication between executive and 
non-executive directors. 
As explained in more detail on page 76 of the Annual 
Report the chairman does not meet the independence 
criteria set out in provision B.1.1 of the Code.
A.4 Non-executive directors
The Board has appointed Eike von der Linden as senior 
independent non-executive director. Mr von der Linden 
provides a communication channel between the chairman 
and the non-executive directors. Further information 
regarding Mr von der Linden’s role can be found on 
page 73 of the Annual Report.
The chairman is available to the non-executive directors

B. Effectiveness
B.1 The composition of the Board
The Board consists of nine directors; three executive 
directors, four independent non-executive directors and 
two non-executive directors who are not considered 
independent for the purposes of the Code. Therefore, as 
explained in further detail on page 76 of the Annual 
Report, the current composition of the Board does not 
comply with provision B.1.1 of the Code as five of the nine 
directors on the Board are not considered independent.
The Nomination and Governance Committee is 
responsible for regularly reviewing the composition of 
the Board. No changes were made to the composition 
of the Board during 2015. 
B.2 Appointments to the Board
The Nomination and Governance Committee leads 
the appointment of new directors. The report of the 
Nomination and Governance Committee can be found 
on pages 88 of the Annual Report and provides an

induction and training programmes and is responsible for 
ensuring that the correct Board procedures are followed. 
The company secretary also assists the chairman in 
ensuring that all directors have full and timely access to all 
relevant information and advises the Board on corporate 
governance matters. The removal of the company 
secretary is a matter for the Board as a whole.
B.6 Evaluation 
The Board and its committees undertook an internal 
evaluation during 2015. In accordance with provision 
B.6.2 and as the Board has conducted internal evaluations

D.2 Procedure
The Remuneration Committee consists of at least 
three independent non-executive directors, however, 
Mr Everaert, a non-independent non-executive director, 
is also a member of the Remuneration Committee and the 
Company understands that the common interpretation of 
provision D.2.1 of the Code is that any additional director 
appointed as a member of the Remuneration Committee 
must also be an independent non-executive director and 
therefore the Company does not fully comply with 
provision D.2.1 of the Code

. Further details can be found 
on page 76 of the Annual Report. 
The Board has delegated a number of responsibilities to 
the Remuneration Committee including determining the 
remuneration of the chairman, the chief executive, the chief 
financial officer, the company secretary and the executive 
committee. Full details are set out in the Remuneration 
Committee terms of reference which can be found at:

and the chairman seeks to ensure that the Board is kept 
appraised of shareholder views.
Further information regarding shareholder engagement 
can be found on pages 74 to 75 of the Annual Report.
E.2 Constructive use of General Meetings
The Company’s Annual General Meeting provides 
shareholders with the opportunity to vote on certain

Audit Committee Report
Letter from the Chairman
It is paramount that the duties of the Audit Committee 
are performed effectively in market conditions such as 
these, with the last year punctuated by the continued 
decline in oil prices. I am pleased to say that throughout 
2015 the Audit Committee has remained focused on 
its responsibilities to Nostrum’s shareholders and has 
continued to deliver oversight and control successfully. 
In addition, the Committee has embraced the new 
regulatory requirement of the viability statement and 
looks forward to building this firmly into Nostrum’s 
corporate governance practices from now on. 
Since its last reporting date, the Audit Committee has 
held eight formal meetings, of which four were held in 
preparation and connection with Board meetings and 
three in anticipation of the viability statement. In 
addition, eight Audit Committee conference calls were 
conducted, the last four in connection with tendering 
of external audit services for the year 2016.
My private meetings with Nostrum’s external audit 
partner gave the Audit Committee an opportunity to 
share our views on the Group’s potential risk areas and 
discuss the areas of concern raised by the committee 
members. In addition, we were periodically updated 
by the Group’s internal audit manager on the audits of 
internal controls, development of the risk management 
function and other assignments given to internal audit.
When the committee members had questions or 
comments on the monthly management reports, those 
were immediately discussed with the Group’s CFO and, 
when considered necessary, recommendations were 
made to the executive management team.
Quarterly meetings of the committee usually take place a 
few days or just prior to a Board meeting to maximise the 
efficiency of the committee’s interaction with the Board. 
As chairman of the committee, it is my responsibility to 
report to the Board on key topics discussed at committee 
meetings to ensure that all directors are informed of the 
committee’s work. 
I believe that the committee consists of members with 
an excellent balance of skills and experience, allowing the 
committee to perform its tasks effectively whilst being 
supported by the management, the external auditor and 
the Group’s internal audit manager.

The members of the Audit Committee were selected 
with the aim of providing a wide range of financial and 
commercial expertise necessary to meet the responsibilities 
of the Committee. All members of the Committee are 
considered to have the required recent and relevant 
financial experience. 
The committee meets on a quarterly basis or additionally 
as and when required. The chief financial officer and the 
internal audit manager are also invited to the meetings 
if regarded necessary together with the external auditor. 
In addition to these activities, on a monthly basis the 
members of the committee are updated by management 
and the internal audit manager on key issues and 
developments including the status of the Group’s strategic 
initiatives, financial performance, risk management and 
internal controls. 
 
Activities of the Audit Committee during the year
The committee held eight meetings in 2015 and below is a 
summary of the major activities of the committee during the 
year, which include: compliance with corporate governance 
standards, financial reporting, external audit, internal audit, 
internal controls and risk management, significant issues 
and related actions and the committee review. 
Compliance with corporate governance standards
Nostrum’s approach to corporate governance is primarily 
based on the UK Corporate Governance Code published by 
the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) and the Listing Rules 
of the UK Listing Authority. 
As of 31 December 2015, Nostrum complied with all the 
principles and provisions of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code in relation to the work of the committee. 
The committee held several meetings with the external 
auditor to discuss the new requirements of the 2014 UK 
Corporate Governance Code relating to the viability 
statement. In addition, the committee gave appropriate 
attention to the recently emerging risks related to cyber 
security and participated in the 2015 Cyber Governance 
Health Check conducted by the UK authorities.
Nostrum has also established a Group Whistle-blowing 
Policy and has appointed two compliance liaison officers; 
one Russian-speaking compliance liaison officer based 
in Kazakhstan and a further Dutch- and English-speaking 
compliance liaison officer based in Brussels, to ensure 
that all Group employees have access to someone who 
can provide them with support and guidance on their 
rights and obligations regarding whistle-blowing. The 
Audit Committee maintains close contact with the 
compliance liaison officers. 
Financial reporting
While reviewing the draft quarterly and annual financial 
statements as well as the Annual Report, the committee 
focused on challenging: 
 disclosures made with financial reporting standards and 
relevant corporate governance requirements; 
 management, which are discussed in more detail in the 
section entitled “Significant issues and related actions” 
below; and 
 balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Group’s performance, business model and strategy. 
  Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC 
Annual Report 2015 84
Audit Committee Report continued
Any questions and comments arising from the Committee 
and from the external auditor were discussed with 
Nostrum’s management at meetings of the committee. 
Subsequently, based on its overall assessment the 
committee recommended that the Board approve the 
financial statements and the Annual Report. 
The committee continuously provides feedback to 
management on ways to improve the effectiveness and 
clarity of the Group’s corporate reporting and has 
encouraged management to support and adopt regulatory 
initiatives that would enhance the Group’s reporting. 
External audit 
During Q4 2015 the Audit Committee reviewed and 
discussed the detailed audit plan prepared by Ernst & 
Young LLP (UK) which identifies the audit scope and its 
assessment of key risks. The key risks monitored by the 
committee correspond with those identified and assessed 
by management and the external auditor. These risks and 
remediating actions are explained in detail in the section 
entitled “Significant issues and related actions” below. All 
members of the committee support the application of 
professional scepticism by the Group’s external auditor. 
During 2015 and 2016 the members of the committee held 
private meetings with the external auditor, which provided 
a mutual opportunity for open dialogue and feedback 
without management being present. Topics covered at 
such meetings include: the external auditor’s assessment 
of significant risks and related management actions, 
confirmation that there has been no restriction in the scope 
placed on it by management, the adequacy of the audit 
fees, the independence of its audit and how it has exercised 
professional scepticism. 
The effectiveness of the external auditor is evaluated by the 
committee each year and takes into account the quality of 
the work and communication undertaken by the external 
auditor and the level of audit fees. The committee reviewed 
the 2015 H1 interim and 2015 annual auditor’s reports 
giving particular consideration to the audit procedures 
and findings in the areas of significant judgements and 
estimates. The committee also reviewed and discussed the 
Group’s significant risks identified by the external auditor, 
and reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s risk 
management framework related to such risks.
The committee also reviewed the letter of representation 
to be signed by management in respect of both the interim 
review and the annual audit. 
Appointment of external auditor
Ernst & Young LLP (Kazakhstan) was the auditor of the 
predecessor group of companies since 2007, and continued 
auditing Zhaikmunai LLP in 2015, while Ernst & Young LLP 
(UK) was first appointed as an auditor of the Group on 
19 May 2014 based on the recommendation of the 
committee and upon approval by the Company’s 
shareholders and re-appointed as an auditor of the Group 
on 19 May 2015. Mr Richard Addison was appointed as lead 
audit engagement partner on 19 May 2014 and continued in 
this role for the 2015 Group audit. 
Given guidance contained under provision C.3.7 of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code that provides that 
companies should put their external audit contract out to 
tender at least once every ten years together with sustained 
low oil prices the committee decided to initiate a tender 
process for the external audit arrangements for the year 
ending 31 December 2016 to ensure that the Group is 
receiving high quality audit services at the best available 
price. Several Big4 audit firms as well as one Tier2 audit 
firm participated in the tender process as a result of which 
it was concluded that it would be in the best interests of 
shareholders to continue engaging Ernst & Young LLP (UK) 
as the Group’s external auditor and on that basis the Board, 
on the recommendation of the committee, will ask 
shareholders to approve the re-appointment of Ernst & 
Young LLP (UK) as the Group’s auditor at the Company’s 
2016 annual general meeting.
Non-audit services
The committee monitors the external auditor to ensure that 
it does not provide non-audit services that are prohibited 
by the UK Auditing Practices Board (APB), and limits such 
services to due diligence services, other assurance services 
and tax compliance and advisory services. 
In 2015, non-audit fees totalled US$203 thousand (2014: 
US$1,089 thousand, including US$730 thousand for 
services relating to corporate finance transactions and 
US$40 thousand for tax compliance services) including 
US$180 thousand (2014: US$319 thousand) for quarterly 
reviews of the interim financial statements and 
US$23 thousand for other non-audit services. The Audit 
Committee is satisfied that adequate safeguards to ensure 
Ernst & Young’s independence are in place. The committee 
concurred with the external auditor’s position that the 
non-audit services do not impair the external auditor’s 
independence. 
The Group’s “Policy on the provision of non-audit services 
by the external auditor” was developed on the basis of the 
requirements of the UK Corporate Governance Code and 
Auditing Practices Board’s (APB) Ethical Standards. The 
main principle of the policy is that non-audit services may 
only be provided by the external auditor where the external 
auditor maintains the necessary degree of independence 
and objectivity and standard supplier selection procedures 
are carried out. The following are the main areas covered by 
the policy:
 the Group’s main principles in relation to non-audit 
services,  Strategic report Corporate governance Financial report Regulatory information Additional disclosures
Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC 
Annual Report 2015 85
 prohibited services – the services which must not be 
provided by the Group’s external auditor; 
 permissible non-audit services – the services which may 
be provided by the Group’s external auditor to the extent 
that they are allowed by the APB Ethical Standards and 
provided that all necessary safeguards are applied;
 procedures for the approval of services to be provided by 
the Group’s external auditor, including thresholds for such 
approvals;
 safeguards that must be considered for non-audit 
services;
 independence requirements, including requirements 
related to hiring employees of the external auditor, 
requirements related to external auditor’s partner rotation; 
and
 reporting requirements related to non-audit services.
The policy is available on the Group’s website at  
www.nog.co.uk. and will be reviewed and amended as 
and when required.
Internal audit 
The committee periodically receives reports from the 
Group’s internal audit manager throughout the year. The 
reports summarise internal audit findings and any action to 
be taken by management as a result. 
In 2014 the Group developed its internal audit function 
and hired an internal audit manager. In connection with this 
an internal audit charter has been adopted, which sets 
out the responsibilities of the internal audit function, and 
a three-year internal audit plan has been developed. The 
primary role of the internal audit function is to help the 
Board and executive management to protect the assets, 
reputation and sustainability of the organisation. This is 
intended to be achieved through: 
 Group;
 processes so that they operate effectively and efficiently 
and reflect leading practice; and
 and assurance across the Group. 
The Group aims to further develop its ongoing process for 
identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks 
faced by the Group in accordance with the FRC’s Internal 
Control: Revised Guidance for Directors on the Combined 
Code (formerly, the “Turnbull Guidance”). The system is 
intended to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure 
to achieve business objectives and can only provide 
reasonable and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. 
The Group plans to enhance the internal audit function 
by assigning internal resources to support the function 
(provided that all necessary safeguards are considered) 
and refining the terms of the internal audit charter in 
consultation with the committee to ensure that it is effective 
and meets the requirements of the business. 
Internal controls and risk management 
The committee has been focusing on the Group’s risk 
assessment and management systems. A comprehensive 
financial procedures report (dated 20 May 2014) was 
developed by the Group during the process of its move to 
a premium listing and was reviewed by the committee. The 
committee established a director’s risk register and actively 
participates in further enhancing it. In 2015 the Group’s 
risk management policy has been drafted and considerable 
progress has been made towards further development of 
a comprehensive risk matrix, and a dedicated software 
solution is in process of deployment, which is expected to 
support the risk management at various levels and locations 
within the Group. 
Particular attention is also paid by the committee to the 
areas of risk management related to ensuring adequate 
maintenance of accounting records and accurate recording 
of transactions, which permit the preparation of financial 
statements in accordance with IFRS. In view of the oil price 
fluctuation, the committee focused on the review of 
impairment testing, going concern and viability statement. 
The Group’s system of internal controls is aimed at 
mitigating risks and improving efficiency, and includes but is 
not limited to the following:
 corporate governance approach, segregation of 
authorities and duties at various levels;
 policies and procedures covering various areas, including 
director’s remuneration, compliance, accounting and 
reporting, health, safety and environment, and others as 
mentioned in the relevant sections of the Annual Report;
 periodic revision of policies and procedures, and related 
trainings and internal communications;
 constant monitoring by senior management and the 
Board of short-term, medium-term and long-term 
planning and decision-making processes;
 internal audit work and the remedial actions taken by 
management in response to findings
In the committee’s view the Group maintains robust and 
defensible systems of risk management and internal 
controls, and the committee makes recommendations to 
the senior management on further improvements as and 
when considered necessary.  Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC

Audit Committee Report continued
Significant issues and related actions
The following are the key risks and issues that the committee focused on during 2015:
Significant issues Committee actions
Recoverability of non-current assets’ carrying values 
The Group performs impairment testing of goodwill on an annual basis 
as required by IFRS. Moreover, the continuing fall in market oil prices since 
Q4 2014 was considered an impairment trigger event for oil & gas assets 
and exploration & evaluation assets. The impairment testing is subject 
to application of management judgement and various assumptions, 
underlying the calculation of the value in the use of this single cash 
generating unit, being the achievability of the long-term business plan 
and the macroeconomic and related modelling assumptions underlying 
the valuation process. 
 
The committee reviewed the detailed reports on impairment testing 
prepared by management and challenged the appropriateness of the 
assumptions made. Areas of focus were the achievability of the business 
plans, as well as assumptions in relation to oil prices and discount rates, 
which have been subject to volatility given the current macroeconomic 
conditions. Special consideration was also given to the sensitivity analysis 
in relation to these assumptions. In addition, these assumptions and 
sensitivity analysis were considered as part of the viability assessment. This 
has also been one of the main areas of audit focus and Ernst & Young LLP 
provided detailed reporting on these matters to the committee.
Oil & gas reserves estimation and accounting
Oil & gas reserves, which are estimated by the Group’s reserve engineers 
and audited by the independent reserve engineers, are used to 
calculate the depletion of oil & gas assets, and also used as input data 
for impairment testing models. Judgements and estimates are used when 
estimating the oil & gas reserves. 
 
The committee reviewed judgemental aspects of the reserve estimation 
report as part of the Group’s annual due diligence process. In addition, 
it reviewed the reserves analysis paper prepared by the internal audit 
in cooperation with the business development team. The committee also 
examined the governance framework for the oil & gas reserves process, 
training for staff and developments in regulations and controls.
Revenue recognition
The timing of revenue recognition in accordance with Incoterms, the 
recognition of revenue on a gross or net basis, and the treatment of 
discounts are complex areas of accounting.
 
The committee has reviewed the Company’s policy and controls in relation 
to revenue recognition and specifically compliance with the PSA.
Related party transactions and disclosures 
This has been assessed as a significant risk area due to the inherent 
complexity of identifying related parties and the extensive disclosure 
requirements of IAS 24 regarding related party disclosures as well as 
the past history of significant related party transactions carried out by 
the Group.
 
The committee has been monitoring the procedures in place for the 
identification of related parties and ensures that pre-approvals are 
obtained before entering into contracts with them. Also the committee 
considered any observations made by the auditor as part of its reporting 
to the committee.
GTU3 construction and well drilling
There are internal and external factors threatening the ability of the Group 
to achieve its strategic objectives such as the construction of GTU3 and 
the drilling programme. These include, but are not limited to, inadequate 
project management, supplier delays, availability of financial and other 
resources and cost overruns.
 
The construction of GTU3 and the drilling programme continued to be 
one of the key areas of focus for the committee in 2015, particularly in light 
of the decline in oil prices. The committee has been reviewing reports 
prepared by management and meeting regularly to review and discuss 
potential problems and to provide advice on future steps to be taken 
by the Group. 
Other areas of committee risk focus
In addition to the abovementioned significant risks, the committee also paid attention to the following risks areas during 2015:
Tax contingencies and compliance with PSA 
The Group is subject to risks associated with uncertainties surrounding 
the application of tax laws in Kazakhstan as well as the uncertainties and 
complexities of the calculation of taxes and other obligatory contributions 
under its production sharing agreement. As a result, management is 
required to make judgements and estimates in relation to provisioning 
for related taxes and contributions.
 
The committee considered management reports setting out the results 
of assessments in relation to significant taxes and other contributions to 
the government. Having received input from the external auditor and 
challenging decisions made, the committee agreed with management’s 
assessment of the provision to be recognised in respect of taxes and 
uncertain tax positions (transfer pricing and social commitments) and 
the associated disclosures. In addition, the committee continuously 
monitored that the Group’s projected liquidity position accounts for 
any potential claims.
The Committee review 
The committee undertakes an annual evaluation of its 
performance and effectiveness. 
In August 2015 the committee used a survey which 
examined governance processes such as the mix of 
experience and skills amongst members, meeting content, 
information, training and resources. Areas of focus for 2015 
arising from the evaluation include monitoring the length 
of committee membership and suggestions for further 
committee training. Aside from this observation, the 
committee concluded that its mandate and oversight 
performance were appropriate.  Strategic report Corporate governance Financial report Regulatory information Additional disclosures
Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC 
Annual Report 2015 87
Significant issues Committee actions
Provisions and contingencies 
The recognition of provisions for the future decommissioning of oil & gas 
assets at the end of their economic lives requires management’s 
judgement when estimating settlement dates, the scope of work, 
technology and legal requirements. Also the level of provisioning for 
contingent and other liabilities is an issue where management and legal 
judgements are important.
 
The committee reviewed management’s reports on the Group’s 
decommissioning, environmental remediation and litigation provisioning, 
including key assumptions used, the governance framework applied, 
discount rates and the movement in provisions over time.
Commercial tests: going concern, viability statement,  
impairment test 
The determination that the Group will continue on a going concern basis 
for the foreseeable future requires management to exercise judgement. 
This obligation also applies for the medium term viability statement  
and for the long term impairment test.
 
The committee considered the reports prepared by management and 
their assumptions and concluded that management’s recommendation 
to prepare the accounts on a going concern basis was appropriate. The 
viability statement approves the company’s robustness under conservative 
oil price assumptions and the impairment test evidences the companies 
sound long term perspectives. The committee also considered the 
external auditor’s findings on these reports and assumptions. 
Derivative financial instruments 
The estimation of the fair value of derivative financial instruments involves 
the use of judgement and estimations in relation to oil price volatilities by 
both external service providers and management. In addition, there are 
risks associated with the complexity of accounting and disclosures related 
to derivative financial instruments.
 
The committee reviewed management’s report on the valuation of 
derivative financial instruments and the respective disclosures made in 
the notes to the financial statements. The external auditor’s conclusions 
on the valuation models were also discussed at committee meetings.
Information security risks 
Given its public nature the Group needs to ensure that its environment is 
sufficiently secure to protect it against the risk of loss or corruption of 
sensitive information. Failure to adequately protect such information could 
have a material adverse effect on the Group’s reputation and may lead to 
legal action against the Group.
 
At its quarterly meetings, the Committee pays attention to information 
security related matters and discusses with the management past and 
planned actions directed at addressing the recommendations from 
external consultants. Also, the Chairman of the committee received timely 
updates on the risks and responses in the context of the Cyber Governance 
Health Check carried out by the UK authorities.
Environmental compliance 
Given the changing nature of environmental regulations in Kazakhstan, 
there is a risk that the Group will not be in full compliance with all 
regulations at all times.
 
As part of the monthly management reports the committee reviewed the 
Group’s activities to ensure an appropriate level of protection for health, 
safety and the environment. The committee has also reviewed the annual 
report prepared by the independent environmental auditor outlining the 
Group’s compliance and the environmental auditor’s recommendations 
for improvement.

Nomination and Governance Committee Report
Letter from the Chairman
Chairman’s introduction 
I am pleased to report on the Nominations and 
Governance Committee, which I chair. 
The Nomination and Governance Committee has met 
four times this year. The attendance of each committee 
member at committee meetings held during 2015 
is shown on page 75.
Membership
The committee consists of three members: Frank Monstrey, 
Eike von der Linden and myself who have all been 
members since 19 May 2014. The primary responsibilities 
of the committee are set out in its terms of reference 
which are reviewed and updated annually and which 
are available for download on the Company’s website. 
Alternatively, copies can be obtained on request from 
the company secretary.
Role of the Nomination and Governance Committee
The key responsibilities of the committee are to:
 recommendations to the Board regarding candidates 
for appointment or reappointment as directors;
 board governance and corporate governance issues, to 
enable the Board to operate effectively and efficiently;
 (including skills, knowledge and experience) required 
of the Board;
 Company, both executive and non-executive, with a 
view to ensuring the continued ability of the Company 
to compete effectively in the marketplace; and
 directors.
Committee meetings
Only members of the committee have the right to attend 
committee meetings. However, other individuals such as 
the chief executive, the head of human resources and 
external advisers may be invited to attend all or part of any 
meeting, as and when appropriate. 
Main activities of the committee during the year
During 2015 the committee has continued to focus on 
succession planning by assessing the current balance of 
skills, experience, independence and knowledge on the 
Board and those required of future appointments to the 
Board. The committee is satisfied that the mix of skills, 
experience and knowledge on the Board and, in 
particular, those of the chairman and chief executive 
remain appropriate. The committee has focused its 
attention on developing profiles for future Board 
candidates.
The committee discussed executive succession planning 
and, in relation to the chairman, it was agreed that in the 
event the chairman became unable to continue in that 
role for any reason, the senior independent director would 
replace him on an interim basis until a new chairman is 
selected.
Diversity is an important issue for the Board and it 
recognises that steps should be taken to meet the 
voluntary Board gender diversity targets set by Lord 
Davies. Therefore, the committee has spent much of 
2015 focusing on the subject resulting in the engagement 
of two search firms to assist with identifying suitable 
female Board candidates. When a suitable female Board 
candidate is identified and agrees to join the Board 
a member of the Board will step down to allow for the 
appointment of a female Board member.
The committee discussed Mr Everaert’s position on the 
Remuneration Committee during 2015 and it was agreed 
that Mr Everaert should remain as a member of the 
Remuneration Committee but that given his non-independent 
status he should not be involved in any discussions 
or decisions regarding Mr Monstrey’s remuneration. 
However, on 22 March 2016 Mr Everaert resigned from 
the Remuneration Committee so that the Company 
would comply unquestionably with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code on this point.
The committee has also kept the training needs of the 
directors under review throughout the year, especially in 
relation to operational, environmental and social matters.
During the year ahead the committee intends to continue 
to build on the progress it has made in terms of 
succession planning and gender diversity, to keep the 
composition of the Board and its committees under 
constant review and to assess how talent is developed 
internally to create a pipeline to the Board to ensure that 
good governance practices are being achieved.

Remuneration Committee Report 
Letter from the Chairman
Dear shareholder
2015 was a challenging year for the Group given the 
substantial drop in the oil price, but as regards 
performance by senior executives against KPIs:
 stable production of 40,391 boepd was achieved, 
despite a prolonged shutdown of a customer’s gas 
pipeline in October that severely disrupted production 
during that month;
 significant progress was made on GTU3 construction 
and the project was expected to be completed on time 
and on budget until a slowdown in works and payments 
was announced by the Company in 2016 due to the 
precipitous fall in the oil price;
 preparatory work for exploration of the Rostoshinskoye 
field progressed in 2015;
 the Company established a full business development 
team and pursued various M&A opportunities; and
 an Executive Committee was established for the Group 
and the project for the establishment of a functional 
(rather than entity-based) organisation is proceeding.
Notwithstanding these achievements, given (i) the 
precipitous drop in the oil price in the second half of 2015, 
with the resulting effect on the Group’s revenues (ii) the 
need for the Group to maintain liquidity and ensure 
sufficient funding is available to complete GTU-3 and its 
other capex requirements (iii) management’s decision to 
cut operating expenditures in 2016 by 25% from the level 
of actual 2015 expenditures management proposed and 
the committee accepted, that no bonuses will be payable 
to the executive directors in 2016 for 2015 performance. 
Bonuses and salary increases awarded to executive 
directors remain extremely low in comparison to the 
Company’s peer group. 
In addition, the committee has discussed the 40% 
maximum annual bonus opportunity referenced in the 
remuneration policy and would like to assure investors 
that, notwithstanding any flexibility afforded by the 
current remuneration policy, the committee considers the 
40% maximum bonus opportunity to be a firm maximum 
that will not be exceeded under any circumstances. 
The committee has also been reviewing the effectiveness 
of the Group’s phantom share option plan in incentivising 
and retaining key employees of the Group and is currently 
considering alternative long-term incentive plan options. 
On 22 March 2016, Piet Everaert resigned as a member of 
the committee to ensure the Company fully complies with 
Provision D.2.1 of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
and I would like to take this opportunity to thank Piet for 
his hard work and contribution to the committee.
At the 2015 Annual General Meeting, shareholders 
approved the remuneration policy. The Remuneration 
Committee believes that the remuneration policy 
continues to support the Company’s strategy and will not 
propose any changes to the policy at the 2016 Annual 
General Meeting. Although the committee does not 
propose to make any changes to the remuneration policy, 
in line with guidance, the existing policy has been 
included in this years Directors’ remuneration report for 
the information of shareholders.
This report has been prepared in accordance with the 
UK’s regulations on remuneration reporting and will be 
subject to an advisory shareholder vote at the forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting.

2015 annual report on remuneration
In this section we give details of the composition of the 
Remuneration Committee and activities undertaken in the 
2015 financial year. We will seek an advisory vote on the 
remuneration report at the 2016 Annual General Meeting.
Remuneration Committee 
The remuneration of the chairman, the chief executive, the 
chief financial officer, the company secretary and all other 
senior members of executive management is determined 
by the committee under delegated powers from the Board 
and in accordance with the committee’s terms of reference. 
The chairman and the executive members of the Board 
determine the remuneration of all non-executive directors, 
including members of the committees. 
In accordance with the terms of reference, members of 
the committee shall be appointed by the Board on the 
recommendation of the Nomination and Governance 
Committee in consultation with Mr Martin as chairman 
of the committee. The committee must always include 
at least three independent non-executive directors who 
comprise a majority of the committee. The members of 
the committee during 2015 were:

1 Mr Everaert resigned as a member of the committee on 22 March 2016.
Given Mr Everaert’s non-independent status in light of 
the common interpretation of Provision D.2.1 of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, Mr Everaert resigned as 
a member of the Remuneration Committee with effect from 
22 March 2016 so that the Company will comply with the 
Code on this point. 
None of the committee members have day-to-day 
involvement with the business. Their biographies are given 
on pages 66 to 67. The company secretary acts as secretary 
to the committee.
The primary responsibilities of the committee are set out in 
its terms of reference which are reviewed and updated 
annually and which are available for download on the 
Company’s website. Alternatively, copies can be obtained 
on request from the company secretary.
In summary, the committee’s key responsibilities include:
 overall framework for remuneration and its cost and, 
in consultation with the chairman and chief executive, 
determining the remuneration packages of each of the 
executive directors; 
 remuneration and the terms of their service or 
employment contracts, including share based schemes, 
other employee incentive schemes adopted by the 
Company from time to time and pension contributions;
 that the remuneration of the executive directors of the 
Company and other senior members of executive 
management of the Company and its subsidiaries is set 
by a committee of the Board whose members have no 
personal interest in the outcomes of the decisions of the 
committee and who will have due regard to the interests 
of the shareholders; and
 relevant provisions of the Company’s remuneration policy.
When making recommendations to the Board regarding 
executive directors’ remuneration the committee is able to 
consider corporate performance on environmental, social 
and governance issues and ensures that any incentive 
structures do not raise any environmental, social or 
governance risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible 
behaviour.
The committee held four meetings in 2015 and the 
attendance of each committee member at such meetings 
is shown on page 75. The principal agenda items at the 
formal meetings were as follows:

During the year the committee received advice internally from Frank Monstrey (Chairman of the Board), Kai-Uwe Kessel 
(Chief Executive) and Thomas Hartnett (Company Secretary). The chairman and the chief executive were consulted on the 
remuneration of the other executive directors and senior members of executive management and on matters relating 
to the performance of the Company and the company secretary was consulted on regulatory requirements; none of the 
chairman of the Board, the chief executive nor the company secretary participated in decisions on their own remuneration. 
Members of the Group’s human resources team may attend relevant portions of committee meetings to ensure appropriate 
input on matters related to senior members of the executive management team below board level.
During 2015 the Company did not engage any external advisers to advise on remuneration.
Voting on remuneration matters
At the Annual General Meeting held on 26 May 2015, two resolutions were put to shareholders relating to directors’ 
remuneration. The first resolution related to the remuneration policy and was subject to a binding vote. The second 
resolution related to the directors’ annual report on remuneration and was subject to an advisory vote. The votes received 
were as follows:

Notes on the single total figure remuneration table
Base salaries 
In the past salaries have been reviewed annually in July of each year. In July 2015 salaries were increased by 2% for the 
chairman of the Board and the chief financial officer and by 3.38% for the chief executive , effective July 2015. 
Going forward the committee intends to review salaries at the end of each year with increases taking effect on 1 July. 
Therefore, the next review of executive director salaries will be in December 2016. In making salary determinations, 
the committee will consider the provisions of the remuneration policy.
Annual bonus
In the last financial year all executive directors were eligible for a bonus. Currently, the bonus year runs from 1 January to 
31 December each year with bonus amounts being determined in July of each year. Going forward and in order to facilitate 
better reporting and transparency in relation to the remuneration of executive directors, the committee intends to review 
performance and determine annual bonus entitlements at the end of each year.
In accordance with the Company’s remuneration policy the maximum annual bonus opportunity is 40% of base 
compensation and is assessed against financial and operational objectives. Refer to page 99 of the remuneration policy 
for more information in relation to the Company’s bonus policy. 
All bonuses are discretionary and can be reduced from the maximum annual bonus opportunity level for reasons such 
as poor performance by the employee or due to disappointing financial performance of the Group as a whole. For the 
bonus year which ran from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2014, the key performance indicators for annual cash bonuses 
for executive directors were as follows:

Total 100% Between 25% and 30%
As the Group did not meet its full targeted average production during 2014 and based on its assessment of Company 
and individual performance of the executive directors the committee awarded bonuses of between 25 and 30 per cent 
of salary to the executive directors. Annual bonuses were paid in cash and are summarised in the following table:
Director
Bonus as 
% of salary Cash (EUR)
Frank Monstrey 30% 204,019
Kai-Uwe Kessel 30% 236,262
Jan-Ru Muller 25% 108,028
The Company does not provide for any clawback provisions regarding annual bonuses as annual bonuses are awarded 
on a lump sum basis based on past performance and so the rationale behind a clawback mechanism is less relevant.
Long-term incentive awards
In 2015 the Company did not operate a performance based long-term incentive scheme. 
Pension entitlements
The Company does not operate a pension scheme and accordingly no element of remuneration is pensionable.
Payments to past directors
No payments were made to past directors of the Company during the year ended 31 December 2015.
Payments for loss of office
No payments were made in respect of loss of office during the year ended 31 December 2015.
Non-executive director fees
A review of non-executive director fees was conducted in 2015 and it was decided that the annual fees for non-executive 
directors will remain the same for 2016 as those for 2015, being $100,000 per annum. The next review of non-executive 
director fees will be conducted in 2016.
Directors’ shareholdings

Phantom share option plan
The Company currently operates one non-performance related share option plan (the “Plan”). As at 31 December 2015, 
the executive directors each held the following options over ordinary shares of the Company, generally vesting over 
a five-year period, exercisable at either US$4.00 or US$10.00 per ordinary share and expiring ten years from the date

1 The options do not have a face value at the date of the grant, since the grant date was before the GDR listing on the London Stock Exchange on 1 April 2008.
2 Calculated by multiplying the market value of the options at the date of grant (US$10.09) less $10.00 by the number of options granted.
3 Such options are held by a company associated with Mr Muller, Tenggara Capital B.V.
There have been no changes in the interests in the Plan between the end of the financial year 2015 and the date of this 
annual report. 
The Plan rules do not contain any malus or clawback mechanisms but going forward management will require any 
recommendations by the Company to the option trustee of an option award to be made subject to an express right for 
the Company to suspend further vesting and to claw back unvested options previously awarded where there has been 
exceptional circumstances of misstatement or misconduct, misbehaviour, significant risk failures or material downturns 
in the Group’s financial performance prior to vesting.
Remuneration statistics and comparisons
The following performance graph shows the growth in value of a notional £100 invested in the Company since the 
premium listing of the Company compared to the FTSE 350 E&P Index. The committee selected the FTSE 350 
Oil & Gas Index as the most appropriate comparator as it feels that it is a broad-based index which includes many of 
the Company’s competitors.

Service contracts
Details of the executive directors’ service contracts 
and the non-executive directors’ letters of appointment 
can be found in the Company’s remuneration policy on 
page 101 of this annual report. All directors are subject 
to annual re-appointment and accordingly all executive 
and non-executive directors will stand for re-election 
at the Annual General Meeting.
Statement of 2016 remuneration policy 
implementation
The Company’s remuneration policy was put to a 
shareholder vote at the 2015 Annual General Meeting 
and was approved by 83.68% of shareholders. There is no 
requirement for a vote on the policy in 2016 unless any 
changes to the policy are proposed and as the committee 
feels that the policy continues to remain both appropriate 
and effective no changes are proposed for the coming year. 
Salaries and bonuses of the executive directors are 
reviewed and determined annually to ensure they remain 
appropriate. The Company’s bonus year runs from 
1 January to 31 December each year with bonus amounts 
being determined in July of each year. Going forward and in 
order to permit the Company to report on annual bonuses 
awarded for the achievement of performance measures and 
targets for the reported year, annual bonus entitlements will 
be determined before publication of the Company’s annual 
report so that annual bonus amounts payable to executive 
directors in respect of performance in the reported year can 
be reported in the relevant annual report. To allow for this 
transition bonuses for executive directors based upon 2014 
performance were awarded in June 2015 but bonuses for 
executive directors based upon 2015 performance were 
assessed in March 2016. As a result of such assessment it 
was decided that as a result of the significant drop in the oil 
price in 2015 and the resulting effect on the Group’s 
revenues, the Company will not pay any discretionary 
bonuses to the executive directors based upon 2015 
performance. 
Remuneration in 2016 will be consistent with the policy 
described on pages 98 to 103.

Phantom share option plan
The committee does not envisage the award of any 
additional phantom share options to executive directors 
in 2016. 
The committee is currently reviewing the effectiveness 
of the phantom share option plan for the executive 
directors and wider employee population and is 
considering alternative long-term incentive plan options. 
Discussions will continue in 2016 and should any change 
occur, shareholders will be consulted and approval sought, 
as appropriate.

Remuneration Committee Report continued 
Directors’ remuneration policy
This sets out the remuneration policy (the “Policy”) for the 
Board which was approved by shareholders at the 2015 
Annual General Meeting held on 26 May 2015 and took 
effect from this point. Whilst we do not envisage making any 
changes to our policy prior to the Company’s 2018 Annual 
General Meeting, we conduct annual reviews to ensure that 
it continues to support the strategy of the Company. If we 
feel it is necessary to make a change to our policy prior to 
the end of this three year period we will seek shareholder 
approval. 
No changes have been made to our remuneration policy 
since the 2015 Annual General Meeting and the policy has 
been included in full below as set out in the 2014 Annual 
Report. 
Policy coverage
This policy applies automatically to the following: 1) all 
executive directors of the Company and the company 
secretary, 2) any other senior members of the executive 
management of the Group, 3) any other member of the 
executive management of the Group as may be required 
by the Board, and 4) any grant of shares, options or similar 
securities or rights relating to more than 10,000 Company 
shares. 
Policy objectives
This policy is designed to:
1.  Provide a structure and level of pay that attracts and 
retains high calibre directors, managers and employees 
capable of delivering the Company’s strategic objectives.
2.  Provide clear and transparent performance incentives in a 
manner that is consistent with best practice and aligned 
with the interests of the Company’s shareholders.
3.  Align the remuneration of executives and senior 
managers with the interests of the Company’s 
shareholders, and ensure that rewards are justified by 
performance.
4.  Ensure that the pay of the executive directors and senior 
members of the executive management takes into 
account: (i) pay and conditions throughout the Company; 
and (ii) corporate governance best practice including 
health & safety, environmental, social and governance 
risks.
Peer group
For the purposes of benchmarking appropriate 
compensation, the committee currently regards the 
following companies as the most relevant peer group 
for Nostrum:

 for scarce skills within the industry.
 compete for expatriate and local staff.
Risk management
The committee will review incentive arrangements regularly 
to ensure that they comply with the risk management 
systems, and that controls are operating effectively. The 
committee also ensures that inappropriate operational or 
financial risk-taking is neither encouraged nor rewarded 
through the Company’s remuneration policies. Instead, 
a sensible balance will be struck between fixed and variable 
pay, short- and long-term incentives and cash and equity.
The committee has access to the Audit Committee and 
senior executive management as and when required to 
discuss any matters of risk assessment.
Nostrum operates in an industry that is inherently subject to 
operational risks. Particular emphasis is therefore placed on 
ensuring that health and safety best practice is reinforced by 
this policy. The committee consults regularly to ensure that 
this is the case.
Ongoing review of policy
The committee will periodically review whether this policy is 
operating appropriately. Any actions arising from this review 
will be assigned to an appropriate person with a deadline to 
report back to the committee. The level and structure of the 
compensation system will also be reviewed annually by the 
committee.

Phantom share option plan
The Company operates the Plan in accordance with the 
Plan rules, the Listing Rules, the Disclosure and 
Transparency rules and other applicable rules. In order 
to retain talent, options are generally granted in tranches 
exercisable at the following times:
 option is granted, from the first anniversary of the date 
of grant;
 which an option is granted, from the second anniversary 
of the date of grant;
 which an option is granted, from the third anniversary 
of the date of grant;
 which an option is granted, from the fourth anniversary 
of the date of grant; and
 of which an option is granted from the fifth anniversary 
of the date of grant.
The Board retains discretion over a number of areas relating 
to the operation and administration of the Plan, which 
include, but are not limited to; (i) who participates; (ii) the 
timing of the grant of award; and (iii) the size of the award.
Treatment of existing arrangement
For the avoidance of doubt, authority is given to the 
Company to honour any commitments entered into with 
current or former directors notwithstanding the approval 
of the Policy. This will last until the existing incentives vest 
(or lapse) or the benefits of any contractual arrangements 
no longer apply.
Remuneration scenarios for executive directors
The bar charts below provide estimates of the potential 
remuneration of the executive directors for 2015 and 
therefore do not reflect the latest remuneration information. 
Three scenarios are presented for each executive director: 
(i) “minimum” remuneration, reflecting no bonus award; (ii) 
“on target” remuneration, where the Board’s expectations 
for the executive director’s performance have been met 
and a bonus of 25% of base salary is awarded; and (iii) 
“maximum” remuneration, where the Board’s expectations 
for good performance by the executive director have been 
exceeded and a bonus of 40% of base salary is awarded. 
At present, the executive directors do not receive any 
pension or any long-term compensation. 
According to the policy of the Board, benefits are not 
expected to be a significant component of remuneration. 
In 2015, only Mr Kessel is expected to receive benefit 
payments directly. Benefits are not paid to Mr Monstrey 
and Mr Muller. Instead, Mr Monstrey and Mr Muller are 
paid a base salary out of which they may arrange any 
benefits themselves. 
The bar charts below do not include any amounts in relation 
to the Phantom share option plan because: 
(i) as at the time of this Annual Report the Board is not able 
to determine whether any options will be issued under the 
Phantom share option plan in 2015 (as described in the 
Directors’ remuneration policy, option awards will only 
be made on the basis of achieving concrete long-term 
objectives defined in advance by the committee and will 
vest over several years); and
(ii) as at the date of this annual report, any options vesting in 
2015 in respect of awards made from prior years would not 
generate proceeds to the executive directors at the current 
share price.

The committee expects any new executive directors to be

Each appointment is for an initial term of three years, subject to being re-elected at each Annual General Meeting, save that 
a non-executive director or the Company may terminate the appointment at any time upon one month’s written notice, or 
that a non-executive director may be required to resign at any time in accordance with the Articles of the Company, the UK

The Company maintains liability insurance for its directors. 
All directors are also in receipt of an indemnity from the 
Company under the Company’s Articles in respect of (a) 
liability incurred by any director due to the negligence, 
default, breach of duty or breach of trust in relation to the 
affairs of the Company, or any subsidiary undertaking or (b) 
any liability incurred by any director in connection with the 
activities of the Company, or any subsidiary undertaking, in 
its capacity as a trustee of an occupational pension scheme, 
in both instances to the extent permitted under the 
Companies Act 2006. Copies of the Company’s articles of 
association (the “Articles”) are available on the Company’s 
website or at the Company’s registered office during normal 
business hours and will be available for inspection at the 
Annual General Meeting.
In May 2015 the Board approved a policy for the 
indemnification of directors, officers and other designated 
beneficiaries and the entry by the Company into an 
accompanying deed of indemnity. 
The policy clarifies that the Company will seek to provide 
the maximum indemnification and protection to Group 
directors and officers permissible under applicable law, 
except in cases of fraud or wilful default, including but not 
limited to: (i) providing compensation for losses suffered in 
the course of acting as a director or officer in the interests 
of the Group (ii) providing directors and officers with quality 
external legal representation and external professional 
advisers (iii) assisting directors or officers with repatriation 
following a third party claim (iv) continuing to make payment 
of a director’s or officer’s remuneration and benefits while 
such director or officer is under suspension, investigation 
or detention by order of a third party (v) taking reasonable 
steps to place any such director or officer in a similar 
position working in another location or elsewhere in the 
Group which would allow his/her employment to continue 
and to compensate for any adverse financial consequences 
they incur as a result of their loss of office or (vi) maintaining 
customary directors and officers liability insurance policies. 
The deed of indemnity is intended to cover any insufficiency 
in the protection granted to directors and officers under the 
Articles which could expose such persons to substantial 
liability to third parties, including governmental authorities, 
in particular in jurisdictions where significant uncertainty 
exists in relation to the interpretation and application of the 
law. The deed of indemnity allows directors, officers and 
other designated beneficiaries to enforce the protection 
provided for under the Articles without any further action 
by the Company being required.

year 2015.

shares in the Company. 
Share rights
Without prejudice to any rights attached to any existing 
shares, the Company may issue shares with rights or 
restrictions as determined by either the Company by 
ordinary resolution or, if the Company passes a resolution, 
the directors.
Voting rights
There are no restrictions on voting rights or transfers of 
shares in the Articles and at a general meeting every 
member present in person or by proxy has one vote for 
every share held by him. No member shall be entitled to 
vote either personally or by proxy or to exercise any other 
right in relation to general meetings if any sum due from 
him to the Company in respect of that share remains unpaid.
Transfer of shares
The Articles provide that transfers of certificated shares 
must be effected in writing duly signed by or on behalf 
of the transferor and, except in the case of fully paid shares, 
by or on behalf of the transferee. The transferor shall remain 
the holder of the shares concerned until the name of the 
transferee is entered on the Register of Members in respect 
of those shares. Transfers of uncertificated shares may be 
effected by means of the relevant electronic system unless 
the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001 provide 
otherwise.
The directors may refuse to register a transfer of shares 
in favour of more than four persons jointly.
Directors, articles and purchase of shares
The Articles were adopted on 19 May 2014 and may only 
be amended by special resolution at a general meeting 
of the shareholders.
The directors’ powers are conferred on them by UK 
legislation and by the Articles. In accordance with the 
Articles the Board has the power at any time to elect any 
person to be a director. Any person so appointed by the 
directors will retire at the next Annual General Meeting in 
accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code; 
retiring directors may be eligible for annual re-election.
The Company did not repurchase any shares during 2015. 
The Board has the power conferred on it by shareholders 
to purchase its own shares and will seek a renewal of that 
power at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting within 
the limits set out in the notice of the meeting.
Employment policies and equal opportunities
The Group is an inclusive and equal opportunity 
employer and complies with all applicable laws governing 
employment practices. The Group has also adopted and 
implemented policies and procedures which cover the 
recruitment, selection, training and development and 
promotion and retirement of its employees.
Nostrum aims to create a workplace that has an open 
atmosphere of trust, honesty and respect. Harassment or 
discrimination of any kind based on race, religion, national 
origin, age, gender, disability, sexual orientation or political 
opinion or any other similarly protected characteristic 
is not tolerated. This principle applies to all aspects of 
employment from recruitment and promotion through 
to termination and all other terms and conditions of 
employment.
It is the Group’s aim that all employment policies are fair 
and equitable and consistent with the skills and abilities 
of the employee and the needs of the business. Employees 
are free to join a trade union or participate in collective 
bargaining arrangements.  Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC 
Annual Report 2015 106
Directors’ Report continued
Further details are included in “Our People” on  
pages 38 to 40.
In accordance with the Group’s Code of Conduct the 
Company’s policy is to fully comply with the UK Equality 
Act 2010, which imposes a duty on employers to make 
reasonable adjustments to help disabled job applicants, 
employees and former employees in certain circumstances 
and prohibits direct disability discrimination, discrimination 
arising from disability, indirect disability discrimination, 
harassment relating to disability and victimisation. 
Where the duty to make reasonable adjustments arises, 
the Company’s policy is to effectively treat the disabled 
person more favourably than others in an attempt to reduce 
or remove that individual’s disadvantage. 
The Company’s policy is to give full and fair consideration 
to applications for employment made by disabled people. 
Disabled job applicants and employees are encouraged to 
tell the Company about their condition so that the Company 
can support them as appropriate. Employees experiencing 
difficulties at work because of a disability may contact their 
supervisor or the Human Resources Department to discuss 
any reasonable adjustments that would help overcome or 
minimise the difficulty. Their line manager or the Human 
Resources Department may consult with the disabled 
person and his or her medical adviser about possible 
adjustments. The Company will consider the matter 
carefully and try to accommodate the disabled person’s 
needs within reason. Support provided by the Company 
to disabled employees may include training and career 
development support. If the Company considers a 
particular adjustment would not be reasonable it will 
explain its reasons and try to find an alternative solution 
where possible.
The Company will monitor the physical features of its 
premises to consider whether they might place anyone with 
a disability at a substantial disadvantage. Where necessary, 
it will take reasonable steps to improve access.
Employee communications and involvement
The Group has processes in place for communicating 
and consulting with all its employees so that their views 
can be taken into account in making decisions which are 
likely to affect their interests and so that employees are 
made aware of any financial and economic factors affecting 
the Company’s performance. Employee communications 
include information about the performance of the Group, 
on major matters affecting their work, employment or 
workplace. The Group has also developed an intranet, 
which assists in communicating with employees across 
borders and provides key information to all Group 
employees.
The Company also operates an employee share option 
plan, further details of which can be found in the Directors’ 
remuneration policy on page 100 and the notes to the 
consolidated audited financial statements for the year 
ended 31 December 2015.

Responsibility statement 
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual 
Report and the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.
The directors are required by the Companies Act 2006 
to prepare accounts for each financial year and, with 
regards to Group accounts, in accordance with Article 4 
of the IAS Regulation. The directors have prepared 
individual accounts in accordance with IFRS as adopted 
by the EU. The accounts are required by law and IFRS to 
present fairly the financial position of the Company and the 
Group and the performance for that period. The directors 
must not approve such accounts unless they are satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs 
of the Company and the consolidated Group.
The Directors consider that the Group has used appropriate 
accounting policies, supported by reasonable judgements 
and estimates, in preparing the financial statements, and 
that all accounting standards which they consider to be 
applicable have been followed.
Having taken all the matters considered by the Board and 
brought to the attention of the Board during the year into 
account, and having reviewed the Annual Report (including 
the strategic report), the directors consider the Annual 
Report and accounts, taken as a whole, to be fair, balanced 
and understandable, providing the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the Company’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy.
The directors have responsibility for:
 accounting records which disclose with reasonable 
accuracy the financial position of the Company and the 
Group and which enable them to ensure that the accounts 
comply with the Companies Act 2006;
 safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and 
detect fraud and other irregularities; and
 financial information on the Company’s website
1
. 
To the best of the directors’ knowledge 
(a)  the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the 
applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and 
fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and 
profit or loss of the issuer and the undertakings included 
in the consolidation taken as a whole; and
(b)  the management report includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business and the 
position of the Company and the undertakings included 
in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with 
a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that 
they face.

Our assessment of risk of material misstatement  
We identified the risks of material misstatement described below as those that had the greatest effect on our overall audit 
strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit and the direction of the efforts of the audit team.  In addressing these 
risks, we have performed the procedures below which were designed in the context of the financial statements as a whole 
and, consequently, we do not express any opinion on these individual areas. 
Risk Our response to the risk What we concluded to the 
Audit Committee 
 
Estimation of oil and gas reserves 
and its impact on the impairment 
testing, depreciation, depletion and 
amortisation and decommissioning 
provision  
Refer to the Audit Committee Report on 
page 82; the estimates and judgements 
on page 123 and the disclosures in note 
8 of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements (page 133) 
This was considered to be a significant 
risk due to the subjective nature of 
reserves estimates and their pervasive 
impact on the financial statements 
through impairment, DD&A calculations 
and decommissioning provision 
estimate. Reserves are also considered 
a fundamental indicator of the future 
potential of the Group’s performance. 
The estimation of oil and gas reserves 
is a significant area of judgement due to 
the technical uncertainty in assessing 
reserves quantities. Consistent with the 
previous year, management has 
engaged a third party specialist in 
connection with the estimation of 
reserves volumes. 
 
Our audit procedures have focused on 
management’s estimation process, including 
whether bias exists in determination of 
reserves. We challenged management’s 
assumptions including commercial 
assumptions to ensure that they are based 
on supportable evidence.  We have: 
 carried out procedures to walkthrough 
and understand the Group’s internal 
process and key controls associated 
with the oil and gas reserves 
estimation process. 
 met with management’s third party 
specialist during the planning and 
execution of the audit and assessed 
their competence and objectivity by 
inquiring their qualifications, practical 
experience and independence. We 
have also assessed the competence 
of internal management’s specialists, 
to satisfy ourselves they are 
appropriately qualified to carry out the 
volumes estimation and prepare the 
input data used by the third party 
specialist. We checked the accuracy 
of the data transfer to the third party 
specialist. 
 corroborated management’s 
commercial assumptions by checking 
they lie within an acceptable range 
compared to publicly available 
benchmarks where appropriate. We 
compared management’s internal 
assumptions to the latest plans and 
budgets for consistency; we have also 
challenged management’s capabilities 
to execute on such plans by 
comparison to prior performance. 
 reviewed the final oil and gas reserves 
estimation report prepared by 
management’s third party specialist in 
light of our understanding of the 
business and we confirmed with them 
that all significant changes in reserves 
were made in appropriate period, and 
in compliance with relevant industry 
standards. 
 validated that the updated reserves 
 
Based on our procedures we 
consider that the reserves 
estimations are reasonable for use 
in the impairment testing, 
calculation of DD&A and the 
determination of decommissioning 
dates.  Strategic report Corporate governance Financial report Regulatory information Additional disclosures

Risk Our response to the risk What we concluded to the 
Audit Committee 
estimates were included appropriately 
in the Group’s consideration of 
impairment, in accounting for DD&A 
and determination of decommissioning 
dates. 
 
We performed full scope audit procedures 
over this risk area in one location 
(Kazakhstan), which covered 100% of the 
risk. 
 
The risk of Impairment of exploration 
licenses, goodwill and oil & gas 
development and production fixed 
assets 
Refer to the Audit Committee Report on 
page 82; the estimates and judgements 
on page 123 and the disclosures in 
notes 6 to 8 of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements (page 132-134). 
At 31 December 2015 the carrying 
value of goodwill was US$32,425 
thousand (2014: US$32,425 thousand); 
exploration licenses: US$36,917 
thousand (2014: US$24,380 thousand); 
oil & gas development and production 
assets, including non-current advances: 
US$1,697,363 thousand (2014: 
US$1,536,196 thousand).  
The continued decline in worldwide 
crude oil prices and the prices of related 
refined products over the current year 
pose a heightened impairment risk for 
the Group. Management have identified 
an impairment trigger with respect to the 
oil & gas development and production 
fixed assets in Kazakhstan. 
We focused on this area due to the 
significance of the carrying value of the 
assets being assessed, the current 
economic environment and the 
judgement involved in the assessment 
of the recoverable amount of the 
Group’s Cash Generating Unit (‘CGU’) 
around the future prices of oil, natural 
gas and related products, both in the 
short and long-term, the discount rate 
applied to future cash flow forecasts 
and the assumptions relevant to 
production volumes.   
 
For exploration licenses we have evaluated 
management’s assessment of each 
impairment trigger per IFRS 6 ‘Exploration 
for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources’. 
We have: 
 verified that the Group had the right to 
explore in the relevant exploration 
licence which included obtaining and 
reviewing supporting documentation 
such as license agreements and 
signed supplemental agreements and 
communication with relevant 
government agencies. In the event of 
non-compliance the Group can 
evidence that the terms are modified 
and any relevant penalties and fines 
accrued.  
 inquired that management had the 
intention to carry out exploration and 
evaluation activity in the relevant 
exploration area and corroborated 
these responses by reviewing 
management’s cash-flow forecast 
models to verify they include further 
spend on the exploration activities. We 
discussed the intentions and strategy 
of the Group  with senior management 
and Directors to confirm our 
understanding. 
 validated whether the Group has the 
ability to finance any planned future 
exploration and evaluation activity. 
 assessed the competency of 
management’s experts, and (where 
applicable), the competency and 
objectivity of third party specialists 
engaged for the purposes of 
assessing the reserves and resources 
associated with those exploration and 
evaluation assets. 
 corroborated the commercial viability 
of the exploration fields to the cash-
flow forecast models. 
 
In addressing the risk of impairment for 
 
The Group’s price assumptions 
are  within the range of analyst 
expectations and other market 
data, including the range of what 
we understand other market 
participants are considering as a 
long-term oil and gas prices. The 
pre-tax discount rate of 14% is 
within the range of our 
expectations.  
Based on our procedures, we 
believe that the cash flow 
projections estimated are 
reasonable, the assumptions are 
supportable and the range of 
economic conditions that could 
exist over the remaining useful 
lives of the assets have been 
considered appropriately.

management’s impairment assessment by 
evaluating the  key assumptions. We have: 
 walked through the controls designed 
by the Group relating to the 
assessment of the carrying value of 
goodwill and oil & gas development 
and production fixed assets.  
 tested the integrity of models with the 
assistance of our own specialists.

curves, broker’s estimates and other 
long-term price forecasts; and 
benchmarking the discount rate to the 
risks faced by the group. 
 focused our audit procedures on oil &

elsewhere in our report. 
 tested forecast cash flows by 
comparing the assumptions used

Revenue recognition 
Refer to the Audit Committee Report on 
page 82; The Summary of significant 
accounting policies in page 123and the 
disclosures in note 22 of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements 
(page 141) 
Revenue for the year ended 31 
December 2015 amounts to 
US$ 448,902 thousand (2014: 
US$ 781,878 thousand). Revenue sales 
include crude oil, gas condensate, dry 
gas and liquefied petroleum gas (‘LPG’).  
There exists a risk of management 
manipulation to overstate or understate 
revenue. This could be achieved by 
potentially recording sales in an 
incorrect period.  
 
 
Our component team in Kazakhstan 
performed procedures to walkthrough and 
understand the process and test key controls 
associated with the revenue recognition and 
accounts receivable process.   
We made enquiries of management and 
analysed contracts to evaluate whether 
revenue was recognised in accordance with 
the terms. We have: 
 audited sales agreements to 
understand the contractual terms and 
appropriate revenue recognition by 
inspecting supporting evidence for a 
sample of revenue transactions and 
agreeing the period when revenue 
should be recognised to the 
contractual terms. 
 performed substantive test of details 
on a sample of sales transactions by 
inspecting delivery documents, 
delivery terms, volumes and prices.  
 performed audit procedures on the 
trade debtors’ ageing and collectability 
to identify any doubtful and or 
irrecoverable debtors, confirmed the 
material debtor balances with the 
relevant counterparties as well as 
tested that debtor amounts were 
received subsequent to year-end. 
 carried out other analytical review 
procedures on each individual 
revenue stream using disaggregated 
volume by product, by customer and 
by month to assess the respective 
products’ underlying performance and 
corroborate the appropriateness of the 
timing of revenue recognition. 
 evaluated the financial statement 
disclosures for compliance with the 
requirements of accounting standards. 
 
 
We believe that Revenue is 
recognised in accordance with 
sales agreements. We also 
consider the disclosures with

financial statements are 
reasonable and adequate. 
 
We performed full scope audit procedures 
over this risk area in one location

In addressing this risk, audit procedures 
were performed by component team in 
Kazakhstan and the Group engagement 
team.  
 
Risk of management override 
We consider the likelihood of 
management override occurring. We 
base our consideration on our 
understanding of the nature and risk of 
both management’s opportunity and 
incentive to manipulate accounting 
records and earnings or financial ratios 
or to misappropriate assets given the 
sizable shareholdings of senior 
executives.  
 
Specifically we considered the 
heightened impairment risks, the risk of 
overstatement of the hedge 
instruments’ valuation, and compliance 
with bank covenants in the light of the 
continued decline in worldwide crude oil 
prices and the prices of related refined 
products over the current year.  
 
 
We considered whether there was evidence 
of bias by the Directors and senior 
management in significant accounting 
estimates and judgements relevant to the 
financial statements. This included 
performing procedures with a particular 
focus on those key judgements and 
estimates which relate to the risks of 
estimation of oil and gas reserves, 
impairment of non-current assets, revenue 
recognition and related parties transactions 
as highlighted above. 
 
We tested manual and automated journal 
entries and included a selection of journals, 
with a focus on those journal entries that 
may impact the carrying value of the long 
term assets, related to other significant risks 
identified as part of our audit engagement.   
 
As part of our audit procedures to address 
this fraud risk, we assessed the overall 
control environment and interviewed senior 
management and the Group’s internal audit 
function to understand whether there had 
been any reported actual or alleged 
instances of fraudulent activity during the 
year. 
 
We have not identified any 
instances of management override 
or bias in significant estimates and 
judgements.  Strategic report Corporate governance Financial report Regulatory information Additional disclosures

Risk Our response to the risk What we concluded to the 
Audit Committee 
 
In addressing this risk, audit procedures 
were performed by component team in 
Kazakhstan and the Group engagement 
team. We tested manual and automated 
journal entries for all 3 components where 
we performed full scope audit. 
 
Our audit approach and assessment of the risks of material misstatements change in response to changes in 
circumstances affecting the Group financial statements. The continued decline in worldwide crude oil prices and the 
prices of related refined products over the current year has resulted in the deterioration of the recoverable amount of oil & 
gas development and production fixed assets and an increased potential impact of this risk on the Group’s financial 
statements. This has led us to an increased focus on this area, unlike the 2014 audit where the primarily focus of our 
audit effort was on the risk of impairment of exploration licenses and goodwill. 
The scope of our audit 
our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of performance materiality determine our 
audit scope for each entity within the Group. Taken together, this enables us to form an opinion on the consolidated 
financial statements under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). We take into account size, risk profile, 
the organisation of the group and effectiveness of group-wide controls, changes in the business environment and other 
factors such as recent Internal audit results when assessing the level of work to be performed at each entity. 
Tailoring the scope  
In establishing our overall approach to the Group audit we determined the type of work that needed to be undertaken at 
each of the components by us, as the Group engagement team, or by component auditors from another EY global 
network firm operating under our instructions.  The Group engagement team performed the audit of the consolidation in 
the United Kingdom. In assessing the risk of material misstatement to the Group financial statements, our Group audit 
scope focused on the Group’s main operating locations. Of the 16 reporting components of the Group, we selected eight 
components covering entities within the Netherlands, Belgium, Russia, United Kingdom and Kazakhstan, which represent 
the principal business units within the Group and account for approximately 100% of the Group’s profit before tax. Of the 
eight components selected, we performed an audit of the complete financial information of three components (“full scope 
components”) which were selected based on their size or risk characteristics. For the remaining five components 
(“specific scope components”), we performed audit procedures on specific accounts within that component that we 
considered had the potential for the greatest impact on the significant accounts in the financial statements either because 
of the size of these accounts or their risk profile. The three full scope components account for 85% of the Group net 
assets, 100% of the Group’s revenue and 117% of the Group’s profit before tax. The profit before tax coverage of 117% 
represents one full scope components having a positive contribution of 133% offset by two full scope components having 
a negative contribution of 16%.  The specific scope locations do not have income generating activities and we audited 
cash, payroll, general and administrative costs, the employee share option plan and other current liabilities. 
Of the remaining 8 components having together a negative contribution of 3% of the Group’s Profit before tax, none are 
individually greater than 1% of the Group’s Profit before tax.  For these components, we performed other procedures, 
including analytical review, inquiry procedures and testing of consolidation journals and intercompany eliminations to 
respond to any potential risks of material misstatement to the Group financial statements. 
The charts below illustrate the coverage obtained from the work performed by our audit teams.  Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC

Changes from the prior year  
Our scope allocation in the current year is broadly consistent with 2014 in terms of overall coverage of the Group. 
However we have made some changes in the number of components subject to full and specific scope procedures. In 
particular, we changed our scope to include three service entities which are now considered significant based on 
materiality of payroll and general and administrative costs.    
 
Involvement with component teams  
In establishing our overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be undertaken at 
each of the components by us, as the primary audit engagement team, or by component auditors from other EY global 
network firms operating under our instruction. For the one full scope component in Kazakhstan, where the work was 
performed by the component auditor, we determined the appropriate level of involvement to enable us to determine that 
sufficient audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the Group as a whole. The work on the Group 
consolidation and remaining 7 full and specific scope components in Russia, the Netherland and Belgium was performed 
by the primary audit team.  
 
During the 2015 audit cycle the primary audit team continued to have close interactions with the component audit team in 
Kazakhstan. The primary audit team held a global audit team event in the year led by the Senior Statutory Auditor, where 
both teams came together in Almaty, Kazakhstan, to consider the audit risk and strategy. The primary team visited the 
component team in Kazakhstan to attend the component closing meeting with local management, visited the operating 
field, reviewed key working papers and was responsible for the scope and direction of the audit process. Video and 
telephone conference meetings were also held with the component team in Kazakhstan throughout the current year’s 
audit cycle. This, together with the additional procedures performed at Group level, gave us appropriate evidence for our 
opinion on the Group financial statements. 
 
Our application of materiality  
We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in evaluating the effect of identified 
misstatements on the audit and in forming our audit opinion.

Materiality 
The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to 
influence the economic decisions of the users of the financial statements. Materiality provides a basis for determining the 
nature and extent of our audit procedures. 
We determined materiality for the Group to be US$3.6 million (2014: US$17 million), which is approximately 5% (2014: 
5%) of Profit before tax (2014: adjusted Profit before tax. In 2014 profit before tax was adjusted by US$29 million mainly 
relating to the costs associated with the reorganisation of the Group that we concluded are non-recurring and therefore 
added back when calculating materiality. We believe this provides us with a consistent year on year basis for determining 
planning materiality and the most relevant performance measure for the stakeholders of the group. This provided a basis 
for determining the nature, timing and extent of risk assessment procedures, identifying and assessing the risk of material 
misstatement and determining the nature, timing and extent of further audit procedures.   
Performance materiality 
Application of materiality at the individual account or balance level.  It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately 
low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality. 
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group’s overall control environment, our 
judgement was that performance materiality was 50% (2014: 50%) of our planning materiality, namely US$1.8m (2014: 
US$8.5m).  We have set performance materiality at this percentage due to our past experience of the audit that indicate a 
higher risk of misstatements, both corrected and uncorrected. 
Audit work at component locations for the purpose of obtaining audit coverage over significant financial statement 
accounts is undertaken based on a percentage of total performance materiality. The performance materiality set for each 
component is based on the relative scale and risk of the component to the Group as a whole and our assessment of the 
risk of misstatement at that component.  In the current year, the range of performance materiality allocated to components 
was US$0.2m to US$1.4m (2014: US$1.7m to US$6.4m).   
Reporting threshold 
An amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial. 
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all audit differences in excess of US0.2m (2014: 
US0.85m), which is set at 5% of planning materiality, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, 
warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.  
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in 
light of other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion. 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or 
error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s and the parent 
company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of 
significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In 
addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies 
with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or 
materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of 
any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 111, the directors are responsible for 
the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is 
to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards  Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC

operations comprise of a single operating segment with three exploration concessions and are primarily conducted 
through its oil and gas producing entity Zhaikmunai LLP located in Kazakhstan.  
As at 31 December 2015, the Group employed 1,063 employees (2014: 1,010).

Zhaikmunai LLP carries out its activities in accordance with the Contract for Additional Exploration, Production and 
Production-Sharing of Crude Hydrocarbons in the Chinarevskoye oil and gas condensate field (the “Contract”) dated 31 
October 1997 between the State Committee of Investments of the Republic of Kazakhstan and Zhaikmunai LLP in 
accordance with the license MG No. 253D for the exploration and production of hydrocarbons in Chinarevskoye oil and 
gas condensate field. 
On 17 August 2012 Zhaikmunai LLP signed Asset Purchase Agreements to acquire 100% of the subsoil use rights 
related to three oil and gas fields – Rostoshinskoye, Darjinskoye and Yuzhno-Gremyachinskoye – all located in the

oil and gas fields in Kazakhstan following the signing of the respective supplementary agreements related thereto by the 
authority now known as the Ministry of Energy (the “MOE”) of the Republic of Kazakhstan. 
The term of the Chinarevskoye subsoil use rights originally included a 5-year exploration period and a 25-year production 
period. The exploration period was initially extended for additional 4 years and then for further 2 years according to the 
supplements to the Contract dated 12 January 2004 and 23 June 2005, respectively. In accordance with the supplement 
dated 5 June 2008, Tournaisian North reservoir entered into production period as at 1 January 2007. Following additional 
commercial discoveries during 2008, the exploration period under the Chinarevskoye subsoil use rights, other than for the 
Tournaisian horizons, was extended for an additional 3-year period, which expired on 26 May 2011. A further extension to 
26 May 2014 was made under the supplement dated 28 October 2013. The extensions to the exploration periods have 
not changed the Chinarevskoye subsoil use rights term, which expires in 2031. On 28 July 2015 the eleventh 
supplementary agreement to the Contract was signed extending the exploration period to 26 May 2016. Zhaikmunai 
LLP’s application for further extension of the Chinarevskoye exploration period is under approval at the MOE. 
The contract for exploration and production of hydrocarbons from Rostoshinskoye field dated 8 February 2008 originally 
included a 3-year exploration period and a 12-year production period. On 27 April 2009 the exploration period was 
extended so as to have a total duration of 6 years. Subsequently, the exploration period was extended until 8 February 
2017. 
The contract for exploration and production of hydrocarbons from Darjinskoye field dated 28 July 2006 originally included 
a 6-year exploration period and a 19-year production period. Subsequently, the exploration period was extended until 31 
December 2017.  
The contract for exploration and production of hydrocarbons from Yuzhno-Gremyachinskoye field dated 28 July 2006 
originally included a 5-year exploration period and a 20-year production period. Subsequently, the exploration period was 
extended until 31 December 2017. 
Royalty payments 
Zhaikmunai LLP is required to make monthly royalty payments throughout the entire production period, at the rates 
specified in the Contract.  
Royalty rates depend on hydrocarbons recovery levels and the phase of production and can vary from 3% to 7% of 
produced crude oil and from 4% to 9% of produced natural gas. Royalty is accounted on a gross basis. 
Government “profit share” 
Zhaikmunai LLP makes payments to the Government of its “profit share” as determined in the Contract. The “profit share” 
depends on hydrocarbon production levels and varies from 10% to 40% of production after deducting royalties and 
reimbursable expenditures. Reimbursable expenditures include operating expenses, costs of additional exploration and 
development costs. Government “profit share” is expensed as incurred and paid in cash. Government profit share is 
accounted on a gross basis.

These consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015 have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) issued by International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) as 
adopted by the European Union and the requirements of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules (“DTR”) of the Financial 
Conduct Authority (“FCA”) in the United Kingdom as applicable to annual financial statements.  
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared based on a historical cost basis, except for certain financial 
instruments which are carried at fair value as stated in the accounting policies (Note 4). The consolidated financial 
statements are presented in US dollars and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand, except when otherwise 
indicated. 
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting 
estimates. It also requires from management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the Group's accounting 
policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are 
significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in Note 4.  Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC

Consolidated financial statements 
 otes to te consolidated financial statements  
 
Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Parent and its subsidiaries as at 31 
December 2015. Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement 
with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. Specifically, the Group 
controls an investee if, and only if, the Group has: 
 power over the investee (i.e., existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the 
investee); 
 exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; 
 the ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns. 
Generally, there is a presumption that a majority of voting rights result in control. To support this presumption and when 
the Group has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee, the Group considers all relevant facts and 
circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee, including: 
 the contractual arrangement with the other vote holders of the investee; 
 rights arising from other contractual arrangements; 
 the Group’s voting rights and potential voting rights. 
The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes 
to one or more of the three elements of control. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over 
the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of the subsidiary. Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a 
subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date the 
Group gains control until the date the Group ceases to control the subsidiary. 
Group reorganisation 
The Group has been formed through a reorganisation that took place in June 2014 in which Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC 
became a new parent entity of the Group (Note 15). The reorganisation is not a business combination and does not result 
in any change of economic substance of the Group. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements of Nostrum Oil & 
Gas PLC are a continuation of the existing group (Nostrum Oil & Gas LP and its subsidiaries). The consolidated financial 
statements reflect the difference in share capital as an adjustment to equity (Other reserves) that is not subject to 
reclassification to income statement in the future periods. 
Going concern 
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The directors are satisfied that 
the Group has sufficient resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future, a period of not less than 12 months 
from the date of this report. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the consolidated 
financial statements. 
 
3. CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND DISCLOSURES 
New standards, interpretations and amendments thereof, adopted by the Group  
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year, except for the following 
amendments to IFRS effective as at 1 January 2015. The Group has not early adopted any other standard, interpretation 
or amendment that has been issued but is not yet effective. 
The nature and the impact of each new standard or amendment which is applicable to the consolidated financial 
statements of the Group is described below:  
Annual improvements 2010-2012 Cycle 
IFRS 2 Share-based Payment 
This improvement is applied prospectively and clarifies various issues relating to the definitions of performance and 
service conditions which are vesting conditions. The clarifications are consistent with how the Group has identified any 
performance and service conditions which are vesting conditions in previous periods. In addition, the Group had not  Strategic report Corporate governance Financial report Regulatory information Additional disclosures
Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC 
Annual Report 2015 133
Consolidated financial statements 
 otes to te consolidated financial statements  
 
granted any awards during 2014 and 2015. Thus, these amendments did not impact the Group’s financial statements or 
accounting policies. 
IFRS 3 Business Combinations 
The amendment is applied prospectively and clarifies that all contingent consideration arrangements classified as 
liabilities (or assets) arising from a business combination should be subsequently measured at fair value through profit or 
loss whether or not they fall within the scope of IAS 39. This is consistent with the Group’s current accounting policy and, 
thus, this amendment did not impact the Group’s accounting policy. 
IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment and IAS 38 Intangible Assets 
The amendment is applied retrospectively and clarifies in IAS 16 and IAS 38 that the asset may be revalued by reference 
to observable data by either adjusting the gross carrying amount of the asset to market value or by determining the 
market value of the carrying value and adjusting the gross carrying amount proportionately so that the resulting carrying 
amount equals the market value. In addition, the accumulated depreciation or amortisation is the difference between the 
gross and carrying amounts of the asset. This amendment did not have any impact on the financial statements of the 
Group considering that the Group's property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost. 
IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures  
The amendment is applied retrospectively and clarifies that a management entity (an entity that provides key 
management personnel services) is a related party subject to the related party disclosures. In addition, an entity that uses 
a management entity is required to disclose the expenses incurred for management services. These amendments did not 
have impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements, since the Group always disclosed the companies providing 
management services as related parties. 
Annual improvements 2011-2013 Cycle 
These improvements are effective from 1 July 2014 and are not expected to have a material impact on the Group. They 
include: 
IFRS 3 Business Combinations 
The amendment is applied prospectively and clarifies for the scope exceptions within IFRS 3 that: 
 Joint arrangements, not just joint ventures, are outside the scope of IFRS 3 
 This scope exception applies only to the accounting in the financial statements of the joint arrangement itself  
These amendments did not have any impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements, since the Group has no 
joint arrangements.  
IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement 
The amendment is applied prospectively and clarifies that the portfolio exception in IFRS 13 can be applied not only to 
financial assets and financial liabilities, but also to other contracts within the scope of IFRS 9 (or IAS 39, as applicable). 
The amendment did not have material effect on the Group’s financial position or performance. 
Standards issued but not yet effective 
The standards and interpretations that are issued, but not yet effective, up to the date of issuance of the Group’s 
consolidated financial statements are disclosed below. The Group intends to adopt these standards, if applicable, when 
they become effective. 
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 
In July 2014, the IASB issued the final version of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments which reflects all phases of the financial 
instruments project and replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and all previous versions 
of IFRS 9. The standard introduces new requirements for classification and measurement, impairment, and hedge 
accounting. IFRS 9 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, with early application permitted. 
Retrospective application is required, but comparative information is not compulsory. Early application of previous 
versions of IFRS 9 (2009, 2010 and 2013) is permitted if the date of initial application is before 1 February 2015. The 
adoption of IFRS 9 is not expected to have an effect on the classification and measurement of the Group’s financial 
assets and the Group’s financial liabilities.  Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC 
Annual Report 2015 134
Consolidated financial statements 
 otes to te consolidated financial statements  
 
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
IFRS 15 was issued in May 2014 and establishes a new five-step model that will apply to revenue arising from contracts 
with customers. Under IFRS 15 revenue is recognised at an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity 
expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer. 
The principles in IFRS 15 provide a more structured approach to measuring and recognising revenue. The new revenue 
standard is applicable to all entities and will supersede all current revenue recognition requirements under IFRS. Either a 
full or modified retrospective application is required for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017 with early 
adoption permitted. The Group is currently assessing the impact of IFRS 15 and plans to adopt the new standard on the 
required effective date. 
Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38: Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation 
The amendments clarify the principle in IAS 16 and IAS 38 that revenue reflects a pattern of economic benefits that are 
generated from operating a business (of which the asset is part) rather than the economic benefits that are consumed 
through use of the asset. As a result, a revenue-based method cannot be used to depreciate property, plant and 
equipment and may only be used in very limited circumstances to amortise intangible assets. 
The amendments are effective prospectively for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016, with early adoption 
permitted. These amendments are not expected to have any impact on the Group given that the Group has not used a 
revenue-based method to depreciate its non-current assets. 
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures 
Applicability of the amendments to IFRS 7 to condensed interim financial statements 
The amendment clarifies that the offsetting disclosure requirements do not apply to condensed interim financial 
statements, unless such disclosures provide a significant update to the information reported in the most recent annual 
report. This amendment must be applied retrospectively. 
IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting 
The amendment clarifies that the required interim disclosures must either be in the interim financial statements or 
incorporated by cross-reference between the interim financial statements and wherever they are included within the 
interim financial report (e.g., in the management commentary or risk report). The other information within the interim 
financial report must be available to users on the same terms as the interim financial statements and at the same time. 
This amendment must be applied retrospectively.  
Amendments to IAS 1 Disclosure Initiative 
The amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements clarify, rather than significantly change, existing IAS 1 
requirements. The amendments clarify: 
 The materiality requirements in IAS 1  
 That specific line items in the statement(s) of profit or loss and OCI and the statement of financial position may 
be disaggregated  
 That entities have flexibility as to the order in which they present the notes to financial statements  
 That the share of OCI of associates and joint ventures accounted for using the equity method must be presented 
in aggregate as a single line item, and classified between those items that will or will not be subsequently 
reclassified to profit or loss 
Furthermore, the amendments clarify the requirements that apply when additional subtotals are presented in the 
statement of financial position and the statement(s) of profit or loss and OCI. These amendments are effective for annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Group will apply those amendments 
from the effective date.  
IFRS 16 Leases 
IFRS 16 sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to 
a contract, ie the customer (‘lessee’) and the supplier (‘lessor’).  Strategic report Corporate governance Financial report Regulatory information Additional disclosures
Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC 
Annual Report 2015 13 5
Consolidated financial statements 
 otes to te consolidated financial statements  
All leases result in a company (the lessee) obtaining the right to use an asset at the start of the lease and, if lease 
payments are made over time, also obtaining financing. 
Accordingly, IFRS 16 eliminates the classification of leases as either operating leases or finance leases as is required by 
IAS 17 and, instead, introduces a single lessee accounting model. Applying that model, a lessee is required to recognise: 
 assets and liabilities for all leases with a term of more than 12 months, unless the underlying asset is of low 
value; and 
 depreciation of lease assets separately from interest on lease liabilities in the income statement. 
IFRS 16 substantially carries forward the lessor accounting requirements in IAS 17. Accordingly, a lessor continues to 
classify its leases as operating leases or finance leases, and to account for those two types of leases differently. 
IFRS 16 is effective from 1 January 2019. A company can choose to apply IFRS 16 before that date but only if it also 
applies IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. 
IFRS 16 replaces the previous leases Standard, IAS 17 Leases, and related Interpretations. 
The amendments are not yet endorsed for use in the EU, expected endorsement is not yet determined. The Group is 
currently assessing the impact of IFRS 16 and plans to adopt the new standard on the required effective date.  
 
4. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
Significant accounting judgments, estimates and assumptions 
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the statement of financial 
position date, that have a significant risk of causing a material change to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities are 
discussed below: 
Oil and gas reserves 
Oil and gas reserves are a material factor in the Group’s computation of depreciation, depletion and amortisation 
(the “DD&A”). These reserve quantities are used for calculating the unit of production depletion rate as it reflects the 
expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits by the Group. 
The Group uses the reserve estimates provided by an independent appraiser on an annual basis to assess the oil and 
gas reserves of its oil and gas fields. The reserves estimates are made in accordance with the methodology of the Society 
of Petroleum Engineers (the “SPE”). In estimating its reserves under the SPE methodology, the Group uses long-term 
planning prices which are also used by management to make investment decisions about development of a field. Using 
planning prices for estimating proved reserves removes the impact of the volatility inherent in using year-end spot prices. 
Management believes that long-term planning price assumptions (Note 6) are more consistent with the long-term nature 
of the upstream business and provide the most appropriate basis for estimating oil and gas reserves. All reserve 
estimates involve some degree of uncertainty. The uncertainty depends mainly on the amount of reliable geological and 
engineering data available at the time of the estimate and the interpretation of this data.  
The relative degree of uncertainty can be conveyed by placing reserves into one of two principal classifications, either 
proved or unproved. Proved reserves are more certain to be recovered than unproved reserves and may be further sub-
classified as developed and undeveloped to denote progressively increasing uncertainty in their recoverability. Estimates 
are reviewed and revised annually.  
Revisions occur due to the evaluation or re-evaluation of already available geological, reservoir or production data; 
availability of new data; or changes to underlying price assumptions. Reserve estimates may also be revised due to 
improved recovery projects, changes in production capacity or changes in development strategy. Proved developed 
reserves are used to calculate the unit of production rates for DD&A. Estimates of economically recoverable oil and gas 
reserves and related future net cash flows also impact the impairment assessment of the Group. 
Fair value of financial instruments 
The fair value measurement of the Group’s financial and non-financial assets and liabilities utilises market observable 
inputs and data as far as possible. Inputs used in determining fair value measurements are categorised into different 
levels based on how observable the inputs used in the valuation technique utilised are (the ‘fair value hierarchy’):   Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC 
Annual Report 2015 136
Consolidated financial statements 
 otes to te consolidated financial statements  
 Level 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical items (unadjusted)  
 Level 2: observable direct or indirect inputs other than Level 1 inputs  
 Level 3: unobservable inputs (i.e. not derived from market data).  
The classification of an item into the above levels is based on the lowest level of the inputs used that has a significant 
effect on the fair value measurement of the item. Transfers of items between levels are recognised in the period they 
occur.  
The financial statements for the years ended 31 December 2015 and 2014 include derivative financial instruments 
recognised at fair value. For more detailed information in relation to the derivative financial instruments, please refer to 
Note 29.  
An analysis of fair values of financial instruments and further details as to how they are measured are provided in 
Note 35.  
Abandonment and site restoration (decommissioning) 
Provision for decommissioning is recognised in full, when the Group has an obligation to dismantle and remove a facility 
or an item of plant and to restore the site on which it is located, and when a reasonable estimate of that provision can be 
made. Estimating the future closure costs involves significant estimates and judgments by management. Significant 
judgments in making such estimates include estimates of timing of cash flow and discount rate. The management made 
its estimates based on the assumption that cash flow will take place at the expected end of the subsoil use rights. 
The Group estimates future dismantlement and site restoration costs for oil and gas properties with reference to the 
estimates provided from either internal or external engineers after taking into consideration the anticipated method of 
dismantlement and the extent of site restoration required in accordance with current legislation and industry practice. The 
amount of the provision is the present value of the estimated expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation 
at current year prices adjusted for expected long-term inflation rate and discounted at applicable rate. The management 
of the Group believes that the long-term interest rates on the Eurobonds issued by the Ministry of Finance of the Republic 
of Kazakhstan provide the best estimates of applicable risk uncorrected discount rate.  
The unwinding of the discount related to the obligation is recorded in finance costs. A corresponding amount equivalent to 
the provision is also recognised as part of the cost of the related oil and gas properties. This asset is subsequently 
depreciated as part of the capital costs of the oil and gas properties on a unit-of-production basis.  
The Group reviews site restoration provisions at each financial reporting date and adjusts them to reflect current best 
estimates in accordance with IFRIC 1 Changes in Existing Decommissioning, Restoration and Similar Liabilities.  
Changes in the measurement of an existing decommissioning liability that result from changes in the estimated timing or 
amount of the outflow of resources embodying economic benefits required to settle the obligation, or changes to the 
discount rate: 
 are added to, or deducted from, the cost of the related asset in the current period. If deducted from the cost of 
the asset the amount deducted shall not exceed its carrying amount. If a decrease in the provision exceeds the 
carrying amount of the asset, the excess is recognised immediately in the profit or loss; and 
 if the adjustment results in an addition to the cost of an asset, the Group considers whether this is an indication 
that the new carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable. If it is such an indication, the Group tests 
the asset for impairment by estimating its recoverable amount, and accounts for any impairment loss in 
accordance with IAS 36. 
Movements in the provision for decommissioning liabilities are disclosed in Note 18. 
Other current liabilities 
The Group makes accruals for liabilities related to the underperformance and or adjustments of work programs under 
subsoil use agreements (SUA) on a regular basis. When evaluating the adequacy of an accrual, management bases its 
estimates on the latest work program included in the SUA and relevant signed supplements and potential future changes 
in payment terms (including the currency in which these liabilities are to be settled). Future changes in the work programs 
may require adjustments to the accrual recorded in the consolidated financial statements.  Strategic report Corporate governance Financial report Regulatory information Additional disclosures

Note 21. 
Impairment of Goodwill 
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually as at 31 December and when circumstances indicate that the carrying value 
may be impaired. Impairment is determined for goodwill by assessing the recoverable amount of each CGU (or group of 
CGUs) to which the goodwill relates. When the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than its carrying amount, an 
impairment loss is recognised. Impairment losses relating to goodwill cannot be reversed in future periods. 
For more detailed information in relation to goodwill, please refer to Note 6. 
Taxation 
Uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation of complex tax regulations, changes in tax laws, and the amount and 
timing of future taxable income. Given the wide range of international business relationships and the long-term nature and 
complexity of existing contractual agreements, differences arising between the actual results and the assumptions made, 
or future changes to such assumptions, could necessitate future adjustments to tax bases of income and expense already 
recorded. The Group establishes provisions, based on reasonable estimates, for possible consequences of audits by the 
tax authorities of the respective counties in which it operates. The amount of such provisions is based on various factors, 
such as experience of previous tax audits and differing interpretations of tax regulations by the Group and the responsible 
tax authority. Such differences in interpretation may arise for a wide variety of issues depending on the conditions 
prevailing in the respective domicile of the Group companies. 
Current income tax 
Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the 
taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that apply to the relevant taxable 
income. 
Current income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the statement of profit 
or loss. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable 
tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate. 
Deferred income tax 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated in respect of temporary differences using the liability method. Deferred 
income taxes are provided for all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their 
carrying values for financial reporting purposes, except where the deferred income tax arises from the initial recognition of 
goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, 
affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.  
A deferred tax asset is recorded only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the 
deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at tax rates that are 
expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.  
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except 
where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary 
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets 
against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.

Significant accounting policies 
Property, plant and equipment 
Exploration expenditure 
Costs directly associated with exploration wells are capitalised within exploration and evaluation assets until the drilling of 
the well is complete and the results have been evaluated. These costs include employee remuneration and materials and 
fuel used, rig costs and payments made to contractors and asset retirement obligation fees. If hydrocarbons are found 
and, subject to further appraisal activity (e.g., the drilling of additional wells), it is probable that they can be commercially 
developed, the costs continue to be carried as an asset while sufficient/continued progress is made in assessing the 
commerciality of the hydrocarbons. 
All such carried costs are subject to technical, commercial and management review at least once a year to confirm the 
continued intent to develop or otherwise extract value from the discovery. When this is no longer the case, the costs are 
written off. 
Subsoil use rights acquisition costs are initially capitalised in exploration and evaluation assets. Subsoil use rights 
acquisition costs are reviewed at each reporting date to confirm that there is no indication that the carrying amount 
exceeds the recoverable amount. This review includes confirming that exploration drilling is still under way or firmly 
planned, or that it has been determined, or work is under way to determine that the discovery is economically viable 
based on a range of technical and commercial considerations and sufficient progress is being made on establishing 
development plans and timing. If no future activity is planned or the subsoil use rights have been relinquished or has 
expired, the carrying value of the subsoil use rights acquisition costs is written off through profit or loss. Upon recognition 
of proved reserves and internal approval for development, the relevant expenditure is transferred to oil and gas 
properties. 
For more detailed information in relation to exploration and evaluation assets, please see Note 7. 
Oil and gas properties 
Expenditure on the construction, installation or completion of infrastructure facilities such as treatment facilities, pipelines 
and the drilling of development wells, is capitalised within property, plant and equipment as oil and gas properties. The 
initial cost of an asset comprises its purchase price or construction cost, any costs directly attributable to bringing the 
asset into operation and the initial estimate of decommissioning obligation, if any. The purchase price or construction cost 
is the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset. When a 
development project moves into the production stage, the capitalisation of certain construction/development costs ceases 
and costs are either regarded as part of the cost of inventory or expensed, except for costs which qualify for capitalisation 
relating to oil and gas property asset additions, improvements or new developments 
All capitalised costs of oil and gas properties are depleted using the unit-of-production method based on estimated proved 
developed reserves of the field, except the Group depreciates its oil pipeline and oil loading terminal on a straight line 
basis over the life of the relevant subsoil use rights. In the case of assets that have a useful life shorter than the lifetime of 
the field the straight line method is applied. 
Other properties 
All other property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. 
Historical cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the items. Subsequent costs are 
included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that 
future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. 
All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the profit or loss during the year in which they are incurred. 
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:  Strategic report Corporate governance Financial report Regulatory information Additional disclosures

Foreign currency translation 
The functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which an entity operates and is normally 
the currency in which the entity primarily generates and expends cash.  
The functional currency of the Company is the United States dollar (the “US dollar” or “US$”). The functional currencies of 
the Group’s subsidiaries are as follows: 
Company Functional currency 
  
Claydon Industrial Limited US dollar 
Grandstil LLC Russian rouble 
Jubilata Investments Limited US dollar 
Nostrum Associated Investments LLP Tenge 
Nostrum E&P Services LLC Russian rouble 
Nostrum Oil & Gas Coöperatief U.A. US dollar 
Nostrum Oil & Gas BV US dollar 
Nostrum Oil & Gas UK Ltd. British Pound 
Nostrum Services Central Asia LLP Tenge 
Nostrum Services CIS BVBA Euro 
Nostrum Services N.V. Euro 
Zhaikmunai LLP US dollar 
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded by the Group’s subsidiaries at their respective functional currency 
spot rates at the date the transaction first qualifies for recognition. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the functional currency spot rates of 
exchange at the reporting date.  
All differences are taken to the profit or loss. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign 
currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured 
at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value is determined. 
In the consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of non-US dollar functional currency subsidiaries are 
translated into US dollars at the spot exchange rate on the balance sheet date. The results and cash flows of non-US 
dollar functional currency subsidiaries are translated into US dollars using average rates of exchange. In the consolidated 
financial statements, exchange adjustments arising when the opening net assets and the profits for the year retained by 
non-US dollar functional currency subsidiaries are translated into US dollars are reported in the statement of 
comprehensive income. 
Advances for non-current assets 
Advances paid for capital investments/acquisition of non-current assets are qualified as advances for non-current assets 
regardless of the period of supplies of relevant assets or the supply of work or services to close advances. Advances paid 
for the purchase of non-current assets are recognised by the Group as non-current assets and are not discounted. 
For more detailed information in relation to advances for non-current assets, please refer to Note 9.  Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC

Business combinations and goodwill 
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the 
aggregate of the consideration transferred, measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any non-controlling 
interest (“NCI”) in the acquiree. For each business combination, the Group elects whether to measure NCI in the acquiree 
at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. Acquisition related costs are expensed 
as incurred and included in administrative expenses. 
When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and 
designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the 
acquisition date. This includes the separation of embedded derivatives in host contracts by the acquiree. Those acquired 
petroleum reserves and resources that can be reliably measured are recognised separately in the assessment of fair 
values on acquisition. Other potential reserves, resources and rights, for which fair values cannot be reliably measured, 
are not recognised separately, but instead are subsumed in goodwill.  
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount 
recognised for NCI over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If the fair value of the 
identifiable net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate consideration transferred (bargain purchase), before 
recognising a gain, the Group reassesses whether it has correctly identified all of the assets acquired and all of the 
liabilities assumed and reviews the procedures used to measure the amounts to be recognised at the acquisition date. If 
the reassessment still results in an excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over the aggregate consideration 
transferred, then the gain is recognised in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. 
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of 
impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the 
Group’s CGUs that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the 
acquiree are assigned to those units.  
Where goodwill forms part of a Cash Generating Unit (“CGU”) and part of the operation in that unit is disposed of, the 
goodwill associated with the disposed operation is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the 
gain or loss on disposal. Goodwill disposed of in these circumstances is measured based on the relative values of the

Impairment of non-financial assets 
The Group assesses assets or groups of assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate 
that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Individual assets are grouped for impairment assessment 
purposes at the lowest level at which there are identifiable cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash flows of 
other groups of assets. If any such indication of impairment exists or when annual impairment testing for an asset group is 
required, the Group makes an estimate of its recoverable amount. An asset group’s recoverable amount is the higher of 
its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. Where the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds its 
recoverable amount, the asset group is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing 
value in use, the estimated future cash flows are adjusted for the risks specific to the asset group and are discounted to 
their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money. 
In determining fair value less costs of disposal, recent market transactions are taken into account. If no such transactions 
can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used. These calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples, 
quoted share prices for publicly traded companies or other available fair value indicators. 
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised 
impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such indication exists, the recoverable amount is 
estimated. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to 
determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. If that is the case, the carrying 
amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount. That increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount 
that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior 
years. Such reversal is recognised in the profit or loss.  
After such a reversal, the depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to allocate the asset’s revised carrying amount, 
less any residual value, on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life. 
Impairment losses of continuing operations, including impairment of inventories, are recognised in profit or loss in those 
expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.  Strategic report Corporate governance Financial report Regulatory information Additional disclosures

Borrowing costs 
The Group capitalises borrowing costs on qualifying assets. Assets qualifying for borrowing costs capitalisation include all 
assets under construction that are not being depreciated, depleted, or amortised, provided that work is in progress at that 
time. Qualifying assets mostly include wells and other operations field infrastructure under construction. Capitalised 
borrowing costs are calculated by applying the capitalisation rate to the expenditures on qualifying assets. The 
capitalisation rate is the weighted average of the borrowing costs applicable to the Group’s borrowings that are 
outstanding during the period. All other borrowing costs are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income in the period in which they are incurred. 
For more detailed information in relation to capitalisation of borrowing costs, please refer to Note 8. 
Inventories 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realisable value (“NRV”). Cost of oil, gas condensate and liquefied 
petroleum gas (“LPG”) is determined on the weighted-average method based on the production cost including the 
relevant expenses on depreciation, depletion and impairment and overhead costs based on production volume. Net 
realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less selling expenses. 
For more information in relation to the breakdown of inventories as at 31 December 2015 and 2014, please see Note 10. 
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is 
probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable 
estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made. Provisions are reviewed by the Group at each balance sheet date 
and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate. If it is no longer probable that an outflow of resources embodying 
economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, the provision is reversed. 
Contingent liabilities  
The Group classifies as contingent liabilities those possible obligations that arise from past events and whose existence 
will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the 
control of the enterprise and the present obligations that arise from past events but are not recognised because it is not 
probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation or the amount 
of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.  
The Group does not recognise contingent liabilities but discloses contingent liabilities in Note 28, unless the possibility 
of an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is remote. 
Financial assets 
Initial recognition and measurement 
Financial assets within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and 
receivables, held-to-maturity investments, available-for-sale financial assets, or as derivatives designated as hedging 
instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate. The Group determines the classification of its financial assets at initial 
recognition. 
All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of investments not at fair value through profit or 
loss, directly attributable transaction costs. 
Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or 
convention in the marketplace (regular way trades) are recognised on the trade date, i.e., the date that the Group 
commits to purchase or sell the asset.  
The Group’s financial assets include cash, long-term and short-term deposits, trade and other receivables. 
Loans and receivables 
Loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method if the time value of money is 
significant. Gains and losses are recognised in income when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired, as 
well as through the amortisation process. This category of financial assets includes trade and other receivables. Cash  Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC 
Annual Report 2015 14 2
Consolidated financial statements 
 otes to te consolidated financial statements  
equivalents are short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, are subject to 
insignificant risk of changes in value and have a maturity of three months or less from the date of acquisition. 
Derecognition 
Financial assets are de-recognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired. 
Impairment of financial assets 
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of 
financial assets is impaired. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is deemed to be impaired if, and only if, there 
is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that has occurred after the initial recognition of the 
asset (an incurred ‘loss event’) and that loss event has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset 
or the group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.  
Evidence of impairment may include indications that the debtors or a group of debtors is experiencing significant financial 
difficulty, default or delinquency in interest or principal payments, the probability that they will enter bankruptcy or other 
financial reorganisation and where observable data indicate that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future 
cash flows, such as changes in arrears or economic conditions that correlate with defaults. 
Financial assets carried at amortised cost 
For financial assets carried at amortised cost the Group assesses individually whether objective evidence of impairment 
exists. If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the 
difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future 
expected credit losses that have not yet been incurred). The present value of the estimated future cash flows is 
discounted at the financial assets original effective interest rate.  
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is 
recognised in the profit or loss. Financial assets together with the associated allowance are written off when there is no 
realistic prospect of future recovery. If, in a subsequent year, the amount of the estimated impairment loss increases or 
decreases because of an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss 
is increased or reduced by adjusting the allowance account. If a future write-off is later recovered, the recovery is credited 
to finance costs in the profit or loss. 
Financial liabilities 
Initial recognition and measurement 
All financial liabilities are recorded initially at fair value. The Group’s financial liabilities include trade and other payables 
and borrowings . 
Subsequent measurement 
After initial recognition, interest bearing borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR. Gains 
and losses are recognised in the profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the EIR 
amortisation process. 
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fee or costs that are an 
integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included in finance cost in the profit or loss. 
Derecognition 
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an 
existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an 
existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original 
liability and the recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the 
profit or loss. 
Offsetting of financial instruments 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the statement of financial position if, and 
only if, there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a 
net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.  Strategic report Corporate governance Financial report Regulatory information Additional disclosures

Derivative financial instruments and hedging 
The Group uses hedging contracts for oil export sales to cover part of its risks associated with oil price fluctuations. Such 
derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered 
into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and 
as liabilities when the fair value is negative. 
Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value of derivatives during the year that do not qualify for hedge 
accounting are taken directly to profit or loss. 
For more detailed information in relation to derivative financial instruments, please refer to Note 29  
Cash and short-term deposits 
Cash and cash equivalents in the statement of financial position comprise cash at banks and at hand and short term 
deposits with an original maturity of three months or less, but exclude any restricted cash which is not available for use by 
the Group and therefore is not considered highly liquid – for example, cash set aside to cover decommissioning 
obligations. 
For the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash 
equivalents, as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts. 
For more detailed information in relation to cash and cash equivalents as at 31 December 2015 and 2015, please see 
Note 14. 
Revenue recognition  
The Group sells crude oil, gas condensate and LPG under agreements priced by reference to Platt’s and/or Argus’ index 
quotations and adjusted for freight, insurance and quality differentials where applicable. The Group sells gas under 
agreements at fixed prices. 
Revenue from the sale of crude oil, gas condensate, gas and LPG is recognised when delivery has taken place and risks 
and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer. 
Revenue is recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the 
Group and the amount of revenue can be reliably measured. 
Treasury shares 
Own equity instruments that are reacquired (treasury shares) are recognised at cost and deducted from equity. No gain or 
loss is recognised in profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Group’s own equity instruments. Any 
difference between the carrying amount and the consideration, if reissued, is recognised in other reserves. Voting rights 
related to treasury shares are nullified for the Group and no distributions are accepted in relation to them. Share options 
exercised during the reporting period are satisfied with treasury shares. 
Share-based payments 
The Group measures the cost of cash-settled transactions with employees by reference to the fair value of the equity 
instruments at the date at which they are granted. Estimating fair value for share-based payment transactions requires 
determination of the most appropriate valuation model, which is dependent on the terms and conditions of the grant. This 
estimate also requires determination of the most appropriate inputs to the valuation model including the expected life of 
the share option, volatility and distribution yield and making assumptions about them. The assumptions and models used 
for estimating fair value for share-based payment transactions are disclosed in Note 28. 
 
5. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS 
On 19 May 2014 the Group agreed to acquire 100% of the share capital of Nostrum Services CIS BVBA (formerly Prolag 
BVBA) and Nostrum Services Central Asia LLP (formerly Amersham Oil LLP), companies providing management and 
consulting services to the Group, from related parties of the Group, in connection with the premium listing on the London 
Stock Exchange of the Group’s listed entity, so as to comply with certain exchange requirements that listed companies be 
managed by persons employed by entities within the listed company’s group.  Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC

Impairment testing 
The goodwill arising from the purchase of Nostrum Services CIS BVBA and Nostrum Services Central Asia LLP (Note 5) 
relates to a single cash-generating unit. Respectively, goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the recoverable 
amount against the carrying value of the underlying cash generating unit. 
The management has determined a single cash-generating unit within the Group’s non-current assets consisting of all 
Group’s assets related to its Chinarevskoye and exploration fields and gas treatment facility. Impairment testing is 
performed by comparing the recoverable amount against the carrying value of the cash generating unit. The recoverable 
amount is determined by calculation of the value-in-use based on the discounted cash flow model as no recent third party 
transactions exist on which a reliable market-based fair value can be established. The value-in-use calculation model, 
which formally approved by the management, takes into consideration cashflows, which are expected to arise until 2032, 
i.e. during the license term of the Chinarevskoye field. The period exceeding five years is believed to be appropriate 
based on the proved and probable reserves audited by independent engineers and respective past history of the Group’s 
ability to transfer probable reserves into proved. 
The key assumptions used in the Group’s discounted cash flow models reflect past experience and take account of 
external factors. These assumptions are: 
 Oil prices (in real terms): US$30/bbl for 2016-2017 and US$60/bbl for 2018-2032; 
 Proved and probable hydrocarbon reserves confirmed by independent reserve engineers; 
 Production profiles based on Group’s internal estimates confirmed by independent reserve engineers; 
 All cash flows are projected on the basis of stable prices, i.e. inflation/growth rates are ignored; 
 Cost profiles for the development of the fields and subsequent operating costs consistent with reserves 
estimates and production profiles; and 
 Pre-tax discount rate of 14% (2014: 14%). 
None of the reasonably possible changes in key assumptions causes the cash generating unit’s carrying amount to 
exceed its recoverable amount.

Change in estimates  (5,622) 4,306 
Abandonment and site restoration provision as at 31 December  15,928 20,877 
The management made its estimate based on the assumption that cash flow will take place at the expected end of the 
subsoil use rights in 2033. There are uncertainties in estimation of future costs as Kazakh laws and regulations 
concerning site restoration evolve. 
The long-term inflation and discount rates used to determine the abandonment and site restoration provision at 31 
December 2015 were 2.49% and 5.54%, respectively (31 December 2014: 3.75% and 4.88%). 
The change in the long-term inflation rate, discount rate and liquidation cost estimates in the year ended 31 December 
2015 resulted in the decrease of the abandonment and site restoration provision by US$ 5,622 thousand (31 December 
2014: the increase by US$ 4,306 thousand). 
 
19. DUE TO GOVERNMENT OF KAZAKHSTAN

to exploration of the Contract territory and the construction of surface facilities in fields discovered therein and that are 
reimbursable by the Group to the Government during the production period. The total amount of liability due to 
Government as stipulated by the Contract is US$ 25,000 thousand.

Employee share option plan 
The Group operates one option plan (the Phantom Option Plan), that was adopted by the board of directors of the 
Company on 20 June 2014 to allow for the continuation of the option plan previously maintained by Nostrum Oil & Gas 
LP. The rights and obligations in relation to this option plan were transferred to Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC from Nostrum Oil 
& Gas LP following the reorganisation (Note 2). 
Employees (including senior executives and executive directors) of members of the Group or their associates receive 
remuneration in the form of equity-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services as consideration for 
share appreciation rights, which can only be settled in cash (“cash-settled transactions”). 
The cost of cash-settled equity-based employee compensation is measured initially at fair value at the grant date using a 
trinomial lattice valuation model. This fair value is expensed over the period until vesting with the recognition of a 
corresponding liability. The liability is remeasured at each reporting date up to and including the settlement date with 
changes in fair value recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. 
The equity-based payment plan is described below. 
During 2008-2015, 4,297,958 equity appreciation rights (SARs) which can only be settled in cash were granted to senior 
employees and executive directors of members of the Group or their associates. These generally vest over a five year 
period from the date of grant, so that one fifth of granted SARs vests on each of the five anniversaries from the date of 
grant. The contractual life of the SARs is ten years. The fair value of the SARs is measured at the grant date using a 
trinomial lattice valuation option pricing model taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the instruments 
were granted. SARs are exercisable at any time after vesting till the end of the contractual life and give its holder a right to 
a difference between the market value of the Group’s ordinary shares at the date of exercise and a stated base value. 
The services received and a liability to pay for those services are recognised over the expected vesting period. 
Until the liability is settled it is remeasured at each reporting date with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss as 
part of the employee benefit expenses arising from cash-settled share-based payment transactions.  
The carrying value of the liability relating to 2,611,413 of SARs at 31 December 2015 is US$ 4,284 thousand  
(31 December 2014: 2,611,413 SARs with carrying value of US$ 6,449 thousand). During the year ended 31 December 
2015 302,000 SARs were fully vested (FY 2014:302,000).

There were no SARs granted during the years ended 31 December 2015 and 2014. The weighted average price at the 
date of exercise for SARs exercised during the year ended 31 December 2014 amounted to US$ 8.22 per SAR. The Hull-
White trinomial lattice valuation model was used to value the share options. The following table lists the inputs to the 
model used for the plan for the years ended 31 December 2015 and 2014:

The expected life of the options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may 
occur. The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may 
also not necessarily be the actual outcome. Option turnover rate represents the rate of employees expected to leave the 
Company during the vesting period, which is based on historical data and is may not necessarily be the actual outcome. 
The model considers that when share price reaches the level of exercise price multiplied by the price trigger the 
employees are expected to exercise their options.

34. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS 
Taxation 
Kazakhstan’s tax legislation and regulations are subject to ongoing changes and varying interpretations. Instances of 
inconsistent opinions between local, regional and national tax authorities are not unusual. The current regime of penalties 
and interest related to reported and discovered violations of Kazakhstan’s tax laws are severe. Penalties are generally 
50% of the taxes additionally assessed and interest is assessed at the refinancing rate established by the National Bank 
of Kazakhstan multiplied by 2.5. As a result, penalties and interest can amount to multiples of any assessed taxes. Fiscal 
periods remain open to review by tax authorities for five calendar years preceding the year of review. Under certain 
circumstances reviews may cover longer periods. Because of the uncertainties associated with Kazakhstan’s tax system, 
the ultimate amount of taxes, penalties and interest, if any, may be in excess of the amount expensed to date and 
accrued at 31 December 2015. As at 31 December 2015 management believes that its interpretation of the relevant 
legislation is appropriate and that it is probable that the Group’s tax position will be sustained. 
Abandonment and site restoration (decommissioning) 
As Kazakh laws and regulations concerning site restoration and clean-up evolve, the Group may incur future costs, the 
amount of which is currently indeterminable. Such costs, when known, will be provided for as new information, legislation 
and estimates evolve.  
Environmental obligations 
The Group may also be subject to loss contingencies relating to regional environmental claims that may arise from the 
past operations of the related fields in which it operates. Kazakhstan’s environmental legislation and regulations are 
subject to ongoing changes and varying interpretations. As Kazakh laws and regulations evolve concerning environmental 
assessments and site restoration, the Group may incur future costs, the amount of which is currently indeterminable due 
to such factors as the ultimate determination of responsible parties associated with these costs and the Government’s 
assessment of respective parties’ ability to pay for the costs related to environmental reclamation.  
However, depending on any unfavourable court decisions with respect to any claims or penalties assessed by the Kazakh 
regulatory agencies, it is possible that the Group’s future results of operations or cash flow could be materially affected in 
a particular period. 
Capital commitments 
As at 31 December 2015 the Group had contractual capital commitments in the amount of US$123,529 thousand (31 
December 2014: US$248,644 thousand) mainly in respect to the Group’s oil field exploration and development activities. 
Operating lease  
The Group entered into a cancellable lease agreement for the main administrative office in Uralsk in October 2007 for a 
period of 20 years for US$ 15 thousand per month. 
In 2010 the Group entered into several agreements on lease of 650 railway tank wagons for transportation of hydrocarbon 
products for a period of up to seven years for KZT 6,989 (equivalent of US$ 47) per day per one wagon. The lease 
agreements may be early terminated either upon mutual agreement of the parties, or unilaterally by one of the parties if 
the other party does not fulfil its obligations under the contract. 
The total of future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases was represented as follows:

Lease expenses of railway tank wagons for the year ended 31 December 2015 amounted to US$15,690 thousand (FY 
2014: US$14,622 thousand). 
Social and education commitments 
As required by the Contract (as amended by, inter alia, Supplement No. 9), the Group is obliged to: 
 spend US$ 300 thousand per annum to finance social infrastructure; 
 make an accrual of  one percent per annum of the actual investments for the Chinarevskoye field for the 
purposes of educating Kazakh citizens; and 
 adhere to a spending schedule on education which lasts until (and including) 2020. 
The contracts for exploration and production of hydrocarbons from Rostoshinskoye, Darjinskoye and Yuzhno 
Gremyachinskoye fields require fulfilment of several social and other obligations.  
The outstanding obligations under the contract for exploration and production of hydrocarbons from Rostoshinskoye field 
(as amended on 3 July 2015) require the subsurface user to: 
 spend US$ 1,000 thousand for funding of development of Astana city in case of commercial discovery; 
 invest at least US$ 5,888 thousand for exploration of the field during the exploration period;  
 reimburse historical costs of US$ 383 thousand to the Government upon commencement of production stage; 
and 
 fund liquidation expenses equal to US$ 35 thousand.  
The outstanding obligations under the contract for exploration and production of hydrocarbons from Darjinskoye field 
(after its amendment on 30 December 2015) require the subsurface user to: 
 invest at least US$ 18,976 thousand for exploration of the field during the exploration period; 
 fund liquidation expenses equal to US$ 130 thousand. 
The outstanding obligations under the contract for exploration and production of hydrocarbons from Yuzhno-
Gremyachinskoye field (after its amendment on 30 December 2015) require the subsurface user to: 
 invest at least US$ 30,453 thousand for exploration of the field during the exploration period; 
 fund liquidation expenses equal to US$ 154 thousand. 
Domestic oil sales 
In accordance with Supplement # 7 to the Contract, Zhaikmunai LLP is required to deliver at least 15% of produced oil to 
the domestic market on a monthly basis for which prices are materially lower than export prices. 
 
35. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES 
The Group’s principal financial liabilities comprise borrowings, payables to Government of Kazakhstan, trade payables 
and other current liabilities. The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance the development of the 
Chinarevskoye oil and gas condensate field and its operations as well as exploration of the three new oil and gas fields – 
Rostoshinskoye, Darjinskoye and Yuzhno-Gremyachinskoye. The Group's financial assets consist of trade and other 
receivables, non-current investments, current investments and cash and cash equivalents. 
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, liquidity risk, 
credit risk and commodity price risk. The Group’s management reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these 
risks, which are summarized below.  
Commodity price risk 
The Group is exposed to the effect of fluctuations in price of crude oil, which is quoted in US dollar on the international 
markets. The Group prepares annual budgets and periodic forecasts including sensitivity analyses in respect of various 
levels of crude oil prices in the future.  Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC 
Annual Report 2015 164
Consolidated financial statements 
 otes to te consolidated financial statements  
 
Interest rate risk 
The Group is not exposed to interest rate risk in 2015 and 2014 as the Group had no financial instruments with floating 
rates as at years ended 31 December 2015 and 2014. 
Foreign currency risk 
As a significant portion of the Group’s operation is the tenge denominated, the Group’s statement of financial position can 
be affected by movements in the US dollar / tenge exchange rates. The Group mitigates the effect of its structural 
currency exposure by borrowing in US dollars and denominating sales in US dollars.  
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the US dollar exchange rate, with all 
other variables held constant, of the Group’s profit before tax. The impact on equity is the same as the impact on profit 
before tax.

 (25,317) (1,080) (182) (157) (26,736) 
Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in raising funds to meet commitments associated with its 
financial liabilities. Liquidity risk may result from an inability to sell a financial asset quickly at close to its fair value. 
The Group monitors its risk to a shortage of funds using a liquidity planning tool. The tool allows selecting severe stress 
test scenarios. To ensure an adequate level of liquidity a minimum cash balance has been defined as a cushion of liquid 
assets. The Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of 
notes, loans, hedges, export financing and financial leases.   Strategic report Corporate governance Financial report Regulatory information Additional disclosures

The Group’s policy is that, while it has an investment program on-going: a) not more than 25% of borrowings should 
mature in the next twelve-month period and b) a minimum balance of US$ 50 million is retained on the balance sheet post 
repayment or refinancing of any debt due in the next twelve-month period. 
The Group's total outstanding debt consists of two notes: US$ 560 million issued in 2012 and maturing in 2019 and 
US$ 400 million issued in 2014 and maturing in 2019. The Group assessed the concentration of risk with respect to 
refinancing its debt and concluded it to be low.  
The table below summarizes the maturity profile of the Group's financial liabilities at 31 December 2015 and 31

Credit risk 
Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Group to credit risk, consist primarily of derivative financial 
instruments, accounts receivable and cash in banks. The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying 
amount of each financial asset. The Group considers that its maximum exposure is reflected by the amount of trade 
accounts receivable, cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments. 
The Group places its tenge denominated cash with SB Sberbank JSC, which has a credit rating of Ba3 (stable) from 
Moody's rating agency and ING with a credit rating of A1 (stable) from Moody's rating agency at 31 December 2015. The 
Group does not guarantee obligations of other parties. 
The Group sells its products and makes advance payments only to recognised, creditworthy third parties. In addition, 
receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Group's exposure to bad debts and 
recoverability of prepayments made is not significant and thus risk of credit default is low. 
Customer credit risk is managed by each business unit subject to the Group’s established policy, procedures and control 
relating to customer credit risk management. Credit quality of a customer is assessed based on an extensive credit rating 
scorecard. Outstanding customer receivables are regularly monitored.  
An impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date on an individual basis for major clients. The maximum 
exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of financial assets. The Group does not 
hold collateral as security. The Group evaluates the concentration of risk with respect to trade receivables as low, as its

Fair values of financial instruments 
Set out below, is a comparison by class of the carrying amounts and fair value of the Group’s financial instruments, other 
than those with carrying amounts reasonably approximating their fair values:

Total (854,394) (884,813) (712,724) (977,019) 
The management assessed that cash and cash equivalents, current investments, trade receivables, trade payables and 
other current liabilities approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.  
The fair value of the financial assets and liabilities represents the amount at which the instruments could be exchanged in 
a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. Fair value of the quoted notes is 
based on price quotations at the reporting date and respectively categorised as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy. 
The fair value of derivative financial instruments is categorised as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy and is calculated 
using Black-Scholes valuation model based on Brent Crude Futures traded on the Intercontinental Exchange, with the 
relative expiration dates ranging from the current reporting date until December 2017. 
The following table shows ranges of the inputs depending on maturity, which are used in the model for calculation of the 
fair value of the derivative financial instruments as at 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2014:  
 
 31 December 2015  31 December 2014  
   
Future price at the reporting date (US$) 37.19-48.75 59.2-67.9 
Historical volatility (%) 30.31 16.02-17.73 
Risk-free interest rate (%) 0.32-0.69 0.25-0.67 
Maturity (months) 1-23 3-15 
The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may also not 
necessarily be the actual outcome. 
The following table reflects the results of the changes in volatilities and oil price assumptions on the fair value of the 
derivative financial instrument: 
 
Increase in the 
assumption 
Decrease in the

Increase/(decrease) in gain on derivative financial instruments

due to change in volatility rate assumption (+/-2%) 3,590 (3,561) 
Movement in the derivative financial instruments is disclosed in Note 29. 
During the years ended 31 December 2015 and 2014 there were no transfers between the levels of fair value hierarchy of 
the Group’s financial instruments.  Strategic report Corporate governance Financial report Regulatory information Additional disclosures

Capital management 
For the purpose of the Group’s capital management, capital includes issued capital, additional paid-in capital and all other 
equity reserves attributable to the equity holders of the parent. The primary objective of the Group’s capital management 
is to maximise the shareholder value. 
In order to achieve this overall objective, the Group’s capital management, amongst other things, aims to ensure that it 
meets financial covenants attached to the notes that define capital structure requirements. Breaches in meeting the 
financial covenants would permit the lenders to immediately call borrowings. There have been no breaches in the 
financial covenants of the notes in the current period nor the prior period. 
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments in light of changes in economic conditions and the 
requirements of the financial covenants. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the distribution 
payment to participants, return capital to participants or increase partnership capital. The Group monitors capital using a 
gearing ratio, which is net debt divided by total capital plus net debt. The Group’s policy is to keep the gearing ratio 
between 20% and 40%. The Group includes within net debt, interest bearing loans and borrowings, less cash, short-term 
deposits and long-term deposits.

Notes to the Parent company financial statements  
 
Going concern 
These Company financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The directors are satisfied that the 
Company has sufficient resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future, a period of not less than 12 months 
from the date of this report. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Company 
financial statements. 
 
3. CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND DISCLOSURES 
New standards, interpretations and amendments thereof, adopted by the Company  
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year, except for the following 
amendments to IFRS effective as at 1 January 2015: 
Annual improvements 2010-2012 Cycle 
These improvements are effective from 1 July 2014 and are not expected to have a material impact on the Company. 
They include: 
IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures  
The amendment is applied retrospectively and clarifies that a management entity (an entity that provides key 
management personnel services) is a related party subject to the related party disclosures. In addition, an entity that uses 
a management entity is required to disclose the expenses incurred for management services. These amendments are not 
expected to have effect on the Company’s future financial statements, since the Company always disclosed the 
companies providing management services as related parties. 
Annual improvements 2011-2013 Cycle 
These improvements are effective from 1 July 2014 and are not expected to have a material impact on the Company. 
They include: 
IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement 
The amendment is applied prospectively and clarifies that the portfolio exception in IFRS 13 can be applied not only to 
financial assets and financial liabilities, but also to other contracts within the scope of IFRS 9 (or IAS 39, as applicable). It 
is not expected that the amendment will have material effect on the Company’s financial position or performance. 
Standards issued but not yet effective 
The standards and interpretations that are issued, but not yet effective, up to the date of issuance of the Company’s 
financial statements are disclosed below. The Company intends to adopt these standards, if applicable, when they 
become effective. 
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 
In July 2014, the IASB issued the final version of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments which reflects all phases of the financial 
instruments project and replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and all previous versions 
of IFRS 9. The standard introduces new requirements for classification and measurement, impairment, and hedge 
accounting. IFRS 9 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, with early application permitted. 
Retrospective application is required, but comparative information is not compulsory. Early application of previous 
versions of IFRS 9 (2009, 2010 and 2013) is permitted if the date of initial application is before 1 February 2015. The 
adoption of IFRS 9 is not expected to have an effect on the classification and measurement of the Company’s financial 
assets and the Company’s financial liabilities. 
Amendments to IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements: Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests 
The amendments to IFRS 11 require that a joint operator accounting for the acquisition of an interest in a joint operation, 
in which the activity of the joint operation constitutes a business must apply the relevant IFRS 3 principles for business 
combinations accounting. The amendments also clarify that a previously held interest in a joint operation is not 
remeasured on the acquisition of an additional interest in the same joint operation while joint control is retained. In  Strategic report Corporate governance Financial report Regulatory information Additional disclosures
Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC 
Annual Report 2015 17 5
Parent company financial statements 
Notes to the Parent company financial statements  
 
addition, a scope exclusion has been added to IFRS 11 to specify that the amendments do not apply when the parties 
sharing joint control, including the reporting entity, are under common control of the same ultimate controlling party. 
The amendments apply to both the acquisition of the initial interest in a joint operation and the acquisition of any 
additional interests in the same joint operation and are prospectively effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 
January 2016, with early adoption permitted. These amendments are not expected to have any impact to the Company. 
Amendments to IAS 27: Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements 
The amendments will allow entities to use the equity method to account for investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and 
associates in their separate financial statements. Entities already applying IFRS and electing to change to the equity 
method in its separate financial statements will have to apply that change retrospectively. For first-time adopters of IFRS 
electing to use the equity method in their separate financial statements, they will be required to apply this method from the 
date of transition to IFRS. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016, with 
early adoption permitted. These amendments are not expected to have any impact on the Company’s financial 
statements.  
Annual improvements 2012-2014 Cycle 
These improvements are effective from 1 January 2016 and are not expected to have a material impact on the Company. 
They include: 
Amendments to IAS 1 Disclosure Initiative 
The amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements clarify, rather than significantly change, existing IAS 1 
requirements. The amendments clarify: 
 
 disaggregated 
 
 aggregate as a single line item, and classified between those items that will or will not be subsequently reclassified to 
profit or loss 
Furthermore, the amendments clarify the requirements that apply when additional subtotals are presented in the 
statement of financial position and the statement(s) of profit or loss and OCI. These amendments are effective for annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016, with early adoption permitted. These amendments are not expected to 
have any impact on the Company. 
 
4. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
Foreign currency translation 
The functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which an entity operates and is normally 
the currency in which the entity primarily generates and expends cash. 
The functional currency of the Company is the United States dollar (the US dollar or US $). 
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency by applying the spot exchange rate 
ruling at the date of the transaction.  
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the functional currency spot rates of 
exchange at the reporting date. 
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange 
rates as at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are 
translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value is determined. 
  Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC 
Annual Report 2015 17 6
Parent company financial statements 
Notes to the Parent company financial statements  
 
Investments 
Investments in subsidiaries are recorded at cost. The Company assesses investments for impairment whenever events or 
changes in the circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an investment may not be recoverable. If any such 
indication of impairment exists the Company makes an estimate of its recoverable amount. Where the carrying amount of 
an investment exceeds its recoverable amount, the investment is considered impaired and is written down to its 
recoverable amount. 
Financial assets 
Initial recognition and measurement  
Financial assets within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as financial assets at fair value through the statement of 
comprehensive income, loans and receivables, held-to-maturity investments, available-for-sale financial assets, or as 
derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate. The Company determines the 
classification of its financial assets at initial recognition. 
All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of investments not at fair value through profit or 
loss, directly attributable transaction. Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a time 
frame established by regulation or convention in the marketplace (regular way trades) are recognised on the trade date, 
i.e., the date that the Company commits to purchase or sell the asset. 
The Company’s financial assets include investments, loans, cash and cash equivalents and receivables. 
Subsequent measurement 
Receivables  
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an 
active market. After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest rate method, less impairment. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or 
premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the effective interest rate. The effective interest rate 
amortisation is included in finance income in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. The losses 
arising from impairment are recognised in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income in finance costs 
for loans and in cost of sales or other operating expenses for receivables 
Accounts receivable are recognized and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectible 
amounts. An estimate for uncollectible amounts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable. These 
estimates are reviewed periodically, and as adjustments become necessary, they are reported as expense (credit) in the 
period in which they become known. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents in the statement of financial position comprise cash at banks. 
Derecognition 
A financial asset (or, where applicable a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is 
derecognized when: 
The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired 
The Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the 
received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; and either (a) the 
Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Company has neither transferred 
nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset. 
Impairment of financial assets 
The Company assesses at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of 
financial assets is impaired. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is deemed to be impaired if, and only if, there 
is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that has occurred after the initial recognition of the 
asset (an incurred ‘loss event’) and that loss event has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset 
or the group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated. Evidence of impairment may include indications that the 
debtors or a group of debtors is experiencing significant financial difficulty, default or delinquency in interest or principal  Strategic report Corporate governance Financial report Regulatory information Additional disclosures

Annual Report 2015 17 7

Notes to the Parent company financial statements  
 
payments, the probability that they will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganization and where observable data 
indicate that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows, such as changes in arrears or economic 
conditions that correlate with defaults. 
Financial liabilities 
Initial recognition and measurement 
Financial liabilities within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, loans 
and borrowings, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate. The Company 
determines the classification of its financial liabilities at initial recognition. All financial liabilities are recognized initially at 
fair value and in the case of loans and borrowings, net of directly attributable transaction costs. 
The Company’s financial liabilities include payables and accrued liabilities. 
Subsequent measurement 
After initial recognition, interest bearing borrowings are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective 
interest rate method (EIR). Gains and losses are recognized in the profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognized as 
well as through the EIR amortization process. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or 
premium on acquisition and fee or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortization is included in finance 
cost in the statement of comprehensive income. 
Derecognition 
A financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an 
existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an 
existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original 
liability and the recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognized in profit 
or loss. 
Offsetting of financial instruments 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the statement of financial position if, and 
only if, there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a 
net basis, or to realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously. 
Fair value of financial instruments 
The fair value of financial instruments that are traded in active markets at each reporting date is determined by reference 
to quoted market prices or dealer price quotations (bid price for long positions and ask price for short positions), without 
any deduction for transaction costs. For financial instruments not traded in an active market, the fair value is determined 
using appropriate valuation techniques. Such techniques may include using recent arm’s length market transactions; 
reference to the current fair value of another instrument that is substantially the same; discounted cash flow analysis or 
other valuation models.

13. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES 
The Company's financial assets consist of receivables from shareholders and cash and cash equivalents. The Company’s 
financial liabilities consist of trade and other payables and accrued liabilities. 
The main risks arising from the Company’s financial instruments are foreign exchange risk and credit risk. The 
Company’s management reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarized below.  
Foreign currency risk 
Most of the Company’s operation is denominated in USD, therefore the Company’s statement of financial position is not 
significantly affected by exchange rate movements.  
Credit risk 
Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to credit risk, consist primarily of receivables and cash in 
banks. The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset. The Company 
considers that its maximum exposure is reflected by the amount of receivables from shareholders and cash and cash 
equivalents. 
The Company places its US Dollar and Euro denominated cash with ING with a credit rating of A1 (upper medium grade) 
from Moody's rating agency at 31 December 2015. 
Receivables are amounts receivable from group companies, thus risk of credit default is low.  Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC 
Annual Report 2015 180
Parent company financial statements 
Notes to the Parent company financial statements  
 
Fair values of financial instruments 
The fair value of the financial assets represents the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current 
transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. 
The management assessed that its assets and liabilities approximate their carrying amounts largely due to their nature or 
the short-term maturities of these instruments. 
Capital management 
For the purpose of the Company’s capital management, capital includes issued capital and all other equity reserves 
attributable to the equity holders of the Company. The primary objective of the Company’s capital management is to 
maximise the shareholder value.

production well A well that has been drilled for producing oil or gas, or one that is capable of production 
once the producing structure and characteristics are determined.
profit oil Profit oil is the difference between cost oil and the total amount of crude oil produced 
each month, which is shared between the State and Zhaikmunai LLP.
prospective resources Quantities of petroleum which are estimated, on a given date, to be potentially 
recoverable from undiscovered accumulations. 
Proven Reserves (1P) Proven or proved reserves (1P) are those reserves that, to a high degree of certainty 
(90% confidence), are recoverable. There is relatively little risk associated with these 
reserves. Proven developed reserves are reserves that can be recovered from existing 
wells with existing infrastructure and operating methods. Proven undeveloped reserves 
require development.
Probable Reserves Probable reserves are those reserves that analysis of geological and engineering data 
suggests are more likely than not to be recoverable. There is at least a 50% probability 
that reserves recovered will exceed Probable Reserves. Proven plus probable reserves 
are referred to as 2P.
Possible Reserves Possible reserves are those reserves that, to a low degree of certainty (10% confidence), 
are recoverable. There is relatively high risk associated with these reserves. Proven, 
probable and possible reserves are referred to as 3P.

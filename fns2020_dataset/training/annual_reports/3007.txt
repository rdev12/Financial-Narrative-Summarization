ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014
STRATEGIC REPORT
Chairman’s Statement
REviEW OF thE YEAR
I am pleased to report that the Group 
achieved another record profit before tax 
this year, building on the successes of recent 
years. This achievement can be attributed 
to a strong operational performance across 
the business. Each division performed well, 
driven by the benefits from research and 
development, innovation, global geographic 
diversity and the strategic investments the 
Board has made. 
In the financial year 2012/2013 the harsh 
UK weather made a significant positive 
contribution to the Group’s profit before tax 
in that period. This year the UK experienced 
a mild winter, resulting in lower revenues, 
however, the impact of this was offset by 
the severe weather conditions in the USA, 
particularly in the Mid-Atlantic States. This 
resulted in record sales of our feed blocks 
and increased recognition of our brands. 
In addition, the Group benefited from the 
increased sales both in the UK and USA 
of AminoMax
®
. Retail sales grew 0.5%, 
further endorsing our continued investment 
programme in our Country Stores across 
Northern England and Southern Scotland, 
with enlarged branches at Annan and Brock 
opening during the year. 
The now fully operational flour mill at 
Kirkcaldy has delivered the anticipated 
benefits to the Food division, and this coupled 
with the continuing excellent customer service 
from all our flour mills has resulted in the 
expected increase to the profit before tax for 
the division.
Significant investment was made through the 
year in our Engineering division, particularly with 
Net cash generated from operating activities 
was £12.5 million (2013: £4.0 million). At the 
end of the period the Group had net debt  
of £24.6 million compared to net debt of 
£22.1 million at 31 August 2013. This increase 
reflects acquisition activity in the year and 
our ongoing significant capital investment 
programme.
Working capital increased by £1.6 million  
and contributions to the deficit in the pension 
scheme totalled £2.8 million.
During the year the Group renewed its 
banking facilities for a 5 year period at 
improved margins. Our headroom against 
existing facilities at the year-end was  
£17.4 million. Borrowing and interest 
cover continue to remain well within our 
conservative levels, meaning that we are  
well placed to make strategic investments  
or acquisitions.
ShARE SpLit
The Board considers it appropriate to propose 
at the Company’s Annual General Meeting on  
13 January 2015, a sub-division of the 
existing ordinary shares on the basis of a 
ten for one share split, thereby reducing the 
nominal value of the existing ordinary shares 
to 2.5 pence each. It is anticipated that such 
a sub-division will improve the liquidity of the 
market in the Company’s shares and reduce 
the bid/offer spread of the Company’s shares. 
Further details will be set out in the Notice of 
the Annual General Meeting.
More information is contained on page 24. 
the acquisition of Chirton Engineering Limited in 
April 2014. The new facility for Wälischmiller at 
Markdorf, Germany was completed during the 
year. The Engineering division met its budgetary 
targets for the year, despite a lack of nuclear 
contracts in the UK and escalating economic 
and political issues worldwide.
viSiON
In the coming year we will continue to build 
on our success and make investments across 
the Group both in the UK and overseas for the 
future. We expect our innovative approach, 
in particular in the development of new 
products, to continue to differentiate us from 
the competition and we will remain alert to 
suitable complementary acquisitions.
EmpLOYEES
Our employees across each division and 
countries in which we operate are our key 
asset. Their first class skills, knowledge, and 
commitment are a critical factor in the Group’s 
success. On behalf of the Board I would like 
to thank all of them for their hard work during 
the year and their continued support, and to 
also welcome everyone that has joined the 
Group during the year.
 
FiNANCiAL REviEW
Revenue for the period fell by 8.4% to  
£429.0 million (2013: £468.1 million). Profit 
before tax was up 7.8% to £16.6 million 
(2013: £15.4 million).
Basic earnings per share for the period  
were up by 3.1% to 127.8 pence  
(2013: 123.9 pence) with fully diluted earnings 
per share of 123.3 pence (2013: 121.7 pence) 
and adjusted earnings per share of 130.8 
pence (2013: 123.9 pence).

DiviDEND
The Board is proposing a 3.0% increase in  
the final dividend to 17.0 pence per ordinary 
share which, together with the two interim 
dividends of 8.5p pence per share each paid 
on 16 May and 10 October 2014, make a total 
of 34.0 pence per share for the year (2013: 
32.0 pence per share). The final dividend,  
if approved by shareholders, will be paid  
on 16 January 2015 to shareholders on  
the register at the close of business on  
19 December 2014 and the shares will go  
ex-dividend on 18 December 2014.
BOARD COmpOSitiON AND CORpORAtE 
GOvERNANCE
During the current year ending August 
2015, Alistair Wannop, Senior Independent 
Director and Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee, will become non-independent  
due to his length of service in accordance  
with the UK Corporate Governance Code 
2012. In order to address this and other 
compliance issues the Board is currently 
undertaking a search for an additional 
independent Non-Executive Director.
The Company takes its corporate governance 
responsibilities very seriously and a full report 
on Corporate Governance is on pages 22  
to 35.
OutLOOK
The Engineering division will continue to 
benefit from Wälischmiller’s advanced 
technological capabilities, and several 
ongoing development projects will continue 
to be progressed over the next year. Global 
political and economic conditions in some 
of its key markets are likely to impact the 
current financial year, although the medium 
term prospects remain very positive. Chirton 
Engineering is expected to start realising 
benefits in its first full year of trading. 
Weak farmgate milk prices will undoubtedly 
have an adverse effect on the farming 
community. However, the diversity of the 
Agriculture division, both operationally and 
geographically, the technical advances 
made by our high quality products such 
as AminoMax
®
, and our highly regarded 
customer service levels will help to mitigate 
some of this impact through this financial year.
The Food division is expecting to realise 
further efficiencies from the Kirkcaldy mill  
and will also benefit from some significant 
new business at the Silloth mill. 
Despite the very mild weather the current 
financial year has started in line with 
expectations, with a strong balance sheet  
and well invested assets, and with our 
continuing investment programme across the 
Group we remain well placed to capitalise on 
future opportunities. The Board will continue 
to look at how best to drive growth and 
achieve optimal returns for its shareholders 
via both organic and acquisitive growth, 
including expanding our geographic footprint.

LEADERSHIP PIPELINE 
We have increased our focus on 
succession planning and made good 
progress in planning the pipeline of 
talent to take the Group forward into 
the future.
Ensuring the appropriate HR 
infrastructure and leadership team are 
in place to support growth is a key 
priority and we are encouraging a more 
collaborative leadership approach 
across the Group businesses.
CHIRTON ENGINEERING
Building on the Group’s experience in 
Engineering 2014 saw the acquisition  
of Chirton Engineering Limited based 
in North Tyneside in the North East of 
England. Chirton is a manufacturer of 
precision engineering components, 
dealing particularly in the fields of 
offshore oil & gas manufacturing.
With many years’ experience in the 
business it has a wide customer base 
in a diverse range of fields including 
IHC Merwede, Oceaneering, and 
Proserv Offshore.
Recently Chirton expanded into 
component manufacturing for high-end 
motor manufacturers such as McLaren 
as part of a strategy of collaborative 
innovation with its core customer base.
Strong underlying values drive everything we do and underpin 
the culture in all of our businesses that encourages an 
approach to doing business ‘the Carr’s way’.
strengthened approach to HR across all the 
Group in the UK and internationally. We aim to 
offer opportunities for people across the Group 
to achieve their full potential from apprentices 
to senior management.
We can only succeed if everybody works as a 
team from the senior management down, and 
collaboration and trust is encouraged at all levels.
Our priority is now to develop our approach 
to leadership development and to roll-out a  10

In order to achieve this we have built on the 
investment made throughout 2013, and over 
the last 12 months our investment programme 
has continued across our three divisions. 
Our strategy has four key drivers: outstanding 
people who will shape our business over the 
next five to ten years; innovative products and 
services; acquisitions accelerating our growth; 
and continued investment in assets to sustain 
a long term competitive advantage. These 
elements lie at the heart of all our divisional 
objectives. Whilst we are tremendously proud 
of the record results we have delivered again

The geographic spread and operational 
diversity of our Agriculture businesses led  
to another successful year for our Agriculture 
Division.  
In the UK the winter weather was mild and 
wet, compared to the extremely cold and long 
winter of 2012/2013. While this was a relief 
for our farming customers, who were able to 
feed good quality home grown forage and 
reduce costs of production, it had an adverse 
impact on sales of compound/blended feed, 
feed blocks and fuel. However, one of our 
key strengths is our geographic diversity, and 
sales of feed blocks in the USA increased as a 
result of one of the coldest winters on record. 
In addition, livestock farmers were in a position 
where bought in feed and supplementary 
feeding regimes were vital to maintain livestock 
performance. The higher rainfall levels in the 
South East, Mid-West and North West of the 
USA ended the drought for the first time in 
several years, however, California and parts of 
Nevada remain in severe drought. The slow, 
but important process of rebuilding livestock 
numbers in these areas has started and will 
benefit our USA block business in future years.

geographic expansion and developing new

Retail sales increased 0.5% over the previous

of investment in our Country Stores and our 
ability to source and supply products which 
provide outstanding value for our customers. 
T otal sales of feed fell 10.5%, predominantly 
to the beef and sheep farmers, following 
the mild winter conditions and the improved 
quality of home grown forage. 
We are cognisant of the volatile weather 
and pricing dynamics which agriculture is 
exposed to, but our broad based, strong 
and diverse division provides us with the 
opportunity to navigate a successful path 
through those uncertainties. We will continue 
to invest in research and development to 
bring new products, systems and techniques 
to market which will improve the profitability

In April 2014 we acquired Chirton Engineering

based in North T yneside, which recorded 
sales of £5.0 million in its full financial year 
ended 30 August 2014. Chirton provides 
value-added manufacturing and services to 
businesses operating in offshore oil and gas 
manufacturing. It services an established 
global customer base, including IHC Merwede, 
Oceaneering, and Proserv Offshore. Revenue 
synergies with Bendalls, our specialist 
fabrication business based in Carlisle, are 
anticipated, enabling us to provide a full service 
offering to our customers from design and 
precision machining, through to fabrication.
Bendalls has commenced production of  
33 pressure vessels for the BP Shah Deniz gas 
pipeline in Azerbaijan; this is an increase from 
the 27 pressure vessels previously reported. 
The value of the contract is now in excess of 
£8 million and is scheduled to complete in 
July 2015. The start date for the manufacture 
of these pressure vessels was delayed due 
to design and specification changes and 
this adversely impacted the performance 
of Bendalls in the year. It is expected that

Risk Management
Effective risk management underpins the 
delivery of the Group’s strategy and objectives.
The Board is ultimately responsible for the Group’s risk management. The risk management 
process involves the identification and prioritisation of key risks, together with associated 
controls and plans for mitigation, which are then reported to the Board.
Further details of the risk management process are on page 24 and the key risks and uncertainties identified as part of this process, together with 
some of the mitigating actions that we are taking, are listed below.
It is not possible to identify or anticipate every risk that may affect the Group. Our overall success depends, in part, upon our ability to succeed  
in different economic, social and political environments and to manage and to mitigate these risks.

Safety,
failure to act 
safely and to 
maintain the safe 
and continuous 
operation of our 
facilities
The safety of our employees, contractors, suppliers, 
and the communities in which we operate is 
paramount. We must operate within local laws, 
regulations, rules and ordinances relating to health, 
safety and the environment, including emissions. 
The operation of plants involves many risks, which 
could cause a temporary or permanent stoppage in 
production and could have a material adverse effect 
on the Group.
• Health and safety policies and procedures at all 
facilities with dedicated staff to ensure they are 
embedded and measured;
• Business continuity capabilities in place to enable 
supply, as quickly as practicable, of product to 
customers from alternative sources in the event of a 
natural disaster or major equipment or plant failure;
• Maintain suitable insurance programme against 
customary risks. 
Failure to attract, 
develop and retain 
key personnel
Performance, knowledge and skills of employees 
are central to success. We must attract, integrate 
and retain the talent required to fulfil our strategy 
and growth. Inability to retain key knowledge and 
adequately plan for succession could have a negative 
impact on the Group’s performance.
• Remuneration policies designed to attract, retain 
and reward employees with ability and experience 
to execute Group strategy;
• Succession planning takes place at management 
and Board level;
• Management review to ensure the workforce has 
the capability to progress with the business.
Non-compliance 
with legislation and 
regulation
The Group operates in diverse markets and therefore 
is exposed to a range of legislation and regulation, 
which are constantly changing. We must comply with 
and understand all regulation and legislation, and 
be able to make correct interpretations across our 
diverse business. Any breach could have a financial 
impact and damage our reputation.
• In-house Counsel provides immediate legal 
knowledge and understanding to the Board and 
management;
• Legal advisers assist with monitoring external 
changes in legislation and advise accordingly,  
and the Group maintains compliance policies in 
areas such as antitrust, money laundering and 
bribery laws;
• Local legal advisers are used in overseas territories 
to ensure compliance with all local legislation. 15

Commodity costs Margins may be affected by fluctuations in crop 
prices due to factors such as harvest and weather 
conditions, crop disease, crop yields, alternative 
crops and by-product values. 
In some cases, due to the basis for pricing in sales 
contracts, or due to competitive markets, we may not 
be able to pass on to customers the full amount of 
raw material price increases or higher energy, freight 
or other operating costs.
• Strategic long term relationships with suppliers;
• Multiple-source suppliers for key ingredient 
supplies;
• Raw material and forward energy purchasing 
policies to provide security of supply and cost;
• Derivatives used where most beneficial to hedge 
exposure to movements in future prices of 
commodities;
• Contract execution is closely monitored to ensure 
supply is within agreed terms.
Failure to protect 
intellectual 
property
Our commercial success depends, in part, on 
obtaining and maintaining trademark and patent 
protection on certain products and technology.  
We must successfully defend trademarks and  
patents against third-party challenges or 
infringements.
• In-house Counsel is supported by expert 
intellectual property lawyers in multiple jurisdictions;
• Organised and secure process for identifying and 
recording innovations, trade secrets and potential 
patentable ideas.
Competitor activity The Group trades in highly competitive markets which 
tend to operate without long-term contracts. Product 
innovation and changing consumer trends provide a 
constant challenge to the future success of the Group 
and its ability to compete effectively.
• The Group manages the risk of operating in a 
competitive sector by developing and maintaining 
strong customer relationships. This process is 
supported by delivering high levels of service and 
quality, and by the continued focus on product 
development and technical innovation.
Brand and 
reputation
Not meeting the required service levels, especially 
where the business is heavily reliant on a particular 
customer, and/or falling behind on emerging trends 
could have a negative impact on performance and 
reputation. Brand awareness and market positioning 
require constant monitoring as a loss of market could 
have a detrimental impact on the financial position of 
the Group.
• Management work closely with customers to 
identify emerging trends;
• Area account managers in place for major 
customers.
Failure to maintain 
an effective system 
of internal financial 
controls
Without effective internal financial controls, we could 
be exposed to financial irregularities and losses from 
acts which could have a significant impact on the 
ability of the business to operate. We must safeguard 
business assets and ensure accuracy and reliability of 
records and financial reporting.
• Authorisation policies ensure that key tasks are 
segregated to safeguard assets;
• Detailed internal finance and capital expenditure 
policies set out procedures;
• Group financial performance monitored with 
monthly Board reports and regular forecasting;
• Chief Executive and Group Finance Director 
undertake detailed business and financial reviews. 16

Financial Review
REvENuE
Reported revenues were £429.0 million,  
8.4% behind last year (2013: £468.1 million). 
Revenues have fallen primarily as a result of 
lower raw material prices, which because 
of the nature of some of our contracts can 
directly affect sales values. Additionally, as 
reported last year, non-recurring weather 
patterns contributed to additional revenues 
in FY13 which were not repeated. There were 
also some large contracts in the Engineering 
division in FY13 which were not repeated.
OpERAtiNG pROFit
Group operating profit of £15.4 million is up 
15.7% on last year (2013: £13.3 million). As 
a percentage of revenues, Group operating 
margin is 3.6% compared to 2.8% in 2013. 
ShARE OF Jvs AND ASSOCiAtES
The Group’s share of the post-tax result in its 
associate and joint ventures was £2.5 million, 
compared to £2.8 million in 2013. The result 
reflected a decline in its associate’s profitability, 
primarily due to the weather impact in the prior 
year, and also further improved performances 
in overseas feed block and feed supplement 
joint ventures.
FiNANCE COStS
Net finance costs of £1.4 million (2013:  
£0.8 million) were significantly higher than the 
previous year. This reflected higher average 
borrowings during the year as a result of the 
EARNiNGS pER ShARE
The profit attributable to the equity holders  
of the Company amounted to £11.4 million 
(2013: £11.0 million), and basic earnings  
per share was 127.8p, an increase of 3.1% 
(2013: 123.9p).
Adjusted earnings per share of 130.8p  
(2013: 123.9p) is calculated by dividing 
the profit attributable to equity holders for 
the period, before non-recurring items and 
amortisation of intangible assets, by the 
weighted average number of shares in issue 
during the period. 
ACquiSitiONS
On 8 April 2014 the Group acquired 100% of 
the issued share capital of Chirton Engineering

£5.3 million. An initial amount of £2.8 million 
was paid upfront, with a further amount of £0.1 
million being paid on finalisation of acquired 
net assets, and the remaining £2.4 million will 
be paid out over a maximum 5 year period on 
achievement of EBITDA growth targets.
On 27 July 2014 the group acquired the  
entire share capital of B.E. Williams Limited,  
a supplier and haulier of agricultural feed,  
for a cash consideration of £1.1 million.
CASh FLOW AND NEt DEBt
Our net debt has increased over the year, 
reflecting the significant capital investment 
programme that began in 2012 and our 
acquisition activity over the financial year.
A free cash flow of £11.1 million was generated 
in the period, representing an increase of 510% 
on the previous year (2013: £1.8 million). 
During the year the Group completed its 
refinancing ahead of schedule with both of its 
primary finance providers, Clydesdale Bank 
and RBS. RBS principally provides working 
capital facilities to the Agriculture business, 
and these were renewed on improved terms for 
a 5 year period. Clydesdale Bank provides the 
remainder of the Group’s primary facilities, and 
these were also renewed on improved terms 
for a five year period.
Headroom against existing facilities was  
£17.4 million at the year end. Other than the 
Group’s overdraft, which is renewable annually, 
the majority of the Group’s existing facilities are 
due for renewal in July 2019.

Revenues are monitored by the Board, although because 
of the nature of our businesses it is not, by itself, an 
indicator of growth. Our volume driven businesses are 
all subject to significant raw material price variations, the 
majority of which are passed through to selling prices. 
Hence, falling raw material prices are expected to lead 
to falling revenues. Additionally, non-recurring weather 
related sales from FY13 have not been repeated this year.

Gross margin is a reflection on how successfully we  
have managed raw material price volatility in our markets, 
together with how successful we have been in pricing  
in other areas of our business in competitive markets.  
Our gross margin grew to 11.7% in the current year, which 
highlights how we have been able to manage input price 
volatility.

The underlying Group operating margin reflects the gross

indicates the efficiency of our operations from both an 
administrative and distribution perspective. The growth  
in margin to 3.6% relates to both of these aspects.

This KPI indicates how much cash is available for the 
Group to utilise for expansionary capital investment, paying 
dividends, or financing/repaying borrowings. The majority 
of the growth in FY14 is explained by the fact that working 
capital did not increase by the same amount as in the 
previous years, where there was a significant net cash 
outflow in respect of weather related demand.

Return on net assets fell this year, however this emphasises

have been 17.3%.

Corporate Responsibility
Our corporate responsibility commitment
Carr’s recognises the ever-increasing importance of its ethical responsibilities to all its 
stakeholders and remains committed to all aspects of corporate social responsibility.  
Corporate social responsibility brings benefits to stakeholders and the Group, helping  
to shape future sustainable growth and development.
pEOpLE
People are fundamental to every business and 
Carr’s is very fortunate to have a dedicated, 
loyal, and enthusiastic workforce.
People management and development is 
crucial for the Group and a Group Head of 
Human Resources Manager was appointed 
during the year to ensure that not only are the 
values of the Group retained but also to ensure 
Carr’s vision for the future can be realised with 
a talented workforce.
With the help of Human Resources a strategy 
has been formed to ensure the attraction and 
retention of talented individuals who have 
key core skills and will aid the achievement of 
the long-term business goals and objectives. 
Through this the Group will enhance its 
performance.
Carr’s is continuously reviewing its 
development and succession needs, to ensure 
that the right people are available to meet the 
ever changing demands of the business.
Diversity and equality are exceptionally 
important, and Carr’s continues to be fully 
committed to treating all employees with 
dignity and respect. The Group is committed  
to providing a working environment that:
• is consistent and fair;
• is free from discrimination;
• aids development and skills;
• supports employee engagement.
The Group employees 1,056 people. The split  
of employees is as follows:
T otal employees male & female 
  
 816 Male
 240 Female
Senior Managers & Executives male & female 
  
 14 Male
 4 Female
hEALth & SAFEt Y
Carr’s is committed to maintaining high 
standards of health and safety for all its 
employees, customers, suppliers, contractors 
and visitors. Health and safety is reviewed 
regularly at Board level, including discussion 
of accidents, claims and health and safety 
developments and initiatives. There is an 
ongoing programme of improvements which  
is also endorsed by the Board. 
This year the Group ran an IOSH Managing 
Safety training programme for key staff across 
all UK businesses, which was well attended 
and is being repeated in the next financial 
year. The Group Risk Manager continuously 
monitors health and safety performance 
together with developments in legislation 
and best practice alongside the needs of our 
business, to ensure that across all the Group’s 
locations the health and safety management 
is of a high standard and a culture of safety is 
adopted by all employees. Notwithstanding 
this work, unfortunately there has been 
an increase in the overall total number of 
accidents in the UK to 48 from 30 in 2013.  
This increase is in part attributable to an 
increase in the number of minor injuries; 
additional training programmes have now been 
put in place. However, the number of days 
lost as a result of RIDDOR reportable injuries 
decreased 35% from 254 in 2013 to 166 this 
year, despite the number of RIDDOR reportable 
injuries increasing to 7 from 4 in 2013.
Whilst the Board is obviously disappointed  
that the number of accidents has increased 
this year, the overall trend over the last six 
years has been one of accident reduction 
despite the expansion of the business, and it is 
confident that the safety improvement plan for 
the next financial year will have positive results.

During 2013/14 the Group commissioned 
an independent Group wide energy survey 
to identify potential improvements in energy 
efficiencies and renewable and sustainable 
opportunities for future investment (Energy 
Intelligent Solutions Programme).
The Group has now appointed a senior 
manager who reports directly to the Executive 
Board and is responsible for the co-ordination 
of environmental improvement initiatives 
throughout all subsidiary companies.
All Group subsidiaries continue to report 
monthly energy consumption data relative 
to monthly production volumes and against 
annual improvement targets for energy and 
carbon reduction.
Further expansion of data measuring and 
monitoring systems is to be introduced during 
2014/15 to encompass water usage, waste 
streams and transport fuel usage. Several of 
the agriculture Country Stores converted from 
fossil fuel heating systems to biomass fuelled 
heat during 2013/14.
CARBON FOOtpRiNt 
Carr’s subsidiaries have been registered in  
the UK Climate Reduction Scheme Phase 1 
since 2010 and report annually on energy 
performance and carbon generation. The larger 
subsidiary sites of the flour mills and Caltech 
are operated under the UK Climate Change 
Agreement and report annually each location’s 
energy performance and carbon generation to 
the Environment Agency.
The annual Group carbon (CO

 for the Group.
The Group will be exempted from the CRC 
Scheme 2 in accordance with the scheme 
guidelines for participation.

2013/14 – 31,020,120 Kwh 
• Annual Group Gas Consumption for 2013/14 
– 9,810,591 Kwh 
• Year on year reduction of 0.7% for primary 
energy consumption
• Target reduction of 5% set for 2014/15.
Energy prices continue to rise with a forecast 
increase of 2% for the period 2014/15 for 
both electricity and gas. A long term contract 
was negotiated for the period 2014-2017 for 
the large consuming sites of Caltech and the 
flour mills. A pilot scheme for an automatic 
monitoring and targeting system is to be 
implemented during 2014/15 for the flour mills 
at Silloth and Kirkcaldy.

FutuRE tARGEtS
The Group is pleased to report no breaches 
of environmental legislation and the large 
manufacturing sites continue to operate 
within the requirements set by the Pollution 
Prevention Control Permits held. Each site 
operates within the framework of a full 
Environmental Management System.
Key performance targets have been set for a 
reduction in waste and water usage during the 
period 2014/15. Waste recycling targets will 
be set for all sites during 2014/15. Further data 
collection and monitoring procedures are to 
be introduced during 2014/15 to encompass 
transport fuel utilisation and set improvement 
targets. 
A number of energy reduction opportunities 
have been identified from the independent 
Energy and Sustainability survey carried out 
during 2014 and these are currently under 
review. The Group remains positive about future 
opportunities and progress in sustainability. 
COmmuNit Y
Interacting with and supporting the 
communities in which we operate continues 
to be important to the Group. Support takes 
many forms, from donations and sponsorship 
to volunteering and mentoring.
Our employees take part in a variety of 
community interactions as well as the Group’s 
involvement in a variety of charities and 
sponsorships.
The Group and the BBSRC (Biotechnology 
and Bioscience Research Council) are jointly 
funding a four year PhD Scholar at Lancaster 
University. The PhD student is researching 
wheat root systems so as to be able to identify 
wheat varieties which are better suited to 
drought conditions.
Charitable donations and sponsorships were 
in excess of £90,000 this year, and include 
involvement with a variety of community 
charities and projects varying from sporting 
clubs to North Air Ambulance and local 
hospices.
We maintain our relationship with Carlisle Y outh 
Zone, which serves the social, recreational, and 
emotional needs of young people in the area.
We believe that the projects we sponsor target 
local needs and deliver the most positive 
impact, and ensure that our community work 
reflects our broader responsibilities as a Group.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Corporate Governance Report
ChAiRmAN’S OvER viEW
I value the openness, mutual respect and trust 
of the Board. It is through this, coupled with the 
expertise, range of perspectives and probative 
questioning that the Board is able to assess 
future opportunities, anticipate risks and build 
a sustainable business.
Carr’s approach to governance is outlined in 
the following report, which describes how it 
integrates the main principles of the 2012 UK 
Corporate Governance Code.
The corporate governance of the Company is 
continuously being reviewed as the Company 
develops, to ensure that the stakeholders’ 
interests are always aligned with the Company.
CHRIS HOLMES
Chairman
12 November 2014
Statement by the Directors on compliance 
with the provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2012.
uK CORpORAtE GO vERNANCE CODE
The UK Corporate Governance Code dated 
September 2012 (The Code) issued by the 
Financial Reporting Council is applicable to 
listed companies, and sets out standards of 
good practice in relation to issues such as:
• Board composition and effectiveness;
• the role of Board committees;
• risk management;
• remuneration;
• relationships with shareholders.
We are required to state how we have applied 
the principles contained in the Code and 
The Company is aware of its ongoing 
corporate governance obligations and is 
undertaking a recruitment process to appoint 
a new independent Non-Executive Director 
to commence in the forthcoming financial 
year. It is anticipated that a newly appointed 
Non-Executive Director will have relevant 
financial experience, which will ensure future 
compliance with C.3.1.
thE BOARD
The Directors have a collective duty to promote 
the long term success of the Company for its 
shareholders. In determining long-term strategy 
and objectives of the Group, the Board is 
mindful of its duties and responsibilities to 
shareholders as well as employees and other 
stakeholders. The Board reviews management 
and financial performance and monitors 
strategic delivery and achievement of business 
objectives, resulting in promoting the vision of 
the Group.
The powers of the Directors are set out in the 
Company’s Articles of Association. In addition, 
the Directors have responsibilities and duties 
under legislation, in particular the Companies 
Act 2006.
During the year ended 30 August 2014, the 
Board consisted of two Executive Directors,  
a Chairman and two Non-Executive Directors. 
There is a Company Secretary to the Board. 
The biographies of the Board can be found  
on page 19.
The Board met ten times throughout the 
year. In addition to the regular scheduled 
meetings throughout the year, unscheduled 
supplementary meetings may also take place 
as and when necessary, although during this 
financial year there was no reason to hold 
an unscheduled meeting. Directors who are 
unable to attend a particular meeting receive 
relevant briefing papers and are given the 
opportunity to discuss any issues with  
the Chairman, the Chief Executive or the 
disclose whether we have complied with the 
provisions of the Code during the year.
The Board consider that the Company has, 
during the year ended 30 August 2014, 
complied with the requirements of the Code 
other than with the following:
• B.1.1. Chris Holmes was the Chief Executive 
Offer and proceeded immediately to 
Chairman and therefore does not meet 
the independence criteria for a Chairman. 
However, the Group believed that the 
substantial in-depth knowledge of Chris 
Holmes was invaluable to the business and 
it was therefore in the best interests of the 
shareholders for him to have a continuing 
role with the Group. Clear division of 
responsibilities with the Chief Executive 
ensure there is no conflict, as set out on 
pages 23 and 24.
• B.1.1. The Board considers Robert Heygate 
as independent, notwithstanding his 
longstanding position on the Board and his 
substantial shareholding. Robert Heygate 
has a wealth of knowledge in the flour milling 
industry which the Board values, and despite 
being a Non-Executive Director for 23 years, 
he has always continued to question with 
the impartiality expected of a Non-Executive 
Director. In addition, his shareholding aligns 
his interests with the other shareholders. 
• B.2.1, B.2.2, B.2.4. A nominations 
committee was not created within the 
financial year to 30 August 2014, however 
it has now been formed and its terms of 
reference are available on the Company’s 
website www.carrs-milling.com.
• C.3.1. For the financial year to 30 August 
2014 there was no member of the 
Audit Committee with relevant financial 
experience, however the Board believes the  
Committee’s collective business experience 
and knowledge is sufficient to discharge the 
Committee’s obligations. 
CHRIS HOLMES
CHAIRMAN
The Board and I are committed to the highest 
standards of corporate governance, which 
I believe are critical to business integrity, 
performance and reputation both within  
the market and with shareholders. 23

approve his continued membership of the 
Board. In addition, Alistair Wannop will become 
non-independent this year through his long 
service on the Board and therefore will stand 
annually for re-election. 
Attendance & Agenda
In advance of all Board meetings the Directors 
are supplied with detailed and comprehensive 
papers covering the Group’s strategy and 
operations. Members of the executive 
management team can attend and make 
presentations as appropriate at meetings of the 
Board. The Company Secretary is responsible 
to the Board for the timeliness and quality of 
information.
Details of the number of meetings of, and 
members’ attendance at, the Board, Audit and 
Remuneration Committees during the period 
are set out in the table above.
Support 
Directors can obtain independent professional 
advice at the Company’s expense in 
performance of their duties as Directors. 
None of the Directors obtained independent 
professional advice in the period under review. 
All Directors have access to the advice and the 
services of the Company Secretary. In addition 
to these formal roles, the Non-Executive 
Directors have access to senior management 
of the business either by telephone or via 
involvement at informal meetings.
DiRECt ORS’ CONFLiCtS OF iNtERES t
The Companies Act 2006 and the Company’s 
Articles of Association require the Board to 
consider any potential conflicts of interest. 
The Board has a policy and procedures for 
managing and, where appropriate, authorising 
actual or potential conflicts of interest. Under 
those procedures, directors are required to 
declare all directorships or other appointments 
to organisations that are not part of the Group 
and which could result in actual or potential 
conflicts of interest, as well as other situations 
which could result in a potential conflict of 
interest. 
The Board is required to review Directors’ 
actual or potential conflicts of interest at least 
annually. Directors are required to disclose 
proposed new appointments to the Chairman 
• providing a sounding board for the Chief 
Executive on key business decisions and 
challenging proposals where appropriate.
The Chief Executive was responsible for:
• the day-to-day management of the Group’s 
business;
• leading the business and the rest of the 
management team in accordance with the 
strategy agreed by the Board; 
• leading the development of the Group’s 
strategy with input from the rest of the 
Board; 
• leading the management team in the 
implementation of the Group’s strategy; 
• bringing matters of particular significance 
to the Chairman for discussion and 
consideration by the Board if appropriate.
Elections
The Company’s Articles of Association provide 
that one third of the Directors retire by rotation 
each year at the Annual General Meeting which 
is in compliance with the Code. As a result of 
Robert Heygate’s long association with the 
Company the Board have decided that it would 
be appropriate to require him to retire annually 
to ensure that the shareholders are able to 
Group Finance Director, however, during this 
year all Directors were able to attend all Board 
meetings.
T o enable the Directors of the Board to carry 
out their responsibilities all Directors have full 
and timely access to all relevant information. 
The Board has a schedule of matters for its 
discussion, which is reviewed against best 
practice. A summary is shown below and a 
full schedule is available on the Company’s 
website. 
The Board is responsible for:
• the Group’s strategy;
• acquisitions and divestment policy;
• corporate governance, risk and environment 
policy and management;
• approval of budgets;
• general treasury policy;
• major capital expenditure projects;
• dividend policy;
• monitoring the Group’s profit and cash flow 
performance.
The Board has delegated authority to the Audit 
and Remuneration Committees to carry out 
certain tasks as defined in their written terms 
of reference approved by the Board; these are 
also available on the Company website. 
The UK Corporate Governance Code stipulates 
that there should be a clear division of 
responsibility between the running of the Board 
and executive responsibilities for running the 
company.
The Chairman was responsible for:
• setting the Board agenda;
• the leadership of the Board and ensuring its 
effectiveness on all aspects of its role;

will review the need for externally facilitated 
evaluation next year.
Independent Audit Ltd has no other relationship

The Chairman appraised the individual 
performance of the Directors and the Non-

of the Chairman.
BOARD COmmittEES
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee’s key function is to 
review the effectiveness of the Company’s 
financial reporting and performance of the 
external auditor.
The Audit Committee currently comprises 
the three Non-Executive Directors, Robert 
Heygate (Chairman), Chris Holmes and 
Alistair Wannop. The Board considers that the 
Committee meets the main requirements of the 
Code for a company of Carr’s size. The work, 
responsibilities and governance of the Audit 
Committee are set out on pages 25 to 26.  
The Chair of the Audit Committee will 
be available at the AGM to answer any 
shareholder questions on the Committee  
and its activities.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee currently 
comprises Alistair Wannop (Chairman),  
Chris Holmes and Robert Heygate. The 
work, responsibilities and governance of 
the Remuneration Committee are set out on 
pages 27 to 32. The Chair of the Committee 
will be available at the AGM to answer any 
shareholder questions on the Committee  
and its activities.
RELAtiONS With ShAREhOLDERS
The Board recognises and values the 
importance of good communications with all 
shareholders. The Group maintains dialogue 
with institutional shareholders and analysts, 
and hosts presentations on the preliminary  
and interim results. Shareholders have  
access to the Company’s website at  
www.carrs-milling.com.
We engage with our shareholders through our 
regular communications. Significant matters 
relating to trading or development of the 
business are disseminated to the market by 
responsibilities, authorities and reporting lines 
to the Board. The organisational structure 
has been designed in order to plan, execute, 
monitor and control the Group’s objectives 
effectively and to ensure that internal control 
becomes embedded in the operations. 
The Board confirms that the key on-going 
processes and features of the Group’s internal 
risk based control system, which accord 
with the Turnbull guidance, have been fully 
operative and up to the date of the Annual 
Report being approved. These include: a 
process to identify and evaluate business risk; 
a strong control environment; an information 
and communication process; a monitoring 
system and a regular Board review for 
effectiveness. The Group Finance Director is 
responsible for overseeing the Group’s internal 
controls. 
The Group’s internal controls systems cover 
controls over the financial reporting process, 
including monthly reporting from subsidiaries, 
its associate and joint ventures. This reporting 
is subject to detailed review by the Chief 
Executive and the Group Finance Director 
and detailed validation by the Group finance 
team, and forms the basis for information 
presented to and reviewed by the Board. 
All monthly reporting is prepared in line with 
Group accounting policies, which are reviewed 
annually and are also subject to review by the 
external auditors.
The Group does not have an internal audit 
function as the Board consider that the Group 
has not yet reached a size where a separate 
internal audit function would be an appropriate 
or cost effective method of ensuring 
compliance with Group policies, and therefore 
does not currently propose to introduce a 
Group internal audit function. This area will 
be kept under review as part of the Board’s 
assessment of the Group’s systems of internal 
control.
The management of the Group’s businesses 
identified the key business risks within 
their operations, considered the financial 
implications and assessed the effectiveness 
of the control processes in place to 
mitigate these risks. The Board reviewed 
a summary of the findings and this, along 
with direct involvement in the strategies of 
the businesses, investment appraisal and 
budgeting process, enabled the Board to 
report on the effectiveness of internal control. 
A summary of the key risks to the business  
is set out on pages 14 and 15.

announce our financial results on a six monthly 
basis with all shareholders receiving a half 
year report. In addition, we produce interim 
management statements. All reports and 
statements are made available on our website.
The Annual General Meeting provides all 
shareholders with the opportunity to develop 
further their understanding of the Company. 
It is the principal forum for all the Directors 
to engage in dialogue with private investors. 
All shareholders are given the opportunity to 
raise questions on any matter at the meeting. 
The Group aims to send notices of Annual 
General Meetings to shareholders at least 20 
working days before the meeting, as required 
by the Code, and it is the Company’s practice 
to indicate the proxy voting results on all 
resolutions at the meetings. Following the 
AGM the voting results for each resolution are 
published and are available on the Company’s 
website.
FAiR AND uNDERSt ANDABLE
The Directors have also reviewed the financial 
statements and taken as a whole consider 
them to be fair, balanced and understandable, 
and provide the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Company’s 
performance, business model and strategy.
GOiNG CONCERN
The Directors have prepared the accounts 
on a going concern basis, having satisfied 
themselves from a review of internal budgets 
and forecasts and current bank facilities that 
the Group has adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future.
ShARE SpLit
The Board have decided to put a resolution to 
the Shareholders at the AGM on 13 January 
2015 to split the Company’s shares 10 to 1. 
The Board believe this is in the best interests 
of the shareholders and would potentially 
increase the liquidity of the shares. Should  
the shareholders approve the resolution the 
record date would be 13 January 2015 and  
the subdivision of the shares would take place 
on 14 January 2015.
iNtERNAL CONtROL
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility 
for the Group’s systems of internal control 
and for reviewing its effectiveness, including: 
financial, operational and compliance controls 
and risk management, which safeguard the 
shareholders’ investment and the Group’s 
assets. Such a system can only provide 
reasonable and not absolute assurance against 
material misstatement or loss, as it is designed 
to manage rather than eliminate the risk of 
failure to achieve business objectives.
The Board of Directors is not aware of any 
significant losses caused by breaches of 
internal control in the period.

The purpose of this report is to highlight the 
areas that the Committee has reviewed during 
the year and how we have discharged our 
responsibilities effectively during the year.
KEY OBJECtivE
Our key objective is to provide effective 
governance over the appropriateness of the 
Group’s financial reporting and performance  
of the external auditor. 
RESpONSiBiLitiES
The Committee is responsible for monitoring 
the integrity of the financial statements and 
considering whether accounting policies 
adopted are appropriate. Under its terms of 
reference, the Committee is required, amongst 
other things, to:
• monitor the integrity of the financial 
statements of the Company; 
• review, understand and evaluate the 
Company’s internal financial risk, and 
other internal controls and their associated 
systems; 
• oversee the relationship with the external 
auditors, making recommendations to 
the Board in relation to their appointment, 
remuneration and terms of engagement; 
• monitor and review the external 
auditors’ independence, objectivity and 
effectiveness, and to approve the policy on 
the engagement of the external auditors to 
supply non-audit services.

performance, position and future prospects 
of the business, there could be inclusion of 
additional non-financial KPIs and these will be 
developed in the forthcoming financial year. 
In addition, the Committee is satisfied that all 
the key events and issues which have been 
reported to the Board in the CEO’s monthly 
report during the year, both good and bad, 
have been adequately referenced or reflected 
within the annual report.
ExtERNAL AuDit ORS
PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) and its 
predecessor firms have been the Auditor for 
Carr’s since the Company first listed on the 
London Stock Exchange in 1972. The Audit 
Committee assesses annually the qualification, 
expertise and independence of the auditors 
and the effectiveness of the audit process.
The Audit Committee is also responsible 
for recommendations for the appointment, 
re-appointment or removal of external 
auditors. Subject to the ongoing satisfactory 
performance of the external auditors, the 
Committee expects to carry out a tendering 
process for the 2019 year end following the 
conclusion of the five year term of the current 
audit partner.
The Audit Committee also approves the 
terms of engagement and remuneration 
of the external auditors and monitors their 
independence.
AuDit OR EFFECtivENESS
The effectiveness of the external audit  
process is dependent on appropriate audit 
risk identification at the start of the audit cycle. 
PwC present their detailed audit plan to us 
each year identifying their assessment of  
these key risks.

quality of the audit process and addressing 
The external auditors have the opportunity to 
access the Committee without the Executive 
Directors being present, at any time.
mAiN ACtivitiES DuRiNG thE YEAR
During the year the Audit Committee reviewed 
reports and information provided by both 
the external auditors and the Group Finance 
Director. The Committee has:
• reviewed the Committee’s terms of 
reference and its effectiveness;
• reviewed the reports from the finance team 
on the financial statements and considering 
matters such as the accounting judgements 
and policies being applied by management;
• reviewed the going concern assumption 
prior to making a recommendation to the 
board;
• reviewed the audit reports from PwC 
on the financial statements and tasking 
management to resolve any issues relating 
to internal controls and risk management 
systems;
• reviewed the independence, objectivity and 
fees of the external auditors and scope of 
audit and non-audit services.
FAiR, BALANCED & uNDERSt ANDABLE
The Committee, further to the Board’s request, 
has reviewed the annual report and financial 
statements with the intention of providing 
advice to the Board on whether, as required 
by the Code, ‘the annual report and accounts, 
taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s performance, business model  
and strategy’.
T o make this assessment, the Committee 
reviewed the KPIs included in the Strategic 
Report (see page 18) and concluded 
that, whilst they were appropriate for 
our shareholders’ understanding of the

these key risks is formed by, amongst other 
things, the reporting from the auditors and also 
seeking feedback from management on the 
audit process.
The Committee remain satisfied with PwC’s 
performance and is of the view that there is 
nothing of concern that would impact the 
effectiveness of the external audit process.
iNDEpENDENCE
The Group meets its obligations for maintaining 
an appropriate relationship with the external 
auditors through the Audit Committee, whose 
terms of reference include an obligation to 
consider and keep under review the degree 
of work undertaken by the external auditor 
other than the statutory audit, to ensure such 
objectivity and independence is safeguarded.
In accordance with the Auditing Practices 
Board Ethical Standards, PwC has to 
implement rules and requirements which 
include that none of their employees working 
on our audit can hold any shares in Carr’s.  
PwC is also required to tell us about any 
significant facts and matters that may 
reasonably be thought to bear on their 
independence or on the objectivity of the lead 
partner and the audit team. The lead partner in 
the audit team must change every five years.
The objective of the non-audit services policy 
is to ensure that the provision of such services 
does not impair, or is not perceived to impair, 
the external auditors’ independence or 
objectivity. The policy imposes guidance on the 
areas of work that the external auditors may 
be asked to undertake and those assignments 
where the external auditors should not 
be involved. There is a further category of 
services for which a case-by-case decision is 
necessary. Examples of the work that can and 
cannot be undertaken are given below.
Work for which the Group external auditors 
can be engaged without referral to the Audit 
Committee:
• regulatory and other specialist financial 
reporting;
• accountants’ reports for any Stock 
Exchange purposes;
• ad hoc reporting on historical financial 
information for any other purpose;
• accounting advisory services;
• accounting, forensic and control 
investigations.
disclosures on this matter and noted a full 
actuarial valuation will be performed of the 
scheme at 31 December 2014 in the coming 
period. More detail on this pension scheme 
is contained in Note 24 of the financial 
statements.
Receivable and inventory provisions
The Committee considered the key 
judgements required in applying provisioning 
to the receivable and inventory balances held 
in the Agriculture business. The Committee 
reviewed the consistency with prior periods 
of the provisioning methodology applied by 
management, assessing the impact of these 
judgements on the Group’s reported profit 
before tax. The Committee determined that  
the judgments made were appropriate to  
justify the working capital provision levels  
at 30 August 2014.
Revenue recognition
The Committee reviewed the key judgements 
on revenue recognition. Attention was given to 
contracts in the German Engineering business 
where stage of completion accounting and 
adjustments are required from local GAAP 
accounting to IFRS. Following their review, 
the Committee concluded that the revenue 
judgements made were appropriate.
ROBERT HEYGATE
Chairman of the Audit Committee
12 November 2014
Work from which the Group’s external auditors 
are excluded:
• selection, design or implementation of 
major financial systems;
• maintaining or preparing financial accounts;
• remuneration advice in respect of senior 
management;
• valuation services;
• any other services specifically prohibited 
by the UK or other relevant legislation or 
regulation.
For the 2014 financial year end, the non-audit 
to audit services ratio was 0.70:1. Note 3 on 
page 54 provides further detail on non-audit 
service fees.
T aking into account our findings in relation 
to the effectiveness of the audit process and 
in relation to the independence of PwC, the 
Committee is satisfied that PwC continues to 
be independent, and free from any conflicting 
interest with the Group. As a result, the 
Committee has recommended to the Board 
that PwC be proposed for reappointment at 
the forthcoming AGM in January 2015.
The Chairman of the Committee will be 
available at the Annual General Meeting to 
respond to any shareholder questions that 
might be raised on the Committee’s activities.
SiGNiFiCANt JuDGEmENtS AND iSSuES
An important responsibility of the Audit 
Committee is to review and agree the most 
significant management judgements and 
issues. T o satisfy this responsibility, the 
Committee request updates from the Group 
Finance Director throughout the period and 
requires interaction and reporting from the 
external auditors at each committee meeting. 
The Committee carefully considers the content 
of these reports in evaluating the significant 
issues and areas of judgement across the 
Group. 
The key areas of judgement in the year were 
as follows:

Remuneration Committee Report
iNtRODuCtiON
This report sets out the Group’s remuneration 
policy and details of remuneration paid to 
Executive and Non-Executive Directors during 
the year.
ROLE
The main role of the Remuneration Committee 
is to determine the remuneration for the 
Executive Directors, in agreement with 
the Board. The Committee is responsible 
for all aspects of the Executive Directors’ 
remuneration, including bonus and long term 
incentives, and makes recommendations 
regarding awarding long term incentives to 
senior management. It reviews the long term 
incentives to ensure they are aligned with the 
development of the Group and the business 
needs. The policy that has been adopted was 
created by taking into account the need to 
create shareholder value and therefore putting 
in place the appropriate incentives for the 
Executive Directors.
The Committee considered the following 
during the year:
• total remuneration and review of base pay 
for the Directors;
• annual earnings of the Directors;
• the LTIP for the Executive Directors and 
senior management.
The Remuneration Committee currently 
comprises Alistair Wannop (Chairman),  
Chris Holmes and Robert Heygate.  
Neil Austin attends meetings of the Committee 
by invitation and in an advisory capacity. 
REmuNERAtiON pOLiCY 
In this forward looking section we describe 
our remuneration policy for the Board. This 
includes considerations when determining 
policy, a description of the elements of the 
reward package, and an indication of the 
potential future value of this package for  
each Executive Director.
We will be seeking shareholder approval  
for our remuneration policy at the AGM in 
January 2015. There have been no changes 
to the policy during 2013/14, and we do not 
intend to make any changes over the next 
three years. However, we will review the policy 
each year to ensure it continues to support the 
Group’s strategy. 
CONSiDERAtiONS WhEN DEtERmiNiNG 
REmuNERAtiON pOLiCY
The Group’s policy is that the overall 
remuneration package offered should be 
sufficiently competitive to attract, retain 
and motivate high quality executives and to 
align the rewards of the Executive Directors 
with the progress of the Group, whilst giving 
consideration to salary levels in similar size 
quoted companies in similar industry sectors.
The remuneration package is split into  
two parts:
• a non-performance related element 
represented by basic salary (including 
benefits);
• a significant performance related element 
in the form of an annual profit related 
bonus and a Long Term Incentive Plan.
No Director attends any part of a meeting at 
which his own remuneration is discussed. 
The Chairman and the Executive Directors 
determine the remuneration of the other 
Non-Executive Directors. The remuneration 
of the Chairman is determined by the Board. 
The Committee has access to advice from the 
Company Secretary and to detailed analysis 
of executive remuneration in comparable 
companies. The Chair of the Committee 
will be available at the AGM to answer any 
shareholder questions on the Committee and 
its activities.
The Committee is authorised by the Board to:
• determine the total remuneration packages, 
authorise terms and conditions, and 
contracts for the Board;
• approve the design and determine the 
targets for performance related pay 
schemes of the Executive Directors;
• review the design of any share incentive 
plans for approval by the Board and 
shareholders.

pERFORmANCE mEASuRES AND t ARGEtS
Our Group strategy and business objectives are the primary consideration when we are selecting performance measures for incentive plans. 
Targets within incentive plans that are related to internal financial measures, such as profit, are typically determined based on our budgets.  
The threshold and maximum levels of performance are set to reflect minimum acceptable levels at threshold and very stretching but achievable 
levels at maximum.
At the end of each performance period we review performance against the targets, using judgement to account for items such as foreign exchange 
rate movements, changes in accounting treatment, and significant one-off transactions. The application of judgement is important to ensure that 
final assessments of performance are fair and appropriate.
In addition, the Remuneration Committee reviews the bonus and incentive plan results before any payments are made to Executive Directors or any 
shares vest and has full discretion to adjust the final payment or vesting downwards if they believe the circumstances warrant it.

ChAiRmAN AND NON-ExECutivE 
DiRECt ORS’ REmuNERAtiON
Our policy is for the Executive Directors to 
review the remuneration of Non-Executive 
Directors annually following consultation with 
the Chairman. Remuneration reflects:
• the time commitment and responsibility  
of their roles;
• market rate; 
• that they do not participate in any bonus, 
pension or share based scheme.
Non-Executive Directors are engaged on one 
year fixed-term letters of appointment that set 
out their duties and responsibilities.
ShAREhOLDiNG GuiDELiNES
The committee believes that it is important 
for a significant investment to be made by 
each Executive Director in the shares of 
the Company to provide alignment with 
shareholder interests. Executive Directors 
are encouraged to build up and retain a 
shareholding throughout their period of 
employment with the Company.
AppROACh t O RECRuitmENt 
REmuNERAtiON
The remuneration package for a new 
Executive Director would be set in accordance 
with the terms of the Company’s approved 
remuneration policy in force at the time of 
appointment.
BuY-Out AWARDS
In addition, the Committee may offer additional 
cash and/or share-based elements (on a one-
time basis or ongoing) when it considers these 
to be in the best interests of the Group (and 
therefore shareholders). Any such payments 
would be limited to a reasonable estimate  
of value of remuneration lost when leaving  
the former employer and would reflect 
the delivery mechanism (i.e. cash and/or 
share-based), time horizons and whether 
performance requirements are attached  
to that remuneration. 
mAximum LEvEL OF v ARiABLE pAY
The maximum initial level of long-term 
incentives which may be awarded to a new 
Executive Director will be limited to the 
maximum Long Term Incentive Plan limit of 
100 per cent of salary. Therefore the maximum 
initial level of overall variable pay that may  
be offered will be 200 per cent of salary  
(i.e. 100 per cent annual bonus plus 100 per 
cent Long Term Incentive Plan). These limits 
are in addition to the value of any buy-out 
arrangements which are governed by the 
policy above.
In the case of an internal appointment, any 
variable pay element awarded in respect of 
the prior role would be allowed to pay out 
according to its terms, adjusted as relevant to 
take into account the appointment. In addition, 
any other previously awarded entitlements 
would continue, and be disclosed in the next 
annual report on remuneration.
BASE SALARY AND RELOCAtiON 
ExpENSES
The Committee has the flexibility to set the 
salary of a new appointment at a discount 
to the market level initially, with a series of 
planned increases implemented over the 
following few years to bring the salary to 
the appropriate market position, subject to 
individual performance in the role. For external 
and internal appointments, the Committee 
may agree that the Group will meet certain 
relocation expenses as appropriate.
AppOiNtmENt OF NON-ExECutivE

For the appointment of a new Chairman or

would be set in accordance with the approved 
remuneration policy in force at that time.

2014 ANNuAL BONuS pAYOut
The annual bonus is payable based on adjusted profit before tax performance (PBT) of different parts of the Group, and an element payable based 
on total Group performance. If the Group target is achieved, regardless of individual divisional performance, then the maximum bonus is payable. 
Adjusted PBT is calculated as reported PBT after adding back or deducting any one-off items outside of normal trading that were not anticipated at 
the time the performance targets were set, such as acquisition related costs.
The targets are split between the different aspects of the Group as follows:
 Agriculture 20%
 Food 20%
 Engineering 20%
 Group 40%
In the 2014 financial year the adjusted PBT target for the Group was set at £16.75 million for maximum payout. An adjusted PBT of £16.88 million 
was achieved, therefore the maximum bonus was awarded.

monthly payments to reduce the Group’s 
pension fund deficit, totalling £2.3 million in

of the Company’s financing arrangements. 
The nominal value of ordinary shares which 
the Directors may allot in the period up to

which is equal to 33% of the nominal value 
of the issued share capital on 15 November 
2013. The Directors do not have any present 
intention of exercising this authority other than 
in connection with the issue of ordinary shares 
in respect of the Company’s share option

the scope of our audit and our areas  
of focus
We conducted our audit in accordance with 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”).
We designed our audit by determining 
materiality and assessing the risks of material 
misstatement in the financial statements. In 
particular, we looked at where the Directors

the greatest effect on our audit, including 
the allocation of our resources and effort,

areas. This is not a complete list of all risks

made subjective judgements, for example in 
respect of significant accounting estimates 
that involved making assumptions and 
considering future events that are inherently 
uncertain. As in all of our audits, we also 
addressed the risk of management override 
of internal controls, including evaluating 
whether there was evidence of bias by the 
Directors that may represent a risk of material 
misstatement due to fraud.  37

STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
AREA OF FOCuS hOW OuR AuDit ADDRESSED thE AREA OF FOCuS
Fraud risk in revenue recognition
Refer also to the significant judgements, key assumptions and estimates 
within the principal accounting policies.
ISAs (UK & Ireland) presume there is a risk of fraud in revenue 
recognition because of the pressure management may feel to achieve 
the planned results.
Our testing of revenue transactions focused on obtaining 
evidence to demonstrate a service had been provided or a 
sale had occurred. For the Agriculture and Food divisions this 
involved testing the operating effectiveness of controls around 
dispatches and invoicing as well as agreeing revenue to cash 
received. 
For the Engineering division we focused on the judgements 
required to account for long term contracts. This involved 
reading extracts of the related contracts in order to understand 
the nature of services provided and evaluating management’s 
assessment of the stage of completion of significant contracts. 
Defined benefit pension scheme surplus
Refer also to the significant judgements, key assumptions and estimates 
within the principal accounting policies and note 24.
The Group has a defined benefit pension scheme with post-retirement 
assets of £64.0 million and post-retirement liabilities of £61.9 million, 
which are significant in the context of the overall balance sheet of the 
Group.
The valuation of the pension scheme liabilities requires significant 
levels of judgement and technical expertise in choosing appropriate 
assumptions, a number of which may also have been impacted by the 
economic downturn. Unfavourable changes in a number of the key 
assumptions (including salary increases, inflation, discount rates, and 
mortality) can have a material impact on the calculation of the liability.
In addition, the recognition of the post-retirement plan surplus position 
for accounting purposes is dependent on the rights of the employers to 
recover any surplus.
We evaluated the assumptions made in relation to the valuations 
of the liabilities and assets in the pension scheme and compared 
the assumptions around salary increases and mortality rates to 
national and industry averages and guidance. 
We also focused on the valuations of pension plan liabilities and 
the pension assets as follows:
• We compared the discount and inflation rates used in the 
valuation of the pension liability to our internally developed 
benchmarks.
• We obtained third party confirmations on ownership and 
valuation of pension assets.
• We tested the census data back to the latest triennial 
valuation provided by the administrator.
• We checked that the Company is entitled to any surplus by 
reviewing the Trust Deed and Rules documentation.
Receivable and inventory provisions
Refer also to notes 17 and 18.
We focused on this area because inventory provisions include subjective 
estimates and are influenced by assumptions concerning the net 
realisable value of aged inventory. The Group also has material amounts 
of trade receivables that are past due and not impaired.
We focused in particular on the Agriculture division given the 
significance of this segment’s working capital balances to the Group 
balance sheet and the slower historic collection pattern in this division. 
The key associated risks were whether inventory is held at the lower 
of cost or net realisable value and the recoverability of past due trade 
receivables. Management’s related provisions are subjective and are 
influenced by assumptions concerning customer credit risk.
When observing inventory counting procedures at the period end 
we checked for damaged items and out of date retail goods. We 
then examined management’s analysis by category of inventory 
held at the period end, assessing the risk of diminution in value 
as well as the provisioning methods applied by management.
We tested the operating effectiveness of controls around 
approval of credit limits for customers and adherence to these 
limits. We examined individual aged receivable balances, 
understanding the rationale for management’s provisioning 
decisions by reference to payment patterns during the year. We 
also assessed the level of cash collected by the business after 
the period end on past due receivable balances to consider any 
additional provisioning requirements.
how we approached the audit scope
In identifying these areas of focus and in 
ensuring that we performed enough work to 
be able to give an opinion on the financial 
statements as a whole, we took into account: 
the geographic structure of the Group; the 
accounting processes and controls; and the 
industry in which the Group operates, and 
tailored the scope of our audit accordingly. 
The Group is structured in three business 
divisions, Agriculture, Food and Engineering. 
The Group financial statements are a 
consolidation of 16 reporting units, comprising 
the Group’s operating businesses within 
these business divisions as well as centralised 
functions. 
We identified six reporting units which in 
our view required an audit of their complete 
financial information, either due to their 
size, or their risk characteristics. Specific 
audit procedures on certain balances and 
transactions were performed on three further 
units due to specific risks associated with those 
units, to address certain material balances. 
These nine reporting units accounted for 91% 
of Group revenue and 79% of Group profit 
before tax. The Senior Statutory Auditor visited 
four of the six reporting units for which we 
audited their complete financial information, 
and attended via conference call the clearance 
meetings for the two other units which are 
audited by a PwC network firm and another 
firm operating under our instruction.
In establishing the overall approach to the 
Group audit, we determined the type of work 
that needed to be performed at the reporting 
units by us, as the Group engagement team, 
or component auditors within PwC UK and 
from other PwC network firms and other firms 
operating under our instruction. Where the work 
was performed by component auditors, we 
determined the level of involvement we needed 
to have in the audit work at those reporting 
units to be able to conclude whether sufficient 
appropriate audit evidence had been obtained

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Independent Auditors’ Report to the Members of Carr’s Milling Industries PLC continued
materiality
The scope of our audit is influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together with 
qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate 
the effect of misstatements, both individually and on the financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Overall Group materiality £830,000
How we determined it 5% of profit before tax 
Rationale for benchmark applied We have applied this benchmark, a generally accepted auditing practice, in the absence of    
 indicators that an alternative benchmark would be appropriate.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £42,000 as well as 
misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the Directors’ statement, set out on page 24, in relation to going concern. We have nothing to 
report having performed our review.
As noted in the Directors’ statement, the Directors have concluded that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements using the going concern 
basis of accounting. The going concern basis presumes that the Group has adequate resources to remain in operation, and that the Directors 
intend it to do so, for at least one year from the date the financial statements were signed. As part of our audit we have concluded that the 
Directors’ use of the going concern basis is appropriate.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the Group’s ability to continue 
as a going concern.

Our responsibilities and those of the 
Directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ 
Responsibilities Statement set out on pages 
34 and 35, the Directors are responsible for 
the preparation of the financial statements and  
for being satisfied that they give a true and  
fair view.
We primarily focus our work in these areas 
by assessing the Directors’ judgements 
against available evidence, forming our own 
judgements, and evaluating the disclosures  
in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using 
sampling and other auditing techniques,  
to the extent we consider necessary to provide  
a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. 
We obtain audit evidence through testing 
the effectiveness of controls, substantive 
procedures or a combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and 
non-financial information in the Annual Report 
to identify material inconsistencies with the 
audited financial statements and to identify 
any information that is apparently materially 
incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent 
with, the knowledge acquired by us in the 
course of performing the audit. If we become 
aware of any apparent material misstatements 
or inconsistencies we consider the implications 
for our report.

Our responsibility is to audit and express 
an opinion on the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and ISAs 
(UK & Ireland). Those standards require us to 
comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s 
Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been 
prepared for and only for the Company’s 
members as a body in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006 and for no other purpose. We do not,

What an audit of financial statements 
involves
An audit involves obtaining evidence about 
the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are 
free from material misstatement, whether 
caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: 
• whether the accounting policies are 
appropriate to the Group’s circumstances 
and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; 
• the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the 
Directors;  
• the overall presentation of the financial 
statements.  40

The equity compensation reserve reflects the cumulative accounting impact, at the balance sheet date, of the fair value of the share schemes over 
the vesting periods. The movement on the equity compensation reserve is taken through the consolidated income statement. During the period 
£55,000 (2013: £9,000) was transferred from the equity compensation reserve to retained earnings in respect of the cumulative accounting impact 
on options exercised in the period.
The Group has opted to use previous revaluations of property made under UK GAAP as deemed cost. On adoption of IFRS the revaluation reserve  
was reclassified to other reserves.

CARR’S MILLING INDUSTRIES PLC
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Principal Accounting Policies
Basis of accounting
The consolidated financial statements are prepared on a going 
concern basis in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) and IFRIC interpretations endorsed by the European 
Union (EU) and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable 
to companies reporting under IFRS.
The Company is a public limited company incorporated and  
domiciled in England and Wales whose shares are listed and traded  
on the London Stock Exchange. The address of its registered office  
is Old Croft, Stanwix, Carlisle, CA3 9BA.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally 
accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of 
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Although these 
estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of the amount, 
event or actions, actual results ultimately may differ materially from the 
estimates.
Accounting policies have been applied consistently, other than where 
new policies have been adopted.
The consolidated financial statements are prepared under the historic 
cost convention as modified by the revaluation of financial assets and 
financial liabilities (including derivative financial instruments) at fair 
value through profit or loss.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements comprise Carr’s Milling 
Industries PLC and all its subsidiaries, together with the Group’s 
share of the results of its associate and joint ventures. The financial 
information of the subsidiaries, associate and joint ventures is  
prepared as of the same reporting date and consolidated using 
consistent accounting policies. Group inter-company balances and 
transactions, including any unrealised profits arising from Group inter-
company transactions, are eliminated in full. Profits and losses on 
transactions with the associate and joint ventures are recognised  
in the consolidated income statement.
Results of subsidiary undertakings acquired during the current and 
prior financial period were included in the financial statements from  
the effective date of control. The separable net assets, both tangible 
and intangible, of the acquired subsidiary undertakings were 
incorporated into the financial statements on the basis of the fair  
value as at the effective date of the Group acquiring control.
Subsidiaries are entities where the Group has the power to govern the 
financial and operating policies, generally accompanied by a share of 
more than 50% of the voting rights. Subsidiaries are consolidated from 
the date on which control is transferred to the Group and are included 
until the date on which the Group ceases to control them. 
Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence 
but not control, generally accompanied by a share of between 20% 
and 50% of the voting rights. Joint ventures are entities over which 
the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement. 
Investments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using 
the equity method. The Group’s share of its associate and joint 
ventures’ post-tax profits or losses are recognised in the income 
statement, and its share of movement in reserves is recognised in 
reserves. The cumulative movements are adjusted against the carrying 
amount of the investment. The Group’s investment in associate and 
joint ventures includes any goodwill arising on acquisition. If the 
Group’s share of losses in an associate or joint venture equals or 
exceeds its investment in the associate or joint venture, the Group 
does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations  
or made payments on behalf of the associate or joint venture. 
All subsidiaries are accounted for by applying the purchase method.  
The cost of a business combination is measured as the aggregate of 
the fair values, at the acquisition date, of the assets given, liabilities 
incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group.  
The identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the 
acquiree are measured initially at fair value at the acquisition date, 
irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling interest. The excess 
of the cost of the business combination over the Group’s interest in 
the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities is recognised as goodwill.
Acquisition related costs are expensed to the consolidated income 
statement in the period they are incurred.
The Group applies a policy of treating transactions with non-controlling 
interests as transactions with parties external to the Group.
Employee share trust
IFRS 10 requires that the Group consolidate a structured entity where 
the substance of the relationship between the parties indicates that 
the Group controls the entity. The employee share trust sponsored by 
the Group falls within this category of structured entity and has been 
accounted for as if it were, in substance, a subsidiary.
Currency translation
The financial statements for the Group’s subsidiaries, associate 
and joint ventures are prepared using their functional currency. 
The functional currency is the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which an entity operates. The presentation currency  
of the Group is Sterling.
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional 
currency using exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the 
transactions. Exchange differences resulting from the settlement of 
such transactions and from the translation, at exchange rates ruling at 
the balance sheet date, of monetary assets and liabilities denominated 
in currencies other than the functional currency are recognised in the 
consolidated income statement.
The balance sheets of foreign operations are translated into sterling 
using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date and the income 
statements are translated into sterling using the average exchange rate 
for the period. Where this average is not a reasonable approximation 
of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction 
dates, the exchange rate on the transaction date is used. Exchange 
differences arising are recognised as a separate component of 
shareholders’ equity. On disposal of a foreign operation any cumulative 
exchange differences held in shareholders’ equity are transferred to 
the consolidated income statement.
Revenue recognition
Revenue from the sale of goods or services is measured at the 
fair value of the consideration, net of rebates and excluding value 
added tax. Revenue from the sale of goods or services is recognised 
when the Group has transferred the significant risks and rewards of 
ownership of the goods to the buyer, when the amount of revenue 
can be measured reliably and when it is probable that the economic 
benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group. Inter 
segmental transactions are on an arm’s length basis. 
In respect of construction contracts, revenue is calculated on the basis  
of the stage of completion and the total sales value of each contract. 47
CARR’S MILLING INDUSTRIES PLC
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014
STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The stage of completion is determined as the proportion that contract 
costs incurred for work performed to date bear to the total estimated 
total contract costs. No profit is recognised until a contract is at least 
30% complete. Amounts invoiced for work completed are deducted 
from the selling price, while amounts invoiced in excess of work 
completed are recognised as current liabilities.
Where it is probable that contract costs will exceed total contract 
revenue the expected loss is recognised immediately as an expense  
in the consolidated income statement.
Retirement benefit obligations
The Group participates in two defined benefit pension schemes, 
Carr’s Milling Industries Pension Scheme 1993 and Carrs Billington 
Agriculture Pension Scheme. The Group also offers various defined 
contribution schemes to its employees.
The assets of the above named schemes are held separately from 
those of the Group and are invested with independent investment 
managers.
Contributions to defined contribution schemes are charged to the 
consolidated income statement in the period to which they relate.
The liability recognised in the consolidated balance sheet at the period 
end in respect of defined benefit pension schemes is the present value 
of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair 
value of scheme assets. Independent actuaries calculate the defined 
benefit obligation annually using the projected unit credit method. 
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by 
discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates  
of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency 
in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity 
approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.
As discussed in new standards and interpretations on page 50  
the Group has adopted IAS 19 (Revised 2011) with effect from  
1 September 2013.
The service costs, including pension scheme administrative costs 
previously charged to the expected return on assets, are included in 
operating profit in the consolidated income statement.
A charge is made within operating profit which represents a net 
interest amount that is calculated by applying the discount rate at 
the beginning of the period to the net defined benefit liability at the 
beginning of the period. The net interest amount also takes into 
account changes to the net liability during the period. 
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and 
changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income. The pension schemes’ deficits 
or surpluses, to the extent that they are considered recoverable, are 
recognised in full on the consolidated balance sheet.
IFRIC 14 confirms that where a company has an unconditional right 
to a refund of surplus from a defined benefit pension plan during the 
lifetime of that plan or when it winds it up, and where there is expected 
to be surplus assets, there is no limit on the asset the company 
can show on its balance sheet. At 30 August 2014 the consolidated 
balance sheet recognises the full surplus on the Carr’s Milling 
Industries PLC defined benefit pension scheme.
The Group’s share of the deficit in the Carrs Billington Agriculture 
Pension Scheme is recognised through its investment in associate.
Share based payments
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain 
employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at 
fair value at the date of the grant. The fair value determined at the 
grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed 
on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s 
estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of a valuation model. The expected life 
used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best 
estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and 
behavioural considerations.
At each balance sheet date the Group revises its estimate of the 
number of options that are expected to vest. Changes to the fair 
value recognised as a result of this are charged or credited to the 
consolidated income statement with a corresponding adjustment  
to the equity compensation reserve.
Interest
Interest is recognised in the consolidated income statement on an 
accruals basis using the effective interest method. 
Borrowing costs
General and specific borrowing costs directly attributable to the 
acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are 
assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready 
for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, 
until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended 
use or sale.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the consolidated income 
statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Operating segments
IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of 
internal financial information about components of the Group that are 
regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (‘CODM’) to 
allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance. 
The CODM has been identified as the Executive Directors.
The CODM considers the business from a product/services 
perspective. Operating segments have been identified as Agriculture, 
Food and Engineering.
Non-recurring items
Non-recurring items that are material by size and/or by nature are 
presented within their relevant income statement category. Items that 
management consider fall into this category are disclosed within a note 
to the financial statements. The separate disclosure of non-recurring 
items helps provide a better indication of the Group’s underlying business 
performance. Events which may give rise to non-recurring items include, 
but are not limited to, gains or losses on the disposal of businesses, 
derivative gains or losses in respect of capital expenditure, gains or 
losses on the disposal of properties, gains or losses on the disposal of 
material investments, the restructuring of businesses, the integration of 
new businesses, acquisition related costs and asset impairments.
Goodwill
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and represents the 
excess of the consideration transferred over the Group’s interest in the 
net fair value of the net identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities of the acquiree and the fair value of the non-controlling 
interest in the acquiree. 48
CARR’S MILLING INDUSTRIES PLC
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business 
combination is allocated to each of the CGUs, or groups of CGUs, 
that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Each 
unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated represents the 
lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for 
internal management purposes. Goodwill is monitored at the operating 
segment level.
Goodwill impairment reviews are undertaken annually or more 
frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential 
impairment. The carrying value of goodwill is compared to the 
recoverable amount, which is the higher of value in use and the fair 
value less costs of disposal. Any impairment is recognised immediately 
as an expense and is not subsequently reversed.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 31 August 
1998 has not been reinstated and would not form part of the gain or 
loss on the disposal of a business.
Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation 
commences when assets are available for use. The expected useful 
lives, over which the assets are amortised, are generally as follows:
Customer relationships 1 - 5 years
Brands 15 - 20 years
Know-how 5 years
Patents and trademarks contractual life
Software 3 - 10 years
Customer relationships and brands are amortised in line with the profit 
and income streams they are respectively expected to generate over 
their expected useful life.
Know-how, patents, trademarks and software are amortised on a 
straight-line basis.
The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination  
is the fair value at the acquisition date. The cost of separately acquired 
intangible assets comprises the purchase price and any directly 
attributable costs of preparing the assets for use.
Research and development costs
All research costs are recognised in the consolidated income statement 
as incurred. Development costs are recognised as an asset only to the 
extent that specific recognition criteria, as set out in IAS38 ‘Intangible 
assets’, relevant to the proposed application are met and the amount 
recognised is recoverable through future economic benefits.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Cost comprises 
purchase price and directly attributable costs. 
Freehold land and assets in the course of construction are not 
depreciated. For all other property, plant and equipment, depreciation 
is calculated on a straight-line basis to allocate cost less residual 
values of the assets over their estimated useful lives as follows:
Freehold buildings up to 50 years
Leasehold buildings shorter of 50 years or lease term
Plant and equipment 3 to 20 years
Residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if 
appropriate, at each financial period-end.
Assets not fully constructed at the balance sheet date are classified  
as assets in the course of construction. When construction is complete 
these assets are reclassified to the appropriate heading within 
property, plant and equipment. Depreciation commences when the 
asset is ready for use.
The cost of maintenance, repairs and minor equipment is charged 
to the consolidated income statement as incurred; the cost of major 
renovations and improvements is capitalised.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the 
proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised within the 
consolidated income statement.
Investment property
Investment properties are properties held for long-term rental yields. 
Investment properties are carried in the balance sheet at cost less 
accumulated depreciation. Freehold land is not depreciated. For all 
other investment property, depreciation is calculated on a straight-
line basis to allocate cost less residual values of the assets over their 
estimated useful lives as follows:
Freehold buildings  up to 50 years
The cost of maintenance, repairs and minor equipment is charged 
to the consolidated income statement as incurred; the cost of major 
renovations and improvements is capitalised.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the 
proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised within the 
consolidated income statement.
Impairment of non-financial assets
Non-financial assets are reviewed for impairment where there are 
any events or changes in circumstances that would indicate potential 
impairment. In addition, at each reporting date, the Group assesses 
whether there is any indication that goodwill may be impaired. Where 
an indicator of impairment exists, the Group makes an estimate of 
recoverable amount. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds 
its recoverable amount the asset is written down to its recoverable 
amount. Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs 
to sell and value in use and is deemed for an individual asset. If the 
asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of 
those from other assets or groups of assets, the recoverable amount 
of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs is determined. 
Discount rates reflecting the asset specific risks and the time value  
of money are used for the value in use calculation.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour 
costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the 
inventories to their present location and condition. Where appropriate, 
cost is calculated on a specific identification basis. Otherwise 
inventories are valued using the first-in first-out method.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all 
estimated costs to completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, 
selling and distribution.
Provision has been made, where necessary, for slow moving, obsolete 
and defective inventories.
Contract work in progress is measured at the selling price of the work 
performed at the balance sheet date. The selling price is measured 
by reference to the stage of completion at the balance sheet date and 
total expected income from the contract work. 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Principal Accounting Policies continued 49
CARR’S MILLING INDUSTRIES PLC
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014
STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Progress payments received are deducted from the value of work in 
progress except to the extent that payments on account exceed the 
value of work in progress on any contract where the excess is included 
in trade and other payables.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents for the purposes of the consolidated 
statement of cash flows comprise cash at bank and in hand, money 
market deposits and other short term highly liquid investments with 
original maturities of three months or less and bank overdrafts. Bank 
overdrafts are presented in borrowings within current liabilities in the 
consolidated balance sheet.
Grants
Grants received on capital expenditure are recorded as deferred 
income and taken to the consolidated income statement in equal 
annual instalments over the expected useful lives of the assets 
concerned. 
Revenue grants and contributions are taken to the consolidated 
income statement in the period to which they apply.
Leases
Leases are classified as finance leases at inception where substantially 
all of the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the Group. 
Assets classified as finance leases are capitalised on the consolidated 
balance sheet and are depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of 
the asset and the term of the lease. The interest element of the rental 
obligations is charged to the consolidated income statement over the 
period of the lease using the actuarial method.
Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to the consolidated 
income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. 
Leasehold land is normally classified as an operating lease. Payments 
made to acquire leasehold land are included in prepayments at cost 
and are amortised over the life of the lease. Any incentives to enter into 
operating leases are recognised as a reduction of rental expense over 
the lease term on a straight-line basis.
Tax
The tax charge comprises current tax and deferred tax.
The current tax charge represents an estimate of the amounts payable 
to tax authorities in respect of the Group’s taxable profits.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary 
differences arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities 
and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. 
Deferred tax arising from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a 
transaction, other than a business combination, that at the time of the 
transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, is not 
recognised. Deferred tax is measured using tax rates that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are 
expected to apply when the asset is realised or the liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable 
that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary 
differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on 
investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, except 
where the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the 
temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference 
will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Tax is recognised in the consolidated income statement, unless the  
tax relates to items recognised directly in shareholders’ equity, in 
which case the tax is recognised directly in shareholders’ equity 
through the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Dividends
Final equity dividends to the shareholders of the Company are 
recognised in the period that they are approved by the shareholders. 
Interim equity dividends are recognised in the period that they  
are paid.
Dividends receivable are recognised in the period in which they  
are received.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Group’s 
consolidated balance sheet when the Group becomes a party  
to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade receivables  
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, 
less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade 
receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the 
Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the 
original terms of the receivables. Significant financial difficulties of the 
debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial 
reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments are considered 
indicators that the trade receivable is impaired. The amount of the 
provision is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and 
the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the 
original effective interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset is 
reduced through the use of an allowance account, and the amount of 
the loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement. When a 
trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance 
account for trade receivables. 
Investments
Investments are initially measured at cost, including transaction costs.  
Equity investments that do not have a quoted market price in an active 
market and whose fair value cannot be reliably measured by other 
means are held at cost. 
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to 
the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.  
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest 
in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing loans and overdrafts are recognised initially at 
fair value net of direct issue costs and are subsequently stated at 
amortised cost. Finance charges, including premiums payable on 
settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on 
an effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of 
the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in 
which they arise.
Trade payables
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the 
proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. 50
CARR’S MILLING INDUSTRIES PLC
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014
Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
The Group primarily uses forward foreign currency contracts and currency swaps to manage its exposures to fluctuating foreign exchange rates.  
These instruments are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently re-measured at their fair value at each balance sheet date. 
The Group’s policy is to hedge its international assets and it has designated foreign currency borrowings as a hedge against net investment in 
foreign operations. The portion of the gain or loss on an instrument used to hedge a net investment in a foreign operation that is determined 
as an effective hedge is recognised directly in equity. The gain or loss on any ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised immediately in the 
consolidated income statement.
New standards and interpretations
From 1 September 2013 the following became effective and were adopted by the Group:
Amendment to IAS 19 (Revised 2011) ‘Employee Benefits’
The Group has adopted ‘Amendment to IAS 19: (Revised 2011) Employee Benefits’ with effect from 1 September 2013. This has resulted in a 
change of accounting policy and the restatement of the prior period financial statements. The change to the accounting policy has been to replace 
interest cost and expected return on plan assets with a net interest amount that is calculated by applying the discount rate at the beginning of the 
period to the net defined benefit liability at the beginning of the period. The net interest amount also takes into account changes to the net liability 
during the period. The effect of this is to remove the previous concept of recognising an expected return on plan assets. See note 35 for the impact 
on the financial statements.
Under the Amendment pension scheme administrative expenses are now charged to the consolidated income statement when the services are 
performed. Previously these were charged to the expected return on scheme assets.
IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’
IFRS 13 applies to IFRSs that require or permit fair value measurements or disclosures. It provides a single IFRS framework for measuring fair value 
and requires disclosures about fair value measurement. The Standard defines fair value on the basis of an ‘exit price’ notion and uses a ‘fair value 
hierarchy’, which results in a market-based, rather than entity-specific, measurement.
The adoption of IFRS 13 has had no impact on the financial statements. Additional disclosures in respect of fair value measurement are included  
in note 23.
Annual improvements to IFRS 2009-2011
These improvements include changes to:
•	 IFRS 	1, 	‘First 	time 	adoption’

Significant judgements, key assumptions and estimates
Application of certain Group accounting policies requires management to make judgements, assumptions and estimates concerning the future  
as detailed below.
Valuation of pension obligations
The valuation of the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme is determined each period following advice from a qualifying independent actuary 
and can fluctuate based on a number of external factors. Such factors include the major assumptions as shown in the table in note 24 and actual 
returns on scheme assets compared to those predicted in the previous scheme valuation.
Valuation of share-based payments
The fair value of share-based payments is determined using valuation models and is charged to the consolidated income statement over the vesting 
period.
The valuation models require certain assumptions to be made as shown in the tables in note 26. Estimations of vesting and satisfaction of 
performance criteria are required to determine fair value.
Impairment of goodwill
The carrying value of goodwill must be assessed for impairment annually, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. 
This requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash generating units to which goodwill is allocated. Value in use is dependent on estimations 
of future cash flows from the cash generating unit and the use of an appropriate discount rate to discount those cash flows to their present value.
No impairment has been identified in the period (note 9).
Revenue recognition on construction contracts
Under long term contracts, the Group recognises revenue and profits based on the percentage completion method. This requires management 
to make an assessment of the overall profitability and the stage of completion of the entire contract in order to determine the level of revenue and 
profit to recognise.
Provision for impairment of trade receivables
The financial statements include a provision for impairment of trade receivables (note 18) that is based on management’s estimation of 
recoverability. There is a risk that the provision will not match the trade receivables that ultimately prove to be irrecoverable.
Valuation of derivative financial instruments
The fair value of derivative financial instruments (note 23) is determined using market factors at the period end over which management have no 
control. Such factors include the estimation of future currency exchange rates. In addition the fair value of such instruments is affected by the global 
economic environment and financial institution pricing structures.  52

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Notes to the Financial Statements
1 The Company has taken advantage of the exemption, under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, from presenting its own income statement.  
The profit after tax for the period dealt with in the accounts of the Company was £2,021,000 (2013 restated: £10,073,000).
2 Segmental information        
The chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) has been identified as the Executive Directors. Management has identified the operating  
segments based on internal financial information reviewed by the CODM. The CODM considers the business from a product/services perspective. 
Operating segments have been identified as Agriculture, Food and Engineering. Operating segments have not been aggregated for the purpose  
of determining reportable segments. 
Agriculture aims to provide for all farming requirements. It derives its revenue from the sale of animal feed and feed blocks together with retail 
sales of farm equipment, fuels and farm consumables.
Food derives its revenues from the milling of wheat into flour. Customers range from the larger companies, bread and biscuit manufacturers  
and supermarkets, to smaller owner managed bakeries. 
Engineering derives its revenues from the design and manufacture of remote handling equipment for use in research and nuclear industries.  
In addition the UK business is involved in precision machining and the design and manufacture of pressure vessels for the oil, petrochemical  
and gas industry. 
        
Performance is assessed using profit before taxation. For internal purposes profit before taxation is measured in a manner consistent with that  
in the financial statements, with the exception of material non-recurring items, which are excluded.      
  
Inter-segmental transactions are all undertaken on an arm’s length basis.
Adjustments to segmental information and amounts classified as ‘other’ represents non-reportable segments and consolidation adjustments.
Segment assets for Agriculture, Food and Engineering represent inventories and trade receivables as reported to the CODM.   
           
As segment liabilities are not reviewed by the CODM they are not required to be disclosed under IFRS 8.     
   
The Group has operations in the UK and overseas. In accordance with IFRS 8, entity wide disclosures based on the geography of operations  
is also presented. The geographical analysis of revenue is presented by revenue origin.

During the period goodwill of £4,585,000 arose on acquisitions (note 27).
During the prior period goodwill totalling £16,000 arose on the acquisition of the trade and assets of Western Feed Supplements LLC. Goodwill 
reflected the value of the employees, which under IFRS should not be recorded as a separately identifiable intangible asset on the balance sheet.
 For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to cash generating units that are expected to 
benefit from the synergies of the combination.

Goodwill is tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. Goodwill is tested for 
impairment by estimating future cash flows from the cash generating units to which goodwill has been allocated and discounting these cash flows 
to their present value. Each unit or group of units to which goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill 
is monitored for internal management purposes. Goodwill is monitored at operating segment level. The key assumptions in this calculation are in 
respect of discount rates used and the change in cash flows. Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the cash generating units.
Cash flows are estimated using the most recent budget information for the year to August 2015, which has been approved by the Board and 
forecast information for the three years to August 2018 based on an estimated growth rate of 1-3% excluding inflation. The pre-tax discount rate 
used to discount the forecast cash flows for all cash generating units is 5.97% - 11.41% (2013: 9.5%).  
The Directors consider the assumptions adopted in calculating the cash flows to be consistent with historical performance and to be reasonable 
given current market conditions.
Significant headroom exists in each of the cash generating units and, based on the sensitivity analysis performed, reasonable possible changes  
in the assumptions would not cause the carrying amount of the cash generating units to equal or to exceed their recoverable amount.
Amortisation and impairment charges are recognised within administrative expenses.
 There is no goodwill or intangible assets in the Company (2013: none).

Liquidity risk    
The Group’s policy throughout the period has been to maintain a mix of short and medium term borrowings. Short-term flexibility is achieved  
by overdraft facilities. In addition it is the Group’s policy to maintain committed undrawn facilities in order to provide flexibility in the management  
of the Group’s liquidity.     
The tables below analyse the Group and Company’s financial liabilities which will be settled on a net basis into relevant maturity groupings based

precedent had been met, were as follows:

The Company’s overdraft is within a Group facility and it is therefore not possible to determine the Company’s undrawn committed facilities at  
the balance sheet date.
Capital risk management        
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for 
shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an efficient capital structure to optimise the cost of capital.    
    
 In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to 
shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.      
 The Group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total equity. Net debt is calculated  
as total borrowings (including current and non-current borrowings) as shown in the consolidated balance sheet less cash and cash equivalents. 
Total equity is as shown in the consolidated balance sheet.     
At 30 August 2014 the Group had net debt of £24.6 million (2013: £22.1 million) and gearing of 27.4% (2013: 28.3%).
The Group monitors cash balances and net debt on a daily basis to ensure adequate headroom exists on banking facilities and that it is compliant 
with banking covenants. 
Fair value hierarchy
IFRS 13 requires financial instruments that are measured at fair value to be classified according to the valuation technique used:
Level 1 – quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
Level 2 – inputs, other than Level 1 inputs, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e., as prices) or indirectly (i.e., derived  
 from prices) 
Level 3 – unobservable inputs
All derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value using Level 2 inputs. There were no transfers between levels in the above hierarchy  
in either the current or prior period.
The Group holds shares in several private limited companies. These have been classified as unquoted investments for which fair value cannot be 
reliably measured and are held at cost less accumulated impairment. Had fair value been applied this financial asset would have been Level 3.

24 Retirement benefit obligation
The Group participates in two defined benefit pension schemes, Carr’s Milling Industries Pension Scheme 1993 and Carrs Billington Agriculture 
Pension Scheme.
Carr’s Milling Industries
The Company sponsors the Carr’s Milling Industries Pension Scheme 1993 and offers a defined contribution and a defined benefit section.  
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group and are invested with independent investment managers.
The pension expense for the defined contribution section of the scheme for the period was £635,000 (2013: £510,000). Contributions totalling 
£41,000 (2013: £33,000) were payable to the fund at the period end and are included in other payables.
The defined benefit section of the scheme is closed to new members. The pension contribution made by the Group over the period to the defined 
benefit section was £2,806,000 (2013: £2,867,000). Contributions to the scheme for the year ending August 2015 are expected to be £2,720,000.
In addition, the Group offers a Group Personal Pension plan to certain employees of Carr’s Flour Mills Limited. The pension expense for this 
scheme for the period was £229,000 (2013: £228,000).

Characteristics of the Scheme and the risks associated with the Scheme
a)  Information about the characteristics of the Scheme
i.  The Scheme provides pensions in retirement and death benefits to members. Pension benefits are linked to member’s final salary at retirement 
and their length of service.
ii.  The Plan is a registered scheme under UK legislation and is contracted out of the State Second Pension.
The plan is subject to the scheme funding requirements outlined in UK legislation. The last scheme funding valuation of the Scheme was as at  
31 December 2011 and revealed a deficit of £9.9 million. In the recovery plan dated August 2012 the Employer has agreed to pay contributions of 
£195,000 per month with the view to eliminating the shortfall by 31 December 2015.
In line with previous years there is no additional liability recognised on the balance sheet as a result of the recovery plan dated August 2012.
iii.  The Scheme was established under trust and is governed by the Scheme’s trust deed and rules dated June 2008. The Trustees are responsible 
for the operation and the governance of the Scheme, including making decisions regarding the Scheme’s funding and investment strategy in 
conjunction with the Employer.
b) Information about risks of the Scheme to the Employer
In general, the risk to the Employer is that the assumptions underlying the disclosures, or the the calculation of contribution requirements are not borne 
out in practice and the cost to the Employer is higher than expected. This could result in higher contributions required from the Employer and a higher 
deficit disclosed. This may also impact the Employer’s ability to grant discretionary benefits or other enhancements to members.
i. The return on the Scheme’s assets being lower than assumed, resulting in an unaffordable increase in the required Employer contribution rate.
ii. Falls in asset values (particularly equities) not being matched by similar falls in the value of liabilities.
iii.  Unanticipated future changes in mortality patterns leading to an increase in the Scheme’s liabilities. Future mortality rates cannot be predicted 
with certainty. This is especially so bearing in the mind that the youngest Scheme members could be expected to still be alive in 50 years or 
more and it is not possible to reliably predict what medical advances may or may not have occurred by this time. The average duration of the 
Scheme’s liabilities is approximately 16 years.
iv.  The potential exercise (by members or others) of options against the Scheme for example taking early retirement or exchanging a portion of 
pension for a cash lump sum. 79

Carrs Billington Agriculture
Carrs Billington Agriculture (Sales) Limited, one of the Group’s subsidiary undertakings, is a participating employer of the Carrs Billington Agriculture 
Pension Scheme, another funded defined benefit scheme. On 30 November 2007, following consultation with the active members, the Company and 
Trustees agreed to close the scheme to future service accrual. The most recent actuarial assessment of the scheme was at 31 December 2012.
 The pension contribution made by Carrs Billington Agriculture (Sales) Limited over the period to the Carrs Billington Agriculture Pension Scheme was 
£nil (2013: £nil).
 It is not possible to identify the underlying share of the pension scheme assets and liabilities that relate to the Group. At inception in June 2000 
approximately 50% of the assets and liabilities of the pension scheme related to the Group and under IFRS approximately 50% of the assets and  
liabilities are included in the Group’s financial statements through the investment in associate, which is the sponsoring employer of the scheme.
Details and disclosures in respect of the scheme are provided in the financial statements of Carrs Billington Agriculture (Operations) Limited which  
are publicly available.
Carrs Billington Agriculture (Sales) Limited offers a Group Personal Pension Plan to its employees and the pension expense for this plan in the period 
was £414,000 (2013: £383,000). 
 During the period contributions were also payable to a defined contribution pension scheme for certain employees of Carrs Billington Agriculture 
(Sales) Limited. The pension expense for this scheme for the period was £22,946 (2013: £16,000).

In 2013 the Group entered into a long term incentive plan. Shares will be awarded to eligible individuals subject to an earnings per share (EPS) 
target measured against average annual increases over a three year period. For the awards granted in May 2013 an average annual growth of EPS 
must exceed 7.0% for 25% of the awards to vest, 50% vest at 8.1% and 100% vest at 10.2%, with a straight line calculation between 25%, 50% 
and 100% of the award. For the awards granted in November 2013 an average annual growth of EPS must exceed 3.0% for 25% of the awards  
to vest and 100% vest at 10.0%, with a straight line calculation between 25% and 100% of the award.
All employees, subject to eligibility criteria, may participate in the share save scheme. Under this scheme employees are offered savings contracts 
for both 3 year and 5 year vesting period plans. The exercise period is 6 months from the vesting date.
The approved share options were granted to certain senior employees and Directors. Options are exercisable between three and ten years from  
the date of grant, subject to the movement of the Group’s adjusted earnings per share over the three years to 31 August 2008 exceeding that of  
the RPI by an average of 2% per annum.
The fair value per option granted and the assumptions used in the calculation of fair values are as follows:

The expected volatility has been calculated using historical daily data over a term commensurate with the expected life of each option.  
The expected life is the midpoint of the exercise period. The risk-free rate of return is the implied yield of zero-coupon UK Government bonds  
with a remaining term equal to the expected term of the award being valued.

All of the above purchases have been accounted for as acquisitions. Given the size of the acquisitions no separate disclosure has been presented 
on the face of the consolidated income statement as the impact would not be material.  
Aggregate disclosures  
The total goodwill arising from acquisitions in the period amounts to £4,585,000 (2013: £16,000). Goodwill, in both the current and prior period, 
reflects the value of the employees, which under IFRS should not be recorded as a separately identifiable intangible asset on the consolidated 
balance sheet.
  
The following aggregated amounts have been recognised within the consolidated income statement in respect of acquisitions:
 2014 2013
   £’000 £’000
Revenue    2,312 295
Profit/(loss) before taxation    129 (36)
There were no other recognised gains and losses other than the profit shown above.
Acquisition related costs amounted to £123,000, which have been recognised within administrative expenses in the consolidated income 
statement.

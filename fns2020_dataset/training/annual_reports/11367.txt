Subsidiary companies
In June 2014 Nostrum underwent a full corporate restructuring, cancelling its GDRs and replacing 
them with shares listed on the main board of the London Stock Exchange. This restructuring required 
a number of steps to dissolve the partnership and replace it with a public limited company. The 
Company currently has a number of intermediary companies between the PLC and its operating entity 
in Kazakhstan, Zhaikmunai LLP. This structure is currently being simplified. The structure as at the date 
of this report can be found in Additional disclosures.

Overview
Who we are
Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC is an 
independent oil and gas 
company engaging in the 
production, development and 
exploration of oil and gas in 
the pre-Caspian Basin.
We are a simple, sustainable 
and successful organisation 
with the vision to become the 
leading independent oil and 
gas exploration and production 
company in the Former Soviet 
Union (FSU). 
We recognise that our financial 
and operational targets need  
to be pursued in a responsible 
way and we believe that our 
track record clearly demonstrates 
the successful achievement of 
our strategic goals. 
Whilst we continue to make 
progress towards our financial 
and operational goals, we have 
developed a simple strategy 
that will allow us to successfully 
deliver the near term growth 
we have targeted, combined 
with long term, sustainable 
value creation.
What we do
We focus on creating long term 
shareholder value through the 
development and discovery of 
oil and gas reserves, as well as 
the production and sale of 
crude oil, stabilised condensate, 
LPG and dry gas. Our highly 
skilled management team has 
managed the investment of 
over US$1.5 billion in our 
licence area since 2004, 
delivering on a number of 
infrastructure projects as well 
as significantly expanding the 
reserve base over the last ten 
years through our own 
appraisal work, as well as 
successful M&A activity.
Our commercial 
products
Our range of products at 
Nostrum are crude oil, 
stabilised liquid condensate, 
LPG and dry gas. Currently all 
our production comes from 
the Chinarevskoye licence. 
We have invested in developing 
our own infrastructure to 
control the transportation of 
our products until they reach 
the final off-taker, which serves 
a wide network of destinations 
and off-takers, helping to 
ensure we always obtain the 
best possible prices.

Reserves
Ryder Scott completed an update 
of Nostrum’s reserves report in 
December 2014. This report includes 
the reserves at Chinarevskoye and  
the three additional licences acquired 
in 2013. 
For more information on  
reserves please see our website:
www.nog.co.uk
Average daily 
production rates
We have increased production 
every year from 2004–2013 when 
full capacity of our processing 
facilities was achieved. The 2014 
production from the Chinarevskoye 
licence of 44,400 boepd will remain 
broadly steady for 2015 and only 
represents half of what we are 
aiming to achieve from the field. 
We are currently working to 
increase our processing capacity, 
allowing us to more than double 
production. 
Market positioning
We are in a unique position in the 
market, with our front-loaded 
investment programme meaning 
we are now a leader in terms of 
infrastructure in the region, with 
the ability to process significant 
volumes of raw gas via our gas 
treatment facility. In addition, 
our advantageous location in 
north-west Kazakhstan places 
us closer to our final off-take 
destinations, such as the Black Sea 
ports and Finland.
Operational structure
Nostrum has a simple and  
familiar operating structure.  
It has a board of directors led  
by the chairman and a senior 
management team led by the 
CEO. Nostrum aims to keep its 
operating structure as simple  
as possible to reflect its simple 
investment case. The senior 
management team manages the 
major units involved in operations 
according to the interaction chart 
on page 58.

Nostrum has developed a world-class portfolio of assets in north-west Kazakhstan. 
The front-loaded investment programme has been the foundation on which strong 
production growth has been built allowing the Company to enjoy sustainable cash 
flow during challenging conditions.
Our investment case
A simple investment case
Over half a billion 
of 2P reserves
With 571.1 million of 2P reserves 
and production of more than 
16 million barrels of oil equivalent 
per year, we provide a unique 
combination of significant 
production and reserve upside 
along with strong operational 
cash flow.
Steady levels 
of production
2014’s average daily production 
was 44,400 boepd, remaining 
broadly constant with 2013 levels.
Stable financial 
platform with strong 
cash flows and 
flexibility
Nostrum generated US$349. 1 million 
of operating cash flow in 2014. 
In addition, the Group ended the 
year with over US$400 million of 
cash
1
 on its balance sheet and 
a hedge on 7,500 bopd until 
February 2016 at US$85. This 
places Nostrum in a strong 
position within the E&P space  
as a company with significant  
cash reserves despite the more 
challenging oil price environment.
1  Cash on the balance sheet is defined as cash and 
cash equivalents including current and non-current 
investments. Strategic report Corporate governance
Annual Report 2014 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC 05
Financial report Regulatory information Additional disclosures
World-class assets
We have four licence areas all 
located in the pre-Caspian Basin, 
to the north-west of Uralsk. 
Nostrum’s current producing 
asset is the Chinarevskoye field 
and the three additional licences 
are all located within 60-120km 
of the field. 
Simple business case, successful model  
and sustainable strategy
We have a clear strategy, based on a solid foundation and compelling 
business case. We will deliver near term production growth, with 
preparations to double production capacity by the end of 2016 well 
underway.
In addition, with our continued appraisal of the existing Chinarevskoye field 
and our three additional licences, we are continually transferring reserves 
to the 1P category, aiming for 700m boe of proved reserves. This will allow 
us to maintain production above 100,000 boepd up until the end of the 
Chinarevskoye licence (2031-2033). 
We are also constantly looking at areas to make additional acquisitions that 
would further expand the reserve base. These would be both within reach  
of our existing infrastructure as well as further afield in Kazakhstan.
Strong governance 
and responsibility
We are committed to achieving 
the highest possible standard of 
corporate governance and social 
responsibility and are aiming for a 
positive and lasting contribution to 
the areas in which we operate, with 
a focus on delivering shareholder 
value for a sustainable future. 
Experienced 
management team
We are confident in the ability of 
our experienced and dedicated 
management team, who are used 
to operating in Kazakhstan, to 
deliver on our clear strategy. Strategic report

Advantageous location of assets
Key
Current destinations
 Oil/condensate
Our main operational facilities are located at 
the 274 square kilometre Chinarevskoye field 
in north-west Kazakhstan. We now have three 
additional licenses, all within a 120km radius 
of this location. This advantageous location  
is core to our business case, allowing us to 
leverage our existing infrastructure and 
operating and development teams.
Transportation dynamics and routes
Crude
Crude oil is transported through 
our own liquids pipeline directly from 
the field site. 15% is sold domestically 
and the remainder is sold through 
our rail terminal to various destinations 
in Finland and through the Black Sea 
ports. 
Condensate
Condensate is transported through 
our own liquids pipeline from the 
field site and then 100% is exported by 
rail to the Russian Black Sea Port of 
Taman. We have a long term off-take 
agreement with Trafigura for our 
condensate in place until 2016.
LPG
LPG is transported on trucks from 
the field site to our rail terminal where 
it is loaded on to special trains and 
then transported to the off-taker. The 
majority of our LPG is sold at Black Sea 
ports and distributed by traders to 
Eastern Europe and Turkey. Strategic report Corporate governance

Expanding for the future
With the preparatory work to double 
production capacity firmly underway, 
all of the related infrastructure, upon 
completion of GTU3, will accommodate 
the potential increased levels of 
production. 
This will again further improve our 
efficiencies and effective use of 
existing infrastructure. Transportation 
routes and destinations are currently 
expected to remain unchanged.
As a company, Nostrum is continually 
evaluating the destinations to which  
we sell in order to achieve the best 
possible netbacks for the Company. Strategic report
08 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2014
Key performance indicators
A successful year
Financial KPIs 
2014 saw continued cash flow generation from our processing facilities along with significant further investments in our 
next growth phase. Despite a challenging oil price environment, at the end of the year Nostrum has ensured it is fully 
financed to continue with its process facility expansion by the end of 2016.
The main contributing factor to the variance between forecast and actual results was the drop in the oil price 
by 47.5% during 2014.
Non-financial KPIs 
Nostrum’s strategic goals are spread across both financial performance and also operational and social indicators. 
We believe that a focus across all these areas is necessary to ensure the Company’s success in the longer term. Thus, 
we set ourselves non-financial KPIs to ensure that we maintain our focus in these areas.

“ Nostrum’s growth and success centres around  
the quality and commitment of our people.”
Chairman’s statement
Delivering continued growth
Our vision
Nostrum’s vision is to grow production 
to over 100,000 boepd and to build 
a reserve base that allows the 
Company to continue to produce at 
this level far into the future. Our vision 
of achieving production of 100,000 
boepd from our existing field in 
north-west Kazakhstan is now only a 
few years away. As a result, we are also 
looking to further build Nostrum’s 
reserve base, not only with reserves 
to prolong the plateau production of 
100,000 boepd, but also to increase 
this through acquisitions outside 
of our current production hub. 
Our vision is to become one of the 
leading independent E&P companies 
in the FSU.
Nostrum intends to realise its vision 
through a clearly defined strategy, 
balancing organic development with 
opportunistic expansion through 
acquisitions. Its main priority remains, 
as always, to continue to deliver growth 
and shareholder value in a responsible 
and efficient way.
Our ambition and  
strong financial position
Nostrum continued to perform well  
in 2014 despite the year ending with  
a challenging oil price environment. 
We consistently delivered production 
of approximately 45,000 boepd and 
started the appraisal programme on 
our three additional fields. Whilst the 
financial performance of the Company 
was not as strong as in 2013, as a result 
of a falling oil price during the second 
half of the year, we were still able to 
end the year with over US$400 million 
of cash and cash equivalents on our 
balance sheet. The combination of the 
US$400m bond we placed in early 
2014 and the hedge we put in place 
from February 2014 means that we are 
well positioned to be able to sustain a 
period of prolonged low oil prices and 
still deliver on our strategy. Thus, our 
ambitions to build the leading CIS 
independent E&P company remain 
as strong as ever. We completed our 
Premium Listing on the London Stock 
exchange during 2014 and we are now 
a member of the FTSE 250 which 
further demonstrates the ambition we 
have to achieve the highest standards in 
everything we do. I believe the current 
environment can provide opportunities, 
rather than limitations, for Nostrum. 
Solid financial performance
Nostrum’s financial performance was 
steady as production levels remained 
broadly similar to 2013. We started 
more meaningful investment into the 
second gas treatment facility and 
raised additional financing in early 
2014 to ensure that we were fully 
financed for this phase of infrastructure 
building. At the same time we 
implemented our hedging programme 
to cover all non-scalable capex for 
2014 and 2015. We continue to 
manage our cash position prudently. 
We take into account, first and 
foremost, the liquidity position of the 
Company. Secondly, we ensure that 
use of excess cash is carefully 
considered before deploying it, and 
that we are maximising shareholder 
returns with each investment we make. 
Despite the falling oil price, 2014 was  
a good year financially and net income 
for the year was US$146.4 million.  
I believe we have struck the right 
balance between reinvesting in future 
growth and returning cash to our 
shareholders in the current 
environment. 
I am pleased that the Board is 
proposing a final dividend for 2014 
of US$0.27 per Ordinary Share, subject 
to shareholder approval at the AGM.
Stable production levels
The financial performance of the 
Company was built on another strong 
year of operational results. Production 
of 44,400 boepd was extremely 
close to our target of 45,000 boepd 
and Nostrum is now enjoying a period 
of sustained production at levels 
around 45,000 boepd. This steady 
production and associated cash flow 
continues to allow Nostrum to invest in 
further infrastructure to double our 
production capacity by the end of 2016 
without the need to raise more capital. 
In addition to this organic growth, the 
cash flows Nostrum generates allows 
the Company to grow reserves and 
extend production through its recently 
established M&A strategy.  Strategic report Corporate governance

Multi-field asset base established
Nostrum has started the appraisal 
programme on the three additional 
licences acquired in 2013. We have 
adopted the same approach with our 
additional fields that we undertook 
with Chinarevskoye to fully understand 
the geology and de-risk the 
development programme as much 
as possible. We have carried out new 
3-D seismic on each field and have 
now interpreted it, allowing us to have 
a much better understanding of where 
to position our first appraisal wells.  
We plan to start drilling an appraisal well 
in the largest field, Rostochinskoye, in 
2015. We look forward to developing 
these fields and to bringing them into 
production to utilise our infrastructure 
development. 
Governance and the Board
The Board understands the 
importance of providing effective 
and clear leadership and direction 
on all matters relating to corporate 
governance and places great 
significance on achieving high 
standards of governance to underpin 
the Group’s good business conduct 
and strong ethical culture. With this in 
mind I am very pleased with how the 
Company has handled the increased 
regulatory obligations imposed as a 
result of the Company’s admission to 
the premium listing segment of the 
Official List of the Financial Conduct 
Authority and to trading on the 
London Stock Exchange plc’s main 
market for listed securities in June 
2014. I believe the Company handled 
this transition very well. During 2015 
the Board will continue to work closely 
with management to maintain good 
standards of corporate governance 
and to ensure the Company’s 
continued compliance with the rules 
imposed by the Financial Conduct 
Authority and associated guidance 
under the UK Corporate Governance 
Code.
Our commitment  
to corporate responsibility
At Nostrum we strive to be a 
responsible and transparent business. 
Our Corporate Responsibility 
approach covers the relationships  
we have with all our stakeholders 
including shareholders, employees, 
contractors, local communities and 
host government as well as the 
environments in which we work. 
Nostrum’s strategy on Corporate 
Responsibility focuses around three 
key areas – people, planet, and profit 
– and includes the following initiatives:
 communicate its approach to its 
various stakeholders, emphasising  
its stringent corporate governance 
provisions and business ethics;
 well-being of its employees, health 
and safety measures, working 
environment specifics and overall 
benefits. Nostrum also reports on its 
direct involvement in the community 
through programmes providing 
social infrastructure, sponsoring 
activities and charitable work; and
 footprint carefully and adheres fully 
to relevant legislation. The Company 
is also proactive in liking its 
environmental objectives to the 
highest possible standards and 
ensuring stringent compliance and 
progress monitoring.
In 2014, we believe Nostrum’s actions 
have deemed to have a positive impact 
on its wide range of stakeholders, 
including investors, business partners, 
regulators, employees, customers, 
local communities, the environment 
and society more generally. 
Our people
We are entering a changing 
environment in relation to recruitment, 
as a falling oil price will inevitably 
lead to the scaling back of costs in 
the industry. Nostrum’s growth and 
success revolves around the quality 
and commitment of our people and  
we believe we have an excellent team 
that can deliver our strategy even with 
a lower oil price. We continued to  
grow our team during 2014 with a 6% 
increase in Kazakhstan. Our total 
global workforce now counts more 
than 1,000 people. We remain 
committed to developing local  
content and employed 98% local 
nationals in Kazakhstan as at the end  
of 2014. We will continue to develop 
our employment practices and policies 
to ensure we can attract and retain the 
best talent. At the same time we will 
continue to monitor our cost base and 
ensure we do not carry unnecessary 
excess costs into 2015.
The future
2014 was a solid year for the Company. 
For most of the year we had a strong 
oil price environment, however this 
rapidly changed in the fourth quarter 
and we need to be prudent as we  
enter 2015 to ensure we are ready for  
a sustained period of low oil prices.  
In 2015 our main focus is ensuring  
the timely completion of GTU3 in 2016 
and building the feedstock to allow us 
to double production. We enter this 
next investment phase with a very solid  
cash position, low levels of leverage 
and healthy margins in place. We 
believe we have the platform to 
execute our strategic initiatives which 
gives me confidence in our prospects 
for 2015 and beyond.

Chief Executive’s review
Maintaining steady production
How we performed in 2014
2014 was another strong year from 
an operational perspective. It saw 
the gas treatment facility continue to 
operate at full capacity with a complete 
range of hydrocarbon products being 
delivered to various destinations 
outside Kazakhstan. Nostrum is now 
deep into its second development 
phase, which will entail the engineering, 
planning, procurement, construction 
and commissioning of a new gas plant 
as well as a scalable drilling programme 
spanning the next 4-5 years. 
Our performance against our four key 
objectives for the Company in 2014 
was as follows:
1. Ensure construction of the next gas 
plant remained on track for 2016
 in the construction of our next GTU, 
which will allow us to double our 
production capacity by the end of 
2016. We have spent over US$150 
million and expect the total cost to 
be below US$500 million. 
2. Continue to grow our Proven 
reserve base through appraisal 
of Chinarevskoye and our three 
new ﬁelds
 as we replaced over 60% of our 
production since August 2013. Whilst 
the oil price environment is extremely 
different from the end of 2013 our 
strategy remains unchanged. We 
have made some reductions to our 
drilling programme but aim to fill the 
GTU3 by the end of 2017, as to reach a 
combined, together with GTU1 and 2, 
production of 100,000 boepd. We 
are well positioned to withstand the 
low oil price environment as we have 
a healthy cash balance and low costs 
of production. I am very excited 
about the future of our current asset 
base as well as the potential we 
have for further expansion over the 
coming years.
3. Establish a dedicated business 
development team
 development team to ensure we  
can quickly and accurately evaluate 
the opportunities in the region.
4. Ensure that the ﬁnancial position 
of the Company remains stable
 Company remains stable despite the 
challenging oil price environment.
Steady production levels
The Chinarevskoye field is now in full 
production with both the Oil Treatment 
Facility (OTF) and the Gas Treatment 
Facility (GTF) being operated at their 
nameplate capacities. Nostrum 
expects a daily total production 
average of at least 45,000 boepd for 
2015 and 2016. All products – crude oil, 
stabilised condensate, LPG and dry 
gas – are sold at the best possible 
prices on the world markets, and our 
operations are running at optimal 
levels. We remain on target to meet 
our objective of doubling capacity  
by the end of 2016.  Strategic report Corporate governance
Annual Report 2014 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC 15
Financial report Regulatory information Additional disclosures
Future drilling programme 
at Chinarevskoye
In 2014, we drilled eight wells and are 
fortunate to have a scalable drilling 
programme in front of us. Our ability 
to quickly scale drilling up or down 
allows us to react to the current oil 
price environment smoothly and 
without jeopardising our non-scalable 
capex. We are required to complete 
six wells in 2015 to maintain production 
at current levels which is comfortably 
achievable. We are able to maintain 
production at around 45,000 boepd 
and complete the GTU3 at substantially 
lower oil prices than today. Any 
increase in the oil price above these 
levels allows us to drill more wells for 
the purpose of filling the GTU3 and 
to appraise the new fields. 
Construction of second gas plant
During 2014 we have made significant 
steps towards the construction of our 
next gas plant. The rationale behind 
the plant is that it will allow faster 
monetisation of reserves, by increasing 
treatment capacity by an additional 
2.5 bcm of raw gas per year, bringing 
total capacity to 4.2 bcm of raw gas 
per annum. Over US$150 million has 
already been invested in the plant and 
contracts relating to over US$300 
million in total for procurement and 
construction have been entered into. 
We remain on track to deliver the plant 
on time and on budget in the second 
half of 2016.
Building up further reserves  
beyond the Chinarevskoye field
In addition to proving up reserves at 
Chinarevskoye Nostrum’s development 
plan also focuses on sustaining its 
long term production beyond the 
Chinarevskoye field alone. This target 
is the basis on which Nostrum’s 
mergers & acquisitions strategy is 
formed. This is exemplified by the 2013 
acquisition of the subsoil use rights 
related to three adjacent oil and gas 
fields, Rostoshinskoye, Darjinskoye 
and Yuzhno-Gremyachenskoye, in the 
near vicinity of the Chinarevskoye field. 
Based on Ryder Scott’s analysis these 
fields could add up to 98m of 2P 
reserves. Nostrum looks forward to 
drilling its first well in Rostoshinskoye 
during 2015.
By virtue of its size, development 
stage and production track record, 
Nostrum has acquired high visibility 
both locally and internationally. 
As a result it regularly monitors further 
M&A opportunities and its approach 
is to remain both pragmatic and 
prudent as it considers these options. 
Nostrum’s main focus remains on 
north-west Kazakhstan, where it 
knows the landscape and is already 
operating successfully. However 
we will also consider opportunities 
outside of North Western Kazakhstan 
where we see the potential to create 
further shareholder value. 
Key priority tasks for 2015
In 2015 there are three key objectives 
for the Company in order to continue 
to deliver on our strategy. 
1.  Ensure that the financial position 
of the Company remains stable. 
2.  Ensure construction of the next 
gas plant remains on track for 2016.
3.  Optimise the drilling programme 
to ensure that we can fill the GTU3  
as quickly as possible whilst not 
jeopardising the Company’s 
financial position. 
I believe that these objectives, if 
successfully achieved, will provide 
the platform to significantly enhance 
shareholder value. We have 
demonstrated in the past that we can 
deliver on all these objectives and 
I am therefore confident as we enter 
2015 that we are well positioned to 
achieve our goals. I believe we are well 
positioned to successfully execute the 
next phase of infrastructure whilst also 
ensuring the reserve base is not only 
maintained but added to over the 
coming years.

Overview – The larger 
Caspian Region
To date, Kazakhstan and 
Azerbaijan are the two significant 
crude oil producing countries in 
the Caspian region. It is expected 
that these countries will continue 
to lead the region in crude oil 
production in the near future, 
driven by production growth from 
existing fields and the development 
of recently discovered fields. 
Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan are 
the predominant gas producers 
in the region. Russia plays an 
important role in the region by 
providing a transportation corridor 
between the Caspian Sea and the 
Black Sea, however this part of 
Russia is not a source of substantial 
crude.
Economic growth 
and investment in 
Kazakhstan’s oil and 
gas industry
Since 2000, Kazakhstan has 
experienced significant economic 
growth mainly through economic 
reform and foreign investment. 
Exports of crude oil have grown 
significantly and, due to Kazakhstan 
being landlocked, most of the oil 
from Kazakhstan is currently 
delivered to international markets 
using pipelines, which run through 
Russia, to shipping points on the 
Black Sea. 
International investment into the 
Kazakh oil and gas sector has 
largely taken the form of joint 
ventures, including cooperation 
with the state-owned oil and gas 
company NC KazMunayGas JSC 
(“NC KMG”), as well as production 
sharing agreements and direct 
grants of exploration/production 
rights to subsoil users. Major 
projects in Kazakhstan include 
the Tengiz, Karachaganak and 
Kashagan fields. 
Oil supply and 
demand
According to BP’s Statistical 
Review of World Energy 2014, as 
at 31 December 2014, Kazakhstan 
ranked 12th in the world by oil 
reserves and 20th in the world by 
gas reserves. Kazakhstan is the 
second largest oil producer (after 
Russia) among the former Soviet 
Republics and has the Caspian 
region’s largest recoverable oil 
reserves. Kazakhstan’s proved 
oil and gas reserves were 
3.9 billion tonnes and 1.5 trillion 
cubic metres respectively, as at 
31 December 2013.
The Kazakh government has 
stated that it expects oil and gas 
production to increase to 
150 million tonnes per year and 
79.4 billion cubic metres per year 
in 2015. Most of this growth is 
expected to come from the Tengiz, 
Karachaganak and Kashagan 
fields.
There are three major refineries in 
Kazakhstan supplying the northern 
region (at Pavlodar), the western 
region (at Atyrau) and the southern 
region (at Shymkent). All three 
major refineries are either under 
the control or joint control of 
NC KMG. 
Oil price outlook
The oil price decline has changed 
our short-term view on oil prices. 
We believe that the new forward 
curve is the best benchmark for 
estimating short-term oil prices 
and therefore see the short-term 
oil price around US$60 per barrel.
In the longer term, we also believe 
that the forward curves reflect our 
view of the market as they show 
the longer-term price of oil 
increasing from US$60 per barrel 
to above US$70 per barrel. Our 
internal assumption for long-term 
oil remains unchanged with a view 
that it will average at least US$85 
over the long term.  Strategic report

Market overview continued
The oil and gas market in Kazakhstan
Transportation
An important aspect of increasing 
hydrocarbon production in 
Kazakhstan has been the 
development of transportation 
infrastructure, as this in turn has 
raised Kazakhstan’s export 
capacity.
Natural gas
Most of the gas pipelines in western 
Kazakhstan, with the exception  
of Makat-Atyrau-Astrakhan, are 
designed to provide gas to CAC. 
The pipeline has two branches that 
meet in the south-western Kazakh 
city of Beyneu before crossing into 
Russia and connecting with the 
Russian pipeline system.
The construction of the 
Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent gas pipeline 
designed to transport gas from west 
Kazakhstan for use in the southern 
regions of Kazakhstan and export  
to China, started in 2010.
The Bukhara Urals gas pipeline was 
initially built to supply gas from 
Uzbekistan to north-east Kazakhstan 
and Russia’s south-east Ural’s region. 
Bukhara-Tashkent-Bishkek-Almaty  
is a transit pipeline that provides gas 
from Uzbekistan to Kazakhstan’s 
main southern population centre.
Macro economic  
and micro economic 
changes during 2014
Macro economic and micro 
economic changes that occurred 
in the reporting period and their 
impact on results: 
 
at US$80 per tonne of crude oil 
from 11 March, 2014
 against the US Dollar and other 
major currencies in February 
2014 affected the Company in 
two ways. The Company 
recognised a foreign exchange 
loss as the Group had a net asset 
position of Tenge denominated 
accounts around this date, and 
also an increase in deferred tax 
expenses due to a significant 
decrease in the tax base for 
property, plant and equipment, 
which is denominated in Tenge.
Gas supply and 
demand
Increases in Kazakhstan’s gas 
production are expected to come 
primarily from associated gas at 
the Tengiz, Karachaganak and 
Kashagan fields. Most of 
Kazakhstan’s gas reserves are 
located in the west of the country 
and over half are located in the 
Karachaganak field. 
Gas production has increased 
significantly since 2004 when the 
Parliament passed a law 
prohibiting the industrial 
production of oil and gas deposits 
without the utilisation of natural 
and associated gas.
Crude oil
Currently over 7,920km of 
Kazakhstan’s 20,238km of pipeline 
are used in oil transportation.  
The three main pipelines are the 
Uzen-Atyrau-Samara (“UAS”) 
pipeline, CPC pipeline, and  
the Kazakhstan-China pipeline. 
Other pipeline routes from 
Kazakhstan are being considered, 
such as routes through the 
Caucasus region to Turkey  
and routes through Iran and 
Afghanistan.
Regulation in 
Kazakhstan
Regulation of the oil and gas 
sector can be divided into three

The TCO joint venture was created 
in 1993 with the aim of developing 
the Tengiz and Korolev fields that 
have estimated recoverable reserves 
of between 5.5 billion barrels 
and 8.1 billion barrels of oil. The 
participants in the joint venture 
are Chevron Overseas Company, 
ExxonMobil, NC KMG and LukArco. 
Karachaganak Project
The Karachaganak field is a  
280 square kilometre gas condensate 
field located in north-west 
Kazakhstan which was discovered  
in 1979. BG Group and ENI are joint 
operators and each hold a 
29.25% interest in the venture. The 
Karachaganak field is Kazakhstan’s 
main gas field, holding an estimated 
9 billion barrels of gas condensate 
and 48 trillion cubic feet of gas.
North Caspian Project
The Kashagan field is located off the 
northern shore of the Caspian Sea, 
near to the city of Atyrau. In 1997, 
a consortium of companies signed 
a 40-year production sharing 
agreement covering five structures. 
The structures consist of 11 offshore 
blocks over an area of 5,600 square

Exploration and production 
licence
We were granted an exploration 
and production licence for the 
Chinarevskoye field in May 1997, 
which was extended in 2008, to 
2033, for all oil- and gas-bearing 
reservoirs and horizons covering  
185 square kilometres of the licence 
area. The licence for the north-eastern 
Tournaisian reservoir is valid until 2031.
Production Sharing Agreement 
(PSA)
Nostrum operates under 
a grandfathered PSA with the 
Government of Kazakhstan, 
which sets the parameters for 
the exploration and development 
of the Chinarevskoye field, and the 
respective royalties, profit share 
and tax liabilities payable to the 
government.
Outlook
The licence and the PSA are currently 
valid until 2031 (with respect to the 
north-eastern Tournaisian reservoir) 
and 2033 (for the rest of the 
Chinarevskoye field), and we must 
comply with the terms of the 
exploration permit, the production 
permit and the development plans 
during this period. To date, Nostrum 
has met all of its capital investment 
obligations under the PSA.
Geology, reserves and drilling
Geology
The Chinarevskoye field is a 
multi-layer structure with ten 
reservoirs and 44 compartments 
spread over three areas: the western 
area contains 16 compartments; the 
northern area has 24 compartments 
and the southern area has four 
compartments. Commercial 
hydrocarbons have been found in 
the Lower Permian, Bashkirian, 
Bobrikovski, Tournaisian, Famennian, 
Mulinski, Ardatovski, and 
Biski-Afoninsk reservoirs. 
Reserves
Based on the Ryder Scott report, 
dated 31 December 2014, the 
proved and probable reserves 
for the Chinarevskoye field amount 
to 473 mmboe. Proven reserves 
amount to 192.2 mmboe and 
probable reserves to 280.7 mmboe. 
Oil and condensate amount to 
197.6 mmbbl of proven and 
probable reserves, LPG to 
68.3 mmbbl and gas to 207 mmboe.
Drilling
Hydrocarbons were first discovered 
in the Chinarevskoye reservoirs 
during the drilling of nine wells in  
the Soviet era. Between 2004-2014, 
69 wells and side-tracks have been 
drilled under the PSA.
Our drilling target in 2014 was 
10-12 wells and side-tracks. This was 
not met due to the declining oil price 
during the second half of the year 
with eight wells drilled in total.
During 2015, we plan to complete 
a total of eight wells in line with our 
strategy to move more reserves from 
the Probable to Proven category.

On-site facilities
Location
All our facilities are close to major 
international railway lines, as well as 
several major oil and gas pipelines. 
This advantageous location provides 
access to flexible transportation links 
for the off-takers of our products. 
Our on-site facilities have grown 
substantially, with our second 
US$1.2 billion capital investment 
phase currently underway.
Crude oil infrastructure
Our oil infrastructure consists of 
an oil treatment and gathering 
facility (OTF), capable of processing 
400,000 tonnes of crude oil per year; 
a 120-kilometre oil pipeline; oil 
gathering and transportation lines; 
an oil-loading facility at the rail 
terminal; oil storage facilities for up 
to 30,000 cubic metres of oil and 
railway cars for the associated crude 
oil and stabilised liquid condensate.
Oil and stabilised condensate 
pipeline and railway loading 
terminal
Our 120-kilometre oil pipeline and 
railway-loading terminal, at Rostoshi 
near Uralsk, were successfully 
completed in 2008. Since 2009, our 
crude oil has been transported via 
the pipeline from the Chinarevskoye 
field site to the railway-loading 
terminal where it is stored and 
transported by railcar to final 
off-takers. 
Our stabilised liquid condensate 
is also transported through the same 
pipeline using a “PIG” system, which 
separates the crude oil from the 
stabilised condensate. This protects 
the product’s quality from being 
reduced as it would in a multi-purpose 
pipeline and ensures the ability to 
command higher export prices.
Our oil pipeline has a maximum 
throughput of 3 million tonnes 
per year. The rail-loading terminal, 
which receives the crude oil and 
condensate, has a capacity of 
3-4 million tonnes per year. 
Our infrastructure also includes 
crude oil storage tanks on site and 
at the rail terminal; condensate tanks 
on site and at the terminal and 
a loading facility at the railway 
terminal. The loading terminal allows 
for 32 railcars to be loaded 
simultaneously. The facility is also 
equipped with a vapour recovery 
unit – the first in Kazakhstan’s history.
All of our infrastructure has the 
capacity to accommodate the 
planned increase in throughput, 
in line with our strategy to double 
production. Strategic report

Subsoil rights acquisition 
completed
In 2013, Nostrum signed an asset 
purchase agreement to acquire 
100% of the subsoil use rights 
related to three oil and gas fields  
in the pre-Caspian Basin to the 
north-west of Uralsk. The signing  
of the supplementary agreements  
by the Ministry of Oil & Gas became 
effective from 1 March 2013.
Geology
Exploration activities over the past 
decades have successfully showed 
that the three fields contain 
hydrocarbons suitable for 
commercial production in several 
reservoirs of Permo-Carboniferous 
age. More specifically, the bulk 
of the hydrocarbons are located 
in the Bashkirian stage of the 
Carboniferous. Significant appraisal 
of the existing accumulations and 
exploration of deeper intervals is still 
required prior to their development. 
Appraisal programme
The cost of the appraisal programme 
for the next 2-3 years is expected to 
be approximately US$85 million. 
During 2014, we have processed 
and interpreted the 3-D seismic 
survey of Rostoshinskoye, and 
completed the re-processing and 
re-interpretation of Darjinskoye 3-D 
and Yuzhno-Gremyachenskoye 3-D 
seismic surveys. A new reserves 
report will be prepared after drilling 
of new appraisal wells. The results of 
the reserves report will determine 
the development programme as well 
as provide greater detail on reservoir 
size and fluid composition. 
Total combined reserves
At Nostrum, we have an outstanding 
track record of converting reserves. 
An updated reserve report by 
Ryder Scott, as at 31 December 
2014, has shown 571.1 mmboe 
of proved and probable reserves 
for the Chinarevskoye and 
additional fields.
In line with our strategy, we are 
continuing to grow the reserve  
base and successfully increase 
production further. Strategic report

Sales and pricing policy 
We closely monitor the production, 
marketing and transportation of  
our liquids as this makes up the 
largest proportion of our revenues. 
We are able to achieve a relatively 
high netback for our export 
production due to the transportation  
of our products through our own 
infrastructure and the resulting 
quality guarantees. 
The commercial production of dry 
gas adds significant benefits through 
the easy off-take of dry gas volumes 
using straightforward pipeline 
logistics, the generation of our own 
power supply, and the partially 
sponsored supply of dry gas to 
neighbouring communities.
Marketing
Our sales and marketing department 
employs experienced traders.  
The team is constantly working 
towards negotiating new off-take 
contracts and identifying efficient 
transportation options for these  
new products.
Development of infrastructure
The gas treatment facility uses  
a gas utilisation concept, and was 
designed to treat raw gas from gas 
condensate reservoirs (and the 
associated gas coming from the OTF)
into 3 separate products – stabilised 
condensate, LPG and dry gas. 
The GTF associated infrastructure 
includes a power generation station, 
an LPG storage tank farm, an LPG 
loading facility at the rail terminal, 
LPG railcars and a 17km dry gas 
pipeline.
GTU 1 & 2
This included the construction of  
two gas treatment units, each with 
the capacity to treat approximately 
850m cubic metres of raw gas. 
The gas treatment facility is now 
producing at capacity with an 
average annual production of  
44,400 boepd for 2014.
GTU 3
The third unit of the gas treatment 
facility will add 2.5 billion cubic 
metres of processing capacity, 
bringing the total to 4.2 billion cubic 
metres and consequently more than 
doubling production. The third unit 
of the gas treatment facility is due 
to be completed during 2016.
Power generation plant 
The gas-fired power generation 
plant is linked to the gas treatment 
facility with an output of 15 megawatts, 
and provides the field site with the 
electricity it requires.
Gas pipeline
Nostrum has its own 17km gas 
pipeline which was completed 
in 2011 and is linked to the 
Orenburg-Novopskov gas pipeline. 
The maximum annual throughput 
of this pipeline is several billion 
cubic metres.
New field camp facilities
A new employee camp was 
completed in 2012 at the field site, 
providing more than 460 beds and 
modern facilities, as well as a canteen, 
recreational areas and a health clinic. 
This ensures comfortable indoor 
living conditions throughout the year 
for our field site employees.
The stable production for 2014 shows 
the facility operating in a steady manner 
and at full capacity. We expect this 
to remain unchanged until GTU3 is 
completed.

Industrial waste management and contaminated soil 
reclamation
Nostrum complies with all current Kazakh legislation with 
regard to industrial waste management and contaminated 
soil reclamation.
Our greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting 
Nostrum has been monitoring and reporting its GHG 
emissions over the last several years in accordance with 
Kazakh regulatory requirements. Starting in 2013, the 
Company has also developed its GHG reporting in line 
with the new regulations amending company law 
requirements in the UK. 
The data is reported from all emission sources, as required 
under the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and 
Directors’ Report) – Regulations 2013. The period for 
which the Company is reporting the information matches 
the periods in respect of which the Directors’ Report is 
prepared. No responsibility is taken for any emission 
sources, which are not included in the consolidated 
financial statements. The results of the GHG emissions 
inventory are presented in the format recommended  
by the GHG Protocol.
Direct GHG emissions (Scope 1)
The following direct GHG emissions (Scope 1) sources have 
been identified: flares, heaters, incinerators, boilers, gas 
turbine plants, electric power stations, compressors and 
fugitive emissions. 2010 was chosen as the base year for 
 for 2014, pursuant to the Republic of Kazakhstan 
government resolution 1588 dated 13 December 2012.
Historically, the major part of stationary combustion 
emissions was attributed to flaring of associated gas at the 
Oil Treatment Unit (OUT) and at the Gas Treatment Facility 
(GTF). The situation has changed considerably since the 
GTF was completed.
Total direct GHG emissions (Scope 1) subdivided by 
gas types and by source types are summarised in  
Tables 1 and 2.

Indirect GHG emissions (Scope 2)
Nostrum does not use purchased steam, heating or 
cooling. The only purchased power related to indirect 
GHG emissions is electrical power, which is supplied  
to Nostrum facilities via the Zelenovskaya distribution 
network (ZapKazREK JSC), through its subsidiary 
Batys Energoresursy LLC. The regional emission factor 
(0.27086 tCO 2/MWh) was calculated using Methodological 
Guidelines for the Calculation of GHG Emissions from 
Electrical Power Stations and Boiler Houses (Astana, 2010) 
and regional net thermal efficiency of Urals Natural Gas 
Fired Power Plants (73.3%).
Total direct and indirect GHG emissions (Scope 1 and

Emissions intensity ratio
Tonnes of CO 2 per tonne of output is a recommended 
intensity ratio for the oil and gas sector, as per Appendix F 
of the Defra Environmental Reporting Guidelines (2013). 
Taking into account the variety of products of Nostrum Oil 
& Gas – crude oil, stabilised condensate, LPG and dry gas 
– the chosen intensity ratio is expressed in metric tonnes 
of CO 2e (mtCO 2e) per tonne of oil equivalent (mmboe). 
Table 4 shows intensity ratios for total (Scope 1 and 
Scope 2) emissions in the period 2011 to 2014.

Developing a GHG reduction capacity
According to its GHG emissions reduction strategy, 
Nostrum evaluates the potential for GHG emissions 
reductions yearly to plan for the subsequent introduction 
of energy and resource saving measures. To establish this 
reduction potential we go through the following steps:
 emissions enterprise management systems (GHG EMS);
 monitoring;
 facilities;
 at industrial sites;
 development;
 finance activities; and
 emissions reduction measures.
To meet these ambitious targets, Nostrum plans to 
 
for managers and identify contractors that are able to 
provide effective assistance in improving energy efficiency 
and reducing GHG emissions. Strategic report

Profit for the year 146,425 18.7% 219,519 24.5%
For the year ended 31 December 2014 (the “reporting period”) realised profit of the Group decreased by US$73.1 million 
to US$146.4 million (FY 2013: US$219.5 million). The decrease in realised profit is mainly driven by a decrease in the oil 
prices during the second half year of 2014, resulting in a decrease in revenue combined with an increase in other 
operating costs and income tax expenses, partially offset by a gain on derivative financial instruments.
Revenue
The Group’s revenue decreased by 12.6% to US$781.9 million for the reporting period (FY 2013: US$895.0 million). 
The decrease in Group revenue was driven primarily by a significant decrease in the overall oil prices during the second 
half of 2014.

Financial report Regulatory information Additional disclosures
Costs for government profit share decreased by 
US$26.2 million to US$4.6 million for the reporting period 
(FY 2013: US$30.7 million). The decrease resulted from the 
adoption of a new work program for oilfield operations 
and a change in the coefficient of natural gas equivalent 
which resulted in a reversal of the government profit share 
expense from prior periods amounting to US$17.8 million.
Materials and supplies expenses decreased by 10.9% 
to US$10.9 million for the reporting period (FY 2013:  
US$12.3 million). This decrease resulted from less need for 
spare parts and other materials for repairs and maintenance 
of the facilities, specifically for the gas treatment facility 
and wells. 
Well workover costs increased by 125.3% to US$6.3 million 
for the reporting period (FY 2013: US$2.8 million). The 
increase resulted from the scheduled work on several wells.
Management fees are absent in cost of sales for the 
reporting period (FY 2013: US$3.6 million). The fees 
incurred by the Group relate to the services provided 
by Probel Capital Management N.V., which was acquired 
by the Group on 30 December 2013 and is now being 
consolidated. The related costs of this entity are included 
in general and administrative expenses for the reporting 
period as professional services (related to the rendering 
of geological, geophysical, drilling, technical and other 
consultancy services) and payroll and related taxes.
General and administrative expenses
General and administrative expenses decreased by 2.0%  
to US$54.9 million for the reporting period (FY 2013:  
US$56.0 million). This was primarily due to an increase  
in expenses for professional services, payroll and related 
taxes, which was partially offset by decreased management 
fees, other taxes and training. The change in the structure 
of general and administrative expenses can be explained 
by the acquisition of Probel Capital Management N.V.  
on 30 December 2013, which led to the elimination of 
intercompany management fees, and the recognition  
of its expenses as professional services and payroll and  
related taxes.
The following table shows the Group’s revenue 
breakdown by export/domestic sales for the years 
ended 31 December 2014 and 2013 is presented below:
In thousands of  
US Dollars 2014 2013 Variance Variance, %
Revenue from 
export sales 676,064 765,029 (88,965) (1 1.6)%
Revenue from 
domestic sales 105,814 129,985 (24,171) (18.6)%
Total 781,878 895,014 (1 13,136) (12.6)%
Cost of sales
Cost of sales decreased by 22.5% to US$221.9 million 
for the reporting period (FY 2013: US$286.2 million). 
The decrease is primarily explained by a decrease in 
depreciation, depletion and amortisation, royalties, 
government profit share, repair, maintenance and other 
services, materials and supplies expenses, although this is 
partially offset by an increase in payroll and related taxes, 
well workover costs and other expenses. On a boe basis, 
cost of sales decreased by US$3.29 or 19.4% to US$13.69 
for the reporting period (FY 2013: US$16.98) and cost of 
sales net of depreciation per boe decreased by US$3.05, 
or 30.7%, to US$6.88 (FY 2013: US$9.92).
Depreciation, depletion and amortisation decreased by 
7.1% to US$110.5 million for the reporting period (FY 2013: 
US$119.0 million). The decrease is mainly due to an increase 
in proved developed reserves starting from 31 August 
2013, which was partially offset by an increase of production 
volumes.
Repair, maintenance and other services decreased by  
31.6% to US$35.8 million for the reporting period (FY 2013: 
US$52.4 million). These expenses include maintenance 
expenses related to the gas treatment facility and other 
facilities of the Group, engineering and geophysical study 
expenses. These costs fluctuate depending on the planned 
works on certain objects.
Royalties, which are calculated on the basis of production 
and market prices for the different products, decreased by 
38.2% to US$24.3 million for the reporting period (FY 2013: 
US$39.4 million). This decrease resulted from the reversal 
of royalty expenses from prior periods amounting to  
US$5.5 million. The reversal was due to the adoption of  
a new work program for oilfield operations and a change  
in the coefficients used for converting condensate, sales 
gas and LPG volumes into natural gas equivalent volumes. Strategic report

Selling and transportation expenses
Selling and transportation expenses increased by 0.5%  
to US$122.3 million for the reporting period (FY 2013: 
US$121.7 million). The significant decrease in transportation 
costs and increase in loading and storage costs is primarily 
due to transportation costs including certain loading and 
storage costs for the prior year. Part of the increase in 
loading and storage costs was driven by a rise in sales 
volumes for LPG and condensate.
Finance costs
Finance costs increased by US$18.3 million to US$61.9 
million for the reporting period (FY 2013: US$43.6 million). 
The increase in these costs was primarily driven by the 
expenses relating to the early redemption of the 2010 
Notes and the amortization of the remainder of transaction 
cost, incurred for the issuance of 2010 Notes. 
Finance costs – reorganisation
The “finance costs – reorganisation” represent the costs 
associated with the introduction of Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC 
as the new holding company of the Group and respective 
reorganisation.
Derivative financial instruments
The “Gain on derivative financial instruments” represents 
the fair value of the hedge that the Group entered into on 
3 March 2014 and which runs through 29 February 2016. 
Other
Foreign exchange losses amounted to US$4.2 million  
for the reporting period (FY 2013: US$0.6 million). This  
is explained by the fact that on 11 February 2014 the  
Tenge was devalued against the US Dollar and other  
major currencies. The exchange rates before and after 
devaluation were 155 Tenge/US Dollar and 185 Tenge/ 
US Dollar respectively. Since the Group had a net asset 
position of Tenge denominated accounts around this date, 
the devaluation of the Tenge resulted in a significant foreign 
exchange loss recognised in the reporting period.
Other expenses increased by 94.8% to US$49.8 million 
for the reporting period (FY 2013: US$25.6 million). Other 
expenses mainly represent export duties paid by the 
Group. The export duties represent custom duties for the 
export of crude oil and customs fees for services such as 
processing of declarations, temporary warehousing etc. 
Other expenses for the reporting period also include fines 
and penalties amounting to US$2.6 million, which were the 
result of court decisions. 
Income tax expense increased by 16.0% to US$165.3 million 
for the reporting period (FY 2013: US$142.5 million).  
The increase in income tax expense is primarily due to an 
increased deferred tax for the reporting period. This was 
driven by the Tenge devaluation in February 2014, which 
led to a significant decrease in the tax base of property, 
plant and equipment, which is denominated in Tenge.

Net cash flows from operating activities
Net cash flow from operating activities was US$349.6 million 
for the reporting period (FY 2013: US$358.6 million) and 
was primarily attributable to:
 US$311.7 million (FY 2013: US$362.0 million), adjusted 
by a non-cash charge for depreciation, depletion 
and amortisation of US$111.9 million (FY 2013: 
US$120.4 million), and finance costs of US$61.9 million

trade receivables of US$36.5 million (FY 2013: an increase 
of US$12.6 million), an increase in prepayments and 
other current assets of US$7.7 million (FY 2013: an 
increase of US$6.8 million), an decrease in trade payables

and an increase in other current liabilities of US$0.3 million 
(FY 2013: US$8.8 million).
 US$154.5 million).
Net cash used in investing activities
The substantial portion of cash used in investing activities  
is related to the drilling programme and the construction 
of a third unit for the gas treatment facility.
Net cash used in investing activities for the reporting 
period was US$305.1 million (FY 2013: US$239.0 million) 
due primarily to the drilling of new wells resulting in cash 
spent of approximately US$126.8 million (FY 2013: 
US$108.1 million), costs associated with the third gas 
treatment unit of approximately US$142.8 million (FY 2013: 
US$12.4 million) and costs associated with Rostoshinskoye, 
Darjinskoye and Yuzhno-Gremyachinskoye fields of  
US$10,4 million (FY 2013: 5,0 million), partially offset by 
the redemption of US$30.0 million of cash deposits 
(FY 2013: redemption of US$25 million and placement 
of US$30.0 million of bank deposits).
Net cash (used in)/provided by financing activities
Net cash provided from financing activities during 
the reporting period was US$147.5 million, primarily 
attributable to the issue of the 2014 Notes amounting 
to US$400.0 million, offset by an early redemption of the 
2010 Notes amounting to US$92.5 million, payment of 
US$64.6 million in distributions and the finance costs paid 
on the Group’s 2010 Notes, 2012 Notes and 2014 Notes. 
Net cash used in financing activities during the FY 2013 
was US$132.4 million, which was mainly represented by

Cost of sales increased by US$48.0 million, or 20.2%, to 
US$286.2 million in the year ended 31 December 2013 from 
US$238.2 million in the year ended 31 December 2012 
primarily due to an increase in depreciation, depletion and 
amortisation, royalties, government profit share, materials 
and supply expenses and changes in stock, partially offset 
by a decrease in payroll and related taxes, well workover 
costs and repair and maintenance expenses. The increase 
of 20% in cost of sales is in line with the increase in revenue 
in 2013 of 21% compared to 2012. On a boe basis, cost 
of sales decreased marginally by US$0.5, or 2.86%, to 
US$16.98 in the year ended 31 December 2013 from 
US$17.48, and cost of sales net of depreciation per boe 
decreased by US$0.12, or 1.20%, to US$9.92 in the year 
ended 31 December 2013 from US$10.04 in the year 
ended 31 December 2012.
Depreciation, depletion and amortisation increased by 
17.4%, or US$17.6 million, in the year ended 31 December 
2013 to US$119.0 million from US$101.4 million in the 
year ended 31 December 2012. The increase is due to an 
increase of production without a similar increase in proved 
developed reserves during the period.
Royalty costs are calculated on the basis of production 
and market prices for the different products. Royalties rose 
15.2% to US$39.4 million up from US$34.2 million in the  
year ended 31 December 2013, whereas production was  
up 25% to an average production of 46,178 boepd in 2013 
up from 36,940 boepd in 2012. The average brent price  
for the year was down 0.6% to US$108.41 per bbl from  
US$109.03 per bbl in 2012.
Costs for government profit share increased by 
US$22.8 million, or 288.6%, to US$30.7 million in the year 
ended 31 December 2013 from US$7.9 million in the year 
ended 31 December 2012, mainly due to the fact that the 
cost oil balance which had been carried forward from 
previous years was depleted in August 2013, causing the 
Government share to substantially rise in the second half 
of 2013.
Materials and supply expenses, taken together with repair, 
maintenance and other services and well workover costs 
increased 1.5% to US$67.4 million in 2013 up from 
US$68.4 million in 2012. The increase of 132% in materials 
and supplies from US$5.3 million in 2012 to US$12.3 million 
in 2013 is the result of repair and maintenance works 
in 2013 being focused on the facilities, specifically the 
Gas Treatment Facility, and less so on wells. 
General and administrative expenses decreased by  
US$4.4 million, or 6.8%, to US$60.4 million in the year 
ended 31 December 2013 from US$64.9 million in the year 
ended 31 December 2012 due primarily to a decrease in 
social programme expenditures of US$21.5 million in the 
year ended 31 December 2013 from US$21.8 million in the 
year 31 December 2012. This decrease was related to the 
completion in 2012 of construction of a 37 kilometre asphalt 
road accessing the field site with no similar expense 
incurred in 2013. The decrease in social costs was primarily 
offset by increased management fees and professional 
services. 
Selling and transportation expenses increased by  
US$18.1 million, or 17.5%, to US$121.7 million in the year 
ended 31 December 2013 from US$103.6 million in the year 
ended 31 December 2012. This was driven primarily by an 
increase of US$15.4 million in loading and storage costs to 
US$37.0 million in the year ended 31 December 2013 from 
US$21.6 million in the year ended 31 December 2012. This 
increase was primarily driven by the rise in output of LPG 
and condensate volumes.
Finance costs decreased by US$3.2 million, to  
US$43.6 million in the year ended 31 December 2013 from 
US$46.8 million in the year ended 31 December 2012.  
The decrease in costs was primarily driven by the raise  
of a new bond in November 2012 with significantly lower 
interest rate with which the first bond was repaid. 
Foreign exchange loss amounted to US$636 thousand in 
the year ended 31 December 2013 compared to a gain  
of US$776 thousand in the year ended 31 December 2012.
Other expenses increased to US$25.6 million in the year 
ended 31 December 2013 from US$6.6 million in the year 
ended 31 December 2012. The increase in other expenses 
was due to the increase in export duties paid by the Group. 
The export duties represent custom duties for export  
of crude oil and customs fees for its services such as 
processing of declarations, temporary warehousing etc. 
The Kazakhstan custom authorities, based on their 
interpretation of CIS free-trade legislation, have imposed 
custom duties on oil exports from Kazakhstan to Ukraine 
starting from December 2012. 
Profit before income tax amounted to a profit of  
US$362.0 million in the year ended 31 December 2013 
compared to a profit of US$282.4 million in the year ended 
31 December 2012. The higher profitability was driven 
primarily by the increased revenue due to the increase  
in output of the gas treatment facility. Strategic report

Financial review continued
Income tax expense increased to US$142.5 million in 
the year ended 31 December 2013 compared to  
US$120.4 million in the year ended 31 December 2012,  
a 18.4% increase. The increase in income tax expense was 
primarily due to the increase in profit before income tax.
Net income amounted to US$219.5 million in the year 
ended 31 December 2013, an increase of US$57.5 million 
from US$162.0 million in the year ended 31 December 
2012. This higher profitability was driven by increased 
revenue from increased production of hydrocarbons.

 attributable to (i) an increase in receivables of  
US$12.6 million, (ii) an increase in prepayments and  
other current assets of US$6.8 million and (iii) an increase 
other current liabilities of US$8.8 million.
 Net cash used in investing activities
The substantial portion of cash used in investing activities  
is related to the drilling programme and the construction of 
gas treatment units one, two and three. During the period 
from 1 January 2010 through 31 December 2013, cash used 
in the drilling programme represented between 43% and 
70% of total cash flow from investment activities. During the 
period from 1 January 2010 through 31 December 2013, 
cash used in the construction of gas treatment units one, 
two and three represented between 14% and 40% of total 
cash flow from investment activities. Together, drilling and 
the construction of the gas treatment units represented 
between 57% and 92% of cash used for investment in 
property, plant and equipment.
Net cash used in investing activities was US$239.0 million 
for the year ended 31 December 2013 due primarily to the 
drilling of new wells (US$108.1 million), costs associated 
with the third gas treatment unit and Rostoshinskoye, 
Darjinskoye and Yuzhno-Gremyachenskoye fields, the 
placement of US$30.0 million of cash deposits partially 
offset by the redemption of US$25.0 million of short-term 
bank deposits and the acquisition of Probel for which  
a payment was made of US$28.4 million. On 30 December 
2013, Nostrum Oil & Gas Coöperatief U.A. signed a 
purchase agreement to acquire 100% of Probel Capital 
Management N.V.. See “Related Parties and Related Party 
Transactions”.
Net cash used in investing activities was US$269.7 million

Risk management
Identification and assessment of the Group’s key risks 
The Board acknowledges its responsibility for determining 
the significant risks which may potentially affect the Group 
in achieving its strategic objectives. A Group-wide risk 
assessment is performed periodically to identify the  
nature and extent of such risks and determine respective 
mitigating actions.
During 2013 the Group formalised the Director’s Risk 
Register, which identified the risks and associated 
mitigating control activities and future actions. These 
identified risks were aggregated and categorised into  
the following risk categories:



Based on this risk register and further analysis and 
discussions, the executive management and the Board 
periodically review previously identified significant risks, 
update their likelihood of occurrence and potential impact, 
and identify potential new significant risks emerging as a 
result of the changing environment. These significant risks 
are discussed in more detail below in the section “Principal 
risks and uncertainties”.
Risk assessment and management
The Group has in place risk management processes and 
procedures and is currently in the process of formalising 
them into a Risk Management Policy, which will reflect the 
following interaction chart and key management principles:

Principal risks and uncertainties
Strategic risks Description of risk Risk management
Development 
projects
The Group’s planned development 
projects, in particular GTU3 and well 
drilling, are subject to customary risks 
related to delay, non-completion and 
cost overruns, which could impact future 
production. 
The Group has engaged an experienced 
international project management firm to 
assist with its development of GTU3 and 
is contracting with reputable international 
equipment suppliers employing proven 
technologies for the project. The timing and 
scope of the drilling programme is also 
tailored taking into account the states of the 
GTU3 project and the oil price development.
Commodity 
price risk
The Group is exposed to the risk that 
its future earnings will be adversely 
impacted by changes in the market price 
of crude oil, given that all sales prices 
of crude oil and condensate are based 
on market prices. Crude oil prices are 
influenced by factors such as OPEC 
actions, political events and supply and 
demand fundamentals. 
The Group could also be compelled by 
governmental authorities, purportedly 
acting based on Kazakh legislation, to sell 
its gas domestically at prices determined 
by the Kazakh government, which could 
be significantly lower than prices which 
the Group could otherwise achieve.
The Group’s hedging policy is that, upon 
entering into longer term non-scalable capital 
expenditure commitments, it will hedge up to 
a maximum of 70% of its liquids production. 
Currently, the hedge in place is in the order of 
30% of the liquids production. The instrument 
the Group has been employing is a zero-cost 
capped-collar. Such a contract fixes the floor 
and ceiling price at a certain predetermined 
level, with the limitation of the ceiling price at 
a certain range. The Group intends to maintain 
the same hedging policy going forward. 
In relation to the gas sales price, based  
on the terms of its PSA and applicable law the 
Group does not believe that such legislation 
is applicable in its subsoil use of the 
Chinarevskoye field and has conveyed such 
a view to the Kazakh government.
Operational risks Description of risk Risk management
Single revenue 
source and 
business 
interruption
The Group’s activities in the Chinarevskoye 
oil and gas condensate field are currently 
the Group’s sole source of revenue.
In 2013 the Group acquired subsurface use 
rights for three oil and gas fields near the 
Chinarevskoye field. In 2014 the Group 
developed a work programme for the initial 
drilling of one well in each of these fields 
before the end of 2015. Due to the depressed 
oil price environment, it is currently proposed 
to drill one of these wells in 2015 and scale 
back drilling of the other two wells. The Group 
also has a team of dedicated specialists who 
assess further possible acquisitions of oil 
and gas fields and assets. 
Estimation of  
oil and gas 
reserves
The Group is subject to the risk that if 
there are inaccurate assessments and 
overstatement of the oil and gas reserves 
the Group’s non-current assets and 
goodwill may be overstated or impaired. 
This may also be a consequence of 
unsuccessful exploration of the new 
fields and may also result in inappropriate 
decision-making.
The Group has a department of highly skilled 
geologists, who perform periodic assessment 
of the oil and gas reserves in accordance 
with international standards on reserve 
estimations. The results of the assessments 
are audited by the Group‘s independent 
reserve auditor, Ryder Scott. Strategic report Corporate governance
Annual Report 2014 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC 61
Financial report Regulatory information Additional disclosures
Compliance risks Description of risk Risk management
Subsoil use 
agreements
The Group may have disagreements 
with the Kazakh government regarding 
its subsoil operations or compliance with 
the terms of its subsoil use agreements. 
The Group believes that it is in full compliance 
with the terms of its subsoil use agreements 
and maintains an open dialogue with Kazakh 
governmental authorities in this regard. In the 
event of any non-compliance the Group will 
pay any applicable penalties and fines.
Environmental 
compliance
The legal framework for environmental 
protection and operational safety is 
not yet fully developed in Kazakhstan 
and, given the changing nature of 
environmental regulations, there is a 
risk that the Group will not be in full 
compliance with all such regulations 
at all times. 
The Group has strengthened its HSE 
department over the past 18 months, is 
regularly developing its internal HSE policies 
and has performed its first audit of supplier 
compliance with such policies. The Group 
also regularly commissions independent 
environmental audits to monitor its 
compliance and best practice in this area. 
Perceived risk of 
non-compliance 
with anti-bribery 
legislation
There is a risk that the Group’s employees 
will unintentionally or deliberately take 
actions prohibited by anti-bribery 
legislation given the perceived 
heightened risk in the jurisdiction in 
which the Group operates.
The Group has adopted an anti-bribery 
and corruption policy, and has included 
a provision on this subject in the Group’s 
Code of Conduct and conducted training for 
employees in relation to their obligations in 
this area.
Financial risks Description of risk Risk management
Tax law 
uncertainty
The uncertainty of application, including 
retroactive application, of tax laws and 
the evolution of tax laws in Kazakhstan 
create a risk of additional payments of 
tax from assessments which the Group 
believes are inapplicable to it. 
The Group regularly challenges, either with 
the Kazakh tax authorities or through the 
Kazakh courts, tax assessments that it believes 
are inapplicable to it, either pursuant to the 
terms of its subsoil use agreements or 
applicable law. 
Going concern 
and liquidity risk
The Group is subject to the risk of 
encountering difficulties in raising funds 
to meet commitments associated with 
its financial liabilities and respective 
inappropriateness of going concern 
assumptions. 
Liquidity requirements are monitored on 
a monthly basis and management ensures 
that sufficient funds are available to meet 
any commitments as they arise. The treasury 
policy requires the Group to maintain a 
minimum level of cash of US$50 million. 
The risks listed above do not comprise all those associated with the Group’s business and are not set out in any order of 
priority. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to management, or currently deemed to be less material, 
may also have an adverse effect on the Group’s business. The risks listed above are continuously monitored by the 
management team and assessed when making business decisions.
This strategic report is approved by the Board.

Chairman’s overview
Dear shareholder
Nostrum attaches a high priority to good practice in 
corporate governance, the system by which the Group 
is directed and managed, and is committed to 
implementing good corporate governance practices 
in the interests of all of our stakeholders. Adopting 
and implementing good corporate governance is 
a core principle of the Group’s relations with investors, 
employees, customers, suppliers and business partners.
I am pleased with the way in which the Group has 
embraced and addressed the demands of the additional 
regulatory obligations made applicable to the Group 
as a result of the Company moving to a premium listing 
on the London Stock Exchange. In particular, as regards 
the UK Corporate Governance Code published by the 
Financial Reporting Council, in the few areas where 
Nostrum does not fully comply with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code the Company has valid reasons 
for such non-compliance which are explained in this 
section of the Annual Report and on the governance 
section of Nostrum’s website http://www.
nostrumoilandgas.com/en/corporate-governance.
The scope of activity of our Board committees has 
changed significantly over the past 12 months as they 
have worked to fulfil their obligations under their terms 
of reference and those under the relevant provisions of 
the UK Corporate Governance Code and other regulatory 
requirements applicable to the Company as a result 
of its premium listing. 
In particular, the nomination and governance committee 
has discussed and considered issues of succession 
planning and suitable profiles for future Board candidates 
and the remuneration committee has focused a great 
deal of its attention this year on developing the 
Company’s first remuneration policy, which will be put 
to a shareholder vote at the AGM this year in line with 
recently enacted regulations, and our first remuneration 
report.
The Board and the Group as a whole continuously take 
into account corporate governance considerations 
when making plans and setting out the Group’s strategy 
and priorities.
As a result of the premium listing both Sir Christopher 
Codrington, Bt. and Mark Martin joined the Board on  
19 May 2014 as non-executive directors. I am delighted  
to welcome Sir Christopher and Mark to the Board. 
I am fortunate to act as chairman of a board of directors 
possessing diverse sectoral experience, ages and 
geographic and ethnic backgrounds. We value diversity 
on the Board and we will seek to foster diversity, including 
gender diversity, going forward. We believe that the 
directors have the appropriate mix of skills, experience, 
independence and knowledge to enable them to 
discharge their duties and responsibilities effectively. 
We pride ourselves on taking a practical rather than 
formalistic approach to corporate governance as we 
endeavour to act in the interests of all our stakeholders.  
I am pleased with the way in which the Group has 
complied with the higher standards of corporate 
governance applicable to it since the premium listing  
and am looking forward to maintaining our good 
standards of corporate governance during the year ahead.

Corporate governance approach
Introduction
Corporate governance is very important to Nostrum 
and the Board promotes high standards of corporate 
governance. The Company fully complies with all provisions 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”)  
with the exception of those matters set out on page 71, 
in respect of which the reasons for the divergence from  
the Code position is explained.
The Board considers all of its non-executive directors, 
other than Piet Everaert and Pankaj Jain, to be independent 
within the meaning of such term as defined in the Code. 
Piet Everaert and Pankaj Jain are not deemed to be 
independent as a result of having been nominated by 
Claremont Holdings C.V. (a Dutch limited partnership 
indirectly controlled by Frank Monstrey, the chairman of 
the Company, and his spouse) and Mayfair Investments B.V., 
respectively, who are the two largest shareholders in the 
Company.
The Code recommends that the Board should appoint one 
of its independent non-executive directors to act in the 
capacity of senior independent director. Eike von der Linden 
serves in such capacity as the Board’s senior independent 
director.
The Board has appointed an audit committee, a 
remuneration committee and a nomination and 
governance committee. The members of these committees 
are appointed principally from among the independent 
directors and all appointments to these committees are for 
a period of one year. The terms of reference of the various 
committees have been drawn up in accordance with the 
provisions of the Code.
Each committee and each director has the authority to 
seek independent professional advice where necessary 
to discharge their respective duties, in each case at the 
Company’s expense. In addition, each director and 
committee has access to the advice of the Company 
Secretary, Thomas Hartnett.

How the Board works
The Board schedules four regular meetings during the 
course of the year and in addition meets when appropriate 
to review trading performance, budgets and funding, set 
and monitor strategy, examine acquisition opportunities 
and report to shareholders.
The Board has a formal schedule of matters reserved for 
its decision which cover decisions relating to:

 Strategic report Corporate governance
Annual Report 2014 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC 69
Financial report Regulatory information Additional disclosures
The schedule is reviewed annually and is available on 
our website. Other specific responsibilities are delegated  
to Board committees.
The Board is responsible for considering all important 
management and policy matters in relation to the Company 
and the Group and has the powers and duties set out in 
the relevant laws of England and Wales and the Company’s 
articles of association. 
The key responsibilities of the Board include:
 resources are in place for the Company to meet its 
objectives; 
 obligations to all shareholders are understood and met.
Board composition
The Board consist of nine directors. As at 31 December 
2014, in addition to the Chairman, Frank Monstrey, there 
were two executive directors and six non-executive 
directors.
Within the Board, the roles of chairman and chief executive 
are separate, with each having distinct and clearly defined 
responsibilities. The chairman, Frank Monstrey, is 
responsible for leadership of the Board and for ensuring its 
effectiveness in all aspects of its role. The chairman sets the 
agenda for Board meetings in consultation with the chief 
executive, the chief financial officer and the general counsel 
and company secretary. The chairman is also responsible 
for ensuring that the directors receive accurate, timely and 
clear information and that there is effective communication 
with the directors. The chief executive provides leadership 
to the Group, which enables the successful planning and 
execution of the objectives and strategies agreed by the 
Board. The chief executive is also responsible for care  
of the Group’s assets and, jointly with the chairman, 
representation of the Group to third parties.
Eike von der Linden as senior independent non-executive 
director provides a sounding board for the chairman and 
serves as an intermediary for the other directors when 
necessary. He is available should the need arise to convey 
concerns to the Board other than through the chairman  
or the chief executive.
The Board’s nomination committee and governance 
committee keeps the balance, independence and 
succession plans of the Board under review so as to 
maintain an appropriate balance of skills and experience 
within the Company and on the Board in accordance 
with the UK Corporate Governance Code. 
Board diversity
The Board has due regard for the importance of, and 
benefits from, diversity in its membership, including 
gender diversity, and strives to maintain an appropriate 
balance in the Board. The Board is comprised of individuals 
with diverse sectoral experience, ages and geographic 
and ethnic backgrounds.
Appointment and tenure
All executive directors have service agreements with the 
Company and all non-executive directors have letters of 
appointment with the Company. For all executive directors 
there is no term limit on their services, as the Company 
proposes all executive directors for annual re-election 
at each subsequent AGM of the Company. 
The appointment of each of the non-executive directors 
commenced on 19 May 2014. Each appointment is for an 
initial term of three years, subject to being re-elected as 
a director at each subsequent AGM of the Company. The 
letters of appointment for non-executive directors do not 
set a fixed time commitment as it is anticipated that the 
time required of directors may fluctuate depending on 
demands of the Company’s business and other events.  
It is expected that directors will allocate sufficient time to 
the Company in order to discharge their duties effectively. 
Copies of the service agreements of the executive 
directors and the letters of appointment for the 
non-executive directors are available for inspection at

Whilst there are currently no women on Nostrum’s Board, 
gender diversity is important to us. The nomination and 
governance committee will be taking this into account 
when considering succession planning and suitable 
profiles for Board candidates. Corporate governance

Board evaluation 
In line with the requirements of the Code, the Company 
aims to review Board effectiveness annually, with Board 
effectiveness also being reviewed through an external 
performance evaluation every three years. 
In 2014 a detailed questionnaire was prepared by the 
Company Secretary and distributed to directors for their 
feedback regarding the Board’s performance and 
effectiveness. The directors were asked to provide their 
views on a range of subjects, including multiple questions 
in four principal areas: leadership, effectiveness, 
accountability and engagement.
Key findings and action items coming out of the 
self-evaluation include the following:
 the Board in Board meetings had not been distributed 
sufficiently in advance of meetings and that 
communication between Board meetings could be 
improved. The Company has entered into a contract  
with an external service provider for the creation of  
a board portal designed to improve the efficiency of  
the information-sharing process and timeliness of the 
distribution of Board materials and other information 
and provide an additional platform for communication 
between directors. 
 management and internal control systems function could 
be improved. The Company hired an Internal Audit 
Manager in 2014 who is responsible for this function, 
which includes providing the Board with quarterly internal 
audit reports. In addition, the hiring of an internal audit 
manager at the level of the Company’s principal operating 
company has been adopted as an action item for 2015. 
 formally agreed goals and objectives for the review and 
monitoring of management’s performance. This has  
been adopted as an action item for 2015.
Director induction and training
Each individual joining the Board receives a full, formal 
induction package with materials on the Group’s business 
and operational, financial and legal matters. They also 
participate in discussions with members of the Board and 
representatives of major shareholders in order to obtain a 
good understanding of the challenges and opportunities 
faced by the Group. Directors are often given the 
opportunity to discuss their training and development 
needs and to make recommendations to the chairman 
regarding topics on which they would like to receive 
training. 
The Company held a reservoir management workshop on 
17 February 2014 in Berlin, which covered topics such as 
production performance, key subsurface events in 2013, 
geology and reservoir engineering and the Group’s drilling 
and wellwork plan for 2014 in relation to the Chinarevskoye 
field. In addition, a training day was held for directors 
on 24 March 2014 in Frankfurt, Germany, which covered 
corporate governance topics including inside information 
and compliance with the Companies Act 2006, the Listing 
Rules and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules. 
In response to requests from directors, a training day was 
also organised for 19 March 2015 and covered business 
and governance topics including but not limited to: (i) crisis 
management; (ii) self evaluation of director’s performance; 
and (iii) regulatory updates.
Shareholder engagement
Nostrum is in regular contact with its shareholders. 
We regularly issue press releases, we attend investor 
conferences globally and our quarterly, half-yearly and 
annual results are always followed by an investor call. We 
are available for shareholder meetings with management 
and welcome enquiries. We are continually reacting to 
feedback to ensure our communications are in line with 
requests. Extensive information is available on our website, 
where shareholders or those with an interest in the  
Group can log their details to receive email updates. All 
shareholders are encouraged to attend the AGM to discuss 
the progress of the Group.
Availability of the relevant corporate governance code
The UK Corporate Governance Code is publicly available 
on the website of the UK Financial Reporting Council.
UK Corporate Governance Code Compliance
Nostrum complied throughout 2014 with the provisions 
of the Code, except in the following aspects:
A.3.1 The chairman does not meet the independence 
criteria set out in B.1.1 of the Code, in part given his 
executive position in the Company. Companies owned 
and controlled by the chairman acquired the Group’s 
assets outright in 2004 and the chairman has been a 
leading driver behind the successful development of the 
business since that date. As such, the other members of the 
Board consider that the chairman’s continued involvement 
as an executive director is important for the future of the 
business, given the chairman’s experience and expertise 
in the development of the Group’s oil and gas assets 
in Kazakhstan. Corporate governance
72 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2014
Corporate governance approach continued
Introduction
B.1.2 Given that the chairman fulfils an executive role 
and Piet Everaert and Pankaj Jain are not categorised as 
independent directors as a result of having been nominated 
by Claremont Holdings C.V. (“Claremont”) and Mayfair 
Investments B.V. (“Mayfair”), respectively, five of the nine 
directors on the Board are not considered independent for 
the purposes of the Code. Mayfair, whilst not considered 
independent for the purposes of the Code, is independent 
of the other shareholders in the Company. Mayfair has 
no alignment with any other major shareholder and hence 
Mayfair’s nominee to the Board is considered to be 
independent in character and judgement with no 
relationships that directly affect his judgement and no 
single group is therefore able to exercise majority influence 
over the Board as a whole. 
In order to provide additional protections to the Company 
in respect of these areas of non-compliance with the Code, 
in 2014 the Company entered into relationship agreements 
with each of Claremont and KazStroyService Global B.V. 
(“KSS Global”). On 30 January 2015 Mayfair (an affiliate 
of KSS Global) acquired 48,333,300 ordinary shares in the 
Company from KSS Global and pursuant to a deed of 
adherence of the same date undertook to the Company 
to be bound by the terms of the relationship agreement 
previously signed between the Company and KSS Global 
and to observe and perform all of the provisions and 
obligations of such relationship agreement in so far as 
they fall to be observed or performed on or after the date 
of the transfer.
Policies
The Company has adopted a share dealing code, which 
incorporates the Model Code as published in the Listing 
Rules and applies to the directors, senior management 
and other relevant employees of the Group. 
Bribery and corruption are significant risks in the oil and gas 
industry and as such the Company operates a group-wide 
anti-bribery and corruption policy, which applies to all 
Group employees and contractor staff. The policy requires 
annual bribery and corruption risk assessments; risk-based 
due diligence on all parties with whom the Company does 
business; appropriate anti-bribery and corruption clauses  
in contracts; and the training of personnel in anti-bribery 
and corruption measures. In addition, the Company’s code 
of conduct requires that employees or others working  
on behalf of the Company do not engage in bribery or 
corruption in any form.
In addition, the Company has adopted a whistle-blowing 
policy that takes account of the Whistle-blowing 
Arrangements Code of Practice issued by the British 
Standards Institute and Public Concern at Work.
Board Committees
The Board has a nomination and governance committee,  
an audit committee and a remuneration committee. Further 
details on each of these committees can be found in their 
reports on pages 74 to 91. The terms of reference of each  
of these committees can be found on our website at  
http://www.nog.com/en.
The committees are provided with all necessary resources 
to enable them to undertake their duties in an effective 
manner. The company secretary acts as secretary to the 
committees. The minutes of the committee meetings are 
circulated to all directors.
Meetings of the Board and its committees are scheduled 
for March, May, August and November each year. Directors 
unable to attend a Board meeting because of another 
engagement are provided with the briefing materials and 
can discuss issues arising in the meeting with the chairman 
or the chief executive. In addition to scheduled Board 
meetings, there are generally other ad hoc meetings called 
to deal with specific matters as and when they arise.

Letter from the Chairman
Eike von der Linden
Chairman, Audit Committee  
Senior independent  
non-executive director
Chairman’s introduction 
In 2014 the committee continued to focus on the 
appropriateness of the Group’s financial reporting, 
which involved reviewing the adequacy of related 
disclosures, reviewing the Group’s assessment and 
management of key risks, reviewing the Group’s 
systems of internal control, establishing an internal 
audit function, and overseeing the relationship with 
Ernst & Young LLP , the Group’s external auditor.  
The committee has also focused on the effect that  
the significant decline in oil prices is likely to have  
on any of the committee’s key areas of focus.
I would like to take this opportunity to formally 
welcome Sir Christopher Codrington, Bt. who joined 
the committee on 19 May 2014 and who brings with 
him a wealth of experience in the oil and gas industry.
The committee has met four times during 2014. 
As Chairman of the committee I also meet regularly 
with our external auditor and the Group’s internal audit 
manager to obtain their independent views on the 
Group’s potential risk areas and to discuss any areas  
of concern identified by the committee. Subsequent  
to the monthly management reports, discussions took 
place between the audit committee members and 
conclusions have been drawn and, when considered 
necessary, recommendations have been made to the 
executive management.
Meetings of the committee usually take place just  
prior to a Board meeting to maximise the efficiency  
of the committee’s interaction with the Board and,  
as Chairman of the committee, it is my responsibility  
to report to the Board on key topics discussed at 
committee meetings to ensure that all Directors are 
informed of the committee’s work.
I believe that the committee consists of members with  
the correct balance of skills and experience to allow the 
committee to perform its tasks effectively whilst being 
supported by management, external auditor and the 
Group’s internal audit manager.

The membership of the committee has been selected 
with the aim of providing a wide range of financial and 
commercial expertise necessary to meet its responsibilities 
and all members of the committee are considered to have 
the required recent and relevant financial experience.
The committee meets on a quarterly basis or additionally 
as and when required. The chief financial officer and the 
internal audit manager are also invited to the meetings 
together with the external auditor. 
In addition to these activities, on a monthly basis the 
members of the committee are updated by management 
and the internal audit manager on key issues and 
developments including the status of the Group’s strategic 
initiatives, financial performance, risk management and 
internal controls. In the last quarter of 2014, the oil price 
impact on the financial results were assessed by the audit 
committee.
Activities of the Audit Committee during the year
Below is a summary of the major activities of the committee 
during the year, which include: compliance with corporate 
governance standards, financial reporting, external audit; 
internal audit, internal controls and risk management, 
significant issues and related actions and the committee 
review.
The committee held four meetings in 2014 and three 
between the beginning of 2015 and the publication date  
of this annual report. Committee members were present 
in person at four of the meetings, while three meetings 
were conducted by conference call.
Compliance with corporate governance standards 
Nostrum’s approach to corporate governance is primarily 
based on the UK Corporate Governance Code published 
by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) and the Listing 
Rules of the UK Listing Authority. 
As of 31 December 2014, Nostrum complied with all the 
principles and provisions of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code, in relation to the work of the committee. 
The Chairman of the committee and external auditor 
participated in an annual reporting and accounts workshop 
organised by the Finance Team together with other 
departments in October 2014. As part of the workshop 
an experienced partner from Ernst & Young LLP gave 
an overview of best practice strategic and governance 
reporting as well as changes in related standards.
Nostrum has also established a Group whistle-blowing 
policy and has appointed two compliance liaison officers; 
one Russian speaking compliance liaison officer based 
in Kazakhstan and a further Dutch and English speaking 
compliance liaison officer based in Brussels, to ensure 
that all Group employees have access to someone who 
can provide them with support and guidance on their 
rights and obligations regarding whistle-blowing. The 
audit committee has close contact with the compliance 
liaison officers.
Financial reporting
While reviewing the draft quarterly and annual financial 
statements as well as the annual report the committee 
focused on challenging: 
 disclosures made with financial reporting standards and 
relevant corporate governance requirements; 
 management, which are discussed in more detail in the 
section entitled “Significant issues and related actions” 
below; and
 balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Group’s performance, business model and strategy.  Corporate governance
76 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2014
Audit Committee Report continued
Any questions and comments arising from such review 
as well as significant issues raised by the external auditor  
were discussed with management at meetings of the 
committee. Subsequently, based on its overall assessment 
the committee recommended that the Board approve 
the financial statements. 
The committee continuously provides feedback to 
management on ways to improve the effectiveness and 
clarity of the Group’s corporate reporting and has 
encouraged management to support and adopt initiatives 
by regulatory bodies which would enhance the Group’s 
reporting.
External audit 
 
the detailed audit plan prepared by Ernst & Young LLP (UK) 
which identifies the audit scope, and their assessment  
of key risks. The key risks monitored by the committee 
coincide with those identified and assessed by 
management and the external auditor. These risks and 
remediating actions are explained in detail in the section 
entitled “Significant issues and related actions” below. 
All members of the committee support the application 
of professional scepticism by the Group’s external auditor. 
During 2014 and 2015 the members of the committee held 
several private meetings with the external auditor, which 
provided a mutual opportunity for open dialogue and 
feedback without management being present. Topics 
covered at such meetings include: the external auditor’s 
assessment of significant risks and related management 
actions, confirmation that there has been no restriction in 
the scope placed on them by management, the adequacy 
of the audit fees, the independence of their audit and how 
they have exercised professional scepticism. 
The effectiveness of the external auditor will be evaluated 
by the committee each year and takes into account the 
quality of the work and communication undertaken by  
the external auditor and the level of audit fees.
The committee reviewed the 2014 H1 interim and 2014 
annual auditor’s reports giving particular consideration to 
the audit procedures and findings in the areas of significant 
judgements and estimates. The committee also reviewed 
the letter of representation to be signed by management 
in respect of both the interim review and the annual  
audit. Lastly, the committee, together with the relevant 
management, considered the external auditor’s 
management letter following the 2014 audit, and reviewed 
the steps proposed by management in response to the 
findings. 
Appointment of external auditor
Ernst & Young LLP (Kazakhstan) was the auditor of 
the predecessor group of companies since 2007, 
and continued auditing Zhaikmunai LLP in 2014, while 
Ernst & Young LLP (UK) was appointed as an auditor of the 
Group on 19 May 2014 based on the recommendation 
of the committee and upon approval by the Company’s 
shareholders. 
Mr Richard Addison assumed the role of lead audit partner 
from Ernst & Young LLP (UK) for the 2014 Group audit in 
compliance with the requirements for the rotation of lead 
audit partners once every five years.
In 2015 the Group intends to adopt a policy on the Group’s 
external audit, which details the Group’s requirements for, 
amongst other things, external auditor selection and 
non-audit services. The committee also considered and 
took account of the guidance contained under provision 
C.3.7 of the UK Corporate Governance Code that provides 
that companies should put their external audit contract 
out to tender at least once every ten years.
Non-audit services
The committee monitors the external auditor to ensure that 
it does not provide non-audit services that are prohibited 
by the UK Auditing Practices Board (APB), and limits such 
services to due diligence services, other assurance services 
and tax compliance and advisory services. 
In 2014, non-audit fees totalled US$1,089 thousand 
(2013: US$397 thousand) including US$730 thousand 
for assurance and due diligence services related to the 
premium listing (2013: US$252 thousand), US$319 thousand 
(2013: US$105 thousand) for quarterly reviews of the interim 
financial statements, US$40 thousand for tax compliance 
services. Notwithstanding a relatively significant amount of 
non-audit fees, the audit committee is satisfied that adequate 
safeguards to ensure Ernst & Young’s independence are in 
place. The committee concurred with the external auditor’s 
position that the majority of non-audit services have been 
of a one-off nature and do not impair the external auditor’s 
independence.
In 2015 the Group is formalising its procedures relating to 
non-audit services in the abovementioned policy regarding 
the Group’s external audit. It is expected that the policy will 
require that non-audit services may only be provided by 
the external auditor where the external auditor maintains 
the necessary degree of independence and objectivity  
and standard supplier selection procedures are carried out. 
The policy will be under review and may be amended from 
time to time as necessary. Strategic report Corporate governance
Annual Report 2014 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC 77
Financial report Regulatory information Additional disclosures
Internal audit 
The committee receives quarterly reports and monthly 
updates from the Group’s chief financial officer and internal 
audit manager throughout the year. The monthly report 
summarises current business performance and issues 
and the quarterly report provides information on internal 
audit findings and any action to be taken by management 
as a result.
During 2014 the Group developed its internal audit 
function and hired an internal audit manager. In connection 
with this an internal audit charter has been adopted, which 
develops a three-year internal audit plan and sets out the 
responsibilities of the internal audit function. The primary 
role of the internal audit function is to help the Board and 
executive management to protect the assets, reputation 
and sustainability of the organisation. This is intended 
to be achieved through:
 the Group; 
 processes so that they operate effectively and efficiently 
and reflect leading practice; and
 and assurance across the Group.
The Company’s ongoing process for identifying, evaluating 
and managing the significant risks faced by the Group 
accords with the FRC’s ‘Internal Control: Revised Guidance 
for Directors on the Combined Code‘ (formerly, the 
‘Turnbull Guidance’). The system is designed to manage 
rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives and can only provide reasonable and not 
absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
The Group’s aim during 2015 is to develop the internal 
audit function further by hiring additional staff and refining 
the terms of the internal audit charter in consultation with 
the committee to ensure that it is effective and meets the 
requirements of the business. 
Internal controls and risk management 
The committee has been focusing on the Group’s risk 
assessment and management system. A comprehensive 
financial procedures report (dated 20 May 2014), was 
developed by the Group during the process of the 
premium listing and was reviewed by the committee. The 
committee adopted the director’s risk register and actively 
participates in further enhancing it. The Group is in the 
process of developing the internal controls manual and 
formalising the risk management policy. Particular attention 
is paid by the committee to the areas of risk management 
related to ensuring adequate maintenance of accounting 
records and accurate recording of transactions, which 
permit the preparation of financial statements in 
accordance with IFRS. In view of the oil price fluctuation, 
the committee focused on the review of impairment testing 
and going concern.
The committee also reviewed and challenged the Group’s 
significant risks identified by the external auditor, and 
reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s risk management 
framework related to such risks.
The Committee review 
The committee undertakes an annual evaluation of its 
performance and effectiveness. 
Concerns were raised in May 2014 evaluation as to 
the adequacy of the induction material. Therefore, during 
the year suitable and detailed induction material was 
prepared and provided to Sir Christopher Codrington, Bt. 
as the newest member of the committee.
In March 2015 the committee used a survey which 
examined governance processes such as the mix of 
experience and skills amongst members, meeting content, 
information, training and resources. Areas of focus for 2015 
arising from the evaluation include monitoring the length 
of committee papers, the inclusion of broader business 
topics on the agenda and suggestions for further 
committee training. Aside from this observation, the 
committee concluded that its mandate and oversight 
performance were appropriate.  Corporate governance

Significant issues and related actions
The following are the key risks and issues that the committee focused on during 2014:
Significant issues Committee actions
Recoverability of non-current assets’ carrying values 
The Group performs impairment testing of goodwill on an annual basis as 
required by IFRS. Moreover, the continuing fall in market oil prices since 
 and exploration & evaluation assets. The impairment testing is subject  
to application of management judgement and various assumptions, 
underlying the calculation of the value in the use of this single cash 
generating unit, being the achievability of the long term business plan 
and the macroeconomic and related modelling assumptions underlying 
the valuation process.
 
The committee continuously reviewed the detailed reports on impairment 
testing prepared by management and challenged the appropriateness 
of the assumptions made. Areas of focus were the achievability of the 
business plans, as well as assumptions in relation to oil prices and 
discount rates, which have been subject to volatility given the current 
macroeconomic conditions. Special consideration was also given to the 
sensitivity analysis in relation to these assumptions. This has also been one 
of the main areas of audit focus and Ernst & Young LLP provided detailed 
reporting on these matters to the committee.
Oil & gas reserves estimation and accounting
Oil & gas reserves, which are estimated by the Group’s reserve 
engineers and audited by the independent reserve engineers, are used  
to calculate the depletion of oil & gas assets, and also used as input data 
for impairment testing models. Judgements and estimates are used when 
estimating the oil & gas reserves. 
 
The committee reviewed judgemental aspects of the reserve estimation 
report as part of the Group’s annual due diligence process. It also 
examined the governance framework for the oil and gas reserves  
process, training for staff and developments in regulations and controls.
Revenue recognition
The timing of revenue recognition in accordance with Incoterms, the 
recognition of revenue on a gross or net basis, and the treatment of 
discounts are complex areas of accounting.
 
The committee has reviewed the Company’s policy and controls in relation 
to revenue recognition and specifically compliance with PSA.
Related party transactions and disclosures 
This has been assessed as a significant risk area due to the inherent 
complexity of identifying related parties and the extensive disclosure 
requirements of IAS 24 regarding related party disclosures as well as 
the past history of significant related party transactions carried out 
by the Group.
 
The committee has been monitoring the procedures in place for the 
identification of related parties and ensures that pre-approvals are 
obtained before entering into contracts with them. Also the committee 
considered any observations made by the auditor as part of their reporting 
to the committee.
GTU3 construction and well drilling
There are internal and external factors threatening the ability of the Group 
to achieve its strategic objectives such as the construction of GTU3 and 
well drilling. These include, but are not limited to, inadequate project 
management, supplier delays, availability of financial and other resources 
and cost overruns.
 
The construction of GTU3 and the drilling programme were one of the key 
areas of focus for the committee in 2014, particularly in light of the decline 
in oil prices. The committee has been reviewing monthly reports prepared 
by management and meeting regularly to discuss and identify potential 
problems and to provide advice on future steps to be taken by the Group.
Tax contingencies and compliance with PSA 
The Group is subject to risks associated with uncertainties surrounding 
the application of tax laws in Kazakhstan as well as the uncertainties 
and complexities of the calculation of taxes and other obligatory 
contributions under its production sharing agreement. As a result, 
management is required to make judgements and estimates in relation 
to provisioning for related taxes and contributions.
 
The committee considered management reports setting out the results 
of assessments in relation to significant taxes and other contributions 
to the government. Having received input from the external auditor and 
challenging decisions made, the committee agreed with management’s 
assessment of the provision to be recognised in respect of taxes and 
uncertain tax positions, (Transfer pricing and social commitments) 
and the associated disclosures.
Provisions and contingencies 
The recognition of provisions for the future decommissioning of oil & 
gas assets at the end of their economic lives requires management’s 
judgement when estimating settlement dates, the scope of work, 
technology and legal requirements. Also the level of provisioning for 
contingent and other liabilities is an issue where management and  
legal judgements are important.
 
The committee reviewed management’s reports on the Group’s 
decommissioning, environmental remediation and litigation provisioning, 
including key assumptions used, the governance framework applied, 
discount rates and the movement in provisions over time. Strategic report Corporate governance
Annual Report 2014 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC 79
Financial report Regulatory information Additional disclosures
Significant issues Committee actions
Going concern 
The determination that the Group will continue on a going concern basis 
for the foreseeable future requires management to exercise judgement.
 
The committee considered the reports prepared by management and 
their assumptions and concluded that management’s recommendation 
to prepare the accounts on a going concern basis was appropriate. 
The committee also discussed these reports and assumptions with 
the external auditors.
Derivative financial instruments 
The estimation of the fair value of derivative financial instruments involves 
the use of judgement and estimations in relation to oil price volatilities by 
both external service providers and management. In addition, there are 
risks associated with the complexity of accounting and disclosures related 
to derivative financial instruments.
 
The committee reviewed management’s report on the valuation of 
derivative financial instruments and the respective disclosures made in 
 the notes to the financial statements. The external auditor’s conclusions  
on the valuation models were also discussed at committee meetings.
Information security risks 
Given its public nature the Group needs to ensure that its environment 
is sufficiently secure to protect it against the risk of loss or corruption 
of sensitive information. Failure to adequately protect such information 
could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s reputation and may 
lead to legal action against the Group.
 
At its quarterly meetings, the Committee pays attention to information 
security related matters and discusses with the management past and 
planned actions directed at addressing the recommendations from 
external consultants.
Environmental compliance 
Given the changing nature of environmental regulations in Kazakhstan, 
there is a risk that the Group will not be in full compliance with all 
regulations at all times.
 
As part of the monthly management reports the committee reviewed the 
Group’s activities to ensure an appropriate level of protection for health, 
safety and the environment. The committee has also reviewed the annual 
report prepared by the independent environmental auditor outlining the 
Group’s compliance and the environmental auditor’s recommendations  
for improvement.

Chairman’s introduction 
I am pleased to report on the Nominations and 
Governance Committee, which I chair. 
As the Nomination and Governance Committee was 
established in June 2014, following the premium listing  
of the Company, it has met once this year. However,  
going forward, it is intended that it will meet at least  
twice a year and more frequently if required.

Role of the Nomination and Governance Committee
The key responsibilities of the committee are to:
 recommendations to the Board regarding candidates 
for appointment or reappointment as directors;
 board governance and corporate governance issues, to 
enable the Board to operate effectively and efficiently;
 (including skills knowledge and experience) required 
of the Board;
 Company, both executive and non-executive, with 
a view to ensuring the continued ability of the Company 
to compete effectively in the marketplace; and
 directors.
Committee meetings
Only members of the committee have the right to attend 
committee meetings. However, other individuals such 
as the chief executive, the head of human resources and 
external advisers may be invited to attend all or part of 
any meeting, as and when appropriate. 
Main activities of the committee during the year
At its initial meeting in 2014 the committee began to 
consider the desired profile of candidates for future 
Board appointments. This is a topic that the committee 
considers important and on which the committee intends 
to focus its attention throughout 2015, laying down 
criteria and key attributes for potential new directors, 
especially in terms of the experience and diversity of 
Board members.
In the year ahead the committee will continue to assess 
the performance of the Board and what changes, if any, 
should be made to the composition of the Board and  
its committees in order to maximise their effectiveness, 
and will continue to monitor developments in corporate 
governance to ensure that the Board is operating 
efficiently and in compliance with its obligations.

Remuneration Committee Report 
Letter from the Chairman
Mark Martin
Remuneration  
Committee Chair
Dear shareholder
This year is Nostrum’s first as a public company. 
The committee has endeavoured to ensure that the 
Company’s remuneration structures evolve to adopt 
aspects of good practice that are expected of a company 
with a premium listing on the London Stock Exchange.  
As such and in compliance with Large and Medium-sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
(Amendment) Regulations 2013 (the “Regulations”)  
this report has been divided into the following parts:
 messages on remuneration for the year under review;
 which proposes an overall executive remuneration 
framework that will be adopted and implemented by 
the Company in 2015 and the following two financial 
years – if approved by shareholders the policy set out  
in this part of the report will become binding with  
effect from the AGM; and
 shareholders with details of the remuneration that was 
actually paid to the Company’s directors during 2014 
and explains how the new policy referred to above will 
be applied in 2015 – this final part of the report will be 
subject to an advisory vote at the forthcoming AGM.
We have structured our remuneration policy in such  
a way that it:
 talent capable of delivering the Company’s strategic 
objectives;
 managers with the interests of our shareholders;
 complies with corporate governance best practice.
The Company’s performance and link to incentives
In 2013 the Group had a record financial and operational 
year. With record production levels of over 46,000 boepd 
and a strong oil price the Company’s performance was 
the best in its history. The Company also made its first 
steps into M&As acquiring three licences at a cost of 
less than 20 cents a 2P barrel. With this in mind, the 
Company paid bonuses to executive directors in 2014 
equal to between 30% and 35% of the amount of fixed 
compensation. This is extremely low in comparison to 
the Company’s FTSE 250 peers.
Risk management
The committee continually reviews our incentive 
arrangements to ensure they do not encourage or 
reward excessive or inappropriate financial or operational 
risk-taking. The committee has reviewed the risks 
involved in the incentive schemes and is satisfied that 
they do not encourage excessive risk taking and that the 
Company has in place adequate governance procedures 
to mitigate any principal risks.
Shareholder support and feedback
We welcome questions and feedback from all parties 
on the content and style of this report and hope that 
shareholders are supportive of the remuneration-related 
resolutions that are to be proposed at the AGM.

Annual report on remuneration
This remuneration report has been prepared in accordance 
with Part 4 of the Regulations and section 420 Companies 
Act 2006 (the “Act”). In accordance with the Regulations 
and the Act, our remuneration policy (as detailed on pages 
87-91) will be subject to a separate binding vote at the 2015 
AGM and, subject to shareholders’ approval, it is intended 
that the remuneration policy will remain in operation for 
three years. We will also seek an advisory vote on the 
remuneration report at the AGM.
Remuneration Committee 
The remuneration of the chairman, the chief executive, the 
chief financial officer, the company secretary and all other 
senior members of executive management is determined 
by the committee under delegated powers from the Board 
and in accordance with the committee’s terms of reference. 
The chairman and the executive members of the Board 
determine the remuneration of all non-executive directors, 
including members of the committees. 
In accordance with the terms of reference, members of 
the committee shall be appointed by the Board on the 
recommendation of the nomination and governance 
committee in consultation with Mr Martin as chairman  
of the committee. The committee must always include  
at least three independent non-executive directors who 
comprise a majority of the committee. The members  
of the committee during 2014 were:

None of the committee members have day-to-day 
involvement with the business. Their biographies are given 
on pages 64-65. The company secretary acts as secretary  
to the committee.
The primary responsibilities of the committee are set out 
in its terms of reference which are reviewed and updated 
annually and which are available for download on the 
Company’s website. Alternatively, copies can be obtained 
on request from the company secretary.
In summary, the committee’s key responsibilities include:
 overall framework for remuneration and its cost and, 
in consultation with the chairman and chief executive, 
determining the remuneration packages of each of the 
executive directors; 
 remuneration and the terms of their service or 
employment contracts, including share based schemes, 
other employee incentive schemes adopted by the 
Company from time to time and pension contributions;
 
that the remuneration of the executive directors of the 
Company and other senior members of executive 
management of the Company and its subsidiaries is set 
by a committee of the Board whose members have no 
personal interest in the outcomes of the decisions of the 
committee and who will have due regard to the interests 
of the shareholders; and
 relevant provisions of the Company’s remuneration policy.
The committee held two meetings in 2014. The principal 
agenda items at the formal meetings were as follows:

With the exception of the chairman of the Board, no other 
executive directors participated in the committee meetings 
during 2014.
During the year the committee received advice internally 
from Frank Monstrey (Chairman of the Board), Kai-Uwe 
Kessel (Chief Executive) and Thomas Hartnett (Company 
Secretary). The chairman and the chief executive were 
consulted on the remuneration of the other executive 
directors and senior members of executive management 
and on matters relating to the performance of the Company 
and the company secretary was consulted on regulatory 
requirements; none of the chairman of the Board, the 
chief executive nor the company secretary participated 
in decisions on their own remuneration. Members of the 
Group’s human resources team may attend relevant 
portions of committee meetings to ensure appropriate 
input on matters related to senior members of the executive 
management team below Board level.
During 2014 the Company did not engage any external 
advisers to advise on remuneration.

Notes on the single total figure remuneration table
Base salaries 
Salaries are reviewed annually in July of each year. In July 2014 salaries were increased by 1.5% for the chairman of the 
Board, the chief executive and the chief financial officer, effective as of August 2014.
The committee intends to review salaries in July 2015. In making salary determinations, the committee will consider  
the provisions of the remuneration policy.
Annual bonus
In the last financial year all executive directors were eligible for a bonus. Prior to the premium listing of the Company 
annual bonuses were determined on the basis of the Group’s performance. Going forward and in accordance with the 
Company’s remuneration policy the annual bonus opportunity absent extraordinary circumstances will be 40% of base 
compensation and will be assessed against financial and operational objectives. Refer to page 88 of the remuneration 
policy for more information in relation to the bonus policy going forward.
Long term incentive awards
In 2014 the Company did not operate a performance based long term incentive scheme. 
Pension entitlements
The Company does not operate a pension scheme and accordingly no element of remuneration is pensionable.
Payments to past directors
No payments were made to past directors of the Company during the year ended 31 December 2014.
Payments for loss of office
No payments were made in respect of loss of office during the year ended 31 December 2014.
Non-executive director fees
The annual fees for non-executive directors for 2015 will remain the same as those for 2014, being $100,000 per annum. 
Fees for non-executive directors were reviewed prior to the premium listing of the Company and in determining their 
levels the Board took account of fees paid by other premium listed companies. In addition, in August 2014 it was agreed 
that, in order to bring the Company into line with other premium listed FTSE 250 companies; (i) Eike von der Linden’s  
fees would be increased by $20,000 to reflect his additional responsibilities as senior independent director; and  
(ii) Eike von der Linden, Mark Martin and Sir Christopher Codrington, Bt. would each receive an additional $10,000 to 
reflect their roles as chairmen of the audit, remuneration and nomination and governance committees respectively.
Directors’ shareholdings
At present, and in accordance with the Company’s remuneration policy, the directors are not subject to any minimum 
shareholding requirements. 
The beneficial interests of the directors in the share capital of the Company as at 31 December 2014 is as follows:

Remuneration statistics and comparisons
Historical TSR performance
The following performance graph shows the growth in value of a notional £100 invested in the Company since the 
premium listing of the Company compared to the FTSE 350 E&P index. The committee selected the FTSE 350 E&P Index 
as the most appropriate comparator as it feels that it is a broad-based index which includes many of the Company’s 
competitors.

2  The increase in payroll and administrative expenses is mainly is driven by the 
acquisition of Probel Capital Management N.V. (now named Nostrum Services N.V.)  
on 30 December 2013, which led to the elimination of the initial management fees  
and recognition of its expenses as payroll and related taxes.
3  These distributions were paid before the reorganisation when the Company was  
an LP and so we refer to them as “distributions”.
For further information on dividends and expenditure  
on remuneration for all employees please see the notes

Service contracts
Details of the executive directors’ service contracts and 
the non-executive directors’ letters of appointment can

of this annual report. All directors are subject to annual 
re-appointment and accordingly all executive and 
non-executive directors will stand for re-election at the AGM.

Directors’ remuneration policy
This sets out the remuneration policy (the “Policy”) for  
the Board which, if approved by shareholders at the AGM, 
will take effect from the date of that meeting and will be 
effective until the Company’s 2018 AGM, unless a further 
policy is proposed by the Company and approved by 
shareholders in the meantime.
Policy coverage
This policy applies automatically to the following: 1) all 
executive directors of the Company and the company 
secretary, 2) any other senior members of the executive 
management of the Group, 3) any other member of the 
executive management of the Group as may be required 
by the Board, and 4) any grant of shares, options or similar 
securities or rights relating to more than 10,000 Company 
shares. 
Policy objectives
This policy is designed to:
 retains high calibre directors, managers and employees 
capable of delivering the Company’s strategic objectives.
 
in a manner that is consistent with best practice and 
aligned with the interests of the Company’s shareholders.
 managers with the interests of the Company’s 
shareholders, and ensure that rewards are justified  
by performance.
 members of the executive management takes into 
account: (i) pay and conditions throughout the Company; 
and (ii) corporate governance best practice including 
health & safety, environmental, social and governance 
risks.
Peer group
For the purposes of benchmarking appropriate 
compensation, the committee currently regards the 
following companies as the most relevant peer group  
for Nostrum:

 for scarce skills within the industry.
 which compete for expatriate and local staff.
Risk management
The committee will review incentive arrangements regularly 
to ensure that they comply with the risk management 
systems, and that controls are operating effectively. The 
committee also ensures that inappropriate operational or 
financial risk-taking is neither encouraged nor rewarded 
through the Company’s remuneration policies. Instead, 
a sensible balance will be struck between fixed and variable 
pay, short and long term incentives and cash and equity.
The committee has access to the Audit Committee and 
senior executive management as and when required to 
discuss any matters of risk assessment.
Nostrum operates in an industry that is inherently subject  
to operational risks. Particular emphasis is therefore  
placed on ensuring that health and safety best practice is 
reinforced by this policy. The committee consults regularly 
to ensure that this is the case.
Ongoing review of policy
The committee will periodically review whether this policy 
is operating appropriately. Any actions arising from this 
review will be assigned to an appropriate person with a 
deadline to report back to the committee. The level and 
structure of the compensation system will also be reviewed 
annually by the committee.

Phantom share option plan
The Company operates the Plan in accordance with 
the Plan rules, the Listing Rules, the Disclosure and 
Transparency rules and other applicable rules. In order 
to retain talent, options are generally granted in tranches 
exercisable at the following times:
 option is granted, from the first anniversary of the date 
of grant;
 which an option is granted, from the second anniversary 
of the date of grant;
 which an option is granted, from the third anniversary 
of the date of grant;
 which an option is granted, from the fourth anniversary 
of the date of grant; and
 of which an option is granted from the fifth anniversary 
of the date of grant.
The Board retains discretion over a number of areas relating 
to the operation and administration of the Plan, which 
include, but are not limited to; (i) who participates; (ii) the 
timing of the grant of award; and (iii) the size of the award.
Treatment of existing arrangement
For the avoidance of doubt, authority is given to the 
Company to honour any commitments entered into with 
current or former directors notwithstanding the approval 
of the Policy. This will last until the existing incentives vest 
(or lapse) or the benefits of any contractual arrangements 
no longer apply.
Remuneration scenarios for executive directors
The bar charts below provide estimates of the potential 
remuneration of the executive directors for 2015. Three 
scenarios are presented for each executive director:  
(i) “minimum” remuneration, reflecting no bonus award;  
(ii) “on target” remuneration, where the Board’s 
expectations for the executive director’s performance have 
been met and a bonus of 25% of base salary is awarded; 
and (iii) “maximum” remuneration, where the Board’s 
expectations for good performance by the executive 
director have been exceeded and a bonus of 40% of base 
salary is awarded. At present, the executive directors do 
not receive any pension or any long term compensation. 
According to the policy of the Boards, benefits are not 
expected to be a significant component of remuneration. 
In 2015, only Mr Kessel is expected to receive benefit 
payments directly. Benefits are not paid to Mr Monstrey and 
Mr Muller. Instead, Mr Monstrey and Mr Muller are paid 
a base salary out of which they may arrange any benefits 
themselves. 
The bar charts below do not include any amounts in relation 
to the Phantom Share Option Plan because: (i) as at the time 
of this annual report the Board is not able to determine 
whether any options will be issued under the Phantom 
Share Option Plan in 2015 (as described in the Executive 
Directors’ remuneration policy, option awards will only be 
made on the basis of achieving concrete long term 
objectives defined in advance by the committee and will 
vest over several years); and
(ii) as at the date of this annual report, any options vesting in 
2015 in respect of awards made from prior years would not 
generate proceeds to the executive directors at the current 
share price.

Directors’ remuneration policy
Recruitment
The committee expects any new executive directors to be

the committee acknowledges that it cannot always predict 
the circumstances under which any new executive director 
may be recruited and so accordingly, in each case, the 
committee will consider:

with best practice and aligned with the interests of the 
Company’s shareholders.

retain flexibility should be considered in order for the 
committee to be able to set base salary at a level 
necessary to facilitate the hiring of the highest calibre 
candidates including awards or payments to compensate 
for remuneration arrangements forfeited on leaving 
a previous employer. The committee would require 
reasonable evidence of the nature and value of any 
forfeited compensation and would, to the extent 
practicable, ensure any compensation awarded was no 
more valuable than the forfeited award.

Non-executive directors
The Chairman and executive directors set the remuneration 
package for non-executive directors in line with the 
non-executive directors’ Remuneration Policy Table above 
and subject to the Company’s Articles of Association 
(the “Articles”).
Non-executive director appointment letters
All non-executive directors of the Company were appointed 
on 19 May 2014. The Company intends to comply with 
provision B.7.1 of the UK Corporate Governance Code and 
accordingly all directors will stand for re-election by 
shareholders at future AGMs until the Board determines 
otherwise. 
Each appointment is for an initial term of three years, 
subject to being re-elected at each Annual General 
Meeting, save that a non-executive director or the 
Company may terminate the appointment at any time upon 
one month’s written notice, or that a non-executive director 
may be required to resign at any time in accordance with 
the Articles of the Company, the UK Corporate Governance 
Code or for any regulatory reason such as the revocation  
of approvals required from the FCA.
Each of the non-executive directors is entitled to an annual 
fee paid quarterly and to reimbursement of reasonable 
expenses. There is no entitlement for non-executive 
directors to participate in the Plan.
The non-executive directors are not permitted to take up 
any office or employment with, or have any direct or indirect 
interest in any firm or company that is in direct or indirect 
competition with the Company without the consent of the 
Board. Upon termination of the appointment and where 
such termination is for any reason other than due to the 
non-executive director’s gross misconduct, material breach 
of the terms of the appointment, act of fraud or dishonesty 
or wilful neglect of the non-executive director’s duties, the 
non-executive director will be paid a pro rated amount of 
their fees in respect of the period between the beginning  
of the quarter in which termination took place and the 
termination date. Otherwise none of the non-executive 
directors are entitled to any damages for loss of office and 
no fee shall be payable in respect of any unexpired portion 
of the term of the appointment.
Statement of consideration of employment conditions 
elsewhere in the Company
We have not consulted with employees on the executive 
remuneration policy. However, when determining the policy 
for executive directors we have been mindful of the pay 
and employment conditions of employees across the 
Group as a whole.
Statement of consideration of shareholder views
Senior executive management of the Company regularly 
meets with shareholders and solicits their views on the 
Company’s policies in relation to director and executive 
remuneration, and takes such views into account when 
formulating remuneration policies and remuneration 
levels in specific cases. Corporate governance

Directors, articles and purchase of shares
The Articles were adopted on 19 May 2014 and may only 
be amended by special resolution at a general meeting 
of the shareholders.
The directors’ powers are conferred on them by UK 
legislation and by the Articles. In accordance with the 
Articles the Board has the power at any time to elect any 
person to be a director. Any person so appointed by the 
directors will retire at the next AGM in accordance with

Employment policies and equal opportunities
The Group is an inclusive and equal opportunity 
employer and complies with all applicable laws governing 
employment practices. The Group has also adopted and 
implemented policies and procedures which cover the 
recruitment, selection, training and development, and 
promotion and retirement of its employees.
Nostrum aims to create a workplace that has an open 
atmosphere of trust, honesty and respect. Harassment or 
discrimination of any kind based on race, religion, national 
origin, age, gender, disability, sexual orientation or political 
opinion or any other similarly protected characteristic 
is not tolerated. This principle applies to all aspects of 
employment from recruitment and promotion through 
to termination and all other terms and conditions of 
employment.
It is the Group’s aim that all employment policies are fair 
and equitable and consistent with the skills and abilities 
of the employee and the needs of the business. Employees 
are free to join a trade union or participate in collective 
bargaining arrangements. 
Further details are included in “Our People” on  
pages 38 to 40.
In accordance with the Group’s Code of Conduct the 
Company’s policy is to fully comply with the UK Equality 
Act 2010, which imposes a duty on employers to make 
reasonable adjustments to help disabled job applicants, 
employees and former employees in certain circumstances 
and prohibits direct disability discrimination, discrimination 
arising from disability, indirect disability discrimination, 
harassment relating to disability and victimisation. 
Where the duty to make reasonable adjustments arises, 
the Company’s policy is to effectively treat the disabled 
person more favourably than others in an attempt to reduce 
or remove that individual’s disadvantage. 
The Company’s policy is to give full and fair consideration 
to applications for employment made by disabled people. 
Disabled job applicants and employees are encouraged 
to tell the Company about their condition so that the 
Company can support them as appropriate. Employees 
experiencing difficulties at work because of a disability 
may contact their supervisor or the Human Resources 
Department to discuss any reasonable adjustments that 
would help overcome or minimise the difficulty. Their line 
manager or the Human Resources Department may consult 
with the disabled person and his or her medical adviser 
about possible adjustments. The Company will consider 
the matter carefully and try to accommodate the disabled 
person’s needs within reason. Support provided by the 
Company to disabled employees may include training and 
career development support. If the Company considers 
a particular adjustment would not be reasonable it will 
explain its reasons and try to find an alternative solution 
where possible.
The Company will monitor the physical features of its 
premises to consider whether they might place anyone with 
a disability at a substantial disadvantage. Where necessary, 
it will take reasonable steps to improve access.
Employee communications and involvement
The Group has processes in place for communicating 
with all its employees. Employee communications include 
information about the performance of the Group, on major 
matters affecting their work, employment or workplace. 
The Group has also developed an intranet, which assists 
in communicating with employees across borders and 
provides key information to all Group employees.
The Company also operates an employee share option 
plan further details of which can be found in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy on page 88 and the notes to the 
consolidated audited financial statements for the year 
ended 31 December 2014.  Corporate governance

 INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF NOSTRUM OIL & GAS PLC 
 
Dear members 
We present our audit report on the Group and Parent company financial statements of Nostrum Oil & Gas 
PLC (the ‘financial statements’), which comprise the Group and Parent primary statements and related 
notes. 
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 
of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s 
members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose.  
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the

101 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2014 
Consolidated financial statements 
 Our application of materiality  
Materiality is a key part of planning and executing our audit strategy. For the purposes of determining 
whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement, we define materiality as the 
magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, in light of the surrounding 
circumstances, could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of the users of the 
financial statements. As we develop our audit strategy, we determine materiality at the overall financial 
statement level and at the individual account level. Performance materiality is the application of materiality 
at the individual account level. In assessing whether errors are material, either individually or in aggregate, 
we consider qualitative as well as quantitative factors. 
Planning Materiality 
When establishing our overall audit strategy, we determined a magnitude of uncorrected and undetected 
misstatements that we judged would be material for the financial statements as a whole. We determined 
materiality for the Group to be US$ 17.0 million (2013: US$ 18.4 million) which is approximately 5% (2013: 
5%) of adjusted pre-tax profit which is explained below. We believe this provides us with a consistent year 
on year basis for determining planning materiality and the most relevant performance measure for the 
stakeholders of the group.  In 2014 profit before tax was adjusted by US$29 million mainly relating to the 
costs associated with the reorganisation of the Group that we concluded are non-recurring and therefore 
added back when calculating materiality. This provided a basis for determining the nature, timing and 
extent of risk assessment procedures, identifying and assessing the risk of material misstatement and 
determining the nature, timing and extent of further audit procedures. 
Performance Materiality 
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group’s overall control 
environment, our judgement was that overall performance materiality (i.e. our tolerance for misstatement 
in an individual account or balance) for the Group was 50% (2013:50%) of planning materiality, namely 
US$ 8.5 million (2013: US$ 9.2 million). Our objective in adopting this approach was to ensure that the 
total uncorrected and undetected audit differences did not exceed our planning materiality of US$17 
million for the financial statements as a whole. 
Reporting Threshold 
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess 
of US$ 0.85 million (2013: US$ 0.92 million), which is set at 5% of planning materiality. We report all 
corrected audit differences that in our view warrant reporting on qualitative grounds or where the corrected 
difference exceeds performance materiality. We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the 
quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light of other relevant qualitative 
considerations. 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements 
sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, 
whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accountings policies are 
appropriate to the Group’s and Parent Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed;; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors;; and 
the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial 
information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements 
and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent 
with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any 
apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.  102 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2014 
Consolidated financial statements 
 An overview of the scope of our audit  
For the Parent company – our assessment of audit risk and our evaluation of materiality determines our 
audit scope for the Parent company financial statements. This helps us to form an opinion on the company 
financial statements under the International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
For the Group - our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of that 
materiality determine our audit scope for each entity within the Group which, when taken together, enable 
us to form an opinion on the consolidated financial statements under International Standards on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland). We take into account the size, risk profile, changes in the business environment and 
other factors when assessing the level of work to be performed at each entity. The range of performance 
materiality allocated to components in 2014 was US$ 1.7 million to US$ 6.4 million. 
In establishing our overall approach to the Group audit we determined the type of work that needed to be 
undertaken at each of the components by us, as the Group engagement team, or by component auditors 
from another EY global network firm operating under our instructions.  The Group engagement team 
performed the audit of the consolidation in Amsterdam. In assessing the risk of material misstatement to 
the Group financial statements, our Group audit scope focused on the Group’s main operating locations. 
We selected five components covering entities within the Netherlands, Belgium, and Kazakhstan, which 
represent the principal business units within the Group and account for 99% of the Group’s profit before 
tax. Two of these components were subject to a full scope audit, whereas the remaining three were 
subject to audit procedures on specific accounts based on our risk assessment. The two full scope 
components account for 97% of the Group net assets, 99% of the Group’s revenue and 99% of the 
Group’s profit before tax. The specific scope locations do not have operating activities and we audited 
cash, payroll, the employee share option plan, other current liabilities and the costs associated with the 
reorganisation of the Group. 
We are satisfied that the components selected have provided an appropriate basis for undertaking audit 
work to address the risks of material misstatement identified below. The audit work performed at the five 
components was executed based on levels of materiality applicable to each individual entity. These 
materiality thresholds were lower than Group materiality. For the remaining components we assessed 
group wide controls and performed analytical reviews and enquiry procedures to address the residual risk 
of material misstatement. 
The Group audit team followed a programme of planned site visits that was designed to ensure that a 
senior member of the team visited each of the three audit locations at least once a year. In 2014, the 
Group audit team including the Senior Statutory Auditor, who leads the audit, visited Kazakhstan where 
the operations of the Group take place.  These visits involved discussing the audit approach and any 
issues arising from the work with the component team.  The Group audit team interacted regularly with the 
component team during various stages of the audit, reviewed key working papers and were responsible 
for the scope and the direction of the audit process.  This, together with the additional procedures 
performed at Group level in Amsterdam, gave us appropriate audit evidence for our opinion on the Group 
financial statements. 
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement 
We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the 
financial statements. In particular, we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements, for 
example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considered 
future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all our audits, we also addressed the risk of management 
override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there is evidence of bias by the directors that 
may represent a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.   Strategic report Corporate governance Financial report Additional disclosures Regulatory information
103 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2014 
Consolidated financial statements 
 We have identified the risks of material misstatement which had the greatest effect on the audit strategy 
and directed the efforts and resources of the engagement team to: 
 Impairment of exploration licenses and goodwill 
 Estimation of oil and gas reserves and its impact of the estimation of DDA expense 
 Revenue recognition 
 Completeness of related party transactions and the related disclosures 
 Risk of management override 
Our responses to the risk of material misstatement identified 
 Impairment of exploration licenses and goodwill 
Refer to the Group Audit Committee report on page 78, the estimates and judgments on page 123 and the disclosures  
in note 6 of the Group Financial Statements 
The potential impairment of goodwill and 
exploration licenses is a key area of audit focus 
due to their value. Further, management are 
required to make a number of significant 
judgements in determining the recognition of, 
and the carrying value of these assets and in 
determining whether there are any indicators of 
impairment. The fall in oil prices will impact 
financial performance, as well as increase the risk 
of uncommercial exploration activities and 
potential non-renewal of exploration licenses. 
We focused on this area as it involves complex and 
subjective judgements about forecasts. In evaluating 
whether any impairment was necessary to the remaining 
carrying value of goodwill and other assets, our audit 
work involved obtaining evidence regarding their 
recoverable amount.  We utilised our valuation 
specialists and challenged management’s impairment 
assessment by evaluating  the  following key 
assumptions: 
 forecast cash flows by comparing the assumptions 
used within the impairment model to the approved 
budgets, business plans and other evidence of 
future intentions; 
 forecast oil prices  were compared to independent 
external sources; and 
 the discount rate was benchmarked to the risks 
faced by the group. 
 
We assessed the historical accuracy of management’s 
budgets and forecasts by comparing them to actual 
performance. We evaluated management’s sensitivity 
analysis of goodwill impairment testing in order to 
assess the potential impact of a range of reasonably 
possible outcomes. We evaluated the financial 
statement disclosures for compliance with the 
requirements of accounting standards. 
Estimation of oil and gas reserves and its impact of the estimation of depreciation, depletion 
and amortisation (“DDA”) expense 
Refer to the Group Audit Committee report on page 78, the estimates and judgments on page 122 and the disclosures 
in note 8 of the Group Financial Statements 
This was considered to be a significant risk due 
to the subjective nature of reserves estimates and 
We gained an understanding of the Group’s internal 
process for reserves estimation and challenged  104 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2014 
Consolidated financial statements 
 their impact on the financial statements through 
impairment and DD&A calculations. Management 
has engaged a third party expert in connection 
with the estimation of reserves. 
management’s assumptions including commercial 
assumptions to ensure that they are based on 
supportable evidence.  In doing so, we have: 
 met with management’s  third party expert during 
the planning and execution of the audit and 
assessed their competence as well as that of 
internal specialists involved in due diligence 
procedures over oil and gas reserves; 
 reviewed the final oil and gas reserves estimation 
report prepared by management’s third party 
expert in light of our understanding of the business 
and agreed key financial inputs to corroborative 
evidence; and 
 assessed the reasonableness of  key assumptions 
(such as oil price, gas and LPG price, opex and 
capex per barrel) by comparing them to external 
data. 
Revenue recognition 
Refer to the Group Audit Committee report on page 78,and the disclosures of revenue in note 22 of the Group 
Financial Statements 
The risk of recognising revenue in the wrong 
period is heightened due to the complexity of the 
Production Sharing Agreement (“the PSA”) and 
the point at which title passes to the customer 
and therefore revenue can be recognised. 
 
We identified and tested controls over the sales process, 
made enquiries of management and analysed contracts 
to evaluate whether revenue was recognised in 
accordance with the terms. We specifically: 
 audited sales agreements to understand the 
contractual terms and checked compliance with 
the PSA and appropriate revenue recognition; 
 performed analytical procedures, test of details, 
cut-off testing on customer delivery notes around  
period end and tested a sample of journals relating 
to revenue; and  
 ensured that the financial statement disclosures 
were in accordance with accounting standards. 
 
Completeness of related party transactions (“RPT”) and the related disclosures 
Refer to the Group Audit Committee report on page 78 and the disclosures of related party transactions in note 32 of 
the Group Financial Statements 
As part of the premium listing on the LSE, the 
Group undertook restructuring activities and has 
entered into material contracts with related 
parties. Therefore RPTs and the related 
disclosures are considered to be a significant 
risk. 
 
In order to obtain evidence over the completeness of 
related party transactions and the related disclosures, 
we have: 
 
 obtained an understanding of the process that 
management has established to identify, account 
for and disclose RPTs and  authorise and approve 
significant RPTs and arrangements outside the 
normal course of business; 
 inspected bank and legal confirmations, minutes of 
meetings and significant agreements with new 
counterparties; 
 obtained sufficient evidence that RPTs were 
conducted on terms equivalent to an arm’s length 
transaction; 
 obtained an updated list of all related parties to the  Strategic report Corporate governance Financial report Additional disclosures Regulatory information
105 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2014 
Consolidated financial statements 
 Group and reviewed the general ledger against 
this list to ensure completeness of transactions; 
 investigated any unusual or high value 
transactions; 
 made enquiries of management in order to identify 
if any related party transactions outside the normal 
course of business have taken place; and 
 verified the completeness of disclosures in the 
financial statements. 
 
Risk of management override 
We consider the likelihood of management 
override occurring. We base our consideration 
on our understanding of the nature and risk of 
both management’s opportunity and incentive to 
manipulate earnings or financial ratios or to 
misappropriate assets. 
 
Specifically we considered the heightened 
expectations following the premium listing of the 
Group on the LSE and the sizable shareholdings 
of senior executives. 
 
We considered whether there was evidence of bias by 
the Directors in significant accounting estimates and 
judgements.  We tested journal entries and also 
assessed the control environment and interviewed 
internal audit. 
 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 97, the directors are 
responsible for the preparation of the group and parent financial statements and for being satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the group and parent 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for 
Auditors. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:  
Under the ISAs (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the 
Annual Report is:  
 materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements;; or  
 apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group

31 October 1997 between the State Committee of Investments of the Republic of Kazakhstan and Zhaikmunai LLP 
in accordance with the license MG No. 253D for the exploration and production of hydrocarbons in Chinarevskoye 
oil and gas condensate field. 
On 17 August 2012 Zhaikmunai LLP signed Asset Purchase Agreements to acquire 100% of the subsoil use rights 
related to three oil and gas fields – Rostoshinskoye, Darjinskoye and Yuzhno-Gremyachinskoye – all located in the 
Western Kazakhstan region. On 1 March 2013 Zhaikmunai LLP has acquired the subsoil use rights related to these  112 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2014 
Consolidated financial statements 
 
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 
 
 three oil and gas fields in Kazakhstan following the signing of the respective supplementary agreements related 
thereto by the Ministry of Oil and Gas (the “MOG”) of the Republic of Kazakhstan. 
The term of the Chinarevskoye subsoil use rights originally included a 5-year exploration period and a 25-year 
production period. The exploration period was initially extended for additional 4 years and then for further 2 years 
according to the supplements to the Contract dated 12 January 2004 and 23 June 2005, respectively. In accordance 
with the supplement dated 5 June 2008, Tournaisian North reservoir entered into production period as at 1 January 
2007. Following additional commercial discoveries during 2008, the exploration period under the Chinarevskoye 
subsoil use rights, other than for the Tournaisian horizons, was extended for an additional 3-year period, which 
expired on 26 May 2011. A further extension to 26 May 2014 was made under the supplement dated 28 October 
2013. The extensions to the exploration periods have not changed the Chinarevskoye subsoil use rights term, which 
expires in 2031. Zhaikmunai LLP applied to the MOG for another extension of the exploration period. 
The contract for exploration and production of hydrocarbons from Rostoshinskoye field dated 8 February 2008 
originally included a 3-year exploration period and a 12-year production period. On 27 April 2009 the exploration 
period was extended so as to have a total duration of 6 years. In January 2012 the MOG made the decision to extend 
the exploration period until 8 February 2015 and the corresponding supplementary agreement between MOG and 
Zhaikmunai LLP was signed on 9 August 2013 (Note 36). 
The contract for exploration and production of hydrocarbons from Darjinskoye field dated 28 July 2006 originally 
included a 6-year exploration period and a 19-year production period. On 21 October 2008 the exploration period 
was extended for 6 months so as to expire on 28 January 2013. On 27 April 2009 the exploration period was 
extended until 28 January 2015. On 23 January 2014 the exploration period was further extended until 31 December 
2015. 
The contract for exploration and production of hydrocarbons from Yuzhno-Gremyachinskoye field dated 28 July 
2006 originally included a 5-year exploration period and a 20-year production period. On 27 April 2009 the 
exploration period was extended until 28 July 2012. On 8 July 2011 the exploration period was further extended until 
28 July 2014. On 23 January 2014 the exploration period was further extended until 31 December 2015. 
Royalty payments 
Zhaikmunai LLP is required to make monthly royalty payments throughout the entire production period, at the rates 
specified in the Contract.  
Royalty rates depend on hydrocarbons recovery levels and the phase of production and can vary from 3% to 7% of 
produced crude oil and from 4% to 9% of produced natural gas. Royalty is accounted on a gross basis. 
Government “profit share” 
Zhaikmunai LLP makes payments to the Government of its “profit share” as determined in the Contract. The “profit 
share” depends on hydrocarbon production levels and varies from 10% to 40% of production after deducting 
royalties and reimbursable expenditures. Reimbursable expenditures include operating expenses, costs of additional 
exploration and development costs. Government “profit share” is expensed as incurred and paid in cash. Government 
profit share is accounted on a gross basis. 
Change in estimates 
The volumes of hydrocarbons extracted and the sales prices of the products form the basis of the royalty and 
government profit share calculations. During the year ended 31 December 2014 Zhaikmunai LLP changed the 
calculation of the coefficient of natural gas equivalent from density ratio used in the prior periods to compression 
ratio based on newly received researches on the conversion coefficient conducted by independent consultants. 
As a result Zhaikmunai LLP revised the calculations of the royalty and government profit share for the prior periods. 
This change in estimate was applied prospectively since updated information on composition of the natural gas 
became available only in 2014. Also during the year ended 31 December 2014 Zhaikmunai LLP reassessed the  Strategic report Corporate governance Financial report Additional disclosures Regulatory information

 government profit share for 2013 following the revision of the work program for the Chinarevskoye oil and gas 
condensate field operations. 
This change in estimate was applied prospectively since updated information on composition of the natural gas 
became available only in 2014. 
2. BASIS OF PREPARATION AND CONSOLIDATION 
Basis of preparation 
These consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2014 have been prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) issued by International Accounting Standards Board 
(“IASB”) as adopted by the European Union and the requirements of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules 
(“DTR”) of the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) in the United Kingdom as applicable to annual financial 
statements.  
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared based on a historical cost basis, except for certain financial 
instruments which are carried at fair value as stated in the accounting policies (Note 4). The consolidated financial 
statements are presented in US Dollars and all values are rounded to the nearest thousands, except when otherwise 
indicated. 
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical 
accounting estimates. It also requires from management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the 
Group's accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where 
assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in Note 4. 
Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Parent and its subsidiaries as at 31 
December 2014. Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its 
involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. 
Specifically, the Group controls an investee if, and only if, the Group has: 
 power over the investee (i.e., existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of 
the investee); 
 exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; 
 the ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns. 
Generally, there is a presumption that a majority of voting rights result in control. To support this presumption and 
when the Group has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee, the Group considers all 
relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee, including: 
 the contractual arrangement with the other vote holders of the investee; 
 rights arising from other contractual arrangements; 
 the Group’s voting rights and potential voting rights. 
The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes 
to one or more of the three elements of control. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control 
over the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of the subsidiary. Assets, liabilities, income and 
expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated financial statements 
from the date the Group gains control until the date the Group ceases to control the subsidiary.  114 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2014

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 
 
 Group reorganisation 
The Group has been formed through a reorganisation in which Nostrum Oil & Gas plc became a new parent entity of 
the Group (Note 15). The reorganisation is not a business combination and does not result in any change of economic 
substance of the Group. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements of Nostrum Oil & Gas plc are a 
continuation of the existing group (Nostrum Oil & Gas LP and its subsidiaries). The consolidated financial 
statements reflect the difference in share capital as an adjustment to equity (Other reserves) that is not subject to 
reclassification to income statement in the future periods. 
Going concern 
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The directors are satisfied that 
the Group has sufficient resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future, a period of not less than 12 
months from the date of this report. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
consolidated financial statements. 
3. CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND DISCLOSURES 
New standards, interpretations and amendments thereof, adopted by the Group  
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year, except for the following 
amendments to IFRS effective as at 1 January 2014: 
Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS12 and IAS 27 – Investment Entities 
These amendments provide an exception to the consolidation requirement for entities that meet the definition of an 
investment entity under IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and must be applied retrospectively, subject to 
certain transition relief. The exception to consolidation requires investment entities to account for subsidiaries at fair 
value through profit or loss. These amendments have no impact on the Group, since none of the entities in the Group 
qualifies to be an investment entity under IFRS 10. 
IAS 32 Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities – Amendments to IAS 32 
These amendments clarify the meaning of 'currently has a legally enforceable right to set-off' and the criteria for non-
simultaneous settlement mechanisms of clearing houses to qualify for offsetting and is applied retrospectively. These 
amendments have no impact on the Group, since none of the entities in the Group has any offsetting arrangements.  
Amendments to IAS 36 – Disclosures on Recoverable Amount for Non-financial Assets 
These amendments eliminate unintended consequences of IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement in part of information 
disclosure according to IAS 36 Asset Impairment. Besides, these amendments require disclosing the recoverable 
amount of assets or cash generation unit (“CGU”) on which the impairment loss was recognized or recovered during 
the reporting period. These amendments had no impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group. 
Amendment to IAS 39 Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting 
These amendments provide relief from discontinuing hedge accounting when novation of a derivative designated as a 
hedging instrument meets certain criteria and retrospective application is required. These amendments have no 
impact on the Group as the Group has not novated its derivatives during the current or prior periods. 
IFRIC 21 Levies 
IFRIC 21 clarifies that an entity recognises a liability for a levy when the activity that triggers payment, as identified 
by the relevant legislation, occurs. For a levy that is triggered upon reaching a minimum threshold, the interpretation 
clarifies that no liability should be anticipated before the specified minimum threshold is reached. Retrospective 
application is required for IFRIC 21. This interpretation has no impact on the Group as it has applied the recognition  Strategic report Corporate governance Financial report Additional disclosures Regulatory information
115 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2014 
Consolidated financial statements 
 
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 
 
 principles under IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets consistent with the requirements of 
IFRIC 21 in prior years. 
Standards issued but not yet effective 
The standards and interpretations that are issued, but not yet effective, up to the date of issuance of the Group’s 
consolidated financial statements are disclosed below. The Group intends to adopt these standards, if applicable, 
when they become effective. 
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 
In July 2014, the IASB issued the final version of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments which reflects all phases of the 
financial instruments project and replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and all 
previous versions of IFRS 9. The standard introduces new requirements for classification and measurement, 
impairment, and hedge accounting. IFRS 9 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, with 
early application permitted. Retrospective application is required, but comparative information is not compulsory. 
Early application of previous versions of IFRS 9 (2009, 2010 and 2013) is permitted if the date of initial application 
is before 1 February 2015. The adoption of IFRS 9 is not expected to have an effect on the classification and 
measurement of the Group’s financial assets and the Group’s financial liabilities. 
IFRS 14 Regulatory Deferral Accounts 
IFRS 14 is an optional standard that allows an entity, whose activities are subject to rate-regulation, to continue 
applying most of its existing accounting policies for regulatory deferral account balances upon its first-time adoption 
of IFRS. Entities that adopt IFRS 14 must present the regulatory deferral accounts as separate line items on the 
statement of financial position and present movements in these account balances as separate line items in the 
statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. The standard requires disclosures on the nature of, and 
risks associated with, the entity’s rate-regulation and the effects of that rate-regulation on its financial statements. 
IFRS 14 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016. Since the Group is an existing IFRS 
preparer, this standard does not apply. 
Amendments to IAS 19 Defined Benefit Plans: Employee Contributions 
IAS 19 requires an entity to consider contributions from employees or third parties when accounting for defined 
benefit plans. Where the contributions are linked to service, they should be attributed to periods of service as a 
negative benefit. These amendments clarify that, if the amount of the contributions is independent of the number of 
years of service, an entity is permitted to recognise such contributions as a reduction in the service cost in the period 
in which the service is rendered, instead of allocating the contributions to the periods of service. This amendment is 
effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2014. It is not expected that this amendment would be 
relevant to the Group, since none of the entities within the Group have defined benefit plans with contributions from 
employees or third parties. 
Annual improvements 2010-2012 Cycle 
These improvements are effective from 1 July 2014 and are not expected to have a material impact on the Group. 
They include: 
IFRS 2 Share-based Payment 
This improvement is applied prospectively and clarifies various issues relating to the definitions of performance and 
service conditions which are vesting conditions, including:  
 A performance condition must contain a service condition  
 A performance target must be met while the counterparty is rendering service 
 A performance target may relate to the operations or activities of an entity, or to those of another entity 
in the same group  116 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2014 
Consolidated financial statements 
 
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 
 
 A performance condition may be a market or non-market condition 
 If the counterparty, regardless of the reason, ceases to provide service during the vesting period, the 
service condition is not satisfied 
It is not expected that this amendment would have impact on the Group’s future consolidated financial statements. 
IFRS 3 Business Combinations 
The amendment is applied prospectively and clarifies that all contingent consideration arrangements classified as 
liabilities (or assets) arising from a business combination should be subsequently measured at fair value through 
profit or loss whether or not they fall within the scope of IFRS 9 (or IAS 39, as applicable). It is not expected that 
this amendment would have any impact on the Group’s future consolidated financial statements. 
IFRS 8 Operating Segments 
The amendments are applied retrospectively and clarify that: 
 An entity must disclose the judgements made by management in applying the aggregation criteria in 
paragraph 12 of IFRS 8, including a brief description of operating segments that have been aggregated and 
the economic characteristics (e.g., sales and gross margins) used to assess whether the segments are 
‘similar’ 
 The reconciliation of segment assets to total assets is only required to be disclosed if the reconciliation is 
reported to the chief operating decision maker, similar to the required disclosure for segment liabilities. 
These amendments are not expected to have any impact on the Group’s financial position or performance.  
IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment and IAS 38 Intangible Assets 
The amendment is applied retrospectively and clarifies in IAS 16 and IAS 38 that the asset may be revalued by 
reference to observable data on either the gross or the net carrying amount. In addition, the accumulated depreciation 
or amortisation is the difference between the gross and carrying amounts of the asset. These amendments are not 
expected to have any impact on the Group’s future consolidated financial statements considering that the Group's 
property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost. 
IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures  
The amendment is applied retrospectively and clarifies that a management entity (an entity that provides key 
management personnel services) is a related party subject to the related party disclosures. In addition, an entity that 
uses a management entity is required to disclose the expenses incurred for management services. These amendments 
are not expected to have effect on the Group’s future consolidated financial statements, since the Group always 
disclosed the companies providing management services as related parties. 
Annual improvements 2011-2013 Cycle 
These improvements are effective from 1 July 2014 and are not expected to have a material impact on the Group. 
They include: 
IFRS 3 Business Combinations 
The amendment is applied prospectively and clarifies for the scope exceptions within IFRS 3 that: 
 Joint arrangements, not just joint ventures, are outside the scope of IFRS 3 
 This scope exception applies only to the accounting in the financial statements of the joint arrangement 
itself  
These amendments are not expected to have impact on the Group’s future consolidated financial statements, since the 
Group has no joint arrangements.   Strategic report Corporate governance Financial report Additional disclosures Regulatory information
117 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2014 
Consolidated financial statements 
 
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 
 
 IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement 
The amendment is applied prospectively and clarifies that the portfolio exception in IFRS 13 can be applied not only 
to financial assets and financial liabilities, but also to other contracts within the scope of IFRS 9 (or IAS 39, as 
applicable). It is not expected that the amendment will have material effect on the Group’s financial position or 
performance. 
IAS 40 Investment Property  
The description of ancillary services in IAS 40 differentiates between investment property and owner-occupied 
property (i.e., property, plant and equipment). The amendment is applied prospectively and clarifies that IFRS 3, and 
not the description of ancillary services in IAS 40, is used to determine if the transaction is the purchase of an asset 
or business combination. 
These amendments are not expected to have any impact on the Group. 
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
IFRS 15 was issued in May 2014 and establishes a new five-step model that will apply to revenue arising from 
contracts with customers. Under IFRS 15 revenue is recognised at an amount that reflects the consideration to which 
an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer. 
The principles in IFRS 15 provide a more structured approach to measuring and recognising revenue. The new 
revenue standard is applicable to all entities and will supersede all current revenue recognition requirements under 
IFRS. Either a full or modified retrospective application is required for annual periods beginning on or after 1 
January 2017 with early adoption permitted. The Group is currently assessing the impact of IFRS 15 and plans to 
adopt the new standard on the required effective date. 
Amendments to IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements: Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests 
The amendments to IFRS 11 require that a joint operator accounting for the acquisition of an interest in a joint 
operation, in which the activity of the joint operation constitutes a business must apply the relevant IFRS 3 principles 
for business combinations accounting. The amendments also clarify that a previously held interest in a joint operation 
is not remeasured on the acquisition of an additional interest in the same joint operation while joint control is 
retained. In addition, a scope exclusion has been added to IFRS 11 to specify that the amendments do not apply when 
the parties sharing joint control, including the reporting entity, are under common control of the same ultimate 
controlling party. 
The amendments apply to both the acquisition of the initial interest in a joint operation and the acquisition of any 
additional interests in the same joint operation and are prospectively effective for annual periods beginning on or 
after 1 January 2016, with early adoption permitted. These amendments are not expected to have any impact to the 
Group. 
Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38: Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation 
The amendments clarify the principle in IAS 16 and IAS 38 that revenue reflects a pattern of economic benefits that 
are generated from operating a business (of which the asset is part) rather than the economic benefits that are 
consumed through use of the asset. As a result, a revenue-based method cannot be used to depreciate property, plant 
and equipment and may only be used in very limited circumstances to amortise intangible assets. 
The amendments are effective prospectively for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016, with early 
adoption permitted. These amendments are not expected to have any impact on the Group given that the Group has 
not used a revenue-based method to depreciate its non-current assets. 
Amendments to IAS 27: Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements 
The amendments will allow entities to use the equity method to account for investments in subsidiaries, joint 
ventures and associates in their separate financial statements. Entities already applying IFRS and electing to change  118 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2014 
Consolidated financial statements 
 
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 
 
 to the equity method in its separate financial statements will have to apply that change retrospectively. For first-time 
adopters of IFRS electing to use the equity method in their separate financial statements, they will be required to 
apply this method from the date of transition to IFRS. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on 
or after 1 January 2016, with early adoption permitted. These amendments are not expected to have any impact on 
the Group’s consolidated financial statements.  
4. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
Significant accounting judgments, estimates and assumptions 
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the statement of 
financial position date, that have a significant risk of causing a material change to the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities are discussed below: 
Oil and gas reserves 
Oil and gas reserves are a material factor in the Group’s computation of depreciation, depletion and amortization 
(the “DD&A”). The Group estimates its reserves of oil and gas in accordance with the methodology of the Society of 
Petroleum Engineers (the “SPE”). In estimating its reserves under SPE methodology, the Group uses long-term 
planning prices which are also used by management to make investment decisions about development of a field. 
Using planning prices for estimating proved reserves removes the impact of the volatility inherent in using year-end 
spot prices. Management believes that long-term planning price assumptions (Note 6) are more consistent with the 
long-term nature of the upstream business and provide the most appropriate basis for estimating oil and gas reserves. 
All reserve estimates involve some degree of uncertainty. The uncertainty depends mainly on the amount of reliable 
geological and engineering data available at the time of the estimate and the interpretation of this data.  
The relative degree of uncertainty can be conveyed by placing reserves into one of two principal classifications, 
either proved or unproved. Proved reserves are more certain to be recovered than unproved reserves and may be 
further sub-classified as developed and undeveloped to denote progressively increasing uncertainty in their 
recoverability. Estimates are reviewed and revised annually.  
Revisions occur due to the evaluation or re-evaluation of already available geological, reservoir or production data; 
availability of new data; or changes to underlying price assumptions. Reserve estimates may also be revised due to 
improved recovery projects, changes in production capacity or changes in development strategy. Proved developed 
reserves are used to calculate the unit of production rates for DD&A. The estimates of economically recoverable oil 
and gas reserves and related future net cash flows also impact the impairment assessment of the Group. 
Fair value of financial instruments 
Where the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the statement of financial position cannot 
be derived from active markets, they are determined using valuation techniques including the discounted cash flows 
model. The inputs to these models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a 
degree of judgment is required in establishing fair values. The judgments include considerations of inputs such as 
liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility. Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair 
value of financial instruments. 
Abandonment and site restoration provision 
The Group estimates future dismantlement and site restoration costs for oil and gas properties with reference to the 
estimates provided from either internal or external engineers after taking into consideration the anticipated method of 
dismantlement and the extent of site restoration required in accordance with current legislation and industry practice. 
The amount of the provision is the present value of the estimated expenditures expected to be required to settle the 
obligation adjusted for expected inflation and discounted at applicable rate. The Group reviews site restoration 
provisions at each date of financial position and adjusts it to reflect the current best estimate in accordance with  Strategic report Corporate governance Financial report Additional disclosures Regulatory information
119 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2014 
Consolidated financial statements 
 
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 
 
 IFRIC 1 "Changes in Existing Decommissioning, Restoration and Similar Liabilities". Estimating the future closure 
costs involves significant estimates and judgments by management. Significant judgments in making such estimates 
include estimate of discount rate and timing of cash flow. The management made its estimate based on the 
assumption that cash flow will take place at the expected end of the subsoil use rights.  
Management of the Group believes that the long term interest rates on the Eurobonds issued by the Ministry of 
Finance of the Republic of Kazakhstan shall provide best estimates of applicable risk uncorrected discount rate. The 
discount rate shall be applied to the nominal risk adjusted amounts the management expects to spend on site 
restoration in the future. The Group estimates future well abandonment cost using current year prices and the average 
long-term inflation rate. 
Due to fact that cash outflows related to abandonment and site restoration cost are mainly denominated in USD, 
during the year ended 31 December 2014 the Group revisited the assumptions used, including abandonment cost, 
US$ inflation rate and discount rates. All these changes resulted in increase of abandonment and site restoration 
provision and respective asset in the amount of US$ 4,306 thousand. These changes were accounted for 
prospectively. 
The long term inflation and discount rates used to determine the balance sheet obligation at 31 December 2014 were 
3.75% and 4.88% respectively. Movements in the provision for decommissioning liability are disclosed in Note 18. 
Taxation 
Uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation of complex tax regulations, changes in tax laws, and the amount 
and timing of future taxable income. Given the wide range of international business relationships and the long-term 
nature and complexity of existing contractual agreements, differences arising between the actual results and the 
assumptions made, or future changes to such assumptions, could necessitate future adjustments to tax bases of 
income and expense already recorded. The Group establishes provisions, based on reasonable estimates, for possible 
consequences of audits by the tax authorities of the respective counties in which it operates. The amount of such 
provisions is based on various factors, such as experience of previous tax audits and differing interpretations of tax 
regulations by the Group and the responsible tax authority. Such differences in interpretation may arise for a wide 
variety of issues depending on the conditions prevailing in the respective domicile of the Group companies. 
Foreign currency translation 
The functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which an entity operates and is 
normally the currency in which the entity primarily generates and expends cash.  
The functional currency of the Company is the United States dollar (the “US dollar” or “US$”). The functional 
currency of the Group’s subsidiaries is the US dollar, except for Condensate (functional currency of which is 
Kazakhstani Tenge (the “Tenge”). 
Transactions and balances denominated in foreign currencies 
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded by the Group’s subsidiaries at their respective functional 
currency spot rates at the date the transaction first qualifies for recognition. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the functional currency spot rates 
of exchange at the reporting date.  
All differences are taken to the profit or loss. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a 
foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items 
measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value is 
determined.  120 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2014 
Consolidated financial statements 
 
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 
 
 Business combinations and goodwill 
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the 
aggregate of the consideration transferred, measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any non-
controlling interest (“NCI”) in the acquiree. For each business combination, the Group elects whether to measure 
NCI in the acquiree at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. Acquisition 
related costs are expensed as incurred and included in administrative expenses. 
When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and 
designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the 
acquisition date. This includes the separation of embedded derivatives in host contracts by the acquiree. Those 
acquired petroleum reserves and resources that can be reliably measured are recognised separately in the assessment 
of fair values on acquisition. Other potential reserves, resources and rights, for which fair values cannot be reliably 
measured, are not recognised separately, but instead are subsumed in goodwill.  
If the business combination is achieved in stages, any previously held equity interest is re-measured at its acquisition 
date fair value, and any resulting gain or loss is recognised in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive 
income. It is then considered in the determination of goodwill. Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the 
acquirer will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. All contingent consideration arrangements classified 
as liabilities or assets arising from a business combination are subsequently measured at fair value through profit or 
loss whether or not they fall within the scope of IFRS 9 (or IAS 39, as applicable). 
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the 
amount recognised for NCI over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If the 
fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate consideration transferred (bargain 
purchase), before recognising a gain, the Group reassesses whether it has correctly identified all of the assets 
acquired and all of the liabilities assumed and reviews the procedures used to measure the amounts to be recognised 
at the acquisition date. If the reassessment still results in an excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over the 
aggregate consideration transferred, then the gain is recognised in the statement of profit or loss and other 
comprehensive income. 
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of 
impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the 
Group’s CGUs that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of 
the acquiree are assigned to those units.  
Where goodwill forms part of a Cash Generating Unit (“CGU”) and part of the operation in that unit is disposed of, 
the goodwill associated with the disposed operation is included in the carrying amount of the operation when 
determining the gain or loss on disposal. Goodwill disposed of in these circumstances is measured based on the 
relative values of the disposed operation and the portion of the CGU retained. 
Property, plant and equipment 
Exploration expenditure 
Geological and geophysical exploration costs are charged to profit or loss as incurred. Costs directly associated with 
exploration wells are capitalised within exploration and evaluation assets until the drilling of the well is complete and 
the results have been evaluated. These costs include employee remuneration and materials and fuel used, rig costs 
and payments made to contractors and asset retirement obligation fees. If hydrocarbons are found and, subject to 
further appraisal activity (e.g., the drilling of additional wells), it is probable that they can be commercially 
developed, the costs continue to be carried as an asset while sufficient/continued progress is made in assessing the 
commerciality of the hydrocarbons. 
All such carried costs are subject to technical, commercial and management review at least once a year to confirm 
the continued intent to develop or otherwise extract value from the discovery. When this is no longer the case, the  Strategic report Corporate governance Financial report Additional disclosures Regulatory information
121 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2014

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 
 
 costs are written off. The exploration expenditure expensed to profit or loss during 2014 amounted to nil (2013: US$ 
3,810 thousand). 
Subsoil use rights acquisition costs are initially capitalised in exploration and evaluation assets. Subsoil use rights 
acquisition costs are reviewed at each reporting date to confirm that there is no indication that the carrying amount 
exceeds the recoverable amount. This review includes confirming that exploration drilling is still under way or firmly 
planned, or that it has been determined, or work is under way to determine that the discovery is economically viable 
based on a range of technical and commercial considerations and sufficient progress is being made on establishing 
development plans and timing. If no future activity is planned or the subsoil use rights have been relinquished or has 
expired, the carrying value of the subsoil use rights acquisition costs is written off through profit or loss. Upon 
recognition of proved reserves and internal approval for development, the relevant expenditure is transferred to oil 
and gas properties. 
Oil and gas properties 
Expenditure on the construction, installation or completion of infrastructure facilities such as treatment facilities, 
pipelines and the drilling of development wells, is capitalised within property, plant and equipment as oil and gas 
properties. The initial cost of an asset comprises its purchase price or construction cost, any costs directly attributable 
to bringing the asset into operation and the initial estimate of decommissioning obligation, if any. The purchase price 
or construction cost is the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the 
asset. When a development project moves into the production stage, the capitalisation of certain 
construction/development costs ceases and costs are either regarded as part of the cost of inventory or expensed, 
except for costs which qualify for capitalisation relating to oil and gas property asset additions, improvements or new 
developments 
All capitalised costs of oil and gas properties are amortised using the unit-of-production method based on estimated 
proved developed reserves of the field, except the Group depreciates its oil pipeline and oil loading terminal on a 
straight line basis over the life of the relevant subsoil use rights. In the case of assets that have a useful life shorter 
than the lifetime of the field the straight line method is applied. 
Oil and gas reserves 
Proved oil and gas reserves are estimated quantities of commercially viable hydrocarbons which existing geological, 
geophysical and engineering data show to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs. 
The Group uses the reserve estimates provided by an independent appraiser on an annual basis to assess the oil and 
gas reserves of its oil and gas fields. These reserve quantities are used for calculating the unit of production 
depreciation rate as it reflects the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits by the Group. 
Advances for non-current assets 
Advances paid for capital investments/acquisition of non-current assets shall be qualified as advances for non-current 
assets regardless of the period of supplies of relevant assets or the supply of work or services to close advances. 
Advances paid for the purchase of non-current assets are recognised by the Group as non-current assets and are not 
discounted. 
Other properties 
All other property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. 
Historical cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the items. Subsequent costs are 
included in the asset's carrying amount or recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that 
future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured 
reliably. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the profit or loss during the year in which they are 
incurred. 
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:  122 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2014

Impairment of non-financial assets 
The Group assesses assets or groups of assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate 
that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Individual assets are grouped for impairment assessment 
purposes at the lowest level at which there are identifiable cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash flows 
of other groups of assets. If any such indication of impairment exists or when annual impairment testing for an asset 
group is required, the Group makes an estimate of its recoverable amount. An asset group’s recoverable amount is 
the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. Where the carrying amount of an asset group 
exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset group is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable 
amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are adjusted for the risks specific to the asset group 
and are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the 
time value of money. 
In determining fair value less costs of disposal, recent market transactions are taken into account. If no such 
transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used. These calculations are corroborated by 
valuation multiples, quoted share prices for publicly traded companies or other available fair value indicators. 
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognized 
impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such indication exists, the recoverable amount is 
estimated. A previously recognized impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used 
to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognized. If that is the case, the 
carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount. That increased amount cannot exceed the 
carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognized for 
the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognized in the profit or loss.  
After such a reversal, the depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to allocate the asset’s revised carrying 
amount, less any residual value, on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life. 
Impairment losses of continuing operations, including impairment of inventories, are recognised in profit or loss in 
those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset. 
Goodwill 
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually as at 31 December and when circumstances indicate that the carrying 
value may be impaired. Impairment is determined for goodwill by assessing the recoverable amount of each CGU (or 
group of CGUs) to which the goodwill relates. When the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than its carrying 
amount, an impairment loss is recognised. Impairment losses relating to goodwill cannot be reversed in future 
periods. 
Borrowing costs 
The Group capitalises borrowing costs on qualifying assets. Assets qualifying for borrowing costs capitalisation 
include all assets under construction that are not being depreciated, depleted, or amortized, provided that work is in 
progress at that time. Qualifying assets mostly include wells and other operations field infrastructure under 
construction. Capitalised borrowing costs are calculated by applying the capitalisation rate to the expenditures on

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 
 
 borrowings that are outstanding during the period. All other borrowing costs are recognised in the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they are incurred. 
Inventories 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value (“NRV”). Cost of oil, gas condensate and liquefied 
petroleum gas (“LPG”) is determined on the weighted-average method based on the production cost including the 
relevant expenses on depreciation, depletion and impairment and overhead costs based on production volume. Net 
realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less selling expenses. 
Provisions 
Provisions are recognized when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, 
it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a 
reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made. 
Abandonment and site restoration (decommissioning) 
Provision for decommissioning is recognized in full, on a discounted cash flow basis, when the Group has an 
obligation to dismantle and remove a facility or an item of plant and to restore the site on which it is located, and 
when a reasonable estimate of that provision can be made. The amount of the obligation is the present value of the 
estimated expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation adjusted for expected inflation and discounted 
at applicable rate. The unwinding of the discount related to the obligation is recorded in finance costs. A 
corresponding amount equivalent to the provision is also recognized as part of the cost of the related oil and gas 
properties. This asset is subsequently depreciated as part of the capital costs of the oil and gas properties on a unit-of-
production basis.  
Changes in the measurement of an existing decommissioning liability that result from changes in the estimated 
timing or amount of the outflow of resources embodying economic benefits required to settle the obligation, or 
changes to the discount rate: 
a) are added to, or deducted from, the cost of the related asset in the current period. If deducted from the cost 
of the asset the amount deducted shall not exceed its carrying amount. If a decrease in the provision exceeds 
the carrying amount of the asset, the excess is recognized immediately in the profit or loss; and 
b) if the adjustment results in an addition to the cost of an asset, the Group considers whether this is an 
indication that the new carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable. If it is such an indication, 
the Group tests the asset for impairment by estimating its recoverable amount, and accounts for any 
impairment loss in accordance with IAS 36. 
Financial assets 
Initial recognition and measurement 
Financial assets within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans 
and receivables, held-to-maturity investments, available-for-sale financial assets, or as derivatives designated as 
hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate. The Group determines the classification of its financial 
assets at initial recognition. 
All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of investments not at fair value through 
profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs. 
Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or 
convention in the marketplace (regular way trades) are recognised on the trade date, i.e., the date that the Group 
commits to purchase or sell the asset.  
The Group’s financial assets include cash, long-term and short-term deposits, trade and other receivables.  124 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2014 
Consolidated financial statements 
 
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 
 
 Loans and receivables 
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in 
an active market. After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using 
the effective interest rate method (“EIR”), less impairment. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any 
discount or premium on acquisition and fee or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. 
The EIR amortisation is included in finance income in the statement of comprehensive income. The losses arising 
from impairment are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in finance costs. 
Accounts receivable 
Accounts receivables are recognized and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectible 
amounts. An estimate for uncollectible amounts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable. 
These estimates are reviewed periodically, and as adjustments become necessary, they are reported as expense 
(credit) in the period in which they become known. 
Derecognition 
A financial asset (or, where applicable a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is 
derecognized when: 
 The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired; 
 The Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay 
the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement;; 
and either (a) the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Group 
has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred 
control of the asset. 
When the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through 
arrangement, and has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset nor 
transferred control of the asset, the asset is recognized to the extent of the Group’s continuing involvement in the 
asset. 
In that case, the Group also recognizes an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability are 
measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the Group has retained. 
Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the 
original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the Group could be required to 
repay. 
Impairment of financial assets 
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of 
financial assets is impaired. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is deemed to be impaired if, and only if, 
there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that has occurred after the initial 
recognition of the asset (an incurred ‘loss event’) and that loss event has an impact on the estimated future cash flows 
of the financial asset or the group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.  
Evidence of impairment may include indications that the debtors or a group of debtors is experiencing significant 
financial difficulty, default or delinquency in interest or principal payments, the probability that they will enter 
bankruptcy or other financial reorganization and where observable data indicate that there is a measurable decrease in 
the estimated future cash flows, such as changes in arrears or economic conditions that correlate with defaults.  Strategic report Corporate governance Financial report Additional disclosures Regulatory information

Consolidated financial statements 
 
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 
 
 Financial assets carried at amortized cost 
For financial assets carried at amortized cost the Group first assesses individually whether objective evidence of 
impairment exists individually for financial assets that are individually significant, or collectively for financial assets 
that are not individually significant. If the Group determines that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an 
individually assessed financial asset, whether significant or not, it includes the asset in a group of financial assets 
with similar credit risk characteristics and collectively assesses them for impairment. Assets that are individually 
assessed for impairment and for which an impairment loss is, or continues to be, recognized are not included in a 
collective assessment of impairment. 
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the 
difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future 
expected credit losses that have not yet been incurred). The present value of the estimated future cash flows is 
discounted at the financial assets original effective interest rate. If a loan has a variable interest rate, the discount rate 
for measuring any impairment loss is the current effective interest rate. 
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is 
recognized in the profit or loss. Interest income continues to be accrued on the reduced carrying amount and is 
accrued using the rate of interest used to discount the future cash flows for the purpose of measuring the impairment 
loss. The interest income is recorded as part of finance income in the profit or loss. Loans together with the 
associated allowance are written off when there is no realistic prospect of future recovery and all collateral has been 
realized or has been transferred to the Group. If, in a subsequent year, the amount of the estimated impairment loss 
increases or decreases because of an event occurring after the impairment was recognized, the previously recognized 
impairment loss is increased or reduced by adjusting the allowance account. If a future write-off is later recovered, 
the recovery is credited to finance costs in the profit or loss. 
Financial liabilities 
Initial recognition and measurement 
Financial liabilities within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, 
loans and borrowings, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate. The 
Group determines the classification of its financial liabilities at initial recognition. All financial liabilities are 
recognized initially at fair value and in the case of loans and borrowings, net of directly attributable transaction costs. 
The Group’s financial liabilities include trade and other payables and borrowings. 
Subsequent measurement 
After initial recognition, interest bearing borrowings are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the EIR. 
Gains and losses are recognized in the profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognized as well as through the EIR 
amortization process. 
Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fee or costs that are 
an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortization is included in finance cost in the profit or loss. 
Derecognition 
A financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. 
When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or 
the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a 
derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the respective 
carrying amounts is recognized in the profit or loss.  126 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2014 
Consolidated financial statements 
 
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 
 
 Offsetting of financial instruments 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the statement of financial position 
if, and only if, there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to 
settle on a net basis, or to realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously. 
Fair value of financial instruments 
The fair value of financial instruments that are traded in active markets at each reporting date is determined by 
reference to quoted market prices or dealer price quotations (bid price for long positions and ask price for short 
positions), without any deduction for transaction costs. 
For financial instruments not traded in an active market, the fair value is determined using appropriate valuation 
techniques. Such techniques may include using recent arm’s length market transactions; reference to the current fair 
value of another instrument that is substantially the same; discounted cash flow analysis or other valuation models. 
An analysis of fair values of financial instruments and further details as to how they are measured are provided in 
Note 35. 
Derivative financial instruments and hedging 
The Group uses hedging contracts for oil export sales to cover part of its risks associated with oil price fluctuations. 
Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognized at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract 
is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is 
positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative. 
Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value of derivatives during the year that do not qualify for hedge 
accounting are taken directly to profit or loss. 
The fair value of financial instruments  is determined by reference to market values for similar instruments.  
Cash and short-term deposits 
Cash and cash equivalents in the statement of financial position comprise cash at banks and at hand and short term 
deposits with an original maturity of three months or less, but exclude any restricted cash which is not available for 
use by the Group and therefore is not considered highly liquid – for example, cash set aside to cover 
decommissioning obligations. 
For the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash 
equivalents, as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts. 
Taxation 
Current income tax 
Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the 
taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that apply to the relevant 
taxable income. 
Current income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the statement of 
profit or loss. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in which 
applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate. 
Deferred income tax 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated in respect of temporary differences using the liability method. 
Deferred income taxes are provided for all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and 
liabilities and their carrying values for financial reporting purposes, except where the deferred income tax arises from  Strategic report Corporate governance Financial report Additional disclosures Regulatory information
127 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2014 
Consolidated financial statements 
 
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 
 
 the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at 
the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.  
A deferred tax asset is recorded only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which 
the deductible temporary differences can be utilized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at tax rates that 
are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates that have 
been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.  
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, 
except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the 
temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax 
assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation 
authority. 
Revenue recognition  
The Group sells crude oil, gas condensate and LPG under agreements priced by reference to Platt’s and/or Argus’ 
index quotations and adjusted for freight, insurance and quality differentials where applicable. The Group sells gas 
under agreements at fixed prices. 
Revenue from the sale of crude oil, gas condensate, gas and LPG is recognized when delivery has taken place and 
risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer. 
Revenue is recognized when it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the 
Group and the amount of revenue can be reliably measured. 
Treasury shares 
Own equity instruments that are reacquired (treasury shares) are recognised at cost and deducted from equity. No 
gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Group’s own equity 
instruments. Any difference between the carrying amount and the consideration, if reissued, is recognised in other 
reserves. Voting rights related to treasury shares are nullified for the Group and no distributions are accepted in 
relation to them. Share options exercised during the reporting period are satisfied with treasury shares. 
Share-based payments 
The Group measures the cost of cash-settled transactions with employees by reference to the fair value of the equity 
instruments at the date at which they are granted. Estimating fair value for share-based payment transactions requires 
determination of the most appropriate valuation model, which is dependent on the terms and conditions of the grant. 
This estimate also requires determination of the most appropriate inputs to the valuation model including the 
expected life of the share option, volatility and distribution yield and making assumptions about them. The 
assumptions and models used for estimating fair value for share-based payment transactions are disclosed in Note 28. 
5. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS 
On 19 May 2014 the Group agreed to acquire 100% of the share capital of Prolag BVBA (Prolag) and Amersham Oil 
LLP (Amersham), companies providing management and consulting services to the Group, from related parties of 
the Group, in connection with the premium listing on the London Stock Exchange of the Group’s listed entity, so as 
to comply with certain exchange requirements that listed companies be managed by persons employed by entities 
within the listed company’s group. 
A cash consideration consisting of initial purchase price of US$1 and a price adjustment of US$212 thousand was 
agreed and paid with respect to the acquisition of Prolag. Historically, Prolag provided consulting services to the 
Group on certain marketing, transportation and logistics matters.  128 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2014 
Consolidated financial statements 
 
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 
 
 It was agreed that Amersham be acquired in exchange for a cash consideration consisting of initial purchase price of 
US$1,915 thousand, subject to a price adjustment based on accounts of Amersham at 31 December 2014. The 
amount of the price adjustment with respect to the acquisition of Amersham has not yet been agreed or paid as at the 
date of the authorisation of the financial statements for issue, but it is estimated at US$487 thousand. Respective 
liability for this amount has been recognised within other current liabilities (Note 21) as at 31 December 2014. 
Certain managers of the Group historically provided services to the Group pursuant to a service agreement between 
Amersham and the Group. 
The goodwill arising on acquisition represents the savings of the Group on management fees and is not expected to 
be deductible for tax purposes.  
There were no significant revenues or profits/losses of the acquired subsidiaries since the respective acquisition dates 
included in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income for the years ended 31 December 2014 and 2013.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 
 
 Impairment testing 
The goodwill arising from the purchase of Probel and Amersham relates to a single cash-generating unit. 
Respectively, goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the recoverable amount against the carrying value of 
the underlying cash generating unit. 
The management has determined a single cash-generating unit within the Group’s non-current assets consisting of all 
Group’s assets related to its Chinarevskoye and exploration fields and gas treatment facility. Impairment testing is 
performed by comparing the recoverable amount against the carrying value of the cash generating unit. The 
recoverable amount is determined by calculation of the value-in-use based on discounted cash flow model as no 
recent third party transactions exist on which a reliable market-based fair value can be established. The value-in-use 
calculation model, which formally approved by the management, takes into consideration cashflows, which are 
expected to arise until 2032, i.e. during the license term of the Chinarevskoye field. The period exceeding five years 
is believed to be appropriate based on the proved and probable reserves audited by independent engineers and 
respective past history of the Group’s ability to transfer probable reserves into proved. 
The key assumptions used in the Group’s discounted cash flow models reflect past experience and take account of 
external factors. These assumptions are: 
 Oil prices for 2015-2022 are based on the forward curve of the ICE Brent Oil Futures, and for 2023-2032 
are kept constant at the level applied for 2022; 
 Proved and probable hydrocarbon reserves confirmed by independent reserve engineers; 
 Production profiles based on Group’s internal estimates confirmed by independent reserve engineers;; 
 All cashflows are projected on the basis of stable prices, i.e. inflation/growth rates are ignored; 
 Cost profiles for the development of the fields and subsequent operating costs consistent with reserves 
estimates and production profiles; and 
 Pre-tax discount rate of 14%. 
None of the reasonably possible changes in key assumptions causes the cash generating unit’s carrying amount to 
exceed its recoverable amount.

resulted in the increase of the provision by US$19,068 thousand which was offset by a decrease of the provision by 
US$14,762 thousand due to change in the inflation rate and other assumptions. 
19. DUE TO GOVERNMENT OF KAZAKHSTAN

Employee share option plan 
The Group operates one option plan (the Phantom Option Plan), that was adopted by the board of directors of the 
Company on 20 June 2014 to allow for the continuation of the option plan previously maintained by Nostrum Oil & 
Gas LP. The rights and obligations in relation to this option plan were transferred to Nostrum Oil & Gas plc from 
Nostrum Oil & Gas LP following the reorganisation (Note 2). 
Employees (including senior executives and executive directors) of members of the Group or their associates receive 
remuneration in the form of equity-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services as consideration 
for share appreciation rights, which can only be settled in cash (“cash-settled transactions”). 
The cost of cash-settled equity-based employee compensation is measured initially at fair value at the grant date 
using a trinomial lattice valuation model. This fair value is expensed over the period until vesting with the 
recognition of a corresponding liability. The liability is remeasured at each reporting date up to and including the 
settlement date with changes in fair value recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. 
The equity-based payment plan is described below. 
During 2008-2014, 4,297,958 equity appreciation rights (SARs) which can only be settled in cash were granted to 
senior employees and executive directors of members of the Group or their associates. These generally vest over a 
five year period from the date of grant, so that one fifth of granted SARs vests on each of the five anniversaries from  Strategic report Corporate governance Financial report Additional disclosures Regulatory information
145 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2014 
Consolidated financial statements 
 
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 
 
 the date of grant. The contractual life of the SARs is ten years. The fair value of the SARs is measured at the grant 
date using a trinomial lattice valuation option pricing model taking into account the terms and conditions upon which 
the instruments were granted. SARs are exercisable at any time after vesting till the end of the contractual life and 
give its holder a right to a difference between the market value of the Group’s ordinary shares at the date of exercise 
and a stated base value. The services received and a liability to pay for those services are recognised over the 
expected vesting period. 
Until the liability is settled it is remeasured at each reporting date with changes in fair value recognised in profit or 
loss as part of the employee benefit expenses arising from cash-settled share-based payment transactions.  
The carrying value of the liability relating to 2,611,413 of SARs at 31 December 2014 is US$ 6,449 thousand  
(31 December 2013: 2,912,348 SARs with carrying value of US$ 12,016 thousand). During the year ended 31 
December 2014 302,000 SARs were fully vested (2013:728,487). 
The following table illustrates the number (“No.”) and exercise prices (“EP”) of, and movements in, SARs during the 
year:  
 2014  2013

Total exercisable at the end of the year 1,815,413  1,808,348  
There were no SARs granted during the year ended 31 December 2014. The weighted average fair value of SARs 
granted during the year ended 31 December 2013 amounted to US$ 6.22 per SAR. The weighted average price at the 
date of exercise for SARs exercised during the year ended 31 December 2014 amounted to US$ 8.22 per SAR (2013: 
US$ 8.22 per SAR). The Hull-White trinomial lattice valuation model was used to value the share options. The 
following table lists the inputs to the model used for the plan for the years ended 31 December 2014 and 2013: 
 
 2014 2013 
   
GDR (2013) or ordinary share (2014) price at the reporting date 
(US$) 6.6 13.0 
Distribution yield (%) 3.0% 3.0% 
Expected volatility (%) 85.0% 85.0% 
Risk-free interest rate (%) 1.0% 2.0% 
Expected life (years) 10.0 10.0 
Option turnover (%) 10.0% 10.0% 
Price trigger 2.0 2.0 
 The expected life of the options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that 
may occur. The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, 
which may also not necessarily be the actual outcome. Option turnover rate represents the rate of employees 
expected to leave the Company during the vesting period, which is based on historical data and is may not 
necessarily be the actual outcome. The model considers that when share price reaches the level of exercise price 
multiplied by the price trigger the employees are expected to exercise their options.  146 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2014

 29. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
On 3 March 2014, in accordance with its hedging policy, the Group entered, at nil upfront cost, into a long-term 
hedging contract covering oil sales of 7,500 bbls/day, or a total of 5,482,500 bbls running through to 29 February 
2016. The counterparty to the hedging agreement is Citibank. Based on the hedging contract the Group bought a put 
at US$85/bbl, which protects it against any fall in the price of oil below US$85/bbl, i.e. Citibank will compensate the 
difference in price below US$85/bbl. As part of this contract the Group also sold a call at US$111.5/bbl and bought a 
call at US$117.5/bbl, under which Zhaikmunai LLP is obliged to compensate the difference in price above 
US$111.5/bbl with an upper limit of US$117.5/bbl, i.e. up to US$6/bbl. If the spot price goes above US$117.5/bbl, 
then Zhaikmunai LLP will be obliged to pay US$6/bbl to Citibank. 
During the years ended 31 December 2014 and 2013 the movement in the fair value of derivative financial 
instruments was presented as follows: 
In thousands of US Dollars  2014  2013  
   
Derivative financial instruments at fair value at 1 January – – 
Gain on derivative financial instruments 60,301 – 
Derivative financial instruments at fair value at 31 December 60,301 – 
The Group classifies the asset constituted by the hedging contract as non-current since no settlement is expected to 
occur under or in respect of the hedging contract until 29 February 2016. 
Gains and losses on the derivative financial instruments, which do not qualify for hedge accounting, are taken 
directly to profit or loss.

As at 31 December 2014 the Group has tax losses of US$41,643 thousand (mainly originated from the Group 
reorganisation costs) that are available to offset against future taxable profits in the companies in which the losses 
arose. Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these losses as they may not be used to offset 
taxable profits elsewhere in the Group. 
Deferred tax liability is calculated by applying the Kazakhstani statutory tax rate applicable to the Chinarevskoye 
subsoil use rights to the temporary differences between the tax amounts and the amounts reported in the consolidated 
financial statements and are comprised of the following:

Taxation 
Kazakhstan’s tax legislation and regulations are subject to ongoing changes and varying interpretations. Instances of 
inconsistent opinions between local, regional and national tax authorities are not unusual. The current regime of 
penalties and interest related to reported and discovered violations of Kazakhstan’s tax laws are severe. Penalties are 
generally 50% of the taxes additionally assessed and interest is assessed at the refinancing rate established by the 
National Bank of Kazakhstan multiplied by 2.5. As a result, penalties and interest can amount to multiples of any 
assessed taxes. Fiscal periods remain open to review by tax authorities for five calendar years preceding the year of 
review. Under certain circumstances reviews may cover longer periods. Because of the uncertainties associated with 
Kazakhstan’s tax system, the ultimate amount of taxes, penalties and interest, if any, may be in excess of the amount 
expensed to date and accrued at 31 December 2014. As at 31 December 2014 management believes that its 
interpretation of the relevant legislation is appropriate and that it is probable that the Group’s tax position will be 
sustained. 
Abandonment and site restoration (decommissioning) 
As Kazakh laws and regulations concerning site restoration and clean-up evolve, the Group may incur future costs, 
the amount of which is currently indeterminable. Such costs, when known, will be provided for as new information, 
legislation and estimates evolve.  
Environmental obligations 
The Group may also be subject to loss contingencies relating to regional environmental claims that may arise from 
the past operations of the related fields in which it operates. As Kazakh laws and regulations evolve concerning 
environmental assessments and site restoration, the Group may incur future costs, the amount of which is currently 
indeterminable due to such factors as the ultimate determination of responsible parties associated with these costs  Strategic report Corporate governance Financial report Additional disclosures Regulatory information

 and the Government’s assessment of respective parties’ ability to pay for the costs related to environmental 
reclamation.  
However, depending on any unfavourable claims or penalties assessed by the Kazakh regulatory agencies, it is 
possible that the Group’s future results of operations or cash flow could be materially affected in a particular period. 
Capital commitments 
As at 31 December 2014 the Group had contractual capital commitments in the amount of US$248,644 thousand (31 
December 2013: US$26,842 thousand) mainly in respect to the Group’s oil field development activities. 
Operating lease  
The Group entered into a cancellable lease agreement for the main administrative office in Uralsk in October 2007 
for a period of 20 years for US$ 15 thousand per month. 
In 2010 the Group entered into several agreements on lease of 650 railway tank wagons for transportation of 
hydrocarbon products for a period of up to seven years for KZT 6,989 (equivalent of US$ 47) per day per one wagon. 
The lease agreements may be early terminated either upon mutual agreement of the parties, or unilaterally by one of 
the parties if the other party does not fulfil its obligations under the contract. 
The total of future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases was represented as follows:

35. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES 
The Group’s principal financial liabilities comprise borrowings, payables to Government of Kazakhstan, trade 
payables and other current liabilities. The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance the development of 
the Chinarevskoye oil and gas condensate field and its operations as well as exploration of the three new oil and gas 
fields – Rostoshinskoye, Darjinskoye and Yuzhno-Gremyachinskoye. The Group's financial assets consist of trade 
and other receivables, non-current investments, current investments and cash and cash equivalents. 
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, liquidity 
risk, credit risk and commodity price risk. The Group’s management reviews and agrees policies for managing each 
of these risks, which are summarized below.  
Commodity price risk 
The Group is exposed to the effect of fluctuations in price of crude oil, which is quoted in US Dollar on the 
international markets. The Group prepares annual budgets and periodic forecasts including sensitivity analyses in 
respect of various levels of crude oil prices in the future. 
Interest rate risk 
The Group is not exposed to interest rate risk in 2014 and 2013 as the Group had no financial instruments with 
floating rates as at years ended 31 December 2014 and 2013. 
Foreign currency risk 
As a significant portion of the Group’s operation is the Tenge denominated, the Group’s statement of financial 
position can be affected by movements in the US dollar / Tenge exchange rates. The Group mitigates the effect of its 
structural currency exposure by borrowing in US dollars and denominating sales in US dollars.   Strategic report Corporate governance Financial report Additional disclosures Regulatory information

Consolidated financial statements 
 
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 
 
 The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the US dollars exchange rate, 
with all other variables held constant, of the Group’s profit before tax. The impact on equity is the same as the impact 
on profit before tax.

2013   
US Dollar thousand + 30.00% (3,294) 
US Dollar thousand + 10.00% (1,098) 
During the year ended 31 December 2014 a significant drop in oil prices and some other non-economic factors were 
observed which caused increase in volatility of Tenge exchange rates and overall market volatility. Statistics for the 
year ended 31 December 2014 reflect the expected behaviour of market in 2015. The ranges of reasonably possible 
changes in market risk variables were estimated by analysing annual standard deviations based on the historical 
market data for the year ended 31 December 2014. 
The Group’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities were as follows: 
As at 31 December 2014 Tenge

Other current liabilities (257) – (7,173) – (7,430) 
 (10,097) (372) (6,152) (5) (16,626) 
 Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in raising funds to meet commitments associated 
with its financial liabilities. Liquidity risk may result from an inability to sell a financial asset quickly at close to its 
fair value. 
The Group monitors its risk to a shortage of funds using a liquidity planning tool. The tool allows selecting severe 
stress test scenarios. To ensure an adequate level of liquidity a minimum cash balance has been defined as a cushion 
of liquid assets. The Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through 
the use of notes, loans, hedges, export financing and financial leases.   154 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2014 
Consolidated financial statements 
 
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 
 
 The Group’s policy is that, while it has an investment program on-going: a) not more than 25% of borrowings should 
mature in the next twelve-month period and b) a minimum balance of US$ 50 million is retained on the balance sheet 
post repayment or refinancing of any debt due in the next twelve-month period. 
The Group's total outstanding debt consists of two notes: US$ 560 million issued in 2012 and maturing in 2019 and 
US$ 400 million issued in 2014 and maturing in 2019. The Group assessed the concentration of risk with respect to 
refinancing its debt and concluded it to be low.  
The table below summarizes the maturity profile of the Group's financial liabilities at 31 December 2014 and 2013

 Credit risk 
Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Group to credit risk, consist primarily of derivative financial 
instruments, accounts receivable and cash in banks. The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the 
carrying amount of each financial asset. The Group considers that its maximum exposure is reflected by the amount 
of trade accounts receivable, cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments. 
The Group places its Tenge denominated cash with SB Sberbank JSC, which has a credit rating of Ba3 (stable) from 
Moody's rating agency and its US Dollar denominated cash with BNP Paribas with a credit rating of A1 (negative) 
and ING with a credit rating of A2 (negative) from Moody's rating agency at 31 December 2014. The Group does not 
guarantee obligations of other parties. 
The Group sells its products and makes advance payments only to recognized, creditworthy third parties. In addition, 
receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Group's exposure to bad debts and 
recoverability of prepayments made is not significant and thus risk of credit default is low. 
Customer credit risk is managed by each business unit subject to the Group’s established policy, procedures and 
control relating to customer credit risk management. Credit quality of a customer is assessed based on an extensive 
credit rating scorecard. Outstanding customer receivables are regularly monitored.  
An impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date on an individual basis for major clients. The maximum 
exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of financial assets. The Group does not  Strategic report Corporate governance Financial report Additional disclosures Regulatory information

 hold collateral as security. The Group evaluates the concentration of risk with respect to trade receivables as low, as 
its customers are located in several jurisdictions and industries and operate in largely independent markets. 
Fair values of financial instruments 
Set out below, is a comparison by class of the carrying amounts and fair value of the Group’s financial instruments, 
other than those with carrying amounts reasonably approximating their fair values:

Total 1,005,415 628,423 1,097,621 686,795 
The management assessed that cash and cash equivalents, short-term deposits, trade receivables, trade payables and 
other current liabilities approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these 
instruments.  
The fair value of the financial assets and liabilities represents the amount at which the instruments could be 
exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. Fair value of the 
quoted notes is based on price quotations at the reporting date and respectively categorised as Level 1 within the fair 
value hierarchy. The fair value of derivative financial instruments is categorised as Level 3 within the fair value 
hierarchy and is calculated using Black-Scholes valuation model based on Brent Crude Futures traded on the 
Intercontinental Exchange, with the relative expiration dates ranging from the current reporting date until March 
2016. 
The following table shows ranges of the inputs depending on maturity, which are used in the model for calculation of 
the fair value of the derivative financial instruments as at 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2013:  
 31 December 2014  31 December 2013

Historical volatility (%) 16.02-17.73 – 
Risk-free interest rate (%) 0.25-0.67 – 
Maturity (months) 3-15 – 
The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may 
also not necessarily be the actual outcome. 
The following table reflects the results of the changes in volatilities and oil price assumptions on the fair value of the 
derivative financial instrument:

 The contingent consideration liability under acquisition agreement of Darjinskoye and Yuzhno-Gremyachenskoye oil 
and gas fields (Note 7 and 21) outstanding as at 31 December 2013 was recognised at fair value, which was assessed 
to be equal to its nominal amount due to its short-term nature and, respectively, categorised as Level 3 within the fair 
value hierarchy. There were no gains or losses arising during 2013 from fair value measurement of this contingent 
consideration liability.  
During the years ended 31 December 2014 and 2013 there were no transfers between the levels of fair value 
hierarchy of the Groups' financial instruments. 
Capital management 
For the purpose of the Group’s capital management, capital includes issued capital, additional paid-in capital and all 
other equity reserves attributable to the equity holders of the parent. The primary objective of the Group’s capital 
management is to maximise the shareholder value. 
In order to achieve this overall objective, the Group’s capital management, amongst other things, aims to ensure that 
it meets financial covenants attached to the notes that define capital structure requirements. Breaches in meeting the 
financial covenants would permit the lenders to immediately call borrowings. There have been no breaches in the 
financial covenants of the notes in the current period nor the prior period. 
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments in light of changes in economic conditions and the 
requirements of the financial covenants. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the 
distribution payment to participants, return capital to participants or increase partnership capital. The Group monitors 
capital using a gearing ratio, which is net debt divided by total capital plus net debt. The Group’s policy is to keep 
the gearing ratio between 20% and 40%. The Group includes within net debt, interest bearing loans and borrowings, 
less cash, short-term deposits and long-term deposits.

3. CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND DISCLOSURES 
New standards, interpretations and amendments thereof, adopted by the Company  
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year, except for the following 
amendments to IFRS effective as at 1 January 2014: 
IAS 32 Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities – Amendments to IAS 32 
These amendments clarify the meaning of 'currently has a legally enforceable right to set-off' and the criteria for non-
simultaneous settlement mechanisms of clearing houses to qualify for offsetting and is applied retrospectively. These 
amendments have no impact on the Company, since none of the entities in the Company has any offsetting 
arrangements.  
Amendments to IAS 36 – Disclosures on Recoverable Amount for Non-financial Assets 
These amendments eliminate unintended consequences of IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement in part of information 
disclosure according to IAS 36 Asset Impairment. Besides, these amendments require disclosing the recoverable 
amount of assets or cash generation unit (“CGU”) on which the impairment loss was recognized or recovered during 
the reporting period. These amendments had no impact on the financial statements of the Company. 
IFRIC 21 Levies 
IFRIC 21 clarifies that an entity recognises a liability for a levy when the activity that triggers payment, as identified 
by the relevant legislation, occurs. For a levy that is triggered upon reaching a minimum threshold, the interpretation 
clarifies that no liability should be anticipated before the specified minimum threshold is reached. Retrospective 
application is required for IFRIC 21. This interpretation has no impact on the Company as it has applied the 
recognition principles under IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets consistent with the 
requirements of IFRIC 21 in prior years. 
Standards issued but not yet effective 
The standards and interpretations that are issued, but not yet effective, up to the date of issuance of the Company’s 
financial statements are disclosed below. The Company intends to adopt these standards, if applicable, when they 
become effective. 
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 
In July 2014, the IASB issued the final version of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments which reflects all phases of the 
financial instruments project and replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and all 
previous versions of IFRS 9. The standard introduces new requirements for classification and measurement, 
impairment, and hedge accounting. IFRS 9 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, with 
early application permitted. Retrospective application is required, but comparative information is not compulsory. 
Early application of previous versions of IFRS 9 (2009, 2010 and 2013) is permitted if the date of initial application 
is before 1 February 2015. The adoption of IFRS 9 is not expected to have an effect on the classification and 
measurement of the Company’s financial assets and the Company’s financial liabilities. 
Annual improvements 2010-2012 Cycle 
These improvements are effective from 1 July 2014 and are not expected to have a material impact on the Company. 
They include: 
IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures  
The amendment is applied retrospectively and clarifies that a management entity (an entity that provides key 
management personnel services) is a related party subject to the related party disclosures. In addition, an entity that  Strategic report Corporate governance Financial report Additional disclosures Regulatory information
165 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2014 
Parent company financial statements 
 
NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 
 
 
uses a management entity is required to disclose the expenses incurred for management services. These amendments 
are not expected to have effect on the Company’s future financial statements, since the Company always disclosed 
the companies providing management services as related parties. 
Annual improvements 2011-2013 Cycle 
These improvements are effective from 1 July 2014 and are not expected to have a material impact on the Company. 
They include: 
IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement 
The amendment is applied prospectively and clarifies that the portfolio exception in IFRS 13 can be applied not only 
to financial assets and financial liabilities, but also to other contracts within the scope of IFRS 9 (or IAS 39, as 
applicable). It is not expected that the amendment will have material effect on the Company’s financial position or 
performance. 
Amendments to IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements: Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests 
The amendments to IFRS 11 require that a joint operator accounting for the acquisition of an interest in a joint 
operation, in which the activity of the joint operation constitutes a business must apply the relevant IFRS 3 principles 
for business combinations accounting. The amendments also clarify that a previously held interest in a joint operation 
is not remeasured on the acquisition of an additional interest in the same joint operation while joint control is 
retained. In addition, a scope exclusion has been added to IFRS 11 to specify that the amendments do not apply when 
the parties sharing joint control, including the reporting entity, are under common control of the same ultimate 
controlling party. 
The amendments apply to both the acquisition of the initial interest in a joint operation and the acquisition of any 
additional interests in the same joint operation and are prospectively effective for annual periods beginning on or 
after 1 January 2016, with early adoption permitted. These amendments are not expected to have any impact to the 
Company. 
Amendments to IAS 27: Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements 
The amendments will allow entities to use the equity method to account for investments in subsidiaries, joint 
ventures and associates in their separate financial statements. Entities already applying IFRS and electing to change 
to the equity method in its separate financial statements will have to apply that change retrospectively. For first-time 
adopters of IFRS electing to use the equity method in their separate financial statements, they will be required to 
apply this method from the date of transition to IFRS. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on 
or after 1 January 2016, with early adoption permitted. These amendments are not expected to have any impact on 
the Company’s financial statements.  
4. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
Foreign currency translation 
The functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which an entity operates and is 
normally the currency in which the entity primarily generates and expends cash. 
The functional currency of the Company is the United States dollar (the US dollar or US $). 
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency by applying the spot exchange rate 
ruling at the date of the transaction.  
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the functional currency spot rates 
of exchange at the reporting date.  166 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2014 
Parent company financial statements 
 
NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 
 
 
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the 
exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign 
currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value is determined. 
Investments 
Investments in subsidiaries are recorded at cost. The Company assesses investments for impairment whenever events 
or changes in the circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an investment may not be recoverable. If any such 
indication of impairment exists the Company makes an estimate of its recoverable amount. Where the carrying 
amount of an investment exceeds its recoverable amount, the investment is considered impaired and is written down 
to its recoverable amount. 
Financial assets 
Initial recognition and measurement  
Financial assets within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as financial assets at fair value through the statement of 
comprehensive income, loans and receivables, held-to-maturity investments, available-for-sale financial assets, or as 
derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate. The Company determines the 
classification of its financial assets at initial recognition. 
All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of investments not at fair value through 
profit or loss, directly attributable transaction. Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets 
within a time frame established by regulation or convention in the marketplace (regular way trades) are recognised 
on the trade date, i.e., the date that the Company commits to purchase or sell the asset. 
The Company’s financial assets include investments, loans, cash and cash equivalents and receivables. 
Subsequent measurement 
Receivables  
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in 
an active market. After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using 
the effective interest rate method, less impairment. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount 
or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the effective interest rate. The effective 
interest rate amortisation is included in finance income in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive 
income. The losses arising from impairment are recognised in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive 
income in finance costs for loans and in cost of sales or other operating expenses for receivables 
Accounts receivable are recognized and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectible 
amounts. An estimate for uncollectible amounts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable. 
These estimates are reviewed periodically, and as adjustments become necessary, they are reported as expense 
(credit) in the period in which they become known. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents in the statement of financial position comprise cash at banks. 
Derecognition 
A financial asset (or, where applicable a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is 
derecognized when: 
The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired 
The Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the 
received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement;; and either (a)  Strategic report Corporate governance Financial report Additional disclosures Regulatory information
167 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2014 
Parent company financial statements 
 
NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 
 
 
the Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Company has neither 
transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset. 
Impairment of financial assets 
The Company assesses at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or a group 
of financial assets is impaired. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is deemed to be impaired if, and only if, 
there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that has occurred after the initial 
recognition of the asset (an incurred ‘loss event’) and that loss event has an impact on the estimated future cash flows 
of the financial asset or the group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated. Evidence of impairment may 
include indications that the debtors or a group of debtors is experiencing significant financial difficulty, default or 
delinquency in interest or principal payments, the probability that they will enter bankruptcy or other financial 
reorganization and where observable data indicate that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash 
flows, such as changes in arrears or economic conditions that correlate with defaults. 
Financial liabilities 
Initial recognition and measurement 
Financial liabilities within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, 
loans and borrowings, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate. The 
Company determines the classification of its financial liabilities at initial recognition. All financial liabilities are 
recognized initially at fair value and in the case of loans and borrowings, net of directly attributable transaction costs. 
The Company’s financial liabilities include payables and accrued liabilities. 
Subsequent measurement 
After initial recognition, interest bearing borrowings are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective 
interest rate method (EIR). Gains and losses are recognized in the profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognized 
as well as through the EIR amortization process. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or 
premium on acquisition and fee or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortization is included in 
finance cost in the statement of comprehensive income. 
Derecognition 
A financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. 
When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or 
the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a 
derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the respective 
carrying amounts is recognized in profit or loss. 
Offsetting of financial instruments 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the statement of financial position 
if, and only if, there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to 
settle on a net basis, or to realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously. 
Fair value of financial instruments 
The fair value of financial instruments that are traded in active markets at each reporting date is determined by 
reference to quoted market prices or dealer price quotations (bid price for long positions and ask price for short 
positions), without any deduction for transaction costs. For financial instruments not traded in an active market, the 
fair value is determined using appropriate valuation techniques. Such techniques may include using recent arm’s 
length market transactions; reference to the current fair value of another instrument that is substantially the same; 
discounted cash flow analysis or other valuation models.  168 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2014

13. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES 
The Company's financial assets consist of receivables from shareholders and cash and cash equivalents. The 
Company’s financial liabilities consist of trade and other payables and accrued liabilities. 
The main risks arising from the Company’s financial instruments are foreign exchange risk and credit risk. The 
Company’s management reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarized below.  
Foreign currency risk 
Most of the Company’s operation is denominated in USD, therefore the Company’s statement of financial position is 
not significantly affected by exchange rate movements.  
Credit risk 
Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to credit risk, consist primarily of receivables and cash 
in banks. The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset. The 
Company considers that its maximum exposure is reflected by the amount of receivables from shareholders and cash 
and cash equivalents. 
The Company places its US Dollar and Euro denominated cash with ING with a credit rating of A2 (negative) from 
Moody's rating agency at 31 December 2014. 
Receivables are amounts receivable from group companies, thus risk of credit default is low. 
Fair values of financial instruments 
The fair value of the financial assets represents the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current 
transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. 
The management assessed that its assets and liabilities approximate their carrying amounts largely due to their nature 
or the short-term maturities of these instruments. 
Capital management 
For the purpose of the Company’s capital management, capital includes issued capital and all other equity reserves 
attributable to the equity holders of the Company. The primary objective of the Company’s capital management is to 
maximise the shareholder value. 
14. EVENTS AFTER THE REPORTING PERIOD 
The Company’s Board of directors is proposing a final dividend of US$0.27 per Ordinary Share for the year ended 
31 December 2014, subject to shareholder approval at the AGM.

Anti-Monopoly Agency The Republic of Kazakhstan anti-monopoly authority. 
API American Petroleum Institute.
API gravity The industry standard method of expressing specific density of crude oil 
or other liquid hydrocarbons as recommended by the American Petroleum 
Institute. Higher API gravities mean lower specific gravity and lighter oils. 
When the API gravity is greater than 10, the product is lighter and floats 
on water; if it is less than 10, it is heavier than water and sinks. Generally 
speaking, oil with an API gravity between 40 and 45 commands the highest 
prices.

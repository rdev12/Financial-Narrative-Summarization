GROUP HIGHLIGHTS
Go-Ahead is one of the UK’s leading providers of bus and rail services.Our strategy is to deliver high
quality services in dense urban markets.
GO-AHEAD – A GOOD PLACETO BE...
Focused on bus and rail
We have made good strategic progress over the financial year.
We retained our Southern franchise and launched the UK’s first
domestic high speed rail service in Southeastern; disposed of the
majority of our loss making aviation services division; invested over
£35 million in UK bus acquisitions and started a yellow school bus
joint venture in North America.
Fundamental sector strengths
Public transport plays a key role in building a strong economy,reducing
traffic congestion and air pollution and helps to promote social inclusion.
There is strong political support for public transport and a clear recognition
that the private sector is best placed to deliver and grow these services.
Geographically well located
Most of our operations are in the South East of the UK.This area is
forecast to have the highest economic and population growth rates
in the country.We have also started a small yellow school bus joint
venture in North America and will cautiously assess further
opportunities in this market.
Local high quality services
We operate a devolved management structure which provides a
strong local focus on our passengers and high quality
bus and rail services.
Responsible operator
Operating our companies in a safe, socially and environmentally
responsible manner is a vital part of our business. It is what we do
on a day-to-day basis and is deeply embedded across our
organisation at all levels.
Delivering shareholder value
We are committed to delivering shareholder value through our
clear and effective strategy. Maintaining the amount of dividend per
share through the economic cycle, including those times when
earnings may reduce, is a high priority for us and is supported by
our strong balance sheet and cash generation. DIRECTORS’ REPORT:BUSINESS REVIEW

Our ground handling and cargo business is now classified as
discontinued and is excluded from the results discussed throughout this
report. Overall, revenue increased by £14.4m, or 0.7%, to £2,201.6m
(2009: £2,187.2m), consisting of £194.3m due to a change in access
charge regime subsidy and an underlying increase of £208.7m, or 9.5%.
Operating profit* was some £5m ahead of our expectations at
£102.0m, albeit £26.8m, or 20.8%, below last year’s strong result (2009:
£128.8m).Adjusted earnings per share* was 128.3p (2009: 161.6p),
basic earnings per share, including exceptional items and discontinued
operations, was 40.1p (2009: 14.7p) and profit attributable to members
was £17.2m (2009: £6.3m).
Dividends
We recognise that our dividend policy is a key part of the
investment decision for many shareholders. Maintaining the amount
of dividend per share through the economic cycle, including those
times when earnings may reduce, is a high priority for us and is
supported by the Group’s strong balance sheet and cash generation.
The Board is proposing a final dividend of 30.0p per share (2009:
55.5p) to maintain the total dividend for the year at 81.0p (2009:
81.0p), following a one-off change to the proportion of full year
dividend paid at the interim stage this year.The final dividend is
payable on 19 November 2010 to registered shareholders at the
close of business on 5 November 2010.
The Board of Directors and Governance
The Board of Go-Ahead continuously reviews the way in which the
Group is managed against best practice corporate governance.
Following such a review during the year, Rupert Pennant-Rea was
appointed as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee on 30
October 2009. Katherine Innes Ker joined the Board as a Non-
Executive Director and a member of the Audit, Remuneration and
Nomination Committees on 9 July 2010.These two changes
demonstrate our commitment to good corporate governance and
full compliance with the provisions of the Combined Code
(published in June 2008).
In May 2010, the Financial Reporting Council issued a new edition
of the Combined Code, renamed the UK Corporate Governance
Code, which outlines a number of changes that are designed to
reinforce Board quality, focus on risk and improve accountability to
shareholders. The Board welcomes the new Code and although
not applicable to Go-Ahead until the financial year ending June

DIRECTORS’ REPORT:BUSINESS REVIEW
We have made good progress in delivering our strategy which leaves us well placed for the future.
Our bus and rail operations remain fundamentally strong and we look forward to working closely with
the new Government.
CHAIRMAN’S ST A TEMENT
Sir Patrick Brown, Chairman
We are pleased with the progress we have made this year in
challenging economic conditions. All of our bus and rail operations
have increased passenger revenue, highlighting the quality and value
for money of our services.
We have sold most of our aviation services division and started
our yellow school bus joint venture in North America.We have
also acquisitively grown our bus operations in the UK, leading to
more than one billion annual passenger journeys on our bus and
rail operations for the first time in our history.We are working
closely with the new Government and welcome its review of future
rail franchising announced in July 2010. In summary, we are in good
financial shape and continue to believe in the fundamental
strengths of public transport.
Business development and acquisitions
We made significant progress in delivering our Group strategy this
year, namely:
•Successful launch of the new Southern rail franchise
•Introduction of the UK’s first domestic high speed rail service
•Investment of over £35m in five UK bus acquisitions 5 The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010
2011, we are already considering and working towards
implementing the changes appropriate to our own corporate
governance arrangements as soon as possible. In particular, at the
forthcoming AGM, all Directors will be subject to annual election
by shareholders.
Corporate responsibility
As a public transport operator, corporate responsibility is integral
to the way we run our business and is a key part of the Group’s
strategy. Our responsibility is centred around five key areas: Safety,
Environment, Passengers, Employees and Community.The safety
and security of our passengers, our people and the general public is
an absolute priority for the Group and we continually strive to
improve our already high safety performance.
We are committed to improving the energy efficiency of our bus
and rail operations as this not only has important environmental
benefits, but also helps to reduce operating costs.This year we
launched our ‘Driving Energy Further’ campaign which sets out a
five year target to reduce our CO2 emissions per passenger
journey by 20% by 2015.Through investment, innovation and the
commitment of our employees we have made good progress this
year as we continue towards our target.
Employees
The number of employees in the Group averaged 22,570 for the
financial year, below last year’s 27,177, primarily due to the disposal
of the majority of our aviation services division. I would like to
thank our employees for their dedication and hard work through
these challenging economic conditions to ensure that we remain
a strong and successful Group.
Outlook
We have made good progress in delivering our strategy which
leaves us well placed for the future. Our bus and rail operations
remain fundamentally strong and we look forward to working with
the new Government.
However, we continue to be cautious on the near term prospects
for the UK economy and the outlook for the next financial year
remains difficult to predict, including any impact from the
Government’s Comprehensive Spending Review expected to be
announced in October 2010.

At this stage, we have not changed our outlook for the next financial
year since our trading update in June 2010, and are assuming that
the broad operating trends experienced in the second half of the
financial year ended 3 July 2010 continue throughout the next
financial year. In bus, we therefore expect lower fuel costs and a
small additional contribution from acquisitions to be partly offset by
the full year effect of lower operating profit* margins in London. In
rail, we expect a small reduction in operating profit* margin next
year compared to the financial year just ended.We will continue to
take management action accordingly, focusing on service quality,
cost control and financial discipline.
Our cashflow, balance sheet and financing are strong and the
maintenance of the dividend per share will remain a priority.We
have started the new financial year well and trading has been
in line with the Board’s expectations.
Sir Patrick Brown, Chairman
1 September 2010 6 www.go-ahead.com
DIRECTORS’ REPORT:BUSINESS REVIEW
investment was slightly ahead of depreciation, as expected, partly
driven by franchise commitments in both Southern and London
Midland but also to maintain our high quality asset base in our
expanding bus division.
We made good progress with bus acquisitions in the year, with a
total investment of £37.2m, of which cash consideration was
£35.2m. On 3 October 2009 we purchased EastThames Buses
fromTransport for London for £5.0m, and bought Arriva’s
Horsham depot for £5.0m.These businesses are now fully
integrated into Go-Ahead London and Metrobus respectively.
On 1 December 2009 we completed the acquisition of Plymouth
Citybus for £19.0m, a high quality urban operation with a large
centrally located freehold depot and a strong reputation that we
are seeking to further enhance. In March 2010 we acquired the
entire share capital of Konectbus, a quality operator in East Anglia,
and completed the acquisition of Arriva’s Hexham depot
operations and sold our Ashington depot to Arriva.
We remain financially robust and gained investment grade ratings
from Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s in the period and completed
our debut issue of a 7½ year £200m bond in March 2010.This
further strengthens our balance sheet and secures our financing
beyond our November 2012 bank facilities.We have maintained our
full year dividend to shareholders at 81.0p per share (2009: 81.0p).
DIVISIONAL PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW
Bus
Our bus division performed slightly ahead of our expectations due
to a strong finish to the year. Like-for-like revenue increased in all
six of our bus companies, endorsing the economic resilience of
these operations. Our acquisitions performed well and contributed
£3.6m of operating profit, including a strong performance by East
Thames Bus. Operating profit* was slightly below last year at
£63.7m (2009: £66.6m), primarily due to lower margin contract
renewals in our regulated London operations. Our devolved
structure encourages high levels of service quality, customer focus
and strong local cost control. Management initiatives contributed a
further £4.3m of cost savings. We continue to champion Group
purchasing power and have de-risked fuel costs through a
comprehensive hedging programme that is complete for the next
two years at 41pence per litre (ppl), compared with 47 ppl in the
year just ended. Capital investment continues at above depreciation,
ensuring that we retain one of the youngest bus fleets in the sector
and maintain our strategically important freehold depot locations.
I am pleased with our overall operational performance.
We continue to deliver solid results by prioritising service quality,
operational excellence, local focus on our high density urban
businesses and financial discipline.
Summary of performance
Revenue was £2,201.6m (2009: £2,187.2m), with the increase of
£14.4m consisting of a reduction of £194.3m due to a change in
access charge regime subsidy and an underlying increase of
£208.7m, or 9.5%.
Overall operating performance was some £5m ahead of our
expectations, with operating profit* of £102.0m supported by a
strong finish to the year from our bus operations and lower than
anticipated electricity costs in our rail division.We completed the
disposal of the majority of our cargo and ground handling
operations during the year and expect to sell the remaining ground
handling operations in the next twelve months.
Strong cash management resulted in cashflow from operations
being well ahead of our expectations at £160.6m (2009: £233.4m)
and net debt remained low at £88.3m (2009: £91.0m). Capital
We continue to deliver solid results by prioritising service quality, operational excellence, local focus on
our high density urban businesses and financial discipline.
GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
Keith Ludeman, Group Chief Executive 7 The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010
Financial Statements Directors’ Report: Corporate Governance Directors’ Report: Business Review
Market environment
In the near term, we expect economic conditions to remain
challenging. Political support from the new Government is strong,
notwithstanding the likelihood of reduced funding as part of the
Comprehensive Spending Review due to be announced in October
2010.We welcome the Government’s review of the future of rail
franchising and will actively participate in the consultation process.
In the medium term, we expect to benefit from both a cyclical
economic recovery and from the fundamental strengths of public
transport in the UK.
Our strategy
Our strategy continues to focus on providing high quality passenger
transport in the UK, primarily through bus and rail.
The underlying elements of this strategy are to:
• Run our companies in a safe, socially and environmentally
responsible manner
• Provide high quality, locally focused passenger transport services
• Prioritise high density, urban markets in the UK
• Maintain strong financial discipline to deliver shareholder value
In summary
We are pleased with the results for the year given the challenging
economic conditions and we have made good progress in
delivering our strategy.
Whilst we remain cautious on the near term outlook for the UK
economy and the potential impact of the Government’s October
2010 Comprehensive Spending Review on our operations, we
continue to be confident in the underlying strengths of, and growth
opportunities for, our business.
Keith Ludeman, Group Chief Executive
1 September 2010
Through our joint venture with Cook Illinois, Go-Ahead North
America finished its preparations to run its first yellow school bus
franchise in St Louis which commenced trading in August 2010.
Rail
Our rail division performed well and operating profit* was
approximately £3m ahead of our expectations, primarily due to a
reduction in electricity costs allocated by Network Rail at the end
of the financial year.
Each of our three rail franchises is underpinned by a focus on high
density, urban commuter markets. Passenger revenue continued to
grow in line with current expectations, with second half trends slightly
stronger than those in the first half. Operating profit* was £37.3m
compared to £61.5m last year, primarily due to the change from the
previous to the new Southern franchise, more difficult economic
conditions compared to the assumptions at the time of our bid for
Southeastern and additional costs in London Midland.We began
running the new Southern franchise in September 2009 and are
pleased with the performance of this franchise to date.This year saw
the introduction of the UK’s first domestic high speed rail service,
operated by Southeastern between St Pancras International and Kent
as part of a major timetable change in December 2009. In London
Midland the new management team has significantly improved the
operational performance of that franchise.We continue to make
good progress with cost control initiatives in our rail operations and
estimate savings for the year just ended of £25.0m.
Aviation services
We disposed of the majority of our cargo and ground handling
operations in January 2010 and are making progress on disposing
of the remaining ground handling operations. Consequently, operating
profit* of £1.0m (2009: £0.7m) for the aviation services division for
the financial year consisted primarily of our Meteor parking and
security business which performed as expected in the year.

Restated to exclude our ground handling and cargo operations. T o date, little additional detail around the proposed cuts has been
published. More information and further spending reductions are
expected in the Comprehensive Spending Review in October
2010. It is believed that many of the savings will come from large
scale infrastructure projects which would not directly affect day-to-
day public transport services. However, there are some risks
to public transport operators, with the bus industry potentially
exposed to cuts.The table opposite shows the main risks,
consequences and certain mitigating factors.
Broadly speaking, rail operators are protected from cuts in
transport spending because franchise contracts, which typically
last for around eight years, are legally binding.
Sector activity
In April 2010 Deutsche Bahn announced that a recommended cash
offer had been agreed to purchase Arriva.The transaction
completed in August 2010 and this means there are now four listed
UK public transport groups in the UK: Go-Ahead, FirstGroup,
National Express and Stagecoach.The UK public transport market is
the most liberalised in Europe but the Continental European market
is in the process of becoming more deregulated.A number of
European players operate in the UK public transport market,
including SNCF, Ned Railways,Transdev and Deutsche Bahn.
Long term growth
We remain cautious on the near term outlook for the UK
economy as the new Government begins to tackle the UK’s budget
deficit. However, despite the near term uncertainty, we believe in
the fundamental strengths of public transport and long term
growth in the sector.An efficient public transport system
strengthens the economy, creates jobs, reduces traffic congestion
and air pollution, and helps tackle social exclusion.This is recognised
by the Government and other major political parties, with a clear
acceptance that the private sector is best placed to deliver and
grow these services.
“THE GOVERNMENT BELIEVESTHAT A
MODERNTRANSPORT INFRASTRUCTURE
IS ESSENTIAL FOR A DYNAMIC AND
ENTREPRENEURIAL ECONOMY . ”
New Government, May 2010
Impact of economic downturn
Two important drivers of transport businesses are economic
growth (GDP) and employment. In the 12 months ended June
2010, UK GDP declined by 1.7% and employment rose marginally
by 0.36%
1
.Whilst the economic climate made UK market
conditions difficult, in particular causing a reduction in discretionary
travel, urban bus operations proved to be relatively resilient and the
impact on commuter rail franchises was less than some had
predicted.This may be in part due to further improvements in
service quality and value for money compared with other modes of
transport. In addition, there has been a focus on cost reduction
across the industry to limit the adverse impact of the economic
downturn on margins.
Rail franchise reform
The recession has highlighted issues with the existing rail franchise
model. In November 2009, the East Coast inter-city franchise was
handed back to the Government.At present almost all franchises
which are eligible for revenue support are receiving it.This situation
is not beneficial to the Government or the industry and as a result
in July 2010 the new Government published a consultation
document entitled "Shaping the future of rail franchising.”Whilst this
is still at the consultation stage we see the potential changes
outlined in the document as a positive step for the rail industry and
look forward to working with the new Government.
Department forT ransport public spending cuts
In June 2010 the Government announced its initial cuts to transport
spending. It stated that £683m will be cut from the Department for
Transport’s £22bn budget for the 2010/11 financial year as part of
the programme of cuts to tackle the national budget deficit.
8
The economic downturn has presented some challenging market conditions for the industry and the
impact of public spending cuts remains unclear. However, the fundamentals of public transport remain
strong. Growth in the sector is essential to the economic and sustainable future of the UK.

Bus service
operators grant (BSOG)
Typically bus operators
receive a fuel duty rebate
of 43 pence per litre.
See page 34 for more
information on the composition
of Go-Ahead’s fuel costs.
£500 million Go-Ahead receives approximately
£48m through BSOG, with just
over half in London.
Equivalent to around 8%
of bus revenue.
In London any changes to BSOG are
likely to be passed on toTfL on
contract renewal. Outside London,
operators would need to look at ways
to recover the extra costs, potentially
through network reduction and fare
increases.
Bus concessionary fares
Currently anyone aged 60
or over is eligible to travel
for free on any off peak
local bus service in England.
Local authorities receive a
fund from the Government
which they use to
reimburse bus operators
a percentage of the full fare.
£1.2 billion Concessionary passengers represent
around 30% of Go-Ahead’s
deregulated bus passengers and
around 20% of deregulated bus
revenue, equivalent to approximately
£60 million.
Overall, our average reimbursement
rates are around 50-60%.
In London we are not exposed
to the scheme as we do not collect
passenger revenue.
The concessionary fares scheme has
proved very popular and it is believed it
would be difficult for the Government
to withdraw it completely. However, if
the fund reduced and eligibility changed,
operators would need to look at ways
to recover the extra costs, potentially
through network reduction and fare
increases.
T endered bus services
Transport for London (TfL)
tenders bus routes in the
capital. Outside London, bus
routes which are not
commercially viable, such as
non-frequent rural services,
are tendered by local
authorities.
£1.2 billion
Includes subsidy
toTfL of c.£600m
Go-Ahead operates around 21%
of the London bus market.
Less than 10% of Go-Ahead’s
deregulated operations are
tendered.We focus on high
density commuter areas where
we operate commercially
run services.
Bus is the most frequently used mode
of transport in London and is vital to
the capital.TfL’s business plan 2009/10-
2017/18 outlines ways to reduce
the bus subsidy whilst maintaining
the network.
Outside London, some rural routes
could be withdrawn but it is unlikely
to have a material effect on Go-Ahead.

BUSINESS AND MAINTAININGTHE
DIVIDEND PER SHARE IS A HIGH
PRIORITY FORTHE BOARD. ”
Keith Ludeman, Group Chief Executive
T o date the specifics around how the cuts in the Department for
Transport’s budget will affect public transport operators are not
known. However, I believe the biggest potential risk for us lies in the
bus industry with the possible reduction in, or removal of, the bus
service operators grant (BSOG). BSOG currently reimburses
operators around three quarters of the fuel duty cost. For Go-
Ahead, this equates to £48m per annum, around 8% of total bus
revenues. In London, the bus network is vital to the capital and
hopefully BSOG relating to existing contracts would be preserved. In
the medium term, any changes are likely to be recovered fromTfL
on contract renewal. Outside London, the risk is that a reduction in
BSOG would lead to a combination of network reduction and price
increases.We believe the Government is aware of these potential
consequences and expect further information as part of the
Comprehensive Spending Review in October.
The UK market remains our priority, but after a review of potential
overseas growth opportunities, we identified North American
yellow school bus as an attractive market. It has many similarities
with the UK bus market and fits well with the Group’s strategy of
providing high quality, locally focused services.
Setting up a joint venture with an established local operator
represents a low risk means of market entry and we are very
pleased with our partner Cook Illinois.While we recognise that the
market is currently under pressure as school districts look to save
costs, the current climate presents a valuable opportunity for us to
learn about the business.We also believe in the market’s long term
growth prospects due to both demographic trends and potential
conversion to the private sector. However, as previously stated, we
will continue to maintain a cautious approach to further expansion
in this market.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT:BUSINESS REVIEW 11 The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010
developing this business.
Y es I do. Fundamentally, rail is a very good business and the private
sector is best placed to deliver the service to passengers. Go-
Ahead has a good track record in winning bids and delivering high
quality services.The dilemma for the industry is how to translate
this into a more sustainable business model which appeals to the
private sector.The economic climate has highlighted the volatile
nature of the current rail franchising model. In 2008, we reported a
rail operating profit* of £77.2m, compared with £37.3m this year. I
would far rather we averaged a more stable level of earnings for a
longer period than the current franchise allows and believe
franchise reform can address these issues. I therefore welcome the
Government’s review of the future of rail franchising.
See pages 39-40 for more information about the UK rail market and franchise reform.
We are a relatively mature business and maintaining the dividend
per share is a high priority for the Board. Our strong balance sheet
and cashflows support this level of dividend whilst ensuring we can
continue to invest properly in our existing business.We will
continue to seek acquisitions where they add value, preferring bolt-
on transactions in UK bus and gradual expansion in North America.
I am pleased with the strategic progress we have made to
strengthen our core bus and rail operations. I believe in the
fundamentals of public transport and in our focus on local
management teams empowered to deliver high quality services to
local communities. I expect the near term to remain challenging as
we work through the economic recovery, but, in the medium to
long term, I believe that Go-Ahead is a good place to be.
Y our rail profits have halved since 2008. Do you still
think the UK rail market is a good place to be?
How do you see the medium/ long term future
of the business?
Y ou say you remain cautious on the outlook for the
Group.What does this mean for the dividend?

NORTH AMERICAN YELLOW
SCHOOL BUS MARKET
We believe that yellow school bus is an attractive market with
significant growth opportunities. However, we are taking a
cautious approach to entry.The market has many similarities
with UK bus, but is far larger and more fragmented.The total
market is approximately 450,000 buses of which around
150,000 are run by private operators.The chart below shows
approximate market share for the private sector.
The North American yellow school bus market is vast.T o
illustrate its size, we operate around 3,800 buses in the UK.
An equivalent sized operator in the privatised sector of the
North American yellow school bus market would have a
market share of around 2.5%.

and rail operations.
We remain committed to the UK market.We are recognised as having
significant expertise in UK bus and rail which is welcomed by our
shareholders and will remain our primary focus. However, following a
review of potential growth opportunities outside the UK, we decided
to enter the North American yellow school bus market. In November
2009, we announced we had established a small joint venture with an
established local operator.This represents a low risk means of market
entry and we will continue to maintain a cautious approach to
developing this business.
Operating responsibly is a vital part of the Group’s strategy. Providing
safe, punctual and customer focused services is an integral part of our
day-to-day operations. In addition, we are committed to improving the
energy efficiency of our operations.This reduces our impact on the
environment and generates significant cost savings.
Our simple, but effective strategy has successfully continued to deliver
shareholder value through the economic cycle. Our bus operations
provide strong and stable cashflows and, although the rail industry has
been through a challenging period, we believe that fundamentally it is
a good business and look forward to working with the new
Government on the potential improvements to the franchise model.
The devolved nature of Go-Ahead differentiates us from the other
large public transport groups.We continue to believe that a flat,
decentralised structure is the most effective way to run our Group.
We empower our local managers to deliver services in their own
markets.This local focus ensures close links to the community, helping
us to provide high quality services tailored to local circumstances,
whilst being part of a large Group provides financial efficiencies and
sharing of knowledge and best practice.The flat structure of the
Group means the Executive Directors stay close to the operating and
financial performance of each company.

THE FOLLOWING KPIS UNDERPIN OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVETO BE A HIGH QUALITY OPERATOR
RAIL PUNCTUALITY
The punctuality of our rail operations is measured on the basis of the Department for
Transport’s Public Performance Measure (PPM) on a moving annual average basis.This is
the percentage of trains that arrive at their final destination within five minutes of their
scheduled arrival time having called at all scheduled stations.This time frame is an industry
standard definition for ‘on-time’ measurement.We also monitor customer satisfaction
through the National Passenger Survey, conducted by the statutory public transport users
watchdog Passenger Focus. See pages 43 to 44 for our performance.
Why it’s important: Providing a punctual service is one of the most important factors for
our passengers. Our PPM performance also forms part of the franchise agreement.
Aim: Maintain our high levels of punctuality at or above 90%.The PPM industry average
is 91.5%

.
LONDON BUS PUNCTUALITY
The reliability of our London bus operations is primarily measured on the basis of
Transport for London’s (TfL) excess waiting time.This is the time in minutes passengers
have to wait for a bus above the average scheduled waiting time.Therefore, the lower the
excess waiting time the better. The industry average is 0.96 minutes.
7
Why it’s important: Providing a punctual service is one of the most important factors for
our passengers.We earn extra revenue through quality incentive contracts (QIC) if we
exceed punctuality targets set byTfL.
Aim: Maintain our low excess waiting time performance at below one minute.

21 The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 The diagram below illustrates the key roles and responsibilities for
each of the respective functions within our risk management
framework. Ultimate accountability for risk management lies with
the Board, supported by the work of the Audit Committee to
which the Board has delegated responsibility for reviewing the
effectiveness of the Group’s risk management and internal control
systems.With clear leadership from the Board and Audit
Committee, the Executive Directors play an integral role in helping
the operating companies identify, assess and monitor their
respective risks and controls.Through monthly meetings with the
senior management of each operating company, the Executive
Directors encourage open communication on risk matters within a
clearly defined framework and reporting process. Ownership of risk
identification and mitigation lies with the senior management in
operating companies where it is an integral part of day-to-day local
company operations.
The tables on pages 23 to 25 summarises our assessment of the
key risks and uncertainties that could impact the Group’s
performance.These risks are monitored on an ongoing basis
through the Group’s risk management processes, together with the
effectiveness of mitigation through the internal control environment.
Residual risk is assessed by the Board and accepted if appropriate
as an integral part of the risk and reward of the business, or
deemed unacceptable and therefore either reduced, transferred to
third parties or avoided by no longer pursuing the relevant activity.
The matters described are not intended to be an exhaustive list of
all possible risks and uncertainties.

Risk DIRECTORS’ REPORT:BUSINESS REVIEW
T reatment of discontinued operations
Following the disposal of the majority of our aviation services
division, the income statements for both the current and the
comparative period have been restated to show continuing
operations (those which remain) and discontinued (all of ground
handling and cargo), with the net profit or loss for the latter shown
as one line at the end of the income statement. This narrative
refers to continuing operations unless otherwise indicated.
Operating profit before depreciation, amortisation
and exceptional items (EBITDA)
EBITDA was £153.2m (2009: £175.0m) consisting of operating
profit* of £102.0m (2009: £128.8m) and depreciation of £51.2m
(2009: £46.2m).
Pensions
Operating profit* included the net cost of the Group’s defined
benefit pension plans of £36.3m (2009: £36.1m), consisting of bus
and aviation services costs of £5.4m (2009: £3.5m) and rail costs of
£30.9m (2009: £32.6m). Company cash contributions to the
schemes were £6.9m (2009: £2.8m) higher than the net cost in the
income statement, totalling £43.2m (2009: £38.9m).
The total net deficit after taxation for the bus and aviation schemes
was £69.8m (2009: £54.7m), consisting of pre tax liabilities of
£96.9m (2009: £76.0m) less a deferred tax asset of £27.1m (2009:
£21.3m).The pre tax deficit consisted of assets of £420.0m (2009:
£352.7m) less estimated liabilities of £516.9m (2009: £428.7m) and
49.2% of the assets (2009: 47.8%) were held as bonds and cash.
The net deficit on the rail schemes was £nil (2009:£7.5m). Any
deficit at the end of the franchise is guaranteed by the DfT and
hence we only recognise the share of deficit (or surplus) expected
to be funded (or received) over the franchise period.
Goodwill and intangible amortisation
The charge for the year of £10.9m (2009: £11.9m) represents the
non-cash cost of amortising goodwill, intangibles including assets
associated with pension accounting for the rail franchises and
computer costs.The decrease against the prior year reflects the
part year charge for the old Southern franchise terminating on
19 September 2009, compared to a full year’s charge in 2009.
Net finance costs
The net finance costs for the year increased to £13.3m (2009:
£11.5m) consisting of finance costs of £14.9m (2009: £17.6m) less
finance revenue of £1.6m (2009: £6.1m).The reduction in finance
Operating profit* for the year was £102.0m, 20.8% below last year
(2009: £128.8m) primarily due to lower results in our rail division.
Adjusted earnings per share* followed a similar trend, down 20.6%
to 128.3p per share (2009: 161.6p). Basic earnings per share were
40.1p (2009:14.7p) as a result of significant exceptional and
discontinued items.
Cash conversion was, once again, excellent with cashflow generated
from operations of £160.6m (2009: £233.4m) compared to
operating profit before depreciation, amortisation and exceptional
items (EBITDA) of £153.2m (2009: £175.0m).
Our balance sheet and financing remains strong.Adjusted net debt
to EBITDA was 1.91x at June 2010 (June 2009: 1.56x) and remains
well within our target range of 1.5-2.5x. Our funding is secured,
partly to November 2012 through a 5 year syndicated loan facility,
and partly through a 7½ year £200m bond to September 2017.
At June 2010 we had headroom within the loan facility of £177.0m
(2009: £101.0m).
The Group operates with financial discipline to deliver shareholder value. Our businesses are highly
cash generative and our balance sheet and financing remain strong.
FINANCIAL REVIEW
26 www.go-ahead.com
Nick Swift, Group Finance Director T axation
The net taxation charge in the income statement of £14.9m (2009:
£32.4m) included underlying tax on ordinary activities of £20.3m
(2009: £28.2m), equivalent to an effective rate of 26.1% (2009:
26.7%) slightly below the UK statutory rate for the period of 28.0%
(2009: 28.0%) due to the benefit of previous tax efficient asset
finance arrangements.
The charge also includes a tax benefit of £5.7m (2009: £4.1m)
relating to the exceptional costs. The 2009 charge includes an
exceptional, non-cash tax charge of £8.6m following the UK
Government’s abolition of industrial buildings allowances
announced in July 2008.
Discontinued operations
Discontinued operations consist of the cargo and ground handling
activities which have either been sold or are intended to be sold by
the year end. The loss for the year was £12.0m (2009: £40.2m),
consisting of an operating profit of £3.5m (2009: loss £5.2m),
exceptional costs of £19.4m (2009: £43.2m), a tax benefit of £4.1m
(2009: £8.7m) and other costs of £0.2 m (2009: £0.5m).The
exceptional cost relating to discontinued operations of £19.4m is
largely unchanged from the £19.6m recognised at the half year.
Minority interest
The minority interest in the income statement of £6.3m (2009:
£12.0m) arises from our 65% holding in Govia Limited (which
owns our rail operations) and therefore represents 35% of the
profit after taxation of the rail division.
revenue on cash held as part of the rail franchise obligations
reflects lower interest rates. Finance costs included £3.0m for the
7½ year sterling bond issued at a 5.375% coupon in March 2010.
The average net interest rate was 4.8% (2009: 5.0%) for the year
and the proportion of gross debt held under fixed interest rate
agreements at 3 July 2010 was 105.6% (2009: 47.2%).
Exceptional items
Exceptional items before taxation totalled £46.8m (2009: £57.7m)
of which £27.4m (2009: £14.5m) related to continuing operations.
Most of the items were non-cash, with cash items totalling £11.0m
(2009: £10.1m). Exceptional costs relating to Meteor were £16.4m
(2009: £1.5m) consisting of a first half impairment charge of
£16.2m and a subsequent restructuring provision of £0.2m in the
second half of 2010.
Bus and rail related exceptionals totalled £11.0m (2009: £12.4m),
including £6.7m of rail restructuring and £0.8m of bus restructuring
costs. In March 2010 the Mayor of London announced that all
articulated buses would come out of use by March 2011 rather
than at the end of the relevantTfL contracts.This has led to a
further acceleration of depreciation charge in this year of £2.6m
following £0.8m last year and a further £1.8m is expected to be
charged against the Group’s 2011 results.

Dividends paid in the period represents the payment of last year’s
final dividend of 55.5p (2009: 55.5p) and the interim dividend in
respect of this year of 55.5p per share (2009: 25.5p).
Cashflow
Cash generated from operations before taxation was £160.6m
(2009: £233.4m), with tight working capital management resulting
in a favourable net movement of £8.6m (2009: £76.7m) and other
net outflows of £1.2m (2009: £18.3m).
Tax paid of £18.8m (2009: £11.4m) was primarily the current
portion of the pre-exceptional tax charge of £20.6m.The 2009 tax
charge includes £8.6m non-cash charge relating to the abolition of
industrial buildings allowances, and a one off refund of £5.2m. Net
interest paid of £10.7m (2009: £11.9m) is in line with the charge
for the period of £13.3m (2009: £11.5m) except for £3.0m of
interest on the £200m 7½ year sterling bond, which is due 29
September 2010. Capital expenditure, net of sale proceeds, was
similar to last year at £54.7m (2009: £56.6m), equivalent to 107%
of depreciation (2009: 123%).
Adjusted earnings per share
Adjusted profit attributable to members* was £55.1m (2009:
£69.4m).This consisted of a profit attributable to members of
£17.2m (2009: profit £6.3m) adjusted to add back members’ share
of post tax amortisation of £5.9m (2009: £6.5m), members’ share
of exceptional items of £20.0m (2009: £16.4m) and post tax loss
on discontinued operations of £12.0m (2009: £40.2m).
The weighted average number of shares remained at 42.9 million
(2009: 42.9 million).The closing number of shares in issue, net of
treasury shares, was 42.9 million (2009: 42.9 million).
Adjusted earnings per share* decreased by 20.6%, or 33.3p, to
128.3 pence per share (2009: 161.6 pence per share).
Dividends
The Board is proposing a total dividend for the year of 81.0p per
share, unchanged from last year and including a proposed final
payment of 30.0p payable on 20 November 2010 to registered
shareholders at the close of business on 6 November 2010.This
follows the one-off change to the proportion of the full year
dividend paid as an interim amount this year.

Following a decision to increase the proportion of the total dividend
for this year payable as an interim dividend, dividends paid to parent
company shareholders amounted to £45.7m (2009: £34.8m)
consisting of 55.5p per share final dividend for 2009 (2009: final

Net debt has been maintained below last year’s significantly lower
balance, reducing in the year by a further £2.7m to £88.3m 
(2009: £91.0m; 2008: £197.8m). 
Prior to our bond issue we achieved investment grade ratings 
from Moody’s (Baa3, stable outlook) and Standard and Poor’s 
(BBB-, stable outlook) consistent with our belief that a target 
range for adjusted net debt to EBITDA of 1.5x – 2.5x is broadly
equivalent to an investment grade rating. 
On 24 March 2010 we launched our debut bond for £200m over
7½ years at a 5.375% coupon and used the proceeds to pay down
part of the syndicated loan facility as well as reducing that facility
from £340m to £280m. This provided us with core financing of
£480m (2009: £340m), of which £177m was undrawn and available
at the year end (2009: £101m).

2010 performance overview 35
Outlook 37 strategy of focusing on high density urban areas means that overall,
demand for our deregulated services has continued to grow.
REGULATED BUS
Buses are a fundamental feature of the capital.They are by far the
most used mode of public transport in London with over two
billion passenger journeys a year (the most since the 1960s),
compared with around one billion on the London Underground
3
.
Go-Ahead is the largest bus operator in London with around
21% market share.We operate over 100 bus routes and carry
approximately one million passengers a day.
London bus market share

T ransport for London
Operating under a regulated system,TfL issues tenders for each bus
route and private operators enter a competitive bidding process
for the right to operate them.The contracts are usually five years in
duration with a two year extension ifTfL performance targets are
met. Route contracts are awarded on a cost per mile basis.This
means that bus operators are not subject to any near term passenger
revenue risk.TfL contracts are price index adjusted, designed to offset
inflationary increases in costs. Broadly speaking, therefore operators’
profits are not impacted by inflationary changes.

BUS STRATEGY
Our core bus strategy is to focus our services in high density urban
areas in the UK where there is a strong demand for frequent
services.We strongly believe that locally based management teams
and local branding helps to ensure close links to the community
and key stakeholders such as local authorities.This helps us to
provide high quality services and means we can respond quickly
to changing passenger needs.
Our aim is to grow our bus business in the UK both organically
and through value adding bolt-on acquisitions, particularly in the
deregulated market where we have a relatively small proportion of
the overall market. In addition, we have established a joint venture
in North America to pursue potential growth opportunities in the
yellow school bus market.We are taking a cautious approach to
developing this business.
MARKET ENVIRONMENT
Bus travel is the most frequently used mode of public transport in
the UK with around five billion passenger journeys made each year
1
.
The UK bus market is split into two models.The London market
is regulated byTransport for London (TfL) and outside London,
the market is largely operated on a normal commercial
basis (deregulated).
Go-Ahead operates in the UK bus market through eight business
units: Go-Ahead London, Go North East, Go South Coast,
Metrobus, Brighton & Hove, Oxford Bus Company, Plymouth
Citybus and Konectbus.
Go-Ahead London and around 70% of Metrobus’ operations are
within the regulated London market.
Impact of economic climate on UK bus market
Overall, the bus market has been relatively resilient throughout
the recession as bus can often be the cheapest way to travel. Bus
passenger journeys in England increased by 2% for the year ended
March 2009
2
, in part due to the popularity of the concessionary
fares scheme which was extended in April 2008 to enable anyone
aged 60+ to travel for free on any local bus service in England.
Latest industry figures suggest bus passenger journeys in England
decreased by 1.8% for the year ended March 2010
2
. However, it
is important to note that there are significant regional variations in
demand for bus use. In London, there has been continued volume
growth throughout the economic downturn and Go-Ahead’s

GO-AHEAD’S LONDON BUS DEPOTS
Quality Incentive Contracts
TfL set performance targets called Quality Incentive Contracts
(QICs) to ensure bus companies run a high quality service.When
targets are met, operators are rewarded with cash bonuses.
If targets are not met operators are penalised. Go-Ahead’s
operations consistently rank highly in theTfL performance leagues,
which are available onTfL’s website. In 2010, our quality incentive
bonus revenue totalled £12.3m (2009: £14.2m).
Go-Ahead has previously highlighted that the amount received
through QICs is likely to continue to fall in the future.This is due
to a combination of factors:
QIC1 is based on punctuality and forms part of the tendered
contract.Typically, on retender the punctuality targets for the new
contract are based on the level achieved at the end of the previous
contract and so it becomes increasingly difficult to exceed the new
targets and earn QIC revenue.
QIC2 was introduced in October 2008.This was a bonus payment
based on qualitative factors such as bus driver attitude and bus
cleanliness.This initiative was withdrawn byTfL by March 2010 as a
way of reducingTfL’s subsidy. In the financial year just ended,
Go-Ahead received £3.5m in revenues from QIC2.
Bus fleet
TfL specify which buses should be used for each contract. Go-
Ahead runs over 1,500 buses in London, of which around 50%
are leased. Outside London we own all our buses.
Running a quality London bus operation
Go-Ahead believes running a successful London bus operation
is based on two main factors:
Strong and experienced management team
Running high quality frequent bus services in the busy and
congested capital is a complex operation. Go-Ahead has a very
experienced management team and has successfully run bus
services in London for over 20 years.
Good network of freehold depots
A depot located close to bus routes results in greater cost
efficiency. Go-Ahead has 16 strategically located London depots,
with around 85% of our depot capacity owned as freehold.The
book value of these properties is approximately £100m, which
we believe is around the current market value.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT:BUSINESS REVIEW
OPERA TING REVIEW:BUS CONTINUED Continued demand for London buses
The London bus market has been resilient through the economic
downturn. Figures fromTfL show that bus passenger journeys
have grown on average by 5.6% over the last five years.This is also
reflected in Go-Ahead’s London operations and may be due to
the following factors:
• Bus is typically the cheapest method of public transport
in the capital
• Congestion zone charging for private car use
• Limited and expensive car parking facilities
• High proportion of bus lanes (almost 300km)
• Significant percentage of the population without car ownership
It is likely that the capital’s bus network will remain relatively
stable over the next couple of years asTfL’s budget is constrained.
However, the market presents good long term growth
opportunities.The London population is set to increase by 1.3
million by 2031 and the Mayor of London has set a target of
reducing London’s greenhouse gas emissions by 60 per cent by
2025
6
. Both are key drivers to continued future growth of the
London bus market.

DEREGULATED BUS
Outside London, bus services are largely commercially run by
private operators. Operators work closely with local authorities
and other stakeholders to provide the appropriate services to
meet demand and are free to set fares on a commercial basis.
Go-Ahead operates around 5% of this market, with a particular
focus on dense, urban operations.

which are competitive with other forms of transport.

BSOG is currently under review by the Government.
Go-Ahead hedging policy and prices
Our bus fuel hedging programme uses fuel swaps to fix the price
of our diesel fuel in advance. Our aim is to be fully hedged for the
next financial year three months before the start of that year, at
which point we aim to have also fixed at least 50% of the following
year and 25% of the year after that.This hedging profile is then
maintained on a quarterly basis. See table at the top of page for
our current hedging prices.
OFTs referral of bus services to Competition Commission
In January 2010The Office of FairTrading (OFT) referred UK
local bus services to the Competition Commission. Provisional
findings are expected to be announced towards the end of this
calendar year and the industry is working closely with the
Competition Commission believing that:“Bus companies operate
in highly competitive local markets and it is always in our interests
to keep prices competitive to attract passengers out of their cars
and onto our services...The industry delivers one of the most
comprehensive bus networks in Europe for one of the lowest
levels of public subsidy.”
Confederation of Passenger Transport UK, January 2010.
Good relationships with local authorities
Local authorities invest in bus priority measures and technology
such as real time bus information to promote bus travel.
Local and customer focused operations
Bus travel is very localised. It is important to have close links with
communities to deliver services tailored to local circumstances.
Quality and reliable services
Investing in modern fleets and ensuring services are punctual help
to grow passengers.This year we spent £38m on new buses.The
average age of our bus fleet is 7.4 years.
BUS OPERATING COST BASE
Ongoing cost control is an important part of running a good bus
operation. Labour is the largest operating cost, accounting for 64%
of Go-Ahead’s bus cost base. Fuel accounts for 12%. Typically, bus
operators have some flexibility within their cost base and in an
economic downturn can vary service levels to demand.

OPERA TING REVIEW:BUS CONTINUED
DIRECTORS’ REPORT:BUSINESS REVIEW In March 2010 we purchased the entire share capital of Konectbus,
a high quality operator in Norfolk, and also in March 2010 our
Go North East business acquired the Hexham operations of Arriva.
We also sold our Ashington depot to Arriva. The total
consideration for these deals was £8.2m.
In total, the acquisition spend for 2010 was £37.2m, with cash
consideration of £35.2m.
2010 PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW
The performance of our bus operations was slightly ahead of our
expectations due to a strong finish to the year.
Revenue increased by 7.7%, or £44.8m, to £629.5m (2009:
£584.7m), consisting of £31.5m, or 5.4%, from acquisitions and like-
for-like growth of £13.3m, or 2.3%.
Operating profit* was £63.7m, slightly ahead of our expectations
but below the record year last year (2009: £66.6m) with an
increase of £3.6m due to acquisitions more than offset by a like-for-
like reduction of £6.5m, primarily due to lower second half margins
in our regulated London operations. Consequently, bus operating
profit* margin fell to 10.1%, 1.3 ppts below last year (2009: 11.4%).
As expected, this year’s operating profit* included additional like-
for-like costs for fuel of £4.0m, additional duty of around £1.0m and
further pension costs of £1.9m.This has been partly offset by a
reduction in accident claim costs of £1.8m and benefits from cost
saving initiatives of approximately £4.3m.
Acquisitions
This was a successful year for acquisitions in the regulated and
deregulated businesses, and the acquired businesses have made
significant contributions to both turnover and operating profit*.
Most of the increased revenue and operating profit* was from East
Thames Buses, a regulated business operating in the East of
London, which was acquired fromTransport for London by our
Go-Ahead London operation on 3 October 2009 for cash
consideration of £5.0m and has now been successfully integrated
into our existing depots.
Also on 3 October 2009, our Metrobus subsidiary acquired Arriva’s
Horsham depot which operates a mix of regulated routes and
deregulated services. Consideration was £5.0m and operations
were quickly and seamlessly absorbed into Metrobus’s Crawley
operations.
Plymouth Citybus, a high quality urban business which operates
from a centrally based freehold depot, was bought by the Group
on 1 December 2009 for a cash consideration of £19.0m.This
business has a strong local presence and reputation that we intend
to enhance.

Going green
Following a Group wide initiative to improve bus fuel economy, by training drivers and
investing £3m in engine monitoring technology, we have successfully managed to
improve our fuel efficiency, with some bus companies achieving a 6% improvement in
miles per gallon.The efficiency programme encourages smooth driving and has also
helped to reduce accidents.
T o help monitor progress, we have introduced a traffic light system which ranks drivers
based on how well they are driving. Green represents the most efficient.The
proportion of drivers in the Green is reviewed at monthly Board meetings.
The traffic light system also encourages healthy competition amongst drivers and
operating companies and helps to maintain motivation amongst our drivers.
Nearly 80% of our 8,000 bus drivers are in the Green.

*
Before amortisation and exceptional items. REGULATED OPERATIONS
Our regulated bus operations in London performed well during
the year, albeit with lower second half margins due to a reduction
in revenue per mile and quality incentive income on a number of
contracts renewed in January 2010. Revenue increased by 6.5% in
the year, of which acquisitions represented 5.4% and like-for-like
growth totalled 1.1%. Contracted mileage increased by 7.4% to
72.8 million miles, of which 5.2% was from acquisitions and 2.2%
from like-for-like growth.
In addition, quality incentive bonuses declined to £12.3m (2009:
£14.2m), of which £3.5m (2009: £1.5m) was from QIC2 incentives
for driver quality and bus incentives which ended during the year.
We continue to perform well in theTfL quality league tables and
operated in excess of 99.5% of our target mileage before traffic
congestion losses (2009: 99.6%).
Revenue trends were as anticipated, with growth in the second half
of 4.3% (2009: 3.8%) compared to a first half of 8.7% (2009: 8.5%).
Excluding acquisitions, this shows a second half reduction in
revenue of 2.8% compared to a second half increase in mileage of
2.5% reflecting the new contracts started in January 2010.
Around 85% of our depot capacity in London is owned as freehold
which provides a strong base for contract renewals. During 2010,
we retained contracts for 281 peak vehicle requirements (PVR),
won new work for 45 PVR and lost 91 PVR.
During 2009TfL commenced the decommissioning of articulated
“bendy” buses as contracts expire.This process accelerated in 2010
and all articulated buses are now expected to be withdrawn by
March 2011.We will continue to provide for the reduction in
residual values as an exceptional item and now expect a total cost
of £5.2m charged over this year and next, rather than over four
years as previously anticipated. £2.6m has been recognised in this
year (2009: £0.8m) and £1.8m is expected be charged against 2011.
Like-for-like performance
Like-for-like performance, excluding acquisitions, remained strong.
Revenue growth was achieved in each of our regulated and
deregulated businesses and tight cost control remained a priority
with initiatives delivering savings of £4.3m in the 2010 financial year.
Our underlying fuel costs, before delivery and duty, were around
£4m higher than the same period last year.We consumed around
115m litres of fuel in the 2010 financial year and hedged all of
our expected fuel requirements at 47p per litre (ppl) compared
with an average price of 43ppl in 2009.The total fuel rebate
provided through the bus service operators grant was £47.7m,
being 43 ppl, and just over half this amount relates to our regulated
London operations.
Labour costs account for around two thirds of our cost base and
are closely controlled through local wage negotiations and ongoing
productivity improvements.T otal depreciation for the division was
£35.5m (2009: £31.5m) and net capital expenditure was £39.6m
(2009: £44.9m).The average age of our deregulated fleet remains
one of the youngest in the sector.

OPERA TING REVIEW:BUS CONTINUED
UK Bus Operator of theY ear
Brighton & Hove Bus Company was awarded the prestigious UK Bus Operator of
theY ear at the 2009 UK Bus Awards. Commending Brighton & Hove’s achievement
the judges noted:‘The company has an enviable reputation in the local community
it serves. It is perhaps the best example today of how partnership with local
authorities and other stakeholders can grow patronage and encourage modal
shift consistently over many years.’
DIRECTORS’ REPORT:BUSINESS REVIEW We expect to benefit from a reduction in the underlying cost of
fuel, with the commodity cost fully hedged at around 41ppl for
both financial years ending 2011 and 2012 compared to 47ppl in
2010.We anticipate fuel usage to remain at 115m litres, resulting
in a saving of around £7m per annum.
Cost control across the division will remain a key focus and priority.
This includes ongoing wage negotiations and productivity
improvements to maintain competitive labour costs.We continue
to make excellent progress with energy savings, fuel consumption
and procurement initiatives and are not assuming any significant
change in pensions or accident claim costs compared to the last
financial year.
Risks to these assumptions include the potential for a reduction in
government support across the industry as part of the October
2010 Comprehensive Spending Review, and any adverse impact
from the Competition Commission review of the deregulated
bus industry.
Opportunities include further like-for-like growth in demand,
bolt-on acquisitions and additional cost savings.
DEREGULATED OPERATIONS
Each of our operating companies reported continued revenue
growth and a strong finish to the financial year resulted in a revenue
increase of 9.0% of which acquisitions represented 5.1% and like-
for-like growth totalled 3.9%. Passenger journeys increased by 8.7%,
of which acquisitions represented 5.5% and like-for-like growth
was 3.2%.Around two thirds of the like-for-like passenger
increase was due to fare paying passengers and one third from
concessionary passengers.
Revenue growth trends across all of our deregulated businesses
remained positive with second half like-for-like growth of 2.9%,
slightly below the first half growth of 4.9% which benefited from
new contracts such as Southampton University. Like-for-like
passenger numbers also increased in each of our operating
companies with a total second half increase of 3.3% compared
to a first half increase of 3.1%.
NORTHAMERICAYELLOW SCHOOL BUS
During the financial year we established a 50:50 North American
joint venture with Cook Illinois Corporation to operate in the
yellow school bus market.T o date, the joint venture has won its first
contract in St Louis, Missouri to run approximately 120 buses and
these successfully commenced operation in August 2010. Our
share of the joint venture investment at the balance sheet date
was US$1.0m (approximately £0.7m) and at commencement of
operations was approximately US$6m.We have secured a
US$10m revolving credit facility to fund our share of the operations
and to provide a hedge for the US$ foreign exchange exposure on
the investment.
OUTLOOK
Overall, at this stage, we expect the underlying performance of our
bus operations to remain robust for the next financial year.We
are assuming that the broad operating trends experienced in the
second half of our 2010 financial year continue throughout the
next financial year.
In London, we therefore expect a full year effect of reduced
margins from January 2010, primarily through lower QIC revenue
given the end of the QIC2 regime and the more difficult QIC1
targets.We expect demand for our deregulated operations to
remain robust. Full year contribution from acquisitions is expected
to add a further £1.0m to operating profit*.

Outlook 44 RAIL STRATEGY
Go-Ahead’s strategy is to operate urban intensive commuter
franchises in the UK.We are the UK’s busiest rail operator, with
almost 30% of rail passenger journeys, representing around 20% of
total industry revenue. Our aim is to turn this fundamentally good
business and significant market share into greater shareholder value.
We believe this could be achieved by improving the franchise
model and welcome the Government’s current review of potential
franchise reform.We currently operate three rail franchises through
Govia, our 65% joint venture with Keolis.
MARKET ENVIRONMENT
The UK rail market is regulated by the Department forTransport
(DfT).The DfT tenders franchise agreements to run rail services
across the UK which typically last for around eight years.There are
currently 19 rail franchises in the UK. Go-Ahead operates three -
Southern, Southeastern and London Midland.

Impact of economic downturn on UK rail market
The rail industry is driven by GDP and employment and the
recession therefore has had an impact on growth. Short distance
commuter services have generally been less affected by the
economic downturn than long distance inter-city services, the latter
being more reliant on discretionary passenger spend. For the year
ended March 2010 passenger journeys in Great Britain decreased
by 1.3%, compared to a 6.9% rise in 2008

Financial Statements Directors’ Report: Corporate Governance Directors’ Report: Business Review
However, latest industry data shows that overall demand for rail
travel has returned to growth since the beginning of 2010. During
the first six months of 2010 passenger journeys rose by 5.1%
2
.
Whilst these trends are positive, we remain cautious on the near
term outlook for the rail market as the Government begins to
tackle the UK’s budget deficit.
Issues with current rail franchise model
In general, the privatisation of the rail industry has been highly
successful as shown by the unprecedented growth in passenger
journeys since 1996. Punctuality and customer satisfaction levels are
at record highs and over one billion train journeys are now made in
the UK each year, the most since the Second World War on a
network virtually half the size.
UK rail passenger journeys (m)

However, the economic downturn has highlighted issues with the
current franchising model, resulting in volatility of train operating
companies (TOCs) earnings. In 2008, Go-Ahead reported a rail
operating profit* of £77.2m, compared with £37.3m this year.

Association of Train Operating Companies (ATOC), August 2010.
Rail Sensitivity of earnings
As revenue support does not typically begin until after the fourth
year, the early years of franchises are exposed to any shortfall in
revenue. For example, a 2.5% decrease in revenue would halve
operating profits based on a typical 5% margin (assuming no
reduction in costs).The sensitivity to passenger revenue in
Go-Ahead is illustrated in the table above, and is mitigated in part
by 80% revenue support in Southeastern since 1 April 2010.
In addition to the sensitivity of earnings to changes in passenger
revenue, the contractual nature of the franchise agreements also
means there are often a number of allocation estimates or
contractual disputes which can have a significant impact on
operating profit. Examples include allocation issues between
operating companies aroundTravelcard revenue and electricity
consumption and disputes with third parties such as Network Rail,
rolling stock leasing companies and the DfT.
Rail franchise reform
Operators have been working with the previous and new
Government on ways to improve the franchise structure which
could lead to a better, more efficient railway and more consistent
returns to shareholders. Such measures might include:
• longer franchises
• less complex franchise specification
• improvements to the risk/reward share structure
In July 2010 the Department forTransport published a consultation
document entitled “Shaping the future of rail franchising” which
notes: ‘The Government believes that the existing system of rail
franchising has become too prescriptive at the point of bidding, and
lacks flexibility once operational… We need to reform franchising to
bring in more private sector investment in order to help deliver
important improvements to the railways that passengers want.’ The
document takes into account the three measures listed above in its
possible approach to future franchises.The consultation remains
open until 18 October.
We welcome the review and believe it represents an opportunity
to provide a more commercial basis for franchises.
Little flexibility to respond to changing market conditions
Franchise agreements are highly specified by the DfT and, generally
speaking, the tender process is financially driven.TOCs submit bids
based on profit margins which are typically below 5%. Based on this
level of return the bidder specifies the premium profile they will pay
to the DfT or the subsidy they require from the DfT.
TOCs bids are based on assumptions for passenger revenue
growth over the life of the franchise.These assumptions are based
on economic forecasts and revenue generating initiatives.
SomeTOCs which secured franchises before the economic climate
changed found that during the recession actual passenger revenue
growth was significantly below that assumed in the bids.The highly
specified contracts, together with the high proportion of fixed costs
inherent in franchise agreements (see page 41 for further detail),
means there is little flexibility for operators to respond to changing
market circumstances.
Revenue risk
A franchise agreement usually includes the revenue share and
support mechanism as shown in the diagram below.The revenue
share mechanism begins at the start of the franchise but operators
are required to take the revenue risk until the support mechanism
begins, typically after the fourth year of the franchise.At present
almost all franchises which are eligible for revenue support are
receiving it.

Energy costs
Our three franchises in total are the largest consumers of rail
traction electricity in the UK with around 900,000 megawatt hours
used each year. Electricity for traction (EC4T) represents around
5% of our rail division’s cost base, costing £78m in 2010.
In 2008 we became the first operators to introduce regenerative
braking on the third rail system
5
.This significant engineering
achievement saves energy by capturing electricity through braking
and returning it to the rail network. It has helped us to improve our
EC4T efficiency, reducing our carbon emissions and operating costs.
EC4T is bought from Network Rail who in turn buys from British
Energy-EDF. Every year, consumption is estimated for eachTOC by
Network Rail for the year ended March and is then finalised at the
end of June.This process attempts to take into account usage by
eachTOC on shared areas of the network together with other
users such as freight, electricity leakage through the network and
consumption efficiencies such as regenerative braking.
The price of electricity is bought forward with Network Rail and is
typically fixed for the next 12 months and 50% for the following
12 months.
Diesel is used in parts of our Southern and London Midland
franchises and accounts for around 0.3% of the rail division’s cost
base.We are fully hedged for the remainder of both franchises.
T rack access and rolling stock
TOCs are not responsible for rail infrastructure (such as tracks).
They pay access fees to Network Rail for this. Operators typically
lease rolling stock for the life of the franchise.
Rail fares
Peak time week day fares (i.e. commuter based fares) are regulated
by the DfT. The typical formula for annual January fare increases is
the previous year’s July Retail Price Index (RPI)+1%.This formula
applies to our Southern and London Midland franchises. Due to the
introduction of the high speed service, the current formula for
Southeastern is RPI+3%, becoming RPI+1% from January 2012.
The July 2010 RPI, which will apply to January 2011 fare increases, is
4.8%
Generally speaking,TOCs profits should not be impacted by
inflationary changes as the subsidy/premium profile takes indexation
into account.
RAIL OPERATING COST BASE
Typically, around 70% of aTOC’s cost base is fixed.The split of costs
varies between each franchise but around 40% of the costs are for
track access and leasing rolling stock and around 30% are staff
costs.

The above figures are subject to change, including adjustment for indexation. any operational issues and the financial results were in line with
expectations.This franchise operated with a profit share regime
where the DfT were paid 60% of profit over a pre determined limit.
T otal revenue in Southern consisted of passenger revenue of
£534.9m (2009: £487.2m), other income of £46.1m
(2009: £32.5m) and net subsidy receipts of £4.3m (2009: £82.7m).
Passenger revenue growth was 9.8% (2009: 7.9%) with second half
growth of 9.6% similar to that of the first half at 10.0%. Passenger
numbers increased by 4.5% compared to last year (2009: 4.4%).
Growth rates in the second half of the year were stronger than the
first, increasing by 4.8% in the second half compared to 4.1% in the
first half.
We are pleased with progress under the new franchise. Our
management team have made excellent progress in delivering bid
initiatives, supported by strong online promotions and marketing
and good operational quality. Following the start of the new
franchise an exceptional charge of £3.0m was incurred due to
restructuring.
Our public performance measure (PPM) showed that 90.7%
(2009: 90%) of our trains arrived on time and the Spring National
Passenger Survey customer satisfaction rating increased to 84%

2010 PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW
The operating profit* from our rail division was approximately £3m
ahead of our previous expectations, primarily due to a favourable
reduction in our allocation of electricity costs by Network Rail at
the end of the financial year. Highlights for the year were the
transition to the new Southern franchise, the introduction of the
high speed service in Southeastern and the significantly improved
customer satisfaction ratings for London Midland.
T otal revenue decreased by 0.9% or £14.2m, to £1,537.8m
(2009: £1,552.0m), consisting of increased passenger revenue from
the addition of high speed services into Kent as well as continued
growth in like-for-like passenger revenue in all three franchises
being offset by reduced levels of DfT subsidy. Passenger revenue
increased £100.8m, or 8.9% of which approximately 2% is
estimated to be due to the additional week of trading this year, and
passenger numbers increased by 3.2%. Other revenue increased by
£12.0m, or 13.2%, and DfT subsidy reduced by £127.0m or 38.9%.
The reduction in subsidy includes an estimated £194.3m due to the
change in the track access regime from 1 April 2009 (which
decreased both subsidy income and track access costs and hence
has no net impact on operating profit). Excluding this change, the
underlying subsidy increased by £74.7m as agreed in the bidding
process, primarily to recognise the additional high speed costs in
Southeastern.
Operating profit* declined by 39.3% or £24.2m, to £37.3m
(2009: £61.5m) reflecting the lower revenue growth below bid
assumptions which have more than offset the benefit of cost savings
of around £25.0m in the year. Operating profit margin fell
1.6 percentage points from 4.0% to 2.4%. Restructuring costs
incurred in the year amounted to £6.7m and are shown in
exceptional items.
T otal depreciation for the rail division was £14.4m (2009: £13.0m).
Net capital expenditure was £18.2m (2009: £12.2m), of which
£15.2m (2009: £8.1m) represented franchise commitments in
Southern and London Midland.

The results for Southern consist of the previous franchise to

Results from Spring National Passenger Survey. The survey is conducted by the statutory public
transport users watchdog Passenger Focus. The industry average is 83%.
Rail T otal revenue in London Midland consisted of passenger revenue of
£191.2m (2009: £173.8m), other income of £36.9m
(2009: £39.8m) and net subsidy receipts of £96.7m (2009: £158.2m).
Like-for-like passenger revenue growth was 10.0% with first half
growth at 11.0%, reflecting the timetable expansion in December
2008, and second half growth at 9.0%. Passenger numbers
increased by 4.6% for the full year, consisting of a first half year
increase of 6.4% benefiting from the December 2008 timetable
changes followed by 2.9% for the second half.
We continue to undertake a significant amount of restructuring in this
franchise, incurring an exceptional charge of £3.2m (2009: £2.8m) in
the year. Costs in this franchise are complicated by legacy issues and
are currently above bid assumptions. Cost control will continue to be
an area of focus as we try to restore margins in this franchise.

OUTLOOK
The outlook for rail is difficult to predict at this stage of the year.
We are pleased with progress made by our Southern franchise
management team to date and are assuming we will perform in line
with the financial assumptions in the bid for the next financial year.
In Southeastern, we expect to remain in 80% revenue support until
the end of the franchise in 2014 and so will continue with our
significant cost saving programme to remain profitable in this franchise.
In London Midland, we will also continue with our cost saving focus
as well as progress a range of other initiatives such as capital
expenditure on gating and car parking, further new trains during
the next financial year and increased marketing to highlight the
excellent value for money fares in this franchise.
Overall, we are assuming a small reduction in operating profit*
margin next year compared to this financial year.
In the medium term, we strongly believe in the fundamental
strengths of the rail business and welcome the Government’s
review of the future of rail franchising.

The increase in full year passenger revenue was 7.5% (2009: 5.7%),
consisting of a first half increase of 3.9% and a second half increase
of 11.2%. Passenger numbers increased by 1.4% (2009: 1.0%)
compared to last year, with a first half reduction of 2.0% due to the
remapping of some journeys to the Southern franchise and a
second half increase of 5.1%, most of which is estimated to be due
to the introduction of the high speed services in December 2009.
The difference between passenger revenue and passenger numbers
partly reflects the RPI + 3% fare regime in this franchise, and partly
the premium fare charged on the high speed service.
Southeastern became entitled to revenue support from 1 April
2010. Revenue support is provided by the DfT based on
projections of the relevant revenue amounts for the rail year ended
each March compared to bid.We estimate that Southeastern will
be at around 90% of bid revenue for the year ended 31 March
2011. This 10% shortfall is shared with the DfT who provide 50%
support between 98% and 94% and 80% support for any shortfall
below 94%. On this basis, DfT support would be 5.2% of revenue
or roughly half of the 10% shortfall.
Underlying profitability has been achieved through a continuing and
significant cost savings programme which Southeastern started in
the first half of 2009.The programme includes further reductions in
staffing which incurred an exceptional charge of £0.5m (2009:
£1.9m), ongoing procurement savings and other efficiency savings.
Our operational performance in Southeastern remained strong,
with a PPM showing 89.2% (2009: 90%) of our trains arrived on
time and the Spring National Passenger Survey customer
satisfaction rating improved to 81% (2009: 76%).

was £34.3m (2009: £50.5m), primarily attributable to Meteor.The
reduction in Meteor’s turnover is largely due to the expiration of
the Heathrow parking contract in September 2009.
Operating profit (excluding discontinued operations) of £1.0m
(2009: £0.7m) was mainly generated by Meteor.

We recognise that adopting a responsible approach directly
contributes to the success of our business. Our performance on
issues such as safety, service punctuality, convenience and value for
money are factors that help us grow patronage. In many cases our
operational performance is regulated by bodies such asTransport
for London and the Department forTransport and therefore forms
part of the Group’s licence to operate.
Minimising the Group’s environmental impact also makes good
business sense. Improving the fuel economy of our rail and bus
operations reduces carbon emissions and delivers significant cost
benefits. In addition, our achievements in reducing site energy
consumption will help to mitigate the financial implications of the
Government’s Carbon Reduction Commitment Energy Efficiency
Scheme (CRC).As concern about climate change grows, our
environmental credentials are becoming increasingly important to
our stakeholders and can play a key part in helping to secure
contracts.
We firmly believe that public transport is a good place to be. Buses
and trains are more carbon efficient than the private car and it is
widely accepted that sustainable transport is key to tackling
congestion, delivering important international commitments on
climate change and achieving a low carbon economy.
An efficient public transport system is also vital to economic
development. Buses and trains take people to and from work and
provide access to services and leisure activities.The transport
sector remains a major employer and contributor to the local
economy.At Go-Ahead we have 22,500 staff working in our
businesses across England.
OUR APPROACHTO CORPORATE
RESPONSIBILITY
Corporate responsibility (CR) has always been at the heart of
Go-Ahead and over the years we have led the way in our
approach.We recognise the importance of being open about our
performance and were the first in our sector to publish our
responsibility data, at Group and individual operating company level.
We remain the only public transport company to provide this level
of transparency.
We have voluntarily responded to the Carbon Disclosure Project
(CDP) survey since 2006 disclosing details of how we manage our
greenhouse gas footprint. CDP is an independent not-for-profit
organisation holding the largest database of corporate climate
change information in the world.The information is used by a wide
Operating our companies in a safe, socially and environmentally responsible manner is a vital part
of the Group’s strategy. It is what we do on a day-to-day basis and is deeply embedded across our
organisation at all levels.

FIVE AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY
Feedback from last year’s Corporate Responsibility report and our
engagement with key stakeholders showed a clear desire for a simpler
approach to reporting our CR objectives and achievements.We have
taken those comments on board and have structured our reporting
around five key areas.
We have also undertaken significant work internally to improve the
process of centrally collating CR data from across our devolved
Group.This has brought the process in line with our approach to
collating the Group’s financial results.

We continue to increase the number of train
stations with Secure Station Status, awarded by
the Department forTransport and the British
Transport Police. During the financial year, an
additional 75 stations were accredited, bringing
the total to 274 stations, covering almost 90% of
our passengers. Secure Stations are those which
meet strict security criteria, including a reduction
in crime rates, good station maintenance,
including lighting and CCTV, and positive results
in an independent passenger survey.

OUR KEY STAKEHOLDERS
At Go-Ahead, working with stakeholders is a fundamental part of
the way we run our business.Working closely with the groups listed
below is pivotal to our success. Frequent engagement enables us to
better understand their expectations and gives us the opportunity
to share our plans with them.
At Board and senior management level we have good working
relationships with the Government and other industry bodies. Our
devolved business structure supports positive relationships with
local stakeholders.Across the Group we held around 1,000
stakeholder events this financial year to help understand local issues
and explain our plans.These include ‘Meet the Manager’ sessions,
Stakeholder Advisery Boards and meetings with local authorities
and MPs.
OUR KEY ISSUES
This financial year we have focused on the following three areas:
SAFETY: OUR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY
As a public transport operator, the safety and security of our
passengers, our people and the general public is always an absolute
priority for the Group.Although Go-Ahead and the industry
already operate to high safety standards we continually strive to
improve our performance.This year we have set Group wide
targets to improve our safety peformance by 20% by 2015
2
.
Bus accidents
The number of bus accidents per million miles has decreased by 8%
since 2008, but we are committed to doing more.Not only is it our
responsibility to provide a safe and positive travel experience but
reducing the number of accidents also makes business sense as the
cost of insurance claims remains a significant Group expense. In
2008/09 we launched the Group wide ‘safe & fuel efficient’ driving
scheme which promotes smooth driving.This year, we have
produced a unique training video called ‘Accidents Can Be Avoided.’
The video features bus drivers from around the Group sharing
their knowledge and experience in ways to prevent accidents, as
well as real life footage. It also illustrates the importance of efficient
management of insurance claim costs if an accident does occur.
T raining video
Our video ’Accidents Can Be Avoided’ is frequently used across our bus companies as
part of our bus driver training programme.
EMPLOYEES
Our 22,500 employees
keep our company
moving.They work in a
wide range of roles,
from bus and train
drivers and station
staff to engineering,
accountancy and
marketing.Almost all
of our operational
employees belong to a
union.
PASSENGERS
Over one billion
passenger journeys are
made with us each
year, so our customers
are our key audience.
COMMUNITY
Our bus and rail
companies form
integral parts of the
towns and cities they
serve. Good
relationships with local
communities are
essential to our
business.
GOVERNMENT
AND LOCAL
AUTHORITIES
Public transport is a
fundamental part of the
UK’s infrastructure.
Changes to
Government policy and
regulation can affect
our business, and
working closely with
local authorities helps
to deliver passenger
growth.
INVESTORS
As a public listed
company, attracting
private investment is
vital to our success.
We are committed to
delivering shareholder
value and maintain
open and frequent
dialogue with investors
throughout the year.
SUPPLY CHAIN
Our key suppliers
range from bus and
train manufacturers to
Network Rail who
provide the
infrastructure for our
train operations. Our
suppliers help us to
deliver our services in
a safe and
environmentally
responsible manner.

Corporate
responsibility ENVIRONMENT: DRIVING ENERGY FURTHER
It is now widely accepted that climate change is one of the biggest
challenges facing our society.Transport accounts for one third of UK
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions with the private car close to 60%. In
contrast, buses and trains together account for only 5% .The maths is
clear – encouraging people out of cars onto public transport delivers
real carbon savings today.
We recognise that as a transport provider, we contribute to GHG
emissions.As our passenger numbers grow, we are putting more
vehicles on the road and rails. Despite this, we also help to alleviate
environmental impacts, because trains and buses are much more
environmentally efficient per passenger journey than the private car.
Through innovation and investment in energy efficiency projects of
around £8m, we have made significant progress in reducing our
carbon emissions.The financial savings have also been substantial,
with a payback period of less than one year on capital expenditure.
Carbon emissions by source
911,484
tonnes
Estimated carbon reductions (CO2 ‘000 tonnes) from
improvements in energy efficiency
The chart above shows the estimated carbon savings resulting from our energy efficiency projects in
the financial years 2009 and 2010.The savings are based on improvements in rail electric vehicle
kms/kwh, where the consumption data is provided by Network Rail, improvements in mpg in our bus
companies and reductions in site and gas consumption at our sites.
Almost 60% of the Group’s carbon emissions result from traction
electricity used to power electric train fleets, mainly on our
Southern and Southeastern networks.The effects of regenerative
braking on the third rail have therefore been significant.The
introduction of eco driving techniques has also helped to improve
rail energy efficiency.
In our bus division the carbon savings have resulted from the
success of our fuel efficient driving programme.Across our depots
we have reduced site energy through investment in intelligent
lighting systems, smart gas and electricity meters and by
encouraging all colleagues to take simple steps to control site
energy use by switching off unnecessary lights, electrical equipment
and heating.
Go-Ahead target: 20% reduction in CO2 by 2015
(per passenger journey)
This year we have set a Group wide strategy ‘Driving Energy Further’
to reduce our carbon emissions by 20% by 2015
2
per passenger
journey.This target marks our commitment to continually seek ways
of making our fuel and energy go that bit further while continuing to
encourage more people to use public transport by providing high
quality, convenient and value for money transport solutions.
Carbon Reduction Commitment Energy Efficiency
Scheme (CRC)
The progress we have made in reducing our site energy places us in
a favourable position with the Government’s Carbon Reduction
Commitment Energy Efficiency Scheme (CRC) which began in April
2010.The UK Government has committed to a 20% reduction in
CO2 emissions by 2020, compared to 1990 levels. CRC has been
designed to focus UK business on this goal through a new
emissions trading scheme, whereby companies have to purchase
allowances each year to cover their CO2 emissions.The revenues
are redistributed among the participants, with each receiving either
a bonus or a penalty, depending on the extent to which they have
reduced their emissions.
PASSENGERS: IMPROVINGTHE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE
This year we progressed a number of projects to improve the
convenience of buying tickets and travelling on our services
following customer research and feedback. Online retailing in the
bus and rail industry is less developed than other sectors. For
example, in the aviation industry, passengers widely use the internet
to book flights; in rail a very limited amount of rail tickets continue
to be bought online.

Financial Statements Directors’ Report: Corporate Governance Directors’ Report: Business Review Appointment of New Non-Executive Director
The Board was pleased to announce the recent appointment of
Katherine Innes Ker as a Non-Executive Director of the Board with
effect from 9 July 2010. Katherine is also a member of the Audit,
Remuneration and Nomination Committees.This represents a change
to the previous constitution, and historic non-compliance with the
Combined Code, where the Audit and Remuneration Committees
were not made up of at least three Non-Executive Directors.
With effect from 9 July 2010, there are no longer any provisions of
the Combined Code with which Go-Ahead does not comply.
OUR DEVOLVED STRUCTURE
We believe that our devolved management structure, as illustrated
below, enables the Group to be managed in a particularly effective
way. Local management throughout the Group are empowered to
operate our companies as autonomous business units, whilst
working together to share experience and expertise around the
Group. For example, many aspects of the Group’s day-to-day
operations report through operating company senior management
directly into the Board through the Group Chief Executive and the
Group Finance Director (the ‘Executive Directors’):
•The Executive Directors sit on the board of each operating
company and meet formally with local senior management each
month.As each operating company is a separate legal entity, and
because of the autonomous nature of the business units, minutes
of each meeting are recorded.
The Board is committed to maintaining the highest standards of corporate governance and this section of
the Annual Report describes how Go-Ahead achieves these standards and complies with the Combined
Code of Corporate Governance.As a Board, we welcome the changes arising from the new UK
Corporate Governance Code and, while not applicable to Go-Ahead until next year, we are already
considering and implementing the changes appropriate to our own corporate governance arrangements.
In particular, and with effect from this year’s Annual General Meeting, all Directors will stand for annual
shareholder election.

BOARD EFFECTIVENESS
We believe that we are able to demonstrate the Board’s
commitment to good practices of corporate governance through
an ongoing re-evaluation of the Board, its structure and
performance. During the year, we made two important changes:
New Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
The Board was pleased to appoint Rupert Pennant-Rea (who is also
Senior Independent Director) as Chairman of the Remuneration
Committee in October 2009.This represents a change to the
previous constitution, and historic non-compliance with the
Combined Code, where the Chairman of the Company was also
the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee.
54 www.go-ahead.com • The Executive Directors hold regular meetings with the Managing
Directors of all of the operating companies (the ‘Chief Executive
Group’) to facilitate the sharing of experience and best practice
across operations.
•The Executive Directors meet on a monthly basis with the senior
managers who are responsible for the key centralised Group
functions (the ‘ExecutiveTeam Group’) which include company
secretarial, finance, pensions, engineering, properties and services,
procurement and technology.
In addition, there are a number of Group forums that are held on a
regular basis which consider finance, engineering, health & safety
and energy matters.These key forums, which also report directly to
the Executive Directors, enable representatives from all operating
companies to share best and emerging practice, to seek synergies
and cost savings, to improve quality and to achieve economies of
scale wherever possible.
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
Operating our companies in a safe, socially and environmentally
responsible manner is a vital part of the Group’s strategy. It is what
we do on a day-to-day basis and is deeply embedded across our
organisation at all levels.
The Board is ultimately responsible for the Group’s corporate
responsibility.We do not have separate Board level committees for
corporate responsibility and health & safety as we believe it is
fundamental for the Board as a whole to be involved in these areas,
which are integral to our business.
The Group’s flat structure enables the Board to closely monitor the
performance of each operating company. Safety and energy Key
Performance Indicators (‘KPIs’) are reviewed at monthly operating
company board meetings, chaired by the Executive Directors. Internal
safety and energy targets for each of our operating companies are set
at the beginning of the financial year and progress against these targets
is linked to both operating company senior managers’ and Executive
Directors’ remuneration.A health & safety audit of each of our
businesses is undertaken by an external consultant each year.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT: CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
COMPLIANCE WITH THE 
COMBINED CODE
The Board confirms that the Company has been in full compliance
throughout the financial year with the main principles of the
Combined Code published in June 2008 (the ‘Combined Code’). A
copy of the Combined Code is available on the Financial Reporting
Council’s website (www.frc.org.uk/corporate/combinedcode.cfm).
The Company has also complied with all of the provisions set out
in Section 1 of the Combined Code, with the following exceptions:
B.2.1 – The Remuneration Committee should be made up of at
least three independent Non-Executive Directors and the
Company Chairman should not chair the Committee.
Following the appointment of Rupert Pennant-Rea as Chairman of
the Remuneration Committee in October 2009 and the
appointment of Katherine Innes Ker as Non-Executive Director in
July 2010, Go-Ahead is now fully compliant with this provision. 
C.3.1 – The Audit Committee should be made up of at least
three independent Non-Executive Directors.
Following the appointment of Katherine Innes Ker as Non-
Executive Director in July 2010, Go-Ahead is now fully compliant
with this provision. 
BOARD ORGANISATION AND
STRUCTURE
The Board
At the beginning of the year, the Board comprised the Non-
Executive Chairman, two independent Non-Executive Directors
(one of whom is the Senior Independent Director) and two
Executive Directors. Following the appointment of Katherine Innes
Ker on 9 July 2010, the Board now comprises three independent
Non-Executive Directors. The Directors’ biographies can be found
on page 52. With the exception of Katherine Innes Ker, all Directors
were members of the Board throughout the financial year. 
The Board has a formal schedule of matters reserved to it for
decision (see page 58). The Board has also delegated specific
responsibilities to the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination
Committees, each of which has terms of reference which detail
their authority and duties. 
While the Board delegates some of its responsibilities to these
Committees, it still retains full Board responsibility for a number of
key areas such as health & safety, corporate responsibility and risk
management. The Board feels that it is fundamental that the Board
as a whole is involved in decision making in these areas and this
‘hands-on’ approach has served the business well over previous
years. 
Responsibility for the operation of Group companies, implementing
Group strategy in accordance with the strategy agreed by the
Board and achievement of objectives is delegated to the Executive
Directors. The Executive Directors meet regularly with the senior
management and staff in the Group’s operating companies, both
formally via the monthly board meetings, and less formally on a
regular basis. 
The Board maintains a Board Procedures Manual, prepared in
response to the Combined Code. This includes formal procedures
for the working of the Board and its Committees, delegated
authorities, the timely provision of appropriate information and the
duties and responsibilities of Directors, including standards of
conduct and compliance. The Board has established robust
procedures for ensuring that their powers to authorise conflicts are
operated in accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association.
The Board considers that the Directors’ powers to authorise
conflict situations have operated effectively during the year and that
the procedures in place have been properly followed. 
Ongoing development and induction
In addition to Board and Committee meeting attendance, the Non-
Executive Directors are encouraged to update their skills,
knowledge and familiarity with the Company in order to
competently carry out their responsibility to Go-Ahead’s
shareholders. The Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors
attend the Group’s annual Senior Management Conference each
year, enabling them to review and discuss the Group’s strategy with
senior managers from across the Group. The Chairman also attends
meetings of the Chief Executive Group.
A full, formal and tailored induction for Katherine Innes Ker is
currently underway which includes a full briefing of her
responsibilities and obligations under law, regulation and corporate
governance guidelines. Katherine will also visit operating companies
to meet with local senior management, as well as meeting with the
Executive Directors and key Group personnel. 
56 www.go-ahead.com Roles of the Board
The offices of the Chairman and Group Chief Executive are held separately. The Company Chairman is Sir Patrick Brown and the Group
Chief Executive is Keith Ludeman. There is a clear division of responsibility between the Chairman and the Group Chief Executive. The
Group Finance Director is Nick Swift. Rupert Pennant-Rea is the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director. Andrew Allner and Katherine
Innes Ker are Non-Executive Directors. The table below outlines the division of key responsibilities, as agreed by the Board:

Board meetings
Directors are expected, wherever possible, to attend all Board
meetings, relevant Committee meetings, Annual and any General
Meetings. The Board holds a minimum of seven scheduled Board
meetings throughout the year. At least one of the meetings each
year is dedicated to reviewing the Group’s strategy. Additional
meetings are held as and when required. The Chairman and the
Non-Executive Directors periodically meet without the Executive
Directors being present.
During the year ended 3 July 2010, the Board held eight scheduled
meetings. The table on page 59 shows Directors’ attendance at
scheduled meetings they were eligible to attend during the financial
year. There were also a number of additional Board meetings held
to consider matters arising before the next scheduled Board
meeting. In addition to the Annual General Meeting held in
October 2009, a General Meeting of shareholders was held in
February 2010 to alter the current restrictions on the borrowings
imposed by the current Articles of Association of the Company. 
The agenda for each Board meeting is set by the Chairman, in
consultation with the Group Chief Executive and Group Company
Secretary. Detailed briefing papers in relation to the business to be
conducted at each meeting are circulated to the Board at least one
week before each meeting and individual Board members have
direct access to the Executive Directors and the Group Company
Secretary should they wish to receive additional information. 
Board meetings are structured to allow open discussion and debate
and the Chairman ensures that adequate time is available for
discussion of all agenda items, in particular strategic issues. Key
senior managers and advisors attend relevant parts of Board
meetings on a regular basis, and as required, to ensure that the
Board is properly informed about the current issues facing the
business. Minutes of all meetings are circulated promptly afterwards. 
58 www.go-ahead.com Non-Executive Directors’ tenure
Group Company Secretary
Carolyn Sephton, who was appointed in July 2006, is the Group
Company Secretary. Her biography can be found on page 52. 
She is Secretary to the Board and all of its Committees. The Group
Company Secretary reports to the Company Chairman in her role
as Secretary to the Board and its Committees. For all other company
secretariat matters, including the management of the Group’s non-rail
pension arrangements, she reports to the Group Finance Director. 
The Group Company Secretary is responsible to the Board for
ensuring that Board procedures are complied with, facilitating
effective communication flows within the Board and its Committees,
as well as the provision of accurate, timely and clear information to
the Board ahead of meetings. Responsibilities also include ensuring
that the Board is regularly updated on matters of corporate
governance, legislative changes and regulatory regimes affecting the
Group. The appointment and removal of the Group Company
Secretary are matters for the Board as a whole.
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the Group
Company Secretary and may also take independent professional
advice at the Group’s expense, if they believe it necessary for the
proper discharge of their duties as Directors.
APPOINTMENTS TO THE BOARD
During the year, the Nomination Committee commenced a selection
process for the appointment of a new independent Non-Executive
Director. An external search agency was appointed to assist in the
identification of suitable candidates. After interviewing a number of
potential candidates the Committee unanimously proposed, and the
Board unanimously approved, the appointment of Katherine Innes
Ker with effect from 9 July 2010. Katherine is also a member of the
Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees. As explained on
page 56, an induction process for Katherine Innes Ker is currently
underway.

Balance of Non-Executive and Executive Directors
Board balance and independence
The Board regularly considers whether the Executive and Non-
Executive Directors together have the range of skills, knowledge
and experience to enable them to promote shareholders’ interests
and govern the business effectively. Excluding the Chairman, more
than half of the Board are Non-Executive Directors who bring a
wide range of experience and objectivity to the Boardroom. The
Executive Directors bring additional perspective to the Board’s
work through a deep understanding of the Group’s business. The
balance of Executive and Non-Executive Directors at the date of
this report is shown above. This includes Katherine Innes Ker, who
was appointed as a Non-Executive Director after the year end on 9
July 2010.
In accordance with the Combined Code, the Chairman was
considered independent on his appointment and the Board
considers all of the Non-Executive Directors to be robustly
independent in character and judgement in accordance with the
provisions of the Combined Code. The Board also regularly
assesses the other commitments of the Non-Executive Directors
and is satisfied that there are no conflicts of duties and that the
Non-Executives have sufficient time to fulfil their responsibilities to
shareholders.
It is important that the Board ensures planned and progressive
refreshing of the Board. The balance of experience of the Non-
Executive Directors, in terms of their length of tenure at the date of
the approval of this report, is shown above. This includes Katherine
Innes Ker, who was appointed as a Non-Executive Director after
the year end on 9 July 2010.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT: CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
As is the case for all of Go-Ahead’s Non-Executive Directors, Katherine
Innes Ker has not been appointed for a specified term. However, in
accordance with the Combined Code, she will stand for election by the
shareholders at the 2010 Annual General Meeting and for re-election
annually thereafter. Katherine has significant Executive and Non-
Executive experience of helping to grow successful and dynamic
organisations and has considerable experience as a financial analyst,
qualifying her to make an effective contribution to the Board. Her
biography can be found on page 52. The Board recommends
unanimously to shareholders that Katherine Innes Ker is elected as a
Non-Executive Director at the 2010 Annual General Meeting. 
PERFORMANCE EVALUATION 
Each year an evaluation of the performance of the Board, its
Committees, individual Directors and the Group Company Secretary is
undertaken.  As shown above, the Board’s evaluation was carried out by
the Chairman this year and was based on the completion of a tailored
questionnaire by each Director. Following individual meetings with the
Chairman, the results of the evaluation were reported back to the
Board as a whole. The objectives of this exercise were to ensure that
the Board, its Committees and each individual Director continued to act
effectively and to fulfil the duties and responsibilities expected of them,
in addition to identifying any additional training requirements. 
The Non-Executive Directors, led by the Senior Independent Director,
were responsible for the performance evaluation of the Chairman,
taking into account the views of the Executive Directors. 
No significant issues were raised in the course of the evaluation process.
It is anticipated that the evaluation of the Board will be carried out by
an external consultant next year. 
RE-ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
The Board is pleased to adopt early the provision of the new UK
Corporate Governance Code which requires all directors of FTSE 350
companies to be subject to annual election by shareholders. At this
year’s Annual General Meeting, Sir Patrick Brown, Rupert Pennant-Rea,
Andrew Allner, Keith Ludeman and Nick Swift will stand for re-election.
Katherine Innes Ker will stand for election. 
The Board’s annual performance evaluation confirmed that each
Director standing for re-election continued to contribute effectively and
demonstrated commitment to the role. 
Sir Patrick Brown joined the Board in 1999 as a Non-Executive
Director and became Non-Executive Chairman in 2002. The Board
recognises his industry-wide experience and long-standing contribution

RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
The Group recognises the importance of regular communication
with all of its shareholders. The reporting calendar is dominated by
the publication of the annual and half year results each year. In
addition, the interim management and trading statements provide
shareholders with a balanced and regular understanding of the
Group’s operational performance, its financial results and prospects. 
The Executive Directors meet with the Group’s major shareholders
(both institutional investors and private shareholders with significant
holdings) after the announcement of annual and half year results and
at other times as appropriate. Such meetings include site visits and
management presentations such as that which took place earlier in
the year regarding the proposal to alter the restrictions on borrowings
imposed by the current Articles of Association of the Company. 
In addition to the meetings with Executive Directors, institutional
shareholders are offered the opportunity of meetings with the Non-
Executive Directors. The institutional shareholders have further
opportunities to make their views known through follow-up
interviews with the Company’s brokers which are then documented

Interview and circulated to the Board. The Executive Directors provide feedback
to the Board following presentations to investors and an independent
survey of shareholder opinion was also undertaken during the year. 
The principal communication with private shareholders is through
the Annual Report and the Annual General Meeting, which is
attended by all Directors. All shareholders are invited to attend the
Annual General Meeting which provides an opportunity for
shareholders to develop their understanding of the Company and
ask questions on the matters put to the meeting (as detailed in the
Notice of Meeting sent to registered shareholders in advance of the
meeting). There is also an opportunity to meet informally with the
Directors before and after the meeting. The Board encourages all
shareholders to attend the Annual General Meeting.
Ordinary business which is raised for consideration at the Annual
General Meeting each year includes:
• T o receive the financial statements for the year, together with the
Directors’ and Auditors’ Reports;
• T o approve the Directors’ Remuneration Report;
• T o approve the final dividend;
• T o elect and re-elect members of the Board;
• T o re-appoint the Company’s Auditor; and
• T o give the Directors the authority to determine the 
Auditors’ remuneration.
Other matters included on the agenda for the Annual General
Meeting vary from year to year in accordance with the requirements
of the Company. 
The Company maintains a comprehensive website that provides a
wealth of information including access to the annual and half year
reports, presentations, useful fact sheets, as well as share price and
general shareholder information. Shareholders can contact the
Company using the email communication system available on the
Company’s website.
INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT
The Board as a whole, supported by the Audit Committee, has
responsibility for reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s system of
internal controls, including the financial, operational and compliance
controls and risk management systems. The Board has established
procedures to provide an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and
managing the significant risks facing the Group and has established the
procedures necessary to meet the requirements of the Code and its
related guidance on internal controls. The effectiveness of these
61 The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010
procedures are regularly reviewed by the Directors who consider that
they accord with the T urnbull guidance on internal controls. These
procedures have been in place during the financial year ended 3 July
2010 and up to the date of the approval of this report. 
During the year, the Group continued to improve the identification,
management and reporting of risk, with a focus on the evaluation of
key risks to each operating company’s own objectives and the
efficiency of the controls in place to mitigate those risks. Risks are
assessed both at an operating company level and for materiality in
the context of the whole Group, in addition to being used to
develop part of the internal audit plan for the year ahead.
Assessment is on an ongoing basis, taking into account changes in
external and internal circumstances. Through monthly meetings with
the Executive Directors, the key risks and mitigating controls facing
the Group are able to be kept under regular review. 
The principle risks and uncertainties facing the Group are discussed
on pages 22 to 25.
During the year, the Group has also strengthened its ongoing
processes for internal controls. The key features of the internal
control system, which have been established to safeguard both the
shareholders’ investment and the assets of the Group, are described
as follows:
The Board’s responsibilities 
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of
internal controls and for reviewing its effectiveness. The Group’s
Policy and Procedures Manual is designed to strengthen the Group’s
corporate governance, internal control processes and management
of risk. All operating companies must adhere to this Manual and
annually certify that they have done so. In addition, the Board gains
assurance from the Group’s structure and the financial, risk
management, operating and compliance reporting processes which
are in place. The Board has also developed an understanding of its
risk appetite which supports the Group’s strategy and objectives,
decision-making and management.
Board-level reporting on internal control
The Board is supported by the work of the Audit Committee which
has delegated responsibility from the Board for reviewing the
effectiveness of the Company’s risk management and internal control
systems. During the year the Audit Committee regularly reviewed
reports from the internal auditors, the external auditors and the
Executive Directors on matters relating to internal controls, financial
reporting and risk management. The Audit Committee provides the
Financial Statements Directors’ Report: Corporate Governance Directors’ Report: Business Review CORPORA TE GOVERNANCE C CO ON NT TI IN NU UE ED D  
DIRECTORS’ REPORT: CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Board with an independent assessment of the Group’s position and
the Board receives regular updates on how specific risks that are
assessed as material are being managed.
Group structure 
The Group’s decentralised organisation structure enables the
Executive Directors to play an active role in communicating the
objectives, risk strategy and policy of the Group. Open
communication on risk matters is encouraged and performance is
monitored against objectives. Risk management is an integral part of
day-to-day operations where there exists clear ownership of risk
identification and mitigation at operating company level. Operating
companies are fully supported by the Executive Directors in assessing
and managing risks and internal controls. Because of the
organisational structure, risk management information can also be
shared across the Group as well as reported upwards.
Financial reporting and planning processes
As part of the Group’s Policy and Procedures Manual, there are formally
defined lines of financial reporting responsibility, delegated authorities,
capital investment approval policies and clear operating processes.
Monthly reporting of financial information to the Board encompasses
profit and loss, cashflow and balance sheet information and key operating
ratios. The annual budgeting and strategic planning process includes
regular re-forecasting of results, taking into account key risks and
opportunities. 
The use of the Group’s Manual by finance teams throughout the
Group ensures that transactions and balances are recognised and
measured in accordance with prescribed accounting policies and that
information is appropriately reviewed and reconciled as part of the
reporting process. The use of a standard reporting pack by all
operating companies in the Group ensures that information is
gathered and presented in a consistent way that facilitates the
production of the consolidated financial statements. 
There is also regular reporting to the Board on specific matters
including safety, insurance, pensions, tax and treasury management.
Business planning encompasses due diligence and risk assessments
where businesses are being acquired or divested and all projects and
partnerships are entered into taking into account an appropriate risk-
reward balance. 
Risk management processes
As part of the Group’s Manual, and in accordance with the Turnbull
guidance on internal controls, an ongoing process has been
established for the identification and evaluation of the significant risks
faced by the Group and the effectiveness of the internal controls in
place. During the year, and in conjunction with the internal auditors,
PricewaterhouseCoopers, the Group continued to strengthen its
ongoing risk management processes, which includes top-down risk
assessment at Group level and bottom-up risk assessments at
operating company level. A bespoke risk categorisation model exists
which is used across the Group to ensure that risks are identified and
reported on a consistent basis and a process is in place to aggregate
key risks on a Group-wide basis. These key procedures ensure that
the impact of key and emerging risks are addressed, with controls
and mitigations monitored at monthly operating company board
meetings. A consolidated review of the Group’s risks and controls is
undertaken by the Audit Committee at least annually. 
Health and safety reporting processes
Health and safety standards have been established across all
operating companies and key performance indicators are closely
monitored at monthly operating company board meetings. The
Group Chief Executive reports on health and safety, which includes
key performance indicators, at each Board meeting. 
Group internal audit
The Group’s internal auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers, provide
assurance as to the effectiveness of key controls identified as part of
the risk assessment process. In addition to meetings with local
management, the internal auditors report on a monthly basis to the
Executive Directors and to the Audit Committee at least three times
a year. 
The Directors acknowledge their responsibility for establishing and
maintaining the Group’s system of internal control and for ensuring
its effectiveness. As with any system of internal controls, the policies
and processes in place throughout the Group are designed to
manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve the
Group’s strategic objectives, and can only provide reasonable, and not
absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss. There have
been no material weaknesses identified that require specific
disclosure in the Group’s Annual Report. 
DISCLOSURE AND TRANSPARENCY RULES 
Disclosures required under DTR 7.2.6 can be found on pages 
73 to 77.

Director of another listed company between 2004 and 2007,
Andrew Allner fully satisfies this requirement.
At least once a year, the Non-Executive Directors meet with the
external auditors, without the Executive Directors being present.
Policy on the Auditors providing non-audit services
In order to ensure auditor objectivity and independence, the provision
of certain non-audit services (including accounting and tax services if
the fees exceed a level set by the Audit Committee) are subject to
approval by the Audit Committee. The Committee has specified that
the external audit firm may not provide certain categories of non-
audit services to the Group as detailed in the Committee’s terms of
reference. The Committee keeps under review the cost effectiveness,
independence and objectivity of the external auditors. During the
financial year, the audit fees of the external auditor were £0.5m and
their fees for non-audit work in relation to continuing operations only
were £0.3m. In comparison, non-audit fees paid to other audit firms
during the financial year were £0.3m.

basis, the 2009/10 audit will be the last year of Debbie O’Hanlon’s
tenure. From the 2010/11 audit, subject to shareholders’ approval
at the 2010 Annual General Meeting, Debbie O’Hanlon will be
replaced by Kath Barrow.
Whistle Blowing Policy
The Group is committed to the highest standards of quality,
honesty, openness and accountability and a ‘whistle blowing’ policy
has been issued to all operating companies to ensure a consistent
approach across the Group. Employees are encouraged to raise
genuine concerns under the policy and any concerns raised are
investigated carefully and thoroughly to assess what action, if any,
should be taken. Any matters of significance are reported to the
Audit Committee. During the year, no issues of significance 
were raised.

Acceptance by the Board of Remuneration
Committee proposals
During the year, the Committee’s recommendations were all accepted
unanimously by the Board and implemented without amendment.
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY
It is the responsibility of the Remuneration Committee to set the
remuneration of the Executive Directors.The Committee is also
informed of the pay, incentives and benefits packages of senior
managers in the Group and its operating companies.The overall policy
adopted by the Committee is to ensure that the Group is paying
sufficient to attract, retain and motivate high calibre Executive
Directors for the benefit of the Group’s shareholders. Considerable
emphasis is placed on performance-driven compensation where
targets are aligned with the Group’s strategic objectives and targeted
shareholder returns.
In considering the Executive Directors’ remuneration, the Committee
follows the Combined Code in designing performance-related
remuneration schemes. In setting the framework for remuneration,
the Committee also has regard to the pay practices of its major
commercial competitors, to the wider pay market in the FTSE 250
and to other factors specific to the Group and to each Director.
The Committee recognises that, for the Group’s business, shareholder
value is dependent on factors not all necessarily appearing within the
published financial statements, although their effect on later financial
statements can be significant. Leading these factors are safety, control
of risk and other executive actions of a strategic nature that may take
several accounting periods to show changes in shareholder value.The
Executive Directors are encouraged to take environmental, social,
governance and strategy matters extremely seriously and always to
consider the long term implications of their decision making.The
Committee has regard to these factors, as well as the annual reported
financial statements, in arriving at the overall remuneration and in
considering the mix between fixed and variable pay.
In accordance with the Remuneration Committee’s policy, a
substantial proportion of the Executive Directors’ pay is
performance-related.The chart on page 67 shows the balance
between fixed and performance-related pay at maximum
performance levels. Maximum performance assumes achievement
of maximum cash bonus and full vesting of shares under the Long
Term Incentive Plan (LTIP).
This report has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Schedule 8 of the Large and
Medium Sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 and has been approved
by the Remuneration Committee and the Board. Ernst andY oung LLP have audited certain parts of this
report.Where disclosures have been subject to audit, they are indicated as such.The auditors’ opinion is
included in their report on page .

78 As reported last year, for the year ending 3 July 2010 only, the
proportion of performance-related pay increased as a result of an
increase in the performance-related cash bonus and an additional
discretionary bonus award. Page 68 illustrates the actual
remuneration for the Executive Directors for the year ending 3 July
2010 compared to the previous year. For subsequent years, the
policy will revert to that shown in the chart below.
Fixed and performance-related pay at maximum
performance levels
BASIC SALARY
Each of the Executive Directors is paid an annual basic salary which is
reviewed in April each year.At the review in April 2009, and in view of
wider economic conditions, the Committee decided that no increases
in basic salary should be awarded. In considering the pay review in
April 2010, the Committee remained mindful of the continuing
difficult economic conditions and the general level of interest and
concern over executive salaries, in addition to the pay and
employment conditions elsewhere in the Group.
At the review in April 2010, and in consultation withT owers Watson
Limited, the Committee decided that the Group Chief Executive
should be awarded an increase in line with inflation (2.5%).The
Committee also decided that the Group Finance Director should be
awarded an increase beyond inflation based on clear evidence that his
existing salary was not competitive in relation to his performance and
experience in post.
PERFORMANCE-RELATED CASH BONUS
Each of the Executive Directors also has the opportunity to earn
additional remuneration under a performance-related cash bonus
arrangement.The bonus is non-pensionable and is paid in cash.This
opportunity is normally capped at a maximum bonus of 100% of
basic annual salary. Of the bonus potential of 100%, 80% is driven by

Performance-related cash bonus
financial performance against budget and 20% by personal
performance against a number of qualitative objectives agreed with
each Executive Director at the beginning of the year. As reported last
year, while the fundamental structure of the performance-related
bonus targets remains unchanged, for the year ending 3 July 2010, the
Committee resolved that an additional 15% of basic salary would be
achievable in relation to a specific strategic target, which was to
dispose of the majority of the aviation division. For this year only, the
maximum performance-related cash bonus potential was 115% of
basic annual salary.
For the year ending 3 July 2010, the Executive Directors were both
awarded the maximum performance-related cash bonus of 115%
of basic salary.The Group’s profit substantially exceeded budget,
triggering a bonus of 80% for financial performance against budget.
Both Executive Directors met their qualitative objectives and so
received a bonus of 20%. An additional 15% was payable following
the successful disposal of the majority of the aviation division.
In subsequent years, the maximum bonus potential will revert to 100%.
ADDITIONAL DISCRETIONARY BONUS
As reported last year, following the year ending 27 June 2009, and in
recognition of the significant achievement in retaining the Southern
franchise, the Committee exercised their discretion and resolved to
award an additional discretionary bonus to the Executive Directors.
The Committee felt that it was appropriate to recognise the
importance of the retention of the franchise to the Group outside the
normal annual bonus structure, with a deferred share element to
provide long term alignment with shareholders’ interests.
Out of a total discretionary award of £100,000 each payable to the
Group Chief Executive and the Group Finance Director, 50%
(£50,000 each) was payable in November 2009 as an additional non-
pensionable cash bonus.The remaining 50% (£50,000 each) was used
to purchase 3,498 shares each, under a Deferred Share Bonus Plan,
subject to a holding provision of three years.The deferred share
awards will lapse if the Executive Director leaves the Company during
the deferral period for any reason other than redundancy, retirement
or ill health.

LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (LTIP)
Following its approval by shareholders in October 2005, the LTIP
has been the Group’s sole long-term share incentive plan for the
Executive Directors. The LTIP provides for the award of nil-cost
options to acquire shares, exercisable at the end of a three year
performance period, subject to the satisfaction of performance
conditions. The Executive Directors are eligible to receive an award
of shares up to an equivalent of 150% of their annual basic salary
each year.
Current Performance Conditions
Awards granted under the LTIP from the 2009/10 financial year will
vest based solely on a comparison of the Group’s three year T otal
Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) performance with that of the
companies within two comparator groups: the Transport Sector
Comparator Group (Arriva plc, FirstGroup plc, National Express
Group plc and Stagecoach Group plc) and the constituents of the
FTSE 250 Index (excluding investment trusts). Specifically:-
T ransport Sector Comparator Award (one half)
One half of the award requires a comparison of the Group’s TSR
with the TSR of other companies in the transport sector - this is a
highly relevant but small peer group comprising five companies only
including the Group. This half of the award is calculated as follows:
• if the Group’s TSR is midway between the TSR of the comparator
companies with the highest and the lowest TSRs, the award vests
as to 25% (12.5% of total potential award);
• if the Group’s TSR is higher than the TSR of the comparator
company with the highest TSR, or is less than that TSR by not
more than 25% of the difference between the TSRs of the
comparator companies with the highest and the lowest TSRs, the
award vests in full (50% of total potential award); and
• if the Group’s TSR falls between those two positions, the
proportion of the award that vests increases, on a straight-line
basis, from 25% to 100%, the higher the TSR of the Group (12.5%
to 50% of total potential award).
FTSE 250 Comparator Award (one half)
The other half of the award is based on a comparison of the
Group’s TSR with the TSR of companies (excluding investment
trusts) that comprise the FTSE 250 index of companies. This half of
the award is calculated as follows: 
• if the Group’s TSR is placed at the median position, the award
vests as to 25% only (12.5% of total potential award);
• if the Group’s TSR is placed in the top quartile, 100% of the
award vests (50% of total potential award); and
• if the Group’s TSR is placed between those two positions, the
proportion of the award that vests increases, on a straight-line
basis, from 25% to 100%, the higher the TSR of the Group (12.5%
to 50% of total potential award).

Awards granted under the LTIP for the 2008/09 financial year are
such that only half of the award is linked to comparative TSR against
the two comparator groups and the other half is linked to real
growth in adjusted earnings per share (EPS). Awards granted in
relation to the financial years up to and including the 2007/08
financial year are based on current performance conditions with an
additional minimum requirement that the Group should achieve an
increase in adjusted EPS over a three year period of not less than
the increase in the retail prices index (RPI) plus 3% per year. If this
target is not met, no part of these awards will vest (and, accordingly,
participants will not acquire any shares). There is no ability to retest
any performance conditions.
All changes to the LTIP involve consultation with major
shareholders. The most recent consultation was last year, when the
Committee concluded that it was no longer appropriate to use an
EPS target given the current economic uncertainty, and that the
most suitable way to set a stretching but motivating target was to
align with returns to shareholders, namely TSR. 
It is the Committee’s view that the structure of LTIP ensures that
the Executive Directors continue to be rewarded if they achieve
substantial improvements in the Group’s underlying financial
performance and perform well relative to other companies in the
FTSE 250. The Committee considers that the LTIP is aligned to the
long term interests of the Group, with performance conditions that
are relevant, challenging and designed to enhance shareholder
value. Awards will vest in full only if exceptional performance has
been achieved.
SHARE INCENTIVE PLAN
The Group operates a Share Incentive Plan in which the Executive
Directors are eligible to participate, under terms identical to any other
participating Group employee. Any such participation would not be
separately regulated by the Remuneration Committee. The Executive
Directors do not currently participate in the Share Incentive Plan.
There are no other share option or long term incentive schemes
available to the Executive Directors.
OTHER BENEFITS
The Group does not allocate company cars to any employees,
including the Executive Directors. Instead, employees who would have
been allocated a company car as part of their benefits, or to
accomplish their work, are given a car replacement allowance. Such
allowances are non-pensionable.
PENSION FUNDS
Under the terms of their service agreements, the Executive Directors are
entitled to become members of The Go-Ahead Group Pension Plan. 
The Group Chief Executive opted out of The Go-Ahead Group
Pension Plan with effect from 1 December 2006, but retained a salary
link in relation to his accrued benefit which was provided separately
through an individual non-registered unfunded pension arrangement
(UURBS). In lieu of future benefits, he receives a non-pensionable
salary supplement. This salary supplement is not included with basic
salary for the purposes of calculating performance-related cash bonus
or LTIP awards. With effect from 1 April 2010, the Group Chief
Executive began receiving his benefits from the Plan and UURBS (see
page 72 for further details).
The Group Finance Director is a member of The Go-Ahead Group
Pension Plan.
SHAREHOLDING GUIDELINES
Shareholder guidelines are in place for the Executive Directors which
provide for them to build up a personal or spouse’s shareholding
equal to one year’s basic annual salary over a period of five years. At
the end of the financial year, the Group Chief Executive had been in
post for four years and held 34,829 shares. Based on the closing share
price on 3 July 2010, this equates to 72% of his basic salary held in
shares of the Company. The Group Finance Director had been in post
for three years and held 12,586 shares, equating to 43% of his basic
salary.

NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS’
REMUNERATION 
The fees of the Non-Executive Directors are set by the Chairman and
the Executive Directors following an annual review in April each year.
The review takes account of fees paid for similar positions in the
market, the time commitment required and any additional
responsibilities undertaken. Non-Executive Directors are not eligible
to receive pension entitlements or performance-related remuneration
and may not participate in share option schemes. The Remuneration
Committee considers the remuneration of the Chairman in his
absence.
No increase in such fees was made following the annual reviews in
April 2009 and 2010. Details of the fees paid to the Chairman and
Non-Executive Directors are below:

The members of the Remuneration Committee have no personal
interests in the matters to be decided by the Committee other than 
as shareholders, and have no conflicts of interest arising from 
cross-directorships.
DIRECTORS’ CONTRACTS
It is the Group’s policy to restrict the notice periods for Executive
Directors to a maximum of 12 months. In line with this policy, the
Executive Directors have service contracts with an undefined term
but which provide for a notice period of 12 months. There are no
provisions for special pension benefits, such as beneficial early
retirement terms. Other than the notice periods specified, the
Executive Directors are not due any contractual compensation
payments in the event of loss of office. 
Each Non-Executive Director has a letter of appointment which
provides for a notice period of six months. The terms of appointment
contain no entitlement to compensation for early termination. The
letters of appointment are available for inspection at the Company’s
Registered Office during normal business hours and will also be available
for inspection prior to and during the Annual General Meeting.

PERFORMANCE GRAPH 
The following graph shows a comparison of The Go-Ahead Group
plc’s total cumulative shareholder return against that achieved by the
Group’s peers and the FTSE 250 Index for the last five financial years
to 3 July 2010. In assessing the performance of the Group’s TSR the
Board believes the comparator groups chosen represent an
appropriate and fair benchmark upon which to measure the Group’s
performance for this purpose. 
T otal shareholder return (rebased to 100)
(1) TSR peer group consists of Arriva plc, FirstGroup plc, National Express plc and Stagecoach Group plc.
This graph is included to meet the relevant legislative requirements
and is not directly relevant to the performance criteria used for the
Company’s LTIP . However, the indices used were selected as the
Directors believe that they are the most appropriate and
representative indices against which to measure the Company’s
performance, in terms of both the size of the Company and the
nature of its business.

Notes
(1) In light of changes to legislation and market conditions and upon taking actuarial advice, the Trustees of The Go-Ahead Group Pension Plan reviewed and amended the basis for
the calculation of cash equivalent transfer values with effect from 25 November 2009. The transfer values at the year end have been calculated in accordance with this basis.
(2) Keith Ludeman and Nick Swift were members of the Group’s approved final salary pension during the financial year. In addition, part of Keith Ludeman’s benefit is provided
separately through an individual unapproved unfunded pension arrangement (UURBS). 
(3) Keith Ludeman opted out of the Group’s approved final salary arrangement from 1 December 2006 but retained a salary link in relation to his accrued benefit. On 1 April 2010,
Keith Ludeman began receiving his benefits from both the approved and unapproved arrangements. The above figures reflect both of these defined benefit arrangements. His
pension entitlement from the Plan was calculated in line with standard practice, which included reducing his pension to reflect the fact that his benefit had come into payment in
advance of the Plan’s normal retirement age. The accrued pension at 3 July 2010 is Keith Ludeman’s immediate early retirement pension as at 1 April 2010, after commutation
for a tax-free cash lump sum of £406,000. The transfer value as at 3 July 2010 is based on market conditions at 3 July 2010, but calculated at the date Keith Ludeman took early
retirement. Consequently, his annual accrued pension has decreased over the financial year, but the value of this benefit has increased due to its immediate vesting. 
(4) In lieu of future pension benefits, Keith Ludeman receives a non-pensionable salary supplement of 15% of basic salary which amounted to £75,469 during the financial year. 
(5) Nick Swift participated in the pensions salary sacrifice arrangement operated by the Group during the year. The notional contributions shown in the table above are those he
would have paid had he not participated in this arrangement.

Meeting. The Directors are committed to measures that promote
good governance, and accordingly have chosen to early adopt the
new UK Corporate Governance Code provision whereby all

Directors to retire from office at every Annual General Meeting
and, if eligible, offer themselves for re-election.

the extent permitted by law, the Directors are granted an
indemnity from the Company in respect of liabilities incurred as a
result of their office. In respect of those matters for which the
Directors may not be indemnified, the Company maintained a
Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance policy throughout the
financial year. This policy has been renewed for the next financial
year. Neither the Company’s indemnity nor the insurance provides
cover in the event that a Director is proven to have acted
dishonestly or fraudulently.
The Directors present their report and audited financial statements
for the year ended 3 July 2010.
Principal activities
The principal activity of the Group throughout the year has been

Under the rules of the Company’s Share Incentive Plan, employees
of the Group are entitled to acquire shares in the Company. In
order to preserve certain tax benefits these shares are held in a
trust by EES Corporate Trustees Limited for participating
employees. Whilst these shares are held in trust, the voting rights
attached to them will not be exercised by the Trustee or the
employees for whom they are held. As at the date of this report,
0.6% of the issued share capital of the Company was held by EES
Corporate Trustees Limited. In the event of an offer being made to
acquire these shares the employees are entitled to direct EES
Corporate Trustees Limited to accept an offer in respect of the
shares held on their behalf.
During the financial year, 13,699 ordinary shares were allotted to
employees and former employees of the Company under the rules
of the Company’s Sharesave Scheme (a savings related share option
scheme). These shares held an aggregate nominal value of £1,370
and the Company received a total consideration of £200,948 for
them. In accordance with best practice guidelines, options granted
under this scheme do not exceed 10% of the issued ordinary share
capital during a rolling ten year period. Vesting of awards under the
Long Term Incentive Plan for the Executive Directors is satisfied by
market purchases of shares, and therefore there is no further
dilution of the issued share capital.

bring together employees, individual passengers and representative
bodies to share views. The Group produces a range of internal
newsletters, information circulars and intranet sites that keep
employees abreast of developments at their specific employing
company and across the Group as a whole. The Group has awards
to recognise and reward outstanding contributions made by our
employees.   
Employees are encouraged to participate directly in the success of
the business through the Group’s HMRC approved Share Incentive
Plan (SIP) which is open to all employees with six months’ service
and gives the opportunity to buy shares in the Company in a tax-
efficient manner. 
The Group is committed to developing a culture of openness
across all its businesses and ensuring the highest standards of
probity and accountability.  The Group engages with its employees,
who are encouraged to discuss matters of interest to them and
subjects affecting day-to-day operations with operating company
management. The Board also actively encourages employees with
serious concerns regarding the interests of others or the Group to
come forward. The Group and its operating companies have
policies in place to ensure processes exist whereby employees can
raise serious concerns constructively without fear of victimisation,
subsequent discrimination or disadvantage. 
Further details of the Group’s responsibilities as an employer,
including operating in a socially and environmentally responsible
manner, can be found on pages 46 to 51 and also in the Group’s
Environmental and Social Report which is published separately and
can be found on the Company’s website (www.go-ahead.com).
Charitable donations 
Charitable donations, sponsorship and community support over the
year amounted to £268,000 (2009: £257,000).  
Political donations and expenditure
It is the Group’s policy not to make political donations and
accordingly no such payments were made in the year (2009: £nil).
Additionally, the Company did not incur any political expenditure as
defined in the Companies Act 2006 (2009: £nil).
Land and buildings
In the opinion of the Directors, there is no material difference
between the market value of the Group’s interest in land and
buildings and its net book value. 
Suppliers
Each Group operating company individually agrees terms and
conditions for its business transactions with suppliers. Payment is
then made on these terms, subject to the terms and conditions
being met by the suppliers and the timely submission of satisfactory
invoices. For the year ended 3 July 2010, the trade creditor days for
The Go-Ahead Group plc as a Company (not as a Group) were 11
days (2009: 7), based on the ratio of trade creditors at the end of
the year to the amounts invoiced during the year by trade
creditors. 
Post balance sheet events
There are no post balance sheet events. 
Going concern 
The Directors have acknowledged the guidance on going concern
and financial reporting published by the Financial Reporting Council
in October 2009. The Group’s business activities, together with the
factors likely to affect its future development, performance and
position are set out in the Director’s Report: Business Review on
pages 1 to 51. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows,
liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the
Financial Review on pages 26 to 29. In addition, note 23 to the
financial statements includes the Group’s objectives, policies and
processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management
objectives; details of its financial instruments and hedging activities;
and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.

OTHER ST A TUTORY INFORMA TION C CO ON NT TI IN NU UE ED D  
DIRECTORS’ REPORT: CORPORATE GOVERNANCE The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group’s
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the
financial position of the Group, enabling them to ensure that the
financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006 and
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for
safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and
other irregularities.
Responsibility Statements 
The Directors who were members of the Board at the time of
approving the Directors’ Report are listed on page 52. The
Directors confirm that to the best of their knowledge:
a) The financial statements, prepared in accordance with IFRS as
adopted by the European Union, give a true and fair view of the
assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the Company and
the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole;
and 
b) The Directors' Report: Business Review includes a fair review of
the development and performance of the business and the
position of the Company and the undertakings included in the
consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of
the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.
Directors’ statement as to disclosure of information to
auditors 
Having made enquiries of fellow Directors and of the Company’s
auditors, each of the Directors confirms that:
• T o the best of each Director’s knowledge and belief, there is no
information (that is, information needed by the Company’s
auditors in connection with preparing their report) of which the
Company’s auditors are unaware; and
• Each Director has taken all the steps a Director might reasonably
be expected to have taken to be aware of relevant audit
information and to establish that the Company’s auditors are
aware of that information.
By Order of the Board
C Sephton, Company Secretary
1 September 2010
Cash generation from the Group’s bus and rail operations was
excellent and the balance sheet remains strong. Core financing is
provided by a £200m sterling bond issue securing financing to
September 2017 and bank facilities funding of £280m to
November 2012, of which £177m was undrawn and available at
the year end. The Directors believe that the Group is well placed to
manage its business risks successfully, despite the current uncertain
economic outlook.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable
expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable
future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis
in preparing the Annual Report and Accounts.
Directors’ responsibilities in relation to the financial
statements 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and
the Group financial statements in accordance with applicable UK
law and those International Financial Reporting Standards as
adopted by the European Union.
Under company law, the Directors must not approve the Group
financial statements unless they are satisfied that they present fairly
the financial position, the financial performance, and cashflows of
the Group for that period. In preparing those financial statements,
the Directors are required to: 
• Select suitable accounting policies in accordance with IAS 8
‘Accounting Policies, Change in Accounting Estimates and Errors’
and then apply them consistently;
• Present information, including accounting policies, in a manner
that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable
information;
• Provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific
requirements in International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
is insufficient to enable users to understand the impact of
particular transactions, other events and conditions on the
Group’s financial position and financial performance;
• State that the Group has complied with IFRS, subject to any
material departures disclosed and explained in the financial
statements; and 
• Make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable
and prudent.

Financial Statements Directors’ Report: Corporate Governance Directors’ Report: Business Review FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF THE GO-AHEAD GROUP PLC 
78 www.go-ahead.com 
We have audited the Group financial statements of The Go-Ahead 
Group plc for the year ended 3 July 2010, which comprise the 
Consolidated income statement, the Consolidated balance sheet, the 
Consolidated cashflow statement, the Consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income, the Consolidated statement of changes in 
equity and the related notes 1 to 29. The financial reporting framework 
that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union.  
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for 
our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditors 
As explained more fully in the Director’s Responsibilities Statement, set 
out on page 77, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of 
the Group financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit the Group financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to 
comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards 
for Auditors. 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the 
Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting 
estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the 
financial statements.  
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion the Group financial statements: 
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 3 July 
2010 and of its profit for the year then ended; 
• have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by 
the European Union; and 
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the  
Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion: 
• the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year 
for which the Group financial statements are prepared is consistent 
with the Group financial statements; and 
• the information given in the Corporate Governance Statement set 
out on pages 61 to 62 with respect to internal control and risk 
management systems in relation to financial reporting processes and 
about share capital structures is consistent with the financial 
statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following: 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in 
our opinion: 
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not 
made; or  
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require 
for our audit; or 
• a Corporate Governance Statement has not been prepared by the 
Company. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
• the Directors’ statement, set out on page 76 and 77, in relation to 
going concern; and  
• the part of the Corporate Governance statement on pages 56 to 62 
relating to the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 
June 2008 Combined Code specified for our review. 
Other matter 
We have reported separately on the parent company financial 
statements of The Go-Ahead Group plc for the year ended 3 July 2010 
and on the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is 
described as having been audited.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
for the year ended 3 July 2010 
 The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 83 
1. Authorisation of financial statements and statement  
of compliance with IFRSs 
The consolidated financial statements of The Go-Ahead Group plc (the 
‘Group’) for the year ended 3 July 2010 were authorised for issue by the 
Board of Directors on 1 September 2010 and the balance sheet was 
signed on the Board’s behalf by Sir Patrick Brown and Nick Swift. The 
Go-Ahead Group plc is a public limited company that is incorporated, 
domiciled and has its registered office in England and Wales. The 
Company’s ordinary shares are publicly traded on the London Stock 
Exchange and it is not under the control of any single shareholder. 
The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been 
prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union (EU) as they apply to the 
consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended 3 
July 2010, and applied in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006. The Group is required to comply with 
international accounting requirements under IAS 1 ‘Presentation of 
Financial Statements’ except in extremely rare circumstances where 
management concludes that compliance would be so misleading that it 
would conflict with the objective to ‘present fairly’ its financial 
statements. On that basis, the Group has departed from the 
requirements of IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ and has accounted for its 
constructive but not legal obligations for the Railways Pension Scheme 
(RPS) under the terms of its UK rail franchise agreements. Details of the 
background and rationale for this departure are provided in note 28. 
2. Summary of significant accounting policies 
Basis of preparation 
A summary of the Group’s accounting policies applied in preparing the 
financial statements for the year ended 3 July 2010 are set out below.  
The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling 
and all values are rounded to the nearest one hundred thousand 
(£0.1m) except when otherwise indicated. 
As noted above, the Group has taken the decision to depart from the 
requirements of IAS 19 so as to present fairly its financial performance, 
position, and cashflows in respect of its obligation for the RPS. 
New standards 
The following new standards or interpretations are mandatory for the 
first time for the financial year ending 3 July 2010: 
• IFRS8 ‘Operating segments’ 
• IAS23 ‘Borrowing costs (revised)’ 
• IFRS2 ‘Share-based payments – vesting conditions and cancellations’ 
• IAS1 ‘Presentation of financial statements (revised)’ 
• Amendment to IAS32 and IAS 31 ‘Puttable financial instruments and 
obligations arising on liquidations’ 
• Amendments to IFRS1 and IAS27 ‘Amendments for determining the 
cost of an investment in separate financial statements’ 
• Amendment to IAS39 ‘Eligible hedged items’ 
• Amendment to IFRS7 ‘Improving disclosures’ 
• Improvements to IFRSs (May 2008) 
• IFRIC13 ‘Customer loyalty programmes’ 
• IFRIC15 ‘Agreements for the construction of real estate’ 
• IFRIC16 ‘Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation’ 
The adoption of IAS1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements (revised)’ 
has required the ‘Statement of changes in equity’, previously described 
in note 26 to the annual report for the year ended 27 June 2009, to be 
presented as a primary statement entitled ‘Consolidated statement of 
changes in equity’. In addition, the ‘Consolidated statement of 
recognised income and expense’ has been replaced with the 
‘Consolidated statement of comprehensive income’. 
In adopting IFRS8 ‘Operating segments’, the Group concluded that the 
operating segments were the same as the business segments 
determined in accordance with IAS14 ‘Segment reporting’, more details 
are provided in note 3. 
Adoption of the remaining new standards and interpretations did not 
have a material impact on the financial performance or position of the 
Group. 
In accordance with IFRS5 ‘Non-current assets held for sale and 
discontinued operations’, the Group has classified the results of the 
ground handling and cargo operations as discontinued and accordingly 
the comparatives in the income statement and related notes have been 
restated. The above treatment is a result of the sale which completed 
on 30 January 2010 of the majority of the Group’s ground handling and 
cargo operations at Heathrow to Dnata and the majority of the 
Group’s ground handling operations outside Heathrow to Servisair UK 
Limited. The remaining ground handling operations are expected to be 
sold in the next twelve months and are also included in discontinued 
operations. 
Use of estimates 
The preparation of the financial statements requires the use of 
estimates and assumptions. Although these estimates are based on 
management’s best knowledge, actual results ultimately may differ from 
these estimates. 
The key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of 
causing material adjustments to the carrying value of assets and 
liabilities within the next financial year are in relation to:  
• the measurement and impairment testing of indefinite life intangible 
assets requires estimation of future cashflows and the selection of a 
suitable discount rate and growth rate, as detailed in note 14; 
• the measurement of defined benefit pension obligations requires the 
estimation of future changes in salaries, inflation, the expected return 
on assets and the selection of a suitable discount rate, as set out in 
note 28; and 
• the measurement of uninsured liabilities is based on an assessment of 
the expected settlement of known claims and an estimate of the cost 
of claims not yet reported to the Group. 
Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements 
of The Go-Ahead Group plc and its subsidiaries as at 3 July 2010. 
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is 
transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date 
on which control is transferred out of the Group. The financial 
statements of subsidiaries for use in the consolidation are prepared for 
the same reporting year as the parent company and are based on 
consistent accounting policies. All intra-group balances and transactions, 
including unrealised profits arising from intra-group transactions, have

2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued  
Interest in joint ventures 
In the year the Group has entered into a contractual arrangement with 
another party which represents a joint venture. This takes the form of 
an agreement to share control over another entity, through an interest 
in a company, (a jointly controlled entity). The Group recognises its 
interest in the entity’s assets and liabilities using the equity method of 
accounting. Under the equity method, the interest in the joint venture 
is carried in the balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in 
the Group’s share of its net assets, less distributions received and less 
any impairment in value of the investment. The Group income 
statement reflects the share of the jointly controlled entity’s results after 
tax. Where there has been a change recognised in other 
comprehensive income of the jointly controlled entity, the Group 
recognises its share of any such changes in the Consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income. 
Revenue recognition 
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the income 
will flow to the Group and the value can be reliably measured. 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received, 
excluding discounts, rebates, VAT and other sales taxes or duty.  
Rendering of services 
The revenue of the Group comprises income from road passenger 
transport, rail passenger transport and aviation services. 
Bus revenue comprises amounts receivable generated from ticket sales 
and revenue generated from services provided on behalf of local 
transport authorities. Revenue for aviation services represents income 
receivable generated from contracts in place with airlines and also 
includes parking revenue generated through the operation and 
management of car parks and associated services, which include 
security and bus transportation. Where the Group acts as a managing 
agent at a car park it recognises only the commission earned as 
revenue.  
Rail revenue comprises amounts based principally on agreed models of 
route usage, by Railway Settlement Plan Limited (which administers the 
income allocation system within the UK rail industry), in respect of 
passenger receipts and other related services such as rolling stock 
maintenance and commission on tickets sold. In addition, franchise 
subsidy receipts from the DfT and local Passenger Transport Executives 
(PTEs) are treated as revenue, and franchise premium payments to the 
DfT are recognised in operating costs. 
Revenue is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the 
customer’s journey or for other services based on the proportion of 
services provided. The attributable share of season ticket or travel card 
income is deferred within liabilities and released to the income 
statement over the life of the relevant season ticket or travel card. 
Rental income 
Rental income is generated from rental of surplus properties and 
subleasing of rolling stock and railway infrastructure access. It is 
accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
Finance revenue 
Interest on deposits is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the 
principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable. 
Government grants 
Government grants are recognised at their fair value where there is 
reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and all attaching 
conditions will be complied with. When the grant relates to an expense 
item, it is recognised in the income statement over the period 
necessary to match on a systematic basis to the costs that it is intended 
to compensate. Where the grant relates to a non-current asset, value is 
credited to a deferred income account and is released to the income 
statement over the expected useful life of the relevant asset. 
Uninsured liabilities 
The Group limits its exposure to the cost of motor, employer and 
public liability claims through insurance policies issued by third parties. 
These provide individual claim cover, subject to high excess limits and 
an annual aggregate stop loss for total claims within the excess limits. 
An accrual is made within current liabilities for the estimated cost to 
the Group to settle claims for incidents occurring prior to the balance 
sheet date, subject to the overall stop loss. On the basis that the Group 
does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement for at least 12 
months after the balance sheet date, these uninsured liabilities are 
classified as current. 
Profit/revenue sharing agreements 
The estimation of the balance sheet uninsured claims accrual is made 
after taking appropriate professional advice and is based on an 
assessment of the expected settlement on known claims, together with 
an estimate of settlements that will be made in respect of incidents 
occurring prior to the balance sheet date but that have not yet been 
reported to the Group by the insurer.  
Franchise bid costs 
A key part of the Group’s activities is the process of bidding for and 
securing franchises to operate rail services in the UK. All franchise bid 
costs incurred prior to achieving preferred bidder status are treated as 
an expense in the income statement irrespective of the ultimate 
outcome of the bid. Directly attributable, incremental costs incurred 
after achieving preferred bidder status are capitalised as an intangible 
asset and amortised over the life of the franchise. 
The rail companies have certain revenue and profit sharing agreements 
with the DfT. An accrual is made within amounts payable to central 
government for the estimated cost to the Group of the relevant 
amounts accrued at the balance sheet date.  
Exceptional items 
The Group presents as exceptional items on the face of the income 
statement those material items of revenue or expense which, because 
of the size or the nature and expected infrequency of the events giving 
rise to them, merit separate presentation to allow better understanding 
of financial performance. 
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost or deemed cost on 
transition to IFRSs less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in 
value. Freehold land is not depreciated. 
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of 
their expected useful lives and the lease terms. 
Depreciation is charged to the income statement based on cost or fair 
value, less estimated residual value of each asset, evenly over its 
expected useful life as follows: 
Short leasehold land and buildings The life of the lease 
Freehold buildings and  
long leasehold land and buildings 
 
Over 10 to 100 years 
Rolling stock Over 8 to 15 years 
Plant and equipment Over 3 to 15 years 
  Financial Statements  
 
 The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 85 
The carrying values of items of property, plant and equipment are 
reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances 
indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. If any such 
indication exists the assets are written down to their recoverable 
amount. 
Non-current assets held for sale 
Non-current assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower 
of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Non-current assets 
are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered 
through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This 
condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and 
the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition. 
Management must be committed to the sale which should be expected 
to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the 
date of classification. 
Business combinations and goodwill 
Acquisitions of businesses since 3 July 2004 are accounted for under 
IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ using the purchase method. Goodwill 
on acquisition is initially measured at cost being the excess of the costs 
of the business combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair 
value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities, 
meeting the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 at the acquisition 
date. It is capitalised and carried as an asset on the balance sheet. If an 
acquisition gives rise to negative goodwill, this is released immediately 
to the income statement. 
In some instances certain fair value accounting adjustments are required 
to be made using provisional estimates, based on information available, 
and amendments are sometimes necessary in the 12 months following 
the acquisition, with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill. 
Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any 
accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment, 
annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. Any impairment is 
recognised immediately in the income statement and not subsequently 
reversed. For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated 
to the related cash-generating units monitored by management.  
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRSs 
has been retained at the previous amounts, and has been subject to 
impairment testing as at the transition date and annually thereafter. 
Goodwill written off to reserves prior to 27 June 1998 has not been 
reinstated. In the event of subsequent disposal of the business to which 
it relates, goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the operation 
when determining the gain or loss on disposal to be charged to the 
income statement. 
Impairment of assets 
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an 
indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication exists, or 
when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group 
makes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount, being the higher 
of the asset’s or cash-generating unit’s fair value less costs to sell and its 
value in use. Value in use is determined for an individual asset, unless 
the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent 
of those from other assets or groups of assets, and the estimated 
future cashflows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax 
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value 
of money and the risks specific to the asset.  
Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable 
amount, the asset is considered to be impaired and is written down to 
its recoverable amount.  
Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in the 
income statement in those expense categories consistent with the 
function of the impaired asset. An assessment is made at each reporting 
date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised 
impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such 
indication exists, the recoverable amount is estimated. A previously 
recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change 
in the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount 
since the last impairment loss was recognised.  
The reinstated amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would 
have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss 
been recognised for the asset in prior years. After such a reversal the 
depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to allocate the asset’s 
revised carrying amount, less any residual value, on a systematic basis 
over its remaining useful life. 
Franchise assets 
Where the conditions relating to the award of a franchise require the 
Group to assume legal responsibility for any pension liability that exists 
at that point in time, the Group recognises a liability representing the 
fair value of the related net pension deficit that the Group expects to 
fund during the franchise term. When a pension deficit exists at the 
start of the franchise, a corresponding intangible asset is recognised, 
reflecting a cost in acquiring the right to operate the franchise. If a 
pension surplus exists at the start of the franchise, then a corresponding 
deferred income balance is recognised, representing a government 
grant. The intangible asset or deferred income balance is amortised 
through the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period 
of the franchise.  
The carrying value of franchise assets is reviewed for impairment at the 
end of the first financial year following the award of the franchise and in 
other periods if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the 
carrying value may not be recoverable. 
Software 
Software, that is not integral to the related hardware, is capitalised as 
an intangible asset and stated at cost less amortisation and any 
impairment in value. Amortisation is charged to the income statement 
evenly over its expected useful life of three to five years. 
Inventories 
Stocks of fuel and engineering spares are valued at the lower of cost 
and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and costs 
incurred in bringing the items to their present location and condition. 
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less costs of 
sale. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and short term deposits in the balance sheet comprise cash at 
bank and in hand, and short term deposits with an original maturity of 
three months or less. For the purpose of the consolidated cashflow 
statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash 
equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued  
Financial assets and derivatives 
Financial assets are accounted for in accordance with IAS 39. Financial 
assets are initially recognised at fair value, being the transaction price 
plus directly attributable transaction costs.  
The Group uses energy derivatives to hedge its risks associated with fuel 
price fluctuations and interest derivatives to hedge its risks associated with 
interest rate fluctuations. Such derivatives are initially recognised at fair value 
by reference to market values for similar instruments, and subsequently re-
measured at fair value at each balance sheet date. 
Changes in the fair value of financial instruments that are designated 
and effective as hedges of future cashflows are recognised in other 
comprehensive income and the ineffective portion is recognised 
immediately in the income statement. When the cashflow hedge results 
in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a liability, then at the time 
that asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the 
derivative that had previously been recognised in other comprehensive 
income are included in the initial measurement of that non-financial 
asset or liability. For hedges that do not result in the recognition of an 
asset or a liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the 
income statement in the period which the hedged item affects net 
profit or loss. 
For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or 
losses arising from changes in fair value are taken directly to the income 
statement as they arise. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the derivative expires or is 
sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or 
otherwise no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. At that point in 
time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised 
in other comprehensive income is kept in equity until the forecast 
transaction occurs, at which point it is taken to the income statement 
or included in the initial carrying amount of the related non-financial 
asset as described above. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected 
to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in other 
comprehensive income is transferred to the income statement. 
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings 
Debt is initially stated at the amount of the net proceeds, being the fair 
value of the consideration received after deduction of issue costs. 
Following initial recognition the carrying amount is measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method. Amortisation of 
liabilities and any gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement 
or other de-recognition of debt, are recognised directly in the income 
statement. 
Assets held under finance leases, which are leases where substantially 
all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset have passed to 
the Group, and hire purchase contracts are capitalised in the balance 
sheet, with a corresponding liability being recognised, and are 
depreciated over the shorter of their useful lives and the lease terms. 
The capital elements of future obligations under leases and hire 
purchase contracts are included as liabilities in the balance sheet. 
The interest element of the rental obligations is charged to the income 
statement over the periods of the leases and hire purchase contracts 
and represents a constant proportion of the balance of capital 
repayments outstanding. 
Leases where a significant proportion of the risks and rewards of 
ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. 
Rentals payable under operating leases, and the amortisation of lease 
incentives and initial direct costs in securing leases, are charged to the 
income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or 
constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an 
outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and a 
reliable estimate of the amount can be made. 
Treasury shares 
Re-acquired shares in the Group, which remain uncancelled, are 
deducted from equity. Consideration paid and the associated costs are 
also recognised in shareholders’ funds as a separate reserve for own 
shares. Any gain or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of 
the Group’s shares is transferred from the reserve for own shares to 
revenue reserves. 
Retirement benefits 
The Group operates a number of pension schemes; both defined 
benefit and defined contribution. The costs of these are recognised in 
the income statement within operating costs. As discussed below, the 
Group has invoked the provisions of IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial 
Statements’ and has departed from the requirements of IAS 19 in 
respect of the Rail Pension Schemes (RPS). 
Non-rail schemes 
The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit plans is 
determined separately for each plan using the projected unit credit 
method, which attributes entitlement to benefits to the current period 
(to determine current service cost) and to the current and prior 
periods (to determine the present value of defined benefit obligation) 
and is based on actuarial advice. The interest element of the defined 
benefit cost represents the change in present value of obligations 
during the period, and is determined by applying the discount rate to 
the opening present value of the benefit obligation, taking into account 
material changes in the obligation during the year. The expected return 
on plan assets is based on an assessment made at the beginning of the 
year of long term market returns on scheme assets, adjusted for the 
effect on the fair value of plan assets of contributions received and 
benefits paid during the year.  
The Group has applied the option under IAS 19 to recognise actuarial 
gains and losses in the statement of comprehensive income in the 
period in which they occur.  
The difference between the expected return on plan assets and the 
interest cost, along with the current service cost, is recognised in the 
income statement within operating costs. 
The defined benefit pension asset or liability in the balance sheet 
comprises the total for each plan of the present value of the defined 
benefit obligation (using a discount rate based on high quality corporate 
bonds), less any past service cost not yet recognised and less the fair 
value of plan assets out of which the obligations are to be settled 
directly. Fair value is based on market price information and in the case 
of quoted securities is the published bid price.  Financial Statements  
 
 The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 87 
Past service costs are recognised in the income statement on a straight-
line basis over the vesting period or immediately if the benefits have 
vested. When a settlement (eliminating all obligations for benefits 
already accrued) or a curtailment (reducing future obligations as a result 
of a material reduction in the scheme membership or a reduction in 
future entitlement) occurs, the obligation and related plan assets are 
remeasured using current actuarial assumptions and the resultant gain 
or loss recognised in the income statement during the period in which 
the settlement or curtailment occurs. 
Contributions payable under defined contribution schemes are charged 
to operating costs in the income statement as they fall due. 
Rail schemes 
Our train operating companies participate in the RPS, a defined benefit 
scheme which covers the whole of the UK Rail Industry. This is 
partitioned into sections and the Group is responsible for the funding 
of these schemes whilst it operates the relevant franchise. In contrast to 
the pension schemes operated by most businesses, the RPS is a shared 
cost scheme, which means that costs are formally shared 60% 
employer and 40% employee. A liability or asset is recognised in line 
with other defined benefit schemes in the Group, although this is offset 
by a franchise adjustment so that the net liability or asset represents the 
deficit or surplus that the Group expects to fund or benefit from during 
the franchise term. This represents a departure from IAS 19 so as to 
present fairly the Group’s financial performance, position and cashflow 
in respect of its obligations for the RPS. 
Share-based payment transactions 
The cost of options granted to employees is measured by reference to 
the fair value at the date at which they are granted, determined by an 
external valuation using an appropriate pricing model. In granting 
equity-settled options conditions are linked to some or all of the 
following: the price of the shares of The Go-Ahead Group plc (‘market 
conditions’); to conditions not related to performance or service (‘non-
vesting conditions’); and to earnings per share criteria. 
The cost of options is recognised in the income statement over the 
period from grant to vesting date, being the date on which the relevant 
employees become fully entitled to the award, with a corresponding 
increase in equity. The cumulative expense recognised at each 
reporting date reflects the extent to which the period to vesting has 
expired and the Directors’ best estimate of the number of options that 
will ultimately vest or, in the case of an instrument subject to a market 
or non-vesting condition, be treated as vesting as described above. This 
includes any award where non-vesting conditions within the control of 
the Group or the employee are not met. 
No cost is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest except for 
awards where vesting is conditional upon a market or non-vesting 
condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not 
the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all other 
performance conditions are satisfied. Where an equity-settled award is 
cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and 
any cost not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately.  
Taxation 
Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected 
to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities on an 
undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when 
the related asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates 
and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is provided, using the liability method, on temporary 
differences at the balance sheet date between the tax base of assets 
and liabilities for taxation purposes and their carrying amounts in the 
financial statements. It is provided for on all temporary differences, 
except: 
• on the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a 
transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the 
transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or 
loss; and 
• in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with 
investments in subsidiaries where the timing of the reversal of the 
temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the 
temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is 
probable that the temporary differences will be reversed in the 
foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available to allow all or 
part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised. The carrying 
amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date 
and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient 
taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred 
income tax asset to be utilised.  
Tax relating to items recognised outside the income statement is 
recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity in 
correlation with the underlying transaction. Otherwise, tax is 
recognised in the income statement.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

3. Segmental analysis 
IFRS8 Operating Segments has been applied for the first time by the Group in these financial statements. For management purposes, the Group is 
organised into three core divisions, Bus, Rail and aviation services, which form the basis of the Group’s reportable operating segments (as they did 
previously under IAS14). Operating segments within those divisions are combined on the basis of their similar long term economic characteristics 
and similar nature of their products and services, as follows; 
The Bus division comprises regulated bus operations in London and deregulated operations in the north east, Oxford, the south east, southern 
England and Norfolk. 
The Group also has a 50% investment in a US school bus operation valued at £0.7m which has not traded in the year. 
The Rail operation, Govia, is 65% owned by Go-Ahead and 35% by Keolis and comprises three rail franchises: Southern, Southeastern and London 
Midland. 
As disclosed in note 8, the majority of the Group’s ground handling and cargo operations were sold on 30 January 2010 and are therefore classified 
as discontinued operations. Amounts included in continuing operations for the aviation services segment comprise mainly Meteor and some residual 
ground handling operations. 
Management monitors the operating results of its divisions separately for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and 
performance assessment. The operating segments disclosed in the financial statements are the same as reported to the Chief Operating Decision 
Maker. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit or loss excluding amortisation of goodwill and intangible assets and exceptional 
items.  Financial Statements

Sharesave Scheme 
The Group operates an HM Revenue & Customs (‘HMRC’) approved savings-related share option scheme, known as The Go-Ahead Group plc 
Savings-Related Share Option Scheme 2003 (the ‘Sharesave Scheme’). The Sharesave Scheme is open to all Group employees (including Executive 
Directors) who have completed at least six months’ service with a Group company at the date they are invited to participate in the scheme. 
Qualifying employees are invited to save between £5 and £75 per month (up to a maximum of £250 per month across all schemes) for a period of 
three years. At the end of that period, employees can apply the amounts saved, together with a bonus, in acquiring shares in the Company at a 
minimum price equal to 80% of their market price at the time of invitation. 
There are savings-related options at 3 July 2010 as follows: 
Scheme maturity 1 June 2010  1 July 2009 1 June 2008
Option price (£) 19.14 14.62 12.10
No. of options unexercised at 3 July 2010 55,183 464,432 –
No. of options exercised during the year 148 13,551 –
No. of options exercisable at 3 July 2010 328,133 – –
The expense recognised for these schemes during the year to 3 July 2010 was £0.5m (2009: £0.7m).

6. Staff costs continued 
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for the options exercised in the period was £13.18 (2009: £17.61). 
The options outstanding at the end of the year have a weighted average remaining contracted life of 0.0 years (2009: 0.4 years). These options are 
exercisable at £19.14 (2009: between £14.62 and £19.14). 
The fair value of equity-settled share options granted is estimated as at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes model, taking into account the terms 
and conditions upon which the options were granted. The key assumptions input into the model are future share price volatility, future dividend 
yield, future risk free interest rate, forfeiture rate and option life.  
Share incentive plans 
The Company operates an HMRC approved share incentive plan, known as The Go-Ahead Group plc Share Incentive Plan (the SIP). The SIP is 
open to all Group employees (including Executive Directors) who have completed at least six months’ service with a Group company at the date 
they are invited to participate in the plan. 
The SIP permits the Company to make four different types of awards to employees (free shares, partnership shares, matching shares and dividend 
shares), although the Company has, so far, made awards of partnership shares only. Under these awards, the Company invites qualifying employees 
to apply between £10 and £125 per month in acquiring shares in the Company at the prevailing market price. Under the terms of the scheme, 
certain tax advantages are available to the Company and employees. 
Long term incentive plans  
The Executive Directors participate in The Go-Ahead Group Long Term Incentive Plan 2005 (the LTIP). The LTIP provides for Executive Directors 
and certain other senior employees to be awarded shares in the Company conditional on specified performance conditions being met over a period 
of three years. Refer to the Directors’ Remuneration Report for further details of the LTIP. 
The expense recognised for the LTIP during the year to 3 July 2010 was £0.2m (2009: £nil). 
The fair value of LTIP options granted is estimated as at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo model, taking into account the terms and conditions 
upon which the options were granted. The inputs to the model used for the options granted in the year to 3 July 2010 were:

Year ended 3 July 2010 
Total exceptional items in the year were £46.8m (2009: £57.7m) consisting of sales proceeds of £14.8m (2009: £nil), non-cash items of £50.6m 
(2009: £47.6m), and other cash items of £11.0m (2009: £10.1m). 
Exceptional items on continuing operations for the year were £27.4m (2009: £14.5m). An impairment review of the Meteor Parking business was 
undertaken, resulting in a goodwill impairment charge of £16.2m. Restructuring costs in Meteor totalled £0.2m following changes to the senior 
management team to effect a fundamental reorganisation of the business. Bus and rail related exceptional costs totalled £11.0m, consisting of £6.7m 
of rail restructuring costs, and £2.6m of accelerated depreciation in respect of the articulated London buses which are being phased out by March 
2011. It is expected a further exceptional depreciation charge of around £1.8m will be incurred into 2011. 
The discontinued exceptional items of £19.4m consist of a net loss on sale of £13.1m, pre-sale reorganisation costs which related to operations 
subsequently sold of £2.4m and onerous contract provisions of £6.1m. The loss on sale represents sales proceeds of £14.8m, less net book value of 
assets sold of £17.8m and provisions of £10.1m. 
Year ended 27 June 2009 
Of the exceptional items totalling £57.7m some £43.2m has been reclassified as relating to discontinued operations.

provision in that business of £1.5m. Bus and rail related exceptional costs totalled £5.5m, consisting of £4.7m of rail restructuring costs, and £0.8m of 
accelerated depreciation in respect of the articulated London buses which are being phased out by March 2011. Non-cash exceptional items also

On 22 June 2010 the Emergency Budget announced by the UK Coalition Government contained details of proposed changes to corporation tax 
rates and the rates of capital allowances to be fully implemented by 2014. The rate of corporation tax is to be cut from 28% to 27% from 1 April 
2011 and then by a further 1% each year until 1 April 2014 when it reaches 24%. The principal rate of capital allowances will be reduced from 20% 
to 18% from 1 April 2012 with reductions in special and short life pool rates from 10% to 8%. None of these changes had been enacted or 
substantially enacted at 3 July 2010 and no adjustment has been recognised in these financial statements. If all changes had been enacted then for 
each 1% change our deferred tax asset would reduce by £1.0m and our deferred tax liability would reduce by £2.3m.  Financial Statements

Rail franchise asset 
This reflects the cost of the right to operate a rail franchise. The brought forward element of the franchise intangible is made up of £21.1m relating 
to the opening deficit in the RPS and £9.9m relating to the cost of the intangible asset acquired on the handover of the franchise assets relating to 
the Southeastern rail franchise. The intangible asset is being amortised on a straight-line basis over the life of the franchises (being between five and 
eight years).  
Software costs 
Software costs capitalised exclude software that is integral to the related hardware.  
Customer contracts 
This relates to the value attributed to customer contracts and relationships purchased as part of the Group’s acquisitions. The value is calculated 
based on the unexpired term of the contracts at the date of acquisition and is amortised over that period. 
Impairment 
During the year ended 3 July 2010 an impairment review of the aviation services division resulted in the goodwill of Meteor Parking of £18.4m being 
written down to £2.2m.   FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

14. Intangible assets continued 
Goodwill 
As from 3 July 2004, goodwill is no longer amortised and is tested annually for impairment. 
The goodwill charge of £1.1m (2009: £2.4m) is in respect of rail businesses which, due to the finite nature of the franchises, require the goodwill to 
be impaired annually. 
Goodwill acquired through acquisitions has been allocated to individual cash-generating units for impairment testing on the basis of the Group’s 
business operations. The carrying value of goodwill by cash-generating unit is as follows: 
 2010
£m
2009
£m
Meteor Parking 2.2 18.4
New Southern Railway – 1.0
Metrobus 10.6 6.5
Go South Coast 28.6 28.6
Brighton & Hove 2.1 2.1
Plymouth Citybus 13.0 –
Go-Ahead London 10.5 10.5
Go North East 2.7 0.8
Konectbus 3.6 –
 73.3 67.9
The recoverable amount of goodwill has been determined based on a value in use calculation for each cash-generating unit, using cashflow 
projections based on financial budgets and forecasts approved by senior management covering a three-year period. Growth has been extrapolated 
forward from the end of the forecasts, using a growth rate of 3.0% which reflects the Directors’ view of long term growth rates in each business. 
The pre-tax cashflows for all cash-generating units have been discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 11.1% (2009: 11.0%), based on the 
Group’s weighted average cost of capital, plus an appropriate risk premium for each cash-generating unit of 0.0-2.0% (2009: 0.0-2.0%). 
The calculation of value in use for each cash-generating unit is most sensitive to the forecast operating cashflows, the discount rate and the growth 
rate used to extrapolate cashflows beyond the budget period. The operating cashflows are based on assumptions of revenue, staff costs and general 
overheads. These assumptions are influenced by several internal and external factors. 
The Directors consider the assumptions used to be consistent with the historical performance of each unit and to be realistically achievable in light 
of economic and industry measures and forecasts. We have conducted sensitivity analysis on our calculations and confirmed that there are no likely 
movement on assumptions that would lead to an impairment. The cash generating unit with the least headroom is Plymouth City Bus, as expected 
given it has only recently been acquired. An increase of 1% of the Group’s  weighted cost of capital would result in an impairment of £0.9m and a 
further 1% increase would lead to a further impairment charge of £2.0m. 
15. Business combinations 
Year ended 3 July 2010 
On 3 October 2009, London General Transport Services Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group, acquired the assets of East Thames 
Buses from Transport for London (‘TfL’) for a total cash consideration of £5.0m. East Thames Buses operated a fleet of approximately 120 vehicles 
over nine TfL contracted routes. 
On 3 October 2009, Metrobus Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group, acquired the assets of Arriva’s bus interest in Horsham for a total 
cash consideration of £5.0m. The interests include a fleet of 18 vehicles and 58 employees, and will operate as part of Metrobus Limited which 
provides bus services in Sussex, Surrey and Kent including regulated services for TfL. 
On 1 December 2009, Go-Ahead Holding Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group, acquired 100% of the share capital of Plymouth 
Citybus Limited from Plymouth City Council for a cash consideration of £19.0m. Plymouth Citybus operates a fleet of 175 vehicles and employs 
approximately 470 employees in the Plymouth area.  
On 9 March 2010, Go Ahead Holding Limited also acquired 100% of the share capital of Konectbus Limited which operates a bus fleet of 44 
vehicles and employs approximately 70 employees in the Norfolk area. On 28 March 2010, Go North East Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of 
the group, entered into a contract to acquire the Hexham operations of Arriva plc for a cash consideration and agreed to sell Go North East’s 
Ashington operations to Arriva. The operations became effective April 2010. The combined consideration for these acquisitions was £8.2m.   Financial Statements

Intangible assets acquired represent customer contracts of £0.7m 
Payment of deferred consideration is dependent upon achievement of target operating profit levels. 
The goodwill capitalised reflects the access to the markets served by the acquired entities and the potential business synergies that can be achieved 
upon acquisition. Management believes that goodwill represents future growth opportunities and created value to the growth in respect of 
customer awareness and an assembled workforce for which the recognition of a discreet intangible asset is not permitted.  
From the date of acquisition, in the year ended 3 July 2010, the acquisitions recorded an operating profit of £3.6m to the Group and revenue of 
£31.5m. Had the combinations taken place at the beginning of the year, it is estimated that they would have recorded £4.9m of operating profit and 
£48.7m of revenue to the Group. This would have resulted in total Group revenue of £2,218.8m, and total operating profit (before amortisation 
and exceptional items) of £103.3m 
Year ended 27 June 2009 
There have been no business combinations during the year ended 27 June 2009. 
16. Assets classified as held for sale

Syndicated loan facility 
On 23 November 2007 the Group entered into a £340.0m five-year syndicated loan facility. The debt is unsecured and interest is charged at LIBOR 
+ Margin, where the margin is dependent upon the gearing of the Group and the intended use of the borrowings. On 15 April 2010 the syndicated 
loan facility was reduced by the Group to £280.0m. 
As at 3 July 2010, £103.0m (2009: £239.0m) of the facility was drawn down.  
£200m Sterling 7.5 Year Bond 
On 24 March 2010, the Group raised a £200m bond of 7.5 years maturing on 29 September 2017 with a coupon rate of 5.375%.  
Medium term loans

On 26 August 2009 two additional floating rate loans were arranged. The first being a £15.0m loan subject to interest at LIBOR + 3.0% with a single 
repayment on 25 August 2012. The second was also for £15.0m and was subject to interest at LIBOR + 2.25%. Repayments of £1.5m, £3.5m and 
£10.0m were scheduled to be made in year one, year two and year three respectively. Both loans were repaid early on 12 April 2010 and 9 April 
2010 respectively. 
A further additional floating rate loan of £20.0m was entered into on 27 November 2009 with an interest rate of LIBOR + 2.5%. This loan was 
repaid early on 9 April 2010. 
Debt issue costs 
There are debt issue costs of £0.7m (2009: £1.1m) on the syndicated loan facility and £nil (2009: £0.1m) on the medium term loans.

23. Financial risk management objectives and policies 
Financial risk factors and management 
The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise bank loans, hire purchase and finance lease contracts, and cash and short term deposits. The 
main purpose of these financial instruments is to provide an appropriate level of net debt to fund the Group’s activities, namely working capital, fixed 
asset expenditure, acquisitions, dividends and share buybacks. The Group has various other financial instruments such as trade receivables and trade 
payables, which arise directly from its operations. 
The Group also enters into derivative transactions, primarily interest rate swaps and fuel swaps. The purpose is to manage the interest rate and fuel 
price risks arising from the Group’s operations and its sources of finance. 
It is, and has been throughout 2010 and 2009, the Group’s policy that no trading in derivatives shall be undertaken and derivatives are only 
purchased for internal benefit. 
The main financial risks arising from the Group’s activities are interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. Risks arising from fuel derivatives are 
explained in note 24. 
Interest rate risk 
The Group borrows and deposits funds and is exposed to changes in interest rates. The Board’s policy toward cash deposits is to deposit cash short 
term on UK money markets. Interest payable on senior bank borrowings is based on re-fixing the rate of interest over short periods of time of up to 
36 months. During the year the Group has partially managed interest rate risk by hedging. Excluding fixed rate debt, the Group has net borrowings 
and hence the present adverse risk is an increase in interest rates.  Financial Statements

Interest on financial instruments classified as floating rate is re-priced at intervals of less than one year. Interest on financial instruments classified as 
fixed rate is fixed until the maturity of the instrument. The other financial instruments of the Group that are not included in the above tables are 
non-interest-bearing and are therefore not subject to interest rate risk. 
At 3 July 2010, the Group had four interest rate swaps totalling £130.0m. Two of these interest rate swaps fix the interest on part of the variable 
rate syndicated loan – £50.0m was fixed at 2.01% plus margin until December 2011 and £50.0m was fixed at 2.39% plus margin until December 
2012. The remaining two interest rate swaps of £15.0m each are now ineffective. During the year ended 3 July 2010, these four interest swaps have 
resulted in a realised loss of £3.0m. 
These swaps result in a net fixed rate liability of £3.4m at 3 July 2010. Hence the adverse risk at year end is a decrease in interest rates.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Liquidity risk 
The Group has in place a £280.0m syndicated loan facility which allows the Group to maintain liquidity within the desired gearing range. Available

On 24 March 2010, the Group raised a £200m bond of 7.5 years maturing on 29 September 2017. The level of drawdown and prevailing interest 
rates are detailed in note 21.  
The Group’s road passenger vehicles can be financed by hire purchase or finance lease arrangements, or term loans at fixed rates of interest over 
two to five year primary borrowing periods. This provides a regular inflow of funding to cover expenditure as it arises. 
Foreign currency risk 
The Group rarely enters into transactions in foreign currency and no transaction to date has been material. Should larger foreign currency 
transactions be undertaken, consideration would be given to hedging the foreign currency exchange risk. 
On 26 July 2010, a $10.0m facility was agreed with RBS to ensure dollar investment in our US joint venture is funded by dollar borrowings to 
provide an effective foreign currency hedge. 
Credit risk 
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables and cash deposits (see note 18). The maximum credit risk exposure of the 
Group comprises the amounts presented in the balance sheet, which are stated net of provisions for doubtful debt. A provision is made where 
there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of future cashflows. 
The majority of the Group’s receivables are with public (or quasi-public) bodies (such as the DfT). The Group does not consider these 
counterparties to be a significant credit risk. Outside of this, the Group does not consider it has significant concentrations of credit risk. Risk of 
exposure to non-return of cash on deposit is managed through a treasury policy of holding deposits with banks rated A+ or Aa3 or above with at 
least one of the agencies. Our treasury policy outlines the maximum level of deposit that can be placed with any one given financial institution.  Financial Statements

Managing capital 
During the year the Group obtained investment grade long term credit ratings from Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s as follows: 
Standard & Poor’s  BBB - (Stable outlook) 
Moody’s  Baa3 (Stable outlook) 
The Group manages its capital structure such that net debt (adjusted to exclude restricted cash), to EBITDA (before exceptionals) is within  
a range which retains an investment grade debt rating. Adjusted net debt at the year end was £292.3m (2009: £272.3m), equivalent to 1.91x (2009: 
1.56x) EBITDA in line with the Group’s aim to maintain to an adjusted net debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.5x to 2.5x through the cycle. 
Operating leases 
The Group uses operating leases for bus and coach purchases across the Group primarily where the vehicles service specific contracts to mitigate 
the risk of ownership at the end of the contract. This results in £1.2m (2009: £0.4m) of cost within operating charges which would otherwise have 
been charged to interest. The Group holds operating leases for its bus fleet with an asset capital value of £31.2m (2009: £13.1m). 
The majority of assets in the rail division are financed by operating leases, in particular rolling stock. Leases are entered into by the respective 
operating companies and are not the subject of parent company guarantees.

The fair value of all other assets and liabilities in notes 18, 20 and 21 is not significantly different to their carrying amount. The fuel price derivatives 
and interest rate swaps were valued externally by the respective banks by comparison with the market fuel price at the relevant date. 
The fair value of fixed rate borrowings has been calculated by discounting the expected future cashflows at prevailing rates. 
The group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique: 
Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: 
Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly; 
and 
Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data. 
As at 3 July 2010, the Group has used a level 2 valuation technique to determine the fair value of all financial instruments. During the year ended 3 
July 2010, there were no transfers between valuation levels. 
b. Hedging activities 
Fuel derivatives 
The Group is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of fuel usage. The Group closely monitors fuel prices and uses fuel derivatives to hedge its 
exposure to increases in fuel prices, when it deems appropriate.  
At the year end, the Group had various fuel price swaps in place. For the 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 financial years cashflow hedges were placed over 
126, 122, 27 and 1 million litres of fuel respectively. The fair value of the asset or liability has been recognised on the balance sheet. The value has been 
generated since the date of the acquisition of the instruments due to the movement in market fuel prices. 
As at 3 July 2010 the Group had derivatives against bus fuel of 109 million litres for the year ending 2 July 2011, representing approximately 97.0% 
of the anticipated fuel usage in our bus division. As at 3 July 2010 the Group also had derivatives against bus fuel for the 2012, 2013 and 2014 
financial years of 105, 13 (increased to 28 million litres after 3 July 2010) and 1 million litres respectively.  
As at 3 July 2010 the Group had derivatives against rail fuel of 17 million litres for the year ending 2 July 2011, representing the anticipated fuel usage 
in London Midland and Southern. As at 3 July 2010 the Group also had further derivatives for the 2012 and 2013 financial years of 17 and 14 
millions litres of rail fuel respectively. 
The Group’s hedging policy for the target percentage of anticipated bus fuel usage hedged for the next year and subsequent two years, and its 
current compliance with that policy is as follows: 
2011 2012 2013
Percentage to hedge per Group policy 100.0% 50.0% 25.0%

During the year ended 3 July 2010, the onerous contract provision in the aviation services division reduced from £1.5m to £0.6m as the expected losses 
were incurred, and a further onerous contract provision of £1.0m was created in the bus division to cover the costs of operating lease commitments on 
routes served by articulated buses which are being phased out. 
Franchise commitments comprise contractual obligations arising in connection with franchise delivery where the amounts payable are subject to  
ongoing disputes. 
The depot provisions represent ongoing legal actions relating to planning consent issues and are expected to be incurred within five years. Onerous 
contracts provisions are expected to be incurred within three years. Franchise commitment provisions are expected to be incurred within one year.

circumstances. During the year ended 3 July 2010 the Company has repurchased 26,447 shares (2009: 13,615 shares). A consideration of £0.3m (2009: 
£0.2m) including expenses was made for the shares purchased during the year. The Company has not cancelled any shares during the year (2009: no shares). 
Other reserve 
The other reserve represents the premium on shares that have been issued to fund or part fund acquisitions made by the Group. This treatment is 
in line with Section 612 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Hedging reserve 
The hedging reserve records the movement in value of fuel price derivatives, offset by any movements recognised directly in equity. 
Capital redemption reserve 
The redemption reserve reflects the nominal value of cancelled shares.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Go-Ahead Group Pension Plan 
For the majority of non-rail employees, the Group operates one main pension scheme, The Go-Ahead Group Pension Plan (the ‘Go-Ahead Plan’), 
which consists of a funded defined benefit scheme and a defined contribution section as follows: 
The defined contribution section of The Go-Ahead Plan is not contracted-out of the State Second Pension Scheme and is open to new entrants. 
The expense recognised for the defined contribution section of The Go-Ahead Plan is £5.4m (2009: £4.9m) being the contributions paid and 
payable. 
The defined benefit section of The Go-Ahead Plan is contracted-out of the State Second Pension Scheme and provides benefits based on a 
member’s final salary. The assets of the scheme are held in a separate trustee-administered fund. Contributions to this section are assessed in 
accordance with the advice of an independent qualified actuary. The section is effectively closed to new entrants. As a result, it can be expected that 
the service cost will increase in future as a percentage of payroll. However, this percentage is likely to be applied to a reducing total pensionable 
payroll. 
The Go-Ahead Plan is a Group plan for related companies where risks are shared. The overall costs of the Go-Ahead Plan have been recognised in 
the Group’s financial statements according to IAS 19. Each of the participating companies accounts on the basis of contributions paid by that 
company. The Group accounts for the difference between the aggregate IAS 19 cost of the scheme and the aggregate contributions paid. 
Wilts & Dorset Pension Scheme and Southern Vectis Group Pension Plan 
Some employees of our Go South Coast operations participate in the Wilts & Dorset Pension Scheme or the Southern Vectis Group Pension Plan. 
These are defined benefit schemes which are externally funded and contracted-out of the State Second Pension Scheme. Contributions to the 
schemes are assessed in accordance with the advice of an independent qualified actuary. The schemes are closed to new entrants, however eligible 
employees can join the defined contribution section of the The Go-Ahead Group Pension Plan.  
Other pension plans 
During the year, a defined benefit plan was introduced for a small number of employees transferring from East Thames Buses, similarly some 
transferring employees of Plymouth City Bus have entitlement to a Devon County Council defined benefit plan. Both schemes are externally funded. 
Contributions to the scheme are assessed in accordance with the advice of an independent qualified actuary. Both schemes are now closed to new 
entrants. 
Other pension arrangements 
A small number of employees in aviance have access to separate defined contribution pension arrangements as part of legacy agreements. The 
expense recognised for this is £0.1m (2009: £0.3m), being the contributions paid.

Rail schemes 
The Railways Pension Scheme (the RPS) 
The majority of employees in our train operating companies are members of sections of the RPS, a funded defined benefit scheme.  
The RPS is a shared costs scheme, with assets and liabilities split 60%/40% between the franchise holder/employee respectively. The  
RPS sections are all open to new entrants and the assets and liabilities of each company’s section are separately identifiable and  
segregated for funding purposes. 
In addition to the defined benefit cost, BRASS matching AVC company contributions of £1.2m (2009: £0.9m) were paid in the year. 
It is our experience that all pension obligations to the RPS cease on expiry of the franchises without cash or other settlement, and therefore the 
obligations recognised on the balance sheet under IAS 19 are only those that are expected to be funded during the franchise term. However, in 
spite of our past experience and that of other train operating companies proving otherwise, our legal obligations are not restricted. On entering into 
a franchise, the operator becomes the designated employer for the term of the contract and under the RPS rules is obliged to meet the schedule of 
contributions agreed with the scheme trustees and actuaries, in respect of which no funding cap is set out in the franchise contract.

IAS 19 would require the Group to account for its legal obligation under the formal terms of the RPS and its constructive obligation under the terms 
of each franchise agreement. Following industry practice, the Group has concluded that the appropriate accounting policy for the RPS to ensure that 
the financial statements present fairly the Group’s financial position, financial performance and cashflows, is to recognise its constructive but not its 
legal RPS defined benefit obligations. In all other respects the Group’s accounting policy is consistent with IAS 19 and the treatment adopted for 
non-rail defined benefit schemes. In doing so, the Group has applied the provisions of paragraph 17 of IAS 1 and departed from the requirements of 
IAS 19 in order to achieve a fair presentation of the Group’s obligations regarding its rail schemes and prevent gains arising on transfer of the 
existing RPS deficits to a new franchise owner at exit. 
The total surplus or deficit recorded is adjusted by way of a ‘franchise adjustment’, which is that portion of the deficit or surplus projected to exist at 
the end of the franchise which the Group will not be required to fund or benefit from.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF THE GO-AHEAD GROUP PLC 
124 www.go-ahead.com 
We have audited the parent company financial statements of  
The Go-Ahead Group plc for the year ended 3 July 2010, which 
comprise the parent company balance sheet and related notes 1 to 14. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their 
preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).  
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for 
our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditors 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, set 
out on page 126, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of 
the parent company financial statements and for being satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit the parent 
company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards 
require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical 
Standards for Auditors. 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the 
parent company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting 
estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the 
financial statements.  
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion the parent company financial statements: 
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs  
as at 3 July 2010; 
• have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and 
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements  
of the Companies Act 2006. 
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies 
Act 2006 
In our opinion: 
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has 
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; 
and 
• the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year 
for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the 
parent company financial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception  
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where 
the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion: 
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent 
company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or 
• the parent company financial statements and the part of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns; or 
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by  
law are not made; or 
• we have not received all the information and explanations  
we require for our audit. 
Other matter 
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements of The 
Go-Ahead Group plc for the year ended 3 July 2010.

DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES IN RELATION TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
126 www.go-ahead.com 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.  
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for 
each financial year. Under that law the Directors have elected to 
prepare the financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards and applicable law). Under company law the Directors must 
not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they 
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of 
the profit or loss of the Company for that period. In preparing these 
financial statements, the Directors are required to:  
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;  
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;  
• state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained 
in the financial statements; and  
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business.  
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of 
the Company and to enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for 
taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.  
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation 
and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions.  Financial Statements

NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
 The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 127 
1. Parent company accounting policies 
Basis of preparation 
The separate financial statements of the Company are presented as 
required by the Companies Act 2006 and were approved for issue on 
1 September 2010. They have been prepared in accordance with 
applicable United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice. 
No profit and loss account is presented by the Company as permitted 
by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 and the Company has 
taken the exemptions under FRS 1 to not present a cashflow 
statement.  
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption available to parent 
companies under FRS 29 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ so as not to 
provide the information otherwise required by the standard, as the 
Group’s consolidated financial statements, in which the Company is 
included, provide equivalent disclosures for the Group under IFRS 7 
‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’. 
Tangible fixed assets 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost or deemed cost less 
accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value. Freehold land is 
not depreciated. 
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of 
their expected useful lives and the lease terms. 
Depreciation is charged to the profit and loss account based on cost or 
valuation, less estimated residual value of each asset evenly over its 
expected useful life as follows: 
Short leasehold land and buildings The life of the lease 
Freehold buildings and  
long leasehold land and buildings 
 
Over 10 to 100 years 
Plant and equipment Over 3 to 15 years 
The carrying values of items of property, plant and equipment  
are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances 
indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. If any such 
indication exists the assets are written down to their recoverable 
amount. 
Investments 
Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries and associates are shown at cost 
less provision for impairment. 
Pension benefits 
The Company is a member of The Go-Ahead Group Pension Plan 
operated by The Go-Ahead Group plc for the majority of its 
employees. This defined benefit scheme is a multi-employer scheme for 
which the individual employer’s share of the underlying assets and 
liabilities cannot be identified and accordingly the Company accounts 
for them as defined contribution schemes. 
For the defined contribution schemes, the amount charged to the profit 
and loss account in respect of pension costs and other post-retirement 
benefits is the contributions payable in the year. Differences between 
contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid are 
shown as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet. 
Share based payments 
The Company has taken advantage of the transitional provision of FRS 
20 and has applied FRS20 only to those options granted after 7 
November 2002. The cost of options granted to employees is 
measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are 
granted, determined by an external valuation using an appropriate 
pricing model. In valuing equity-settled options, no account is taken of 
any performance conditions, other than conditions linked to the price 
of the shares of The Go-Ahead Group plc (‘market conditions’), to 
conditions not related to performance or service (‘non-vesting 
conditions’) and to earnings per share criteria. 
The cost of options is recognised in the profit and loss account over 
the period from grant to vesting date, being the date on which the 
relevant employees become fully entitled to the award, with a 
corresponding increase in equity. The cumulative expense recognised, 
at each reporting date, reflects the extent to which the period to 
vesting has expired and the Directors’ best estimate of the number of 
options that will ultimately vest or, in the case of an instrument subject 
to a market or non-vesting condition, be treated as vesting as described 
above. This includes any award where non-vesting conditions within the 
control of the Group or the employee are not met. 
No cost is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest except for 
awards where vesting is conditional upon a market or non-vesting 
condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not 
the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all other 
performance conditions are satisfied. Where an equity-settled award is 
cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and 
any cost not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately.   FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Parent company accounting policies continued 
Deferred tax 
The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes 
into account taxation deferred because of timing differences between 
the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes. 
Deferred taxation is provided on all timing differences which have 
originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date. Except where 
otherwise required by accounting standards, no timing differences are 
recognised in respect of: 
• property revaluation surpluses where there is no commitment to sell 
the asset; 
• gains on sale of assets where those gains have been rolled over into 
replacement assets; 
• deferred tax assets except to the extent that it is more likely than not 
that they will be recovered. 
Deferred tax is calculated at the enacted rates at which it is estimated 
the tax will be payable. The deferred tax provision is not discounted to 
net present value. 
Uninsured liabilities 
The Company limits its exposure to the cost of motor, employer and 
public liability claims through insurance policies issued by third parties. 
These provide individual claim cover, subject to high excess limits and 
an annual aggregate stop loss for total claims within the excess limits. 
An accrual is made within current liabilities for the estimated cost to 
the Company to settle claims for incidents occurring prior to the 
balance sheet date, subject to the overall stop loss. On the basis that 
the Company does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement 
for at least twelve months after the balance sheet date, these uninsured 
liabilities are classified as current. 
The estimation of the balance sheet uninsured claims accrual is made 
after taking appropriate professional advice and is based on an 
assessment of the expected settlement on known claims, together with 
an estimate of settlements that will be made in respect of incidents 
occurring prior to the balance sheet date but that have not yet been 
reported to the Company. 
Treasury shares 
Re-acquired shares in the Company, which remain uncancelled, are 
deducted from equity. Consideration paid and the associated costs are 
also recognised in shareholders’ funds as a separate reserve for own 
shares. Any gain or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of 
the Company’s shares is transferred from the reserve for own shares to 
profit and loss. 
Financial assets 
Financial assets are accounted for in accordance with FRS 26. Financial 
assets are initially recognised at fair value, being the transaction price 
plus directly attributable transaction costs. 
The Company uses energy derivatives to hedge its risks associated with 
fuel price fluctuations. Such derivatives are initially recognised at fair 
value by reference to market values for similar instruments, and 
subsequently remeasured at fair value at each balance sheet date. 
Changes in the fair value of financial instruments that are designated 
and effective as hedges of future cashflows are recognised in other 
comprehensive income and the ineffective portion is recognised 
immediately in the profit and loss account. When the cashflow hedge 
results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a liability, then at 
the time that asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or 
losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in other 
comprehensive income are included in the initial measurement of that 
non-financial asset or liability. For hedges that do not result in the 
recognition of an asset or a liability, amounts deferred in equity are 
recognised in the profit and loss account in the period which the 
hedged item affects net profit or loss. 
For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or 
losses arising from changes in fair value are taken directly to the profit 
and loss account as they arise. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the derivative expires or is 
sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or 
otherwise no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. At that point in 
time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised 
in other comprehensive income is kept in equity until the forecast 
transaction occurs, at which point it is taken to the profit and loss 
account or included in the initial carrying amount of the related non-
financial asset as described above. If a hedged transaction is no longer 
expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in other 
comprehensive income is transferred to the profit and loss account. 
Leasing commitments 
Leases where a significant portion of all the risks and rewards of 
ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. 
Rentals payable under operating leases, and the amortisation of lease 
incentives and initial direct costs in securing leases, are charged to the 
profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
Debt 
Debt is initially stated at the amount of the net proceeds, being the fair 
value of the consideration received after deduction of issue costs. 
Following initial recognition the carrying amount is measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method. Amortisation of 
liabilities and any gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement 
or other derecognition of debt are recognised directly in the profit and 
loss account.

7. Pension commitments 
Defined contribution: 
The Company participates in the defined contribution scheme of The Go-Ahead Group Pension Plan. This scheme is not contracted-out of the 
State Second Pension Scheme and is open to new entrants. The expense recognised in these accounts for the year is £0.1m (2009: £0.1m) being 
the contributions paid and payable.  
Defined benefit: 
The Company participates in a scheme which is part of The Go-Ahead Group Pension Plan. The assets of the scheme are held separately from 
those of the Company in an independently administered fund.  
The most recent actuarial valuation of the scheme was at 31 March 2009 and was updated by Watson Wyatt LLP to take account of the 
requirements of FRS 17 in order to assess the liabilities of the scheme at 3 July 2010 and 27 June 2009. The contributions paid to the scheme are 
paid in line with the schedule of contributions, being 13.3% and 11.2% of pensionable salaries paid to upper and lower tier sections respectively.  
The defined benefit scheme is effectively closed to new entrants. As a result it can be expected that the service cost will increase in future, as a 
percentage of payroll. However, this percentage is likely to be applied to a reducing total pensionable payroll.  
The scheme is a multi-employer scheme and in accordance with FRS 17, the Company has accounted for its contributions to the scheme as if it 
were a defined contribution scheme because it is not possible to identify the Company’s share of the net assets and liabilities in the scheme on a 
consistent and reasonable basis due to the high volume of members/pensioners and the historic interaction between Group companies. The 
following disclosures provide details of the entire defined benefit scheme.  
The main assumptions are:

  DIVIDEND PAYMENTS
Dividends are paid in April and November each year.We
recommend that all shareholders have their dividends paid directly
into their bank or building society account.This is more secure than
receiving your dividend by cheque which could be slow to arrive or
get lost in the post.The dividend is paid into your account on the
payment date which means you do not have to wait for a cheque
to clear before the funds are available.We will send you a tax
voucher following each dividend payment.T o select this method of
dividend payment, please contact Equiniti.
DUPLICATE DOCUMENTS
Many of our shareholders have more than one account on the
share register, which means they receive duplicate documentation
and split dividend payments.T o request that your accounts be
combined, please contact Equiniti.

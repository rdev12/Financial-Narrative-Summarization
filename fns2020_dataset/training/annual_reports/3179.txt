Kounrad – Kazakhstan
Operation
CAML was awarded the contract to develop the 
Kounrad project in 2007. The agreement was 
structured as a 60/40 joint venture and in May 
2014 the Company completed the transaction to 
acquire 100% ownership of the project. 
Having raised $60 million at the IPO in September 
2010, CAML built its Kounrad SX-EW copper 
plant in central Kazakhstan. The construction was 
completed early in 2012 at a cost of $39 million – 
approximately 15% below the budget. Built in just 
21 months, the 10,000 tonnes per annum plant, 
started production in late April 2012. Since that 
time a total of 28,232 tonnes of copper has been 
produced up to 31 December 2014.
Resource
The resources at Kounrad were classified as JORC 
compliant during 2013 and it is estimated that 
the dumps contain over 650 million tonnes of 
material containing copper in excess of 600,000 
tonnes.
The leaching process to extract the copper will 
recover between 35% and 51% of the contained 
copper depending on the mineralogy of the 
material. In parallel to the JORC classification the 
resources were also placed onto the approved 
‘State Balance’ of geological resources during 
2013. The Eastern and Western dumps cover a 
combined area of 22km

2014 dividend
* includeds proposed 2014 final dividend
Having established the Kounrad project as 
a low cost copper project in Kazakhstan, 
we now plan to increase production to 
15,000 tonnes of copper per annum by 
2016. We are also looking at expanding 
the business where we see an opportunity 
to create value for our shareholders.
Dear Shareholders
Key Achievements
It is now over four years since the Company listed on 
AIM and raised $60 million to implement its business 
plans. Thanks to the hard work, dedication and skill 
of our staff we have achieved a lot since that time 
and managed to deliver on all of our key promises to 
shareholders.
Since September 2010 we have now produced over 
30,000 tonnes of cathode copper at Kounrad at 
extremely competitive cash costs of production. The 
CAML Board intend to propose a final dividend for 
2014 of 7.5 pence per Ordinary Share taking the 
total dividend for 2014 to 12.5 pence per Ordinary 
Share subject to shareholder approval and to the 
proposed captial reduction as summarised in the 
Directors’ Report on page 38. This will take take the 
total dividend for 2014 to 12.5 pence per Ordinary 
Share. This latest dividend will increase the amount 
returned to shareholders in dividends and share buy 
backs since the listing to approximately $53 million.
In addition the Company has retained sufficient 
cash resources to fund the $35 million expansion 
programme at Kounrad. Stage 1 of this expansion 
programme will increase the SX-EW plant’s capacity 
to 15,000 tonnes per annum at a total capital cost of 
$15.5 million, inclusive of the boiler house expansion, 
whilst Stage 2 will commence on receipt of the 
relevant State approvals to enable the resource from 
the Western dumps to be leached and processed. 
The capital cost of the Stage 2 expansion is currently 
estimated at $19.5 million.
In May 2014, the Company completed the 
transaction to acquire 100% ownership of the 
Kounrad project. This was a key milestone for the 
Company and prompted the commencement 
of the expansion programme mentioned above. 
As part of the completion of the transaction, 
Mr Kenges Rakishev, a Non-Executive Director of the 
Company, also became a 20% shareholder of the 
Company. We are pleased to have such an influential 
Kazakhstani businessman as Kenges as both a Board 
member and a supportive major shareholder.

In recognition of the Company’s achievements since 
the IPO, the Company was awarded ‘Best Basic 
Resources PLC’ in the UK Stock Market Awards in 
March 2014. The award was judged on the basis 
of the Company’s performance within the mining 
sector and in comparison to its peer group and other 
larger mining companies.
Corporate Governance
Dr Michael Price retired from the Board in June 
2014, having served as a Director of the Company 
since 2006. During his time with the Company, 
Mike served both as a valued independent Non-
Executive Director and as the Chairman of the 
Audit and Remuneration Committees of the Board. 
In these roles he helped lead the transition of the 
governance of the Company from the private arena 
to the public market. The rest of the Board and 
I wish to record our appreciation to Mike for his 
independent and insightful input over many years.
Following Mike’s departure the Board has been 
strengthened by the appointment of David Swan 
in June 2014 as an independent Non-Executive 
Director of the Company and Chairman of the Audit 
Committee. David is a chartered accountant with 
broad commercial experience across a range of small 
to large companies. We are delighted to welcome 
David to the Board and believe he will provide great 
value to the Group as we continue developing 
CAML’s controls and procedures.
The Company is committed to improving corporate 
governance wherever it can and the Board is well 
aware of the importance of maintaining strong 
controls and procedures across the Group’s 
operations.
Strategy and Growth
Kazakhstan
The Company has an established presence in 
Kazakhstan and since the commencement of 
operations at Kounrad, has paid almost $50 million 
in various taxes to the Kazakhstan authorities, 
contributed close to $690,000 towards the local 
community and currently employs approximately 
330 staff on site, the majority of whom have been 
recruited locally.
The Company is keen to grow its business and 
reputation in Kazakhstan and the expansion 
of operations at Kounrad is testament to this 
goal. As a responsible operator, we place the 
highest priority on our obligations to protect the 
environment in the area of our copper recovery 
operations and to comply with the applicable 
health and safety regulations of Kazakhstan.
Alongside the main copper production facilities at 
Kounrad, the Company has established a business 
development focus within Kazakhstan which is 
tasked with seeking out additional opportunities.
Outside of Kazakhstan
Elsewhere, based on our strong financial position 
and technical experience, the Group is keen 
to consider other business opportunities. Such 
opportunities will only be actively pursued by 
management so long as they can be suitably 
incorporated into CAML and would add significant 
shareholder value.
In determining this, the management team will 
consider a number of factors from the strategic 
fit within the Group’s operations to the funding 
requirements and overall impact on Group 
profitability. To support our business development 
activities we were delighted to appoint Gavin 
Ferrar as our Business Development Director in 
June 2014. Gavin brings with him a wealth of 
commercial experience in the natural resources 
sector and will be a valuable member of the 
CAML team.
Outlook
During 2014, the copper price came under 
pressure due to increasing supply and continued 
concerns over the outlook for the growth of the 
Chinese economy. These price pressures became 
particularly acute in January 2015 when the price 
fell to a five and a half year low.
Whilst the current commodity price environment 
provides a challenge to all copper producers from 
which CAML is not immune, our low operating 
cash costs of production at Kounrad places us in an 
enviable position compared to our peers.

Since the start of the project we have 
exceeded annual production targets 
and our cash costs of production have 
remained in the lowest quartile on the 
industry cost curve.
Kounrad Operations –  
Record Production in 2014
During 2014, the Company’s production at the 
Kounrad project continued to be a success. We 
produced 11,136 tonnes of copper cathode and 
surpassed our production target of 11,000 tonnes 
whilst maintaining a low cash cost base. During 2014, 
our C1 cash cost of production was $0.71/lb (2013: 
$0.73/lb) and fully absorbed costs within Kazakhstan 
were $1.30/lb (2013: $1.13/lb). The increase in fully 
absorbed costs is due to increased depreciation and 
amortisation charges as a result of the accounting 
treatment of the acquisition of the additional 40% 
share in the Kounrad project in 2014.
A total of 11,163 tonnes of copper (2013: 10,689) 
were sold at an average copper price of $6,794 
per tonne (2013: $7,114) resulting in annual 2014 
gross revenue for CAML of $76.6 million (2013: 
$54.1 million) and $161.4 million cumulative gross 
revenues to 31 December 2014 since operations 
commenced. This revenue stream combined with 
the low costs of production helped to generate a 
Kounrad project EBITDA for the year ended  
31 December 2014 of $56.0 million.
During 2014, the utilisation rate of the plant was 
98.7%. The performance and efficiency of the SX-
EW plant continued to meet our expectations and is 
further evidence of the reliability of the plant design, 
equipment selection and construction methods 
employed from the outset.
Similarly, the quality of the copper cathodes 
produced continued to be of a high standard 
and met all contractual conditions and 
London Metal Exchange (LME) specifications.
Our commitments to the local community and 
environment continued to be a key focus during the 
year. Significant efforts have been made to ensure 
that we comply with all the local environmental and 
health and safety legislation.
Our Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Director, 
Nick Shirley, is based on site in Kazakhstan to 
lead these activities and is tasked with raising 
environmental and health and safety standards  
to ensure they meet industry best practice.
Whilst health and safety is key to the welfare 
of our employees, the Group did record its first 
lost time injury (LTI) since the commencement 
of construction four years ago. The injury to the 
employee was relatively minor and he made a quick 
and full recovery and has since returned to duties.

contributing $280,000 to local causes through our 
voluntary and regulated subsoil use contract (SUC) 
social contributions.
Kounrad Ownership and Expansion
During the year, and as part of the process of 
purchasing the remaining 40% ownership of 
the Kounrad project, the Group received all the 
necessary approvals from the State for the transfer 
of ownership. On completion of the transaction in 
May 2014, Mr Kenges Rakishev, a Non-Executive 
Director of the Company became a 20% 
shareholder of the Company.
Following the completion of the transaction, the 
expansion plans for the project commenced in 
May 2014. The Company plans to invest $35 
million into the project in two specific stages. 
Stage 1 is to increase copper production at the 
SX-EW plant to 15,000 tonnes per annum by 2016. 
The estimated cost for this stage is $15.5 million 
inclusive of the capital costs for constructing the 
boiler house extension. Stage 2, at an additional 
estimated capital cost of $19.5 million, will extend 
the life of the mine to enable the resource from the 
Western dumps to be leached and processed. The 
programme of works for Stage 1 will be completed 
in Q2 2015 using the same CAML construction 
personnel that worked on the construction of the 
current SX-EW plant.
Stage 1
An additional 5.6 MW of boiler capacity was 
commissioned on schedule in October 2014 to 
facilitate increased production throughout the 
winter months. The total capital cost of building 
and commissioning the boiler was $1.4 million. 
In June 2014, the Company commenced the 
construction programme for the expansion of the 
existing SX-EW plant. This involves the addition of a 
new mixer settler unit (SX), a new 5,000 tonne per 
annum capacity Electro-Winning (EW) facility and an 
upgrade to the existing electrical sub-station. As at 
31 December 2014, work was progressing well and 
we remain on target for commissioning in Q2 2015.
Stage 2
The Stage 2 expansion will only commence upon 
receipt of all the necessary approvals and mining 
permits required from the State to allow leaching 
operations on the Western dumps. All the required 
applications have been submitted and we hope to 
have obtained all approvals by Q2 2015.
The Stage 2 expansion programme’s focus is on the 
extraction of copper from the Western dump area. 
Exploitation of the Western Kounrad resource area 
will be f acilitated by the construction of two 12.6km 
pipelines from the expanded SX-EW plant in the 
East to the Western dumps. This will allow for the 
transportation of pregnant leach solution (PLS) and 
raffinate solution from the Western leaching areas to 
the plant for processing. The Stage 2 expansion plans 
also involve the construction of three additional boilers 
at the Western leaching area together with solution 
collection and pumping f acilities. The anticipated cost 
is approximately $19.5 million, phased from late 2015 
and completion is planned for 2017. 
Growth Opportunities
Copper Bay Project – Chile 
During 2014 we progressed the Copper Bay 
project having acquired a 50% shareholding 
in November 2013. As at 31 December 2014, 
significant progress had been made on the 
in-house developed preliminary feasibility study 
(PFS) although a number of technical aspects 
required additional work.
At the time of CAML’s investment there was no 
approved JORC resource despite several previous 
drilling campaigns and resource calculations 
prepared by former owners. Consequently, a 
drilling campaign was planned in consultation 
with Wardell Armstrong International (WAI) and 
conducted in August 2014 during which a total 
of 136 holes were drilled to an average depth of 
9.2m. The analysis of the data has enabled WAI 
to commence preparation of a JORC compliant 
resource statement.
During much of the year the focus of the PFS work 
has been on assessing the most efficient means 
of extracting the copper from the resource. The 
preferred process route is for the tailings to be 
reclaimed by dredging from the beach zone, with 
the reclaimed solids then pumped to the processing 
plant for copper recovery through an acid leaching 
process followed by froth flotation. The treated waste 
tailings from the plant will then be either returned to 
the beach zone as coarse backfill or sent to a tailings 
management facility (TMF) as fine tailings.
During this period emphasis was placed on 
metallurgical testing, using the WAI laboratory 
facilities in Cornwall. The results from the test 
programme have indicated that a copper recovery 
in the range of 70% to 73% can be achieved using 
the process mentioned above. Additional testing 
performed on a 7 tonne bulk sample taken from the 
2014 drilling programme is under consideration as 
part of the next stage of the project.
These additional aspects of the work remain 
ongoing, together with the environmental and 
social studies, and it is anticipated that the PFS will 
be completed in Q2 2015. A decision whether to 
then invest a further $3 million to increase CAML’s 
stake to 75%, in line with the Investment and 
Shareholder’s Agreement, will be made shortly 
thereafter.
Other Opportunities
Elsewhere, we continue to look for additional 
business opportunities to enhance the value of the 
CAML portfolio. Whilst the expansion at Kounrad 
and the 100% ownership of the project will increase 
the cash generation capabilities of the Company, 
the CAML Board is keen to further increase returns 
to shareholders by taking advantage of the Group’s 
balance sheet strength and technical skills.
During the year the Company established a formal 
business development function in its management 
structure to establish and execute an accretive 
growth strategy. Underlying these objectives is to 
ensure solid shareholder value by targeting only 
those opportunities that will deliver profitable 
production and be accretive to our shareholders.
CAML’s management has well-established expertise 
in project delivery, mining and processing operations, 
which together with the financial strength afforded 
by strong cash flow and a debt-free balance sheet, 
will allow the Company to assess a broad range of 
opportunities.
CAML will assess opportunities in Kazakhstan as 
well as Europe, Africa and the Americas. Although 
business development activities are constant, there 
are currently no transactions in process.
Outlook
During 2014 the copper price fell by 18% and a 
further reduction in prices was seen in January 
2015. Indeed, by the end of January 2015 copper 
prices had fallen to a five and a half year low of 
approximately $5,505 per tonne.
Whilst such price reductions are not ideal they are 
also outside of our control. Consequently, we will 
focus our efforts on what we can control and strive 
to maintain our low cash costs of production and 
meet our production target for 2015 of 13,000 
tonnes of copper. Delivery on time and within the 
capital budget of the expansion programme at 
Kounrad is a primary objective for the year. 
Alongside all of the above operational objectives 
we will continue to actively pursue additional 
business opportunities that may arise from the 
challenging nature of the commodities market as 
well as making some key decisions on the future of 
the Copper Bay project in Q2 2015.

Demand
In spite of global stock market indices reaching record 
levels during 2014, it has been a difficult year for the 
commodities markets. This is due to a number of 
factors including the slowing growth in China which 
is affecting the fundamental demand for nearly 
all commodities, and the tapering of quantitative 
easing by the US Federal Reserve. The latter has also 
resulted in a strengthening of the US dollar over 
the year which has led to the softening of US dollar 
denominated commodity prices.
 
The underlying concerns over demand evident 
during 2014 took a dramatic turn for the worse 
in early 2015 when the World Bank reduced its 
global growth forecast from 3.4% to 3.0%. The 
bank specifically cited concerns over a “disorderly 
slowdown” in China emphasising the slowdown in 
the Chinese property and land sales which could 
restrict growth from infrastructure related projects.
Given that approximately a third of all copper is used 
in construction, with another third in transport and 
infrastructure projects, the metal is clearly sensitive to 
both the demand from developing countries, notably 
China, but also the huge infrastructure projects and 
building programmes that have supported Chinese 
growth since the global financial crisis in 2008. 
Indeed, China’s economy is crucial to the copper 
market and the demand side of the equation and 
according to a study by the International Copper 
Studies Group in December 2014 it is estimated to 
consume 48% of the world’s copper in 2015.
 
Concerns about growth in the construction sector 
in China have been compounded by the huge 
over capacity that has been constructed in the 
major cities of China, mainly financed by debt. In 
December 2014 average house prices had fallen 
almost 4.3% from 12 months earlier and it was 
estimated that unsold floor space was up by more 
than 26% (Financial Times, January 2015). The 
correction in China’s real estate sector could prove 
damaging to the world economy as a whole and 
more specifically to the demand for copper.
Despite this scenario, China’s copper consumption 
is still expected to grow around 4% this year, slower 
than a few years ago, but still increasing off a larger 
base and accounting for more than 40% of the 
world’s copper consumption. It seems that the 
price of copper is increasingly determined in China 
as evidenced by the 33% increase in 2014 copper 
trading volume on the Shanghai Futures Exchange 
(Reuters Inside Metals, January 2015).
 
Supply
On the supply side of the equation, the variables 
are also not clear. Whilst many analysts have been 
predicting a surplus of copper supply in 2015 
and 2016 due to production capacity increases 
gradually coming on stream from the major miners, 
the recent reductions in the copper price have led 
many to reassess this expected surplus.
In recent months Rio Tinto has lowered forecasts 
for its Kennecott mine by 100,000 tonnes, BHP 
has cut 150,000 tonnes from Escondida’s 2015 
outlook and Glencore shaved guidance for Minera 
Alumbrera by 50,000 tonnes.
This reaction to the price drops, together with 
the usual industry expectations for anticipated 
production disruptions and the under delivery 
of major mine projects, could quickly turn an 
anticipated surplus into a shortfall. Indeed, one 
of the major producers estimated recently that 
as much as 1.8 million tonnes of new capacity 
might not materialise. Bearing in mind that world 
demand for copper is approximately 21 million 
tonnes per annum the estimated surplus forecasts 
are insignificant at 55,000 tonnes (Macquarie, 
February 2015).
Fundamentally the outlook for copper remains 
robust as average head grades continue to 
decrease, new mine locations are ever more remote 
or the jurisdictions politically challenging, and 
capital costs continue to rise. Due to its physical 
properties of malleability and conductivity, 
copper is still the primary electrical conductor in 
use today and hence a fundamental element in 
our technology-obsessed world as well as a key 
component of the construction industry.
Consensus is that the market will return to a deficit 
post 2016. In current market conditions it is clearly 
an advantage to be a low cost producer. 
During 2014 the copper price fell by 18%, 
however as a low cost producer CAML is 
able to continue to operate profitably. CENTRAL ASIA MET ALS PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014

Impact on Copper Price
The copper price chart above highlights the 
impact the finely balanced arguments regarding 
supply and demand have had on the selling price 
of copper over the past two years.
Copper prices started the year at $7,395/tonne and 
ended at $6,359/tonne, a decrease of 18% over 
the course of the year. The volatility in the copper 
price was evident throughout 2014 with major 
price declines in March on the back of Chinese fund 
selling which took the price below $6,500/tonne, 
and then in June when the market reacted sharply 
to the Qingdao Port stock financing probe which 
sent the price below $6,700/tonne. Between these 
two events the copper price peaked at over $7,000/
tonne.
 
Post-Qingdao the price again rallied to reach 
a high of $7,100/tonne during August but 
declined steadily for the remainder of the year 
as the macro outlook for China and other copper 
consumer nations was called into question and 
copper eventually closed at $6,359/tonne at the 
end of the year.
The early weeks of January 2015 saw a significant 
shift in the general market sentiment towards 
copper and the downward price pressure that was 
evident in the second half of 2014 turned into 
something more material. 
Copper plunged 18% in January 2015 and by 31 
January 2015 prices were at their lowest since 2009. 
The key question now for the industry is which way 
will the copper price go next and has it further to fall 
or is this the end of a long expected correction. As 
ever there are different views with the more bearish 
anticipating further falls below $5,000/tonne and 
others believing that the steep price decline is not 
reflective of fundamental supply and demand in 
the global economy but driven by aggressive fund 
managers looking for the next commodity to short.
Despite all the above commentary, CAML is a 
copper producer, and whilst concerned by the 
short term fluctuations, has a primary focus on 
the long term fundamentals for copper. The 
Company’s view is that the key to survival in the 
current market is to focus on maintaining its low 
costs of production and remaining profitable 
through the cycle.
As the chart above illustrates, the price of copper 
will need to drop below $3,500/tonne before 
CAML becomes unprofitable. Despite all the 
current gloom in the copper market it has only 
been below this price twice in the last 10 years as 
the long term chart below shows. CENTRAL ASIA MET ALS PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014

Kounrad Operations
“Leaching performance is key to any SX-EW project’s 
success, where performance is closely related to ore 
mineralisation with respect to the rate of copper  
recovery, grade of the off-flow solutions and 
the consumption of acid. In Kounrad’s case the 
mineralisation has certainly proved to be favourable.”
A total of 11,136 tonnes of copper cathode were 
produced during 2014 which represented a marginal 
increase on the production target of 11,000 tonnes. 
As at 31 December 2014, the SX-EW plant at 
Kounrad had produced 28,232 tonnes of copper 
cathode since production first commenced in April 
2012, some 32 months ago.
Leaching Operations
Since the commencement of leaching operations 
in April 2012, the focus of the activity has 
been on the Eastern dump area. The Eastern 
areas consisting of dumps 9-10, 6, 7, 5 and 2 
are illustrated in the adjacent diagram. These 
dumps cover a total area of 308 hectares and 
are estimated to contain approximately 168,000 
tonnes of copper at the outset of operations, 
of which the CAML management team have 
estimated approximately 80,000 tonnes will be 
recovered.
 
Initially leaching was confined to dumps 9-10, 
immediately adjacent to the SX-EW plant. As 
the recoverable copper in dumps 9-10 became 
exhausted, the leaching operations have moved 
further afield to dumps 6 and then 7 and will be 
followed by dump 5 in 2016. 
The graph on page 15 shows the calculated 
percentage recovery of copper achieved to date 
compared to the IPO Feasibility Study predictions 
for dumps 9-10, 6 and 7. As at 31 December 
2014, approximately 69% of the total expected 
soluble copper had been recovered from these 
dumps and it is projected that this recovery will 
be close to 90% by the end of 2015, with the 
remaining balance achieved in 2016.

The site metallurgical team work on the basis of 
an average leaching time of 270 days per block 
of material in order to achieve the planned target. 
The graph above indicates the number of days 
each of the 3 active dumps has been leached for 
in accordance with this approach; noting that only 
dump 9-10 is nearing the target time period at 
214 days.
All of the current Kounrad leaching activity is 
based on the Eastern dump areas, which over 
the next 4 years will continue to supply the bulk 
of copper recovered through the expanded 
SX-EW facility. Beginning in mid-2017 there will 
be an increasing proportion of recovered copper 
supplied by the transfer of leach solutions from 
the Western dump areas. By 2019 the Western 
dump area will be the predominant feed source to 
the SX-EW facility following the gradual depletion 
of the Eastern dumps.
Winter Operations
Leaching operations during the winter months are 
facilitated by a combination of heating the dump 
irrigation solution, known as raffinate, and also 
covering certain areas of the dripper piping system 
with a layer of protective high-density polyethylene 
(HDPE) sheeting. For leaching operations during 
the first quarter of 2014, a total area of 24 hectares 
was covered with HDPE on dumps 9-10 and 
dump 7. This ensured successful and continuous 
operations, despite temperatures regularly 
dropping to minus 20˚C and below for much of  
the quarter.
An additional area of 27 hectares of HDPE was 
laid on dump 7 over the period August 2014 
through to October 2014 in readiness for leaching 
during the winter months through to March 2015.

Transporting Copper Solution Around 
the Kounrad Site 
During the year the average area irrigated on 
a daily basis was 35 hectares and in order to 
achieve this, the quantity of distribution pipework 
and dripper irrigation pipe installed is significant. 
To give an indication of the magnitude of this 
quantity, since the commencement of leaching 
operations in early 2012, a total of 2,275km of 
irrigation and distribution pipelines have been 
installed which laid end to end would stretch 
from London to Athens. With the requirements 
to purchase an additional 3,000km of piping 
over the next two years, it will not be long before 
the irrigation piping laid will be the equivalent 
distance of London to New York.
As leaching operations progress on the Eastern 
dumps, the distances from the SX-EW plant to the 
leaching cells become greater. During 2015 the 
operations plan involves leaching various blocks 
located in the Northern part of dump 7 and this 
will result in pumping raffinate a distance from 
the SX-EW plant of 2.5 to 3.0km. The main twin 
distribution lines for the dripper piping system  
are shown in blue and green on the diagram on 
page 14. 
In order to achieve the delivery of the required 
volume of raffinate solution for this area, and 
also to ensure that dumps 5 and 2 can be 
irrigated from 2016 onwards, a modification to 
the pump delivery system is being undertaken. 
This involves the addition of a second parallel 
450mm diameter pipeline.
These two pipelines will then be equipped with 
booster pumps, at a point close to the junction of 
dumps 7 and 5, in order to overcome the calculated 
extra head pressure that is required to maintain the 
flow volumes. This necessary enhancement is not 
only associated with extra distance, but also with 
the extra height of the dumps. 
As at 31 December 2014 the pipeline had 
already been installed and all necessary pumping 
equipment ordered and ready for delivery to site. 
It is anticipated that the pumping system will be 
commissioned in late Q2 2015.
Managing the Grade
Copper recovery from the dumps is controlled by 
manipulating the irrigation flow rate, in a planned 
sequence to maintain the resulting grade of 
the leached solution, known as pregnant leach 
solution (PLS), within desired ranges. The SX-EW 
plant is designed such that it can accommodate 
a wide range of flow rates, from 250 to 900m
3
/hr, 
and PLS grades, from 1 to 4 grams of copper per 
litre of solution (gpl). 
A further important parameter is the maintenance 
of a steady raffinate solution application rate. 
This has been optimally determined to be 2.5 to 
3.0l/m
2
/hr. During the course of 2014 the average 
raffinate application rate was 3.0l/m
2
/hr and the 
average flow rate was 801m
3
/hr with a resulting 
PLS grade that averaged 2.24gpl.
The graph on page 16 illustrates how these two 
parameters have varied quarterly since start-up of 
operation in 2012, whilst producing an increasing 
quantity of copper cathode.
The Kounrad site operations team have become 
proficient at controlling the daily leaching activity 
on the dumps. To assist them, an Australian 
consultancy firm PCMETS Consulting Pty Ltd 
(PCMETS), are retained as advisors for their 
significant experience in dump leaching and 
SX-EW operations. PCMETS undertake a monthly 
review of all Kounrad leaching and SX-EW plant 
data and make an annual site visit to provide 
advice and guidance to the site team. CENTRAL ASIA MET ALS PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014

OPERA TIONAL REVIEW
SX–EW Plant Operations
The SX-EW plant performed in line with 
expectations during 2014 and utilisation rates 
improved to 98.7% for both the SX and EW 
sections compared to 97.0% during 2013. This 
contributed to the record production for the year 
of 11,136 tonnes of cathode copper. 
During 2014 the average PLS flow volumes 
through the SX-EW plant increased to 
around 771m
3
/hr representing an increase of 
approximately 44% compared to 2013 flow 
volumes. This along with an ability to easily 
adapt the process flowsheet to accommodate 
any fluctuations in PLS grade or other variable, 
demonstrates the operational flexibility of the 
plant design that allows us to achieve consistent 
copper production.
A detailed review of the reagents used in 
conjunction with BASF, our supplier of the 
extracting reagent (LIX), resulted in a change of 
the specific LIX product to minimise iron transfer 
from the PLS solution into the EW feed solution. 
The transfer of too much iron, in particular 
during winter months when PLS copper grades 
tend to reduce, can have a negative impact 
on the power efficiency in the EW plating cells. 
Such modifications and regular reviews are an 
integral part of the operation of the SX-EW plant 
management team as they strive to improve 
efficiency and maintain budgeted costs.
The leaching of the copper from the dump does 
not simply involve the addition of dilute sulphuric 
acid to the dissolved copper. There are several 
interacting processes related to the copper 
mineralisation which involve natural bacterial 
activity and ferric/ferrous iron reactions, which 
degrade the stability of sulphide associated 
copper species. In addition, due to the virtual 
absence of acid consuming minerals in the 
bulk waste material, and with this combination 
of favourable conditions the consumption of 
sulphuric acid at Kounrad has been low both in the 
irrigation of the dumps and also within the EW 
circuit. During 2014, the consumption rate was 
approximately 228kg/t of copper produced which 
was approximately 10% lower than that achieved 
in 2013. This low consumption rate combined 
with lower sulphuric acid purchase prices during 
EW building expansion

the year helped to maintain the low cost base of 
the Kounrad operation.
One of the main costs associated with the 
SX-EW plant operation is the consumption 
of electricity. During 2014 the average 
consumption of electricity per tonne of copper 
produced was approximately 2,992kWhr. The 
EW process utilises direct current (DC) for the 
plating of the copper cathodes and during 
2014 the main rectifier unit operated at an 
annualised 84% of its design capacity. This 
average figure is impacted during the winter 
months as the quantity of copper available 
for plating drops due to limitations on the 
irrigation circuit, as a consequence the rectifier 
power demand is lowered. The Chinese supplied 
rectifier unit has proved to be extremely resilient 
and reliable since production commenced and 
for several months of the year was operating at 
100% of its design capacity.
Quality Control
The quality of the copper cathodes produced 
at Kounrad continues to be to a high standard 
and meets all our contractual obligations and 
the technical LME specifications. The adjacent 
graph highlights the quality of the production 
from the Kounrad SX-EW plant since production 
commenced in April 2012.

OPERA TIONAL REVIEW
EXPANSION: 
KAZAKHST AN
This included the physical location of the 
resource at Kounrad, differing metallurgical 
characteristics, and the estimated remaining 
useful life of the SX-EW plant. 
After due consideration, the CAML Board agreed 
on a phased expansion of annual copper cathode 
production to 15,000 tonnes at the existing plant 
with a capital expenditure programme over the 
next three years through to 2017. 
The key parameter in these studies was the ability 
of the existing SX-EW facility to operate for a 
further 15 years, provided normal standards of 
maintenance are met. Through the expansion of 
the existing SX-EW facility to a nominal capacity 
of 15,000 tonnes per annum the forecast is that 
the Eastern dumps can provide the required 
quantity of copper to reach this by 2016. 
Thereafter, through the phased introduction of 
leach solutions from the Western dump area this 
capacity can be maintained until the cessation of 
leaching in the Eastern dumps.
Engineering studies have verified that the 
required quantity of solutions transferred 
between the East and West sites can be achieved 
by the installation of two 12.6km pipelines. Cost 
comparisons have illustrated this option to be 
preferable to any other option.
Stage 1 – Expansion of the SX-EW 
Plant to 15,000 Tonnes Per Annum
During the year detailed engineering plans were 
finalised for the expansion of the existing SX-EW 
facility. They comprised two stages, firstly the 
installation of extra heating capacity through 
the addition of two 2.8 MW boilers thus allowing 
increased winter production. In addition the 
SX-EW plant is to be expanded by the inclusion 
of a sixth mixer-settler and construction of a 
separate EW building containing 24 new EW cells 
and associated equipment, thus increasing our 
copper plating capacity by approximately 50%.
The construction work on the new boilers 
commenced in June 2014 and was completed 
by late October 2014. The addition of these two 
new boilers, housed in an extension to the existing 
boiler house, increased the total installed heating 
capacity to 14 MW. This provides for a planned 
design increase in heating winter raffinate flows 
from 450m
3
/hr to 750m
3
/hr, which through 
the use of a heat exchanger system raises the 
temperature of cold incoming solution at 1˚C to 
10˚C, prior to passing through the SX mixer-settler 
units. By mid-December 2014 the boiler house 
was performing somewhat better than design 
forecasts, heating up to 770m
3
/hr of raffinate, and 
achieving a temperature differential of plus 10˚C 
between the incoming cold and outgoing warm 
solutions. This being achieved whilst daily external 
temperatures of minus 25˚C was common place.
The second stage of the SX-EW expansion requires 
the addition of a sixth mixer-settler unit in the SX 
section and a new EW section, containing 24 EW 
cells. As per the original SX-EW plant, the design 
and main equipment supply contract was placed 
with the Beijing General Research Institute of 
Mining & Metallurgy (BGRIMM), with all on site 
construction being managed and undertaken 
by our in-house construction team. Following 
the receipt of all necessary State permits, work 
commenced on site at the beginning of July 2014, 
and commissioning is scheduled for Q2 2015.
On schedule to grow annual production at 
Kounrad to 15,000 tonnes per annum by 
2016, funded by internal cash flows.
Increased Copper Production to 
15,000 Tonnes Per Annum 
In May 2014, the Company completed the 
acquisition of the remaining 40% of the Kounrad 
project. Whilst the commercial advantages of 
acquiring the additional shareholding in the 
Kounrad project were significant, it also prompted 
the Company to commence the implementation of 
its expansion plans for the project.
The JORC compliant resources at Kounrad are 
estimated at approximately 614,000 tonnes 
of contained copper. CAML management have 
estimated that the amount of recoverable copper 
is approximately 250,000 tonnes.
As can be seen from the resource summary 
above, some 80,000 tonnes of the recoverable 
copper (32%) is situated in the Eastern dumps 
adjacent to the location of the SX-EW plant. The 
remaining resource at Kounrad is situated in the 
Western dumps that are located 10km from the 
plant. 
The rationale and basis for the Kounrad 
expansion plans had to consider a number of 
factors in order to determine the most cost 
effective approach to processing all the Group 
owned resource at the Kounrad site.

In line with the plan, the new SX and EW buildings 
were structurally completed and fully enclosed 
by mid-December 2014 in order to facilitate the 
installation of equipment within the buildings 
during the Q1 winter period of 2015. The EW 
overhead crane, used for harvesting cathode 
plates in the new EW extension had been fully 
installed as at 31 December 2014 and will be used 
by the construction team to install and equip the 
24 EW cells during Q1 2015.
All the requisite purchase orders and equipment 
supply contracts have been placed both locally 
and overseas, with many items already delivered 
to site by 31 December 2014. CAML management 
are confident that the SX-EW expansion project is 
sufficiently advanced as at the time of this report 
to ensure that commissioning will take place in Q2 
2015 and that the capital cost will be in line with, 
if not less than, the announced capital budget of 
$15.5 million.
Stage 2 – Development of the 
Western Dumps
Engineering design of the facilities required to 
commence leaching at the Western dumps by 
Q2 2017 has progressed well during the year. The 
technical project documentation, developed by 
IHT, the engineering arm of KazAtomProm, was 
completed by July 2014 and has been submitted for 
the necessary review and approvals process required 
to obtain regulatory project approval via the Ministry 
of Investment and Development. It is anticipated 
that State approval will be granted in Q2 2015. 
Once all permits and approvals have been received, 
equipment procurement and certain construction 
work will commence on site from late Q3 2015. This 
stage of the Kounrad expansion plan requires the 
construction and installation of two pipelines, each 
of 12.6km as can be seen in the adjacent diagram. 
One pipeline will enable PLS from the Western 
dumps to be transferred to the expanded SX-EW 
plant for processing into copper cathodes. The other 
pipeline will enable the raffinate solution from the 
SX section to be transported back to the Western 
dumps for irrigation purposes. The pumping and 
pipeline system has been designed to allow a range 
of flow-rates between 600 to 850m
3
/hr, which will 
provide the necessary flexibility depending upon the 
copper grade of the PLS solution flowing from the 
operational dumps. 
13,000 t
Production target 2015
T o provide the ability to operate through the winter 
periods at the Western dumps, a boiler house of 
the exact same design as the original facility at the 
Eastern plant, comprising of three 2.8 MW boiler 
units will be installed. During December 2014 
final engineering discussions were undertaken 
with BGRIMM, to finalise the equipment list and 
specifications and also to revalidate the capital cost 
estimate of approximately $19.5 million for this 
phase of the Kounrad expansion.
The supply of sufficient technical quality water from 
2017 onwards, to allow simultaneous leaching at 
both the Eastern and Western dumps, has always 
been an important consideration. At present all such 
water is provided from an underground reservoir 
sourced from an abandoned mine, approximately 
8km to the North East of the SX-EW plant. 
Hydrogeological studies indicate that this reservoir 
has the capability to provide adequate water at 
least until the end of 2017 at current abstraction 
rates. Beyond this date, this source may not be 
capable of providing the extra volume of water 
needed to simultaneously operate two leaching sites. 
Consequently, a management decision was taken 
in December 2014 to reinstate a water pipeline to 
transport water drawn from Lake Balkhash to the 
Kounrad site. This will provide sufficient water for 
the Kounrad project through to the end of its life, as 
well as assisting the local community at the Kounrad 
village with plentiful water for community purposes. 
This project requires the upgrading of an 
intermediate pumping station close to Balkhash 
and the installation of 16.5km of pipeline. The 
estimated capital cost of the programme is 
$2.7 million and it is anticipated that installation 
works, using our in-house personnel, will be 
completed by December 2015. As the abstraction 
system from the lake does not operate in winter, 
commissioning will be conducted during Q2 
2016 with the onset of more favourable weather 
conditions. During winter months the make-up 
water requirement is very low, which can be 
provided by the underground reservoir as required. CENTRAL ASIA MET ALS PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014

OPERA TIONAL REVIEW
EVALUA TION: 
CHILE
Copper Bay – Chile
Background
CAML acquired a 50% interest in Copper Bay 
Limited (CBL) via a cash investment of $3.2 million 
in November 2013. CBL was incorporated in 
September 2010 with the sole purpose of developing 
the Copper Bay project in the Atacama region of 
Chile, some 1,000km North of Santiago and 120km 
North West of the regional capital of Copiapó.
From 1938 to 1975, the Potrerillos, and later the 
El Salvador copper mines, disposed of the tailings 
residues from their respective mineral processing 
operations into the Rio Salado which outflows 
into Chañaral Bay. Over that period, it is believed 
that some 250Mt of tailings were discharged into 
the bay. These tailings now sit in the bay and on 
the beach at Chañaral and cover a 13km
2
 area. 
CBL is examining the viability of reclaiming and 
processing the copper tailings to produce copper 
cathode and copper concentrate.
Upon the acquisition of CBL, CAML agreed a 
scope of works that was intended to deliver a 
pre-feasibility study (PFS). The $3.2 million funds 
invested into CBL by CAML were all allocated for 
the delivery of the PFS. 
As at 31 December 2014, significant progress had 
been made on the PFS and a total of $1.8 million 
had been spent on advancing the project. Work 
continues on the PFS which is expected to be 
completed in Q2 2015. 
Chañaral Bay
Quantifying the Resource – Beach 
Zone only 
At the time of CAML’s investment, there was 
no compliant resource statement, albeit there 
was a high degree of confidence in the available 
resources based on previous drilling programmes 
on site. During 2014, a drilling campaign was 
conducted on the beach in agreement with 
Wardell Armstrong International (WAI). A total 
of 136 holes were drilled to an average depth of 
9.2m and a total of 1,022 samples were collected 
for assaying.
The data from the latest drilling programme 
together with all the data from previous drilling 
programmes allows a JORC compliant resource 
statement to be prepared.
The area is known to have copper tailings in three 
zones, namely beach, surf and bay. The resource 
currently being assessed only covers the material in 
the beach zone and previous studies have indicated 
the potential for additional copper resources 
which may be investigated at a later date. 
Technical Studies
During 2014, the technical focus has been on 
assessing the most efficient means of extracting 
the copper from the resource. The outline process 
is for the tailings to be reclaimed by dredging from 
the beach zone, after which the reclaimed solids 
will be pumped to the nearby processing plant.
The first stage of the process consists of leaching 
whereby sulphuric acid is added to the tailings in 
order to solubilise the copper oxides. This will be 
conducted in a series of agitated leach tanks to 
produce a PLS for conventional processing into 
copper cathodes by means of a SX-EW plant.
The second stage of the processing is for the 
leached residue solids to undergo a froth flotation 
process in order to extract residual sulphide 
minerals into a saleable concentrate product. The 
final tailings residue from this combined process 
will then be returned either to the beach zone as 
coarse backfill or to a tailings management facility 
(TMF) as fine tailings. CENTRAL ASIA MET ALS PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014

This latter part of the process is expected to result 
in approximately 90% of the processed tailings 
from the plant being returned to the beach 
zone. Given the importance of this aspect of the 
process to both the economic viability and the 
environmental success of the project, a great deal 
of work has gone into assessing how this can be 
achieved to best effect. 
An outline of the beach zone and processes 
envisaged for the project are illustrated on the right.
A significant amount of bench scale metallurgical 
testing has been carried out during the year and 
this has indicated that a copper recovery in the 
range of 70% to 73% can be achieved from the 
above processes. Additional testing performed 
on a 7 tonne bulk sample taken from the 2014 
drilling programme is under consideration as part 
of the next stage of the project.
Environmental and Social Studies
There is a high degree of local and national 
support for any proposed improvements to the 
environmental conditions in the area due to 
historical environmental pollution. Any initiative 
to reduce the impact of the tailings on the 
environment will be welcomed by the local 
community and by regional state authorities. 
During 2014 the consultancy company, Arcadis, 
were appointed to complete an environmental 
fatal flaw analysis of the project together with the 
commencement of an environmental baseline study. 
The study did not identify any fatal flaws in the 
project and provided management with a far better 
understanding of the environmental obligations.
The most important environmental aspect for the 
viability of the project involves the assessment of 
the re-deposition of the processed tailings to the 
beach zone and we continue to study this issue. 
Next Steps
The PFS is expected to be completed during Q2 
2015 at which time a decision will then be taken by 
the CAML Board regarding the additional investment 
of $3 million to increase the CAML holding in Copper 
Bay Limited to 75%. These funds would then be 
used to finance more detailed work on the project.

DELIVERING VALUE 
FOR OUR SHAREHOLDERS
2014 has proved to be another profitable year for CAML in a  
difficult market. Our continued focus on the low cost of operations  
at Kounrad and our increased ownership to 100% of the project 
has further strengthened the balance sheet.
Overview
During 2014 the Company completed the 
Kounrad transaction and became the 100% owner 
of the Kounrad project. The continued strong 
operational performance of the project and 
the associated low costs of production, resulted 
in strong cashflows for the CAML Group. Cash 
generated from operations increased to $47 
million (2013: $41 million) for the year of which 
$17.9 million was returned to shareholders as 
dividend and a further $11 million was invested 
back into the project.
Acquisition of 100% of the  
Kounrad Project 
As previously mentioned, on 23 May 2014 the 
Kounrad transaction was completed with Mr 
Rakishev resulting in the Group owning 100% 
of the Kounrad project. Accordingly, the Group 
accounted for the increased ownership of the 
Kounrad project by de-recognising its previous 
interests held and recognising the fair value of 
the assets and liabilities acquired at the time of 
completion. 
This resulted in an uplift to the asset values of 
$54.0 million and a one-off gain for the year of 
$33.0 million (2013: $27.8 million). There was an 
additional depreciation and amortisation charge 
during 2014 of $6.6 million as a result of the uplift 
to the asset values (2013: $1.3 million). 
Details of the Kounrad transaction and business 
combination accounting treatment are contained 
in note 33 of the financial statements.
Income Statement 
The Group operating profit for the 12 month 
period was $37.5 million (2013: $27.9 million) 
an increase of 34%. As mentioned above, a 
one off exceptional gain from the completion 
of the Kounrad transaction boosted the Group’s 
profit for the year from continuing operations to 
$59.7 million (2013: $48.6 million). 
Losses from discontinued operations reduced to 
$0.3 million (2013: $14.1 million) following the full 
write down of all the Mongolian assets during 2013.
The resulting Group profit for the year was $59.5 
million (2013: $34.5 million) which resulted in 
earnings per share of 56.04 cents (2013: 38.89 
cents) or 54.91 cents (2013: 37.36 cents) on a fully 
diluted basis.
Summary
▲ ▲ Gross revenue for the year increased by 42% to $76.6 m (2013: $54.1 m) 
▲ ▲ Operating profit for the year increased by 34% to $37.5 m (2013: $27.9 m)
▲ ▲ Unit operating costs at Kounrad remain competitive
 – C1 cash costs of $1,566 per tonne (2013: $1,600), equates to $0.71/lb 
(2013: $0.73/lb)
 – Fully inclusive cost of $3,642 (2013: $3,147), equates to $1.65/lb (2013:

▲ ▲ One-off gain in the period of $33.0 m as a result of the completion of the 
Kounrad transaction 
▲ ▲ Cash balances as at 31 December 2014 of $46.3 m (2013: $44.5 m) 
▲ ▲ Proposed 2014 final dividend of 7.5 pence per share –

Revenue
10,687 (2013: 10,500) tonnes of copper cathode 
were sold to Traxys as part of the Company’s offtake 
arrangements at Kounrad and a further 476 (2013: 
189) tonnes were sold locally. The Group achieved an 
average selling price of $6,794 (2013: $7,114) per 
tonne and this generated reported gross revenues for 
the Group of $76.6 million (2013: $54.1 million).
The offtake arrangement with Traxys is to sell a 
minimum of 90% of its product through to 31 
December 2015. As part of this arrangement, Traxys 
takes the goods at the SX-EW plant at Kounrad and is 
then responsible for transporting the goods to the end 
customer.
The costs of marketing, distribution and selling 
associated with this arrangement are borne by the 
Group at an agreed fixed fee. During the start of 2014 
the fixed fee was renegotiated with Traxys from $350 
to $320 per tonne of copper shipped. 
The Group reports both a gross revenue and net 
revenue line which reflects the offset of the fixed fee 
from the price of the copper achieved.
Costs of Production 
The Group commenced production of copper 
cathodes in April 2012. The cathodes are 
produced by the SX-EW plant at Kounrad which 
is owned and operated by Kounrad Copper 
Company LLP. Given the changes in the business 
over the past two years as a result of the Kounrad 
transaction, comparisons between the 2013 and 
2014 reported statutory numbers can be difficult 
to interpret. 
 
A more meaningful analysis of the reported revenues 
and costs can be obtained in the table on page 23.
The reported cost of sales for the year were $25.1 
million (2013: $13.8 million). This amount consists 
of the costs associated with the production of 
copper cathodes, the associated mineral extraction 
tax levied by the government and the depreciation 
and amortisation charges.
The costs related to the physical production 
of copper cathodes are the production labour, 
reagents and electricity, plus any other SX-EW 
site related cost. These costs amounted to $9.4 
million (2013: $6.1 million). On a project basis, 
the equivalent comparable cost in 2013 was $8.5 
million which indicates an 11% increase. This 
increase was primarily due to increased production 
and higher power and production payroll costs at 
Kounrad. 
Mineral Extraction T ax is charged by the Kazakhstan 
authorities at the rate of 5.7% on the value of the 
metal recovered and during the year this amounted 
to a further cost of $4.4 million (2013: $3.1 million). 
On a project basis, the equivalent comparable cost 
in 2013 was also $4.4 million.
During the year depreciation and amortisation 
charges amounted to $11.4 million (2013: $4.6 
million). This includes depreciation and amortisation 
charges of $6.6 million (2013: $1.3 million) as a 
result of the fair value accounting for the acquisition 
of the additional 40% share in the Kounrad project. 
Again on a project basis, the equivalent comparable 
charge in 2013 was $5.7 million indicating an 
increase year on year of $5.7 million or 100%. 
The ongoing annual depreciation and amortisation 
charges are expected to remain at approximately 
the same level in future years but are always 
subject to future periodic reviews of the Group’s 
depreciation policy. 
Distribution and Selling Costs
The major portion of the sales and distribution 
costs consist of the buyers fees paid to Traxys as 
part of the offtake agreements as noted above. 
During 2014, the Group incurred costs of $3.7 
million (2013: $3.0 million) and at project level 
the equivalent comparable 2013 costs were $4.2 
million. The 12% reduction in the year at project 
level is primarily due to lower negotiated fees with 
Traxys for the delivery of copper.
Administrative Expenses
During 2014, the Group employed an average 
of 46 staff (2013: 40) at Kounrad to oversee the 
technical and commercial management of the 
operations in Kazakhstan together with a small 
office headquarters in London of 8 staff including 
the Directors (2013: 7). Group administrative 
expenses for the year are $11.8 million (2013: $9.6 
million) reflecting the growth of the Group during 
the period.

Unit Costs
The Group’s C1 cash costs of production remains 
in the lowest quartile on the industry cost curve 
at $1,566 per tonne throughout the year (2013: 
$1,600) or $0.71/lb (2013: $0.73/lb). This 
represents a 3% decrease year on year due a 
combination of strong management controls and 
the devaluation of the local Kazakhstan currency 
by 20% in February 2014. Given that the Group 
currently only has one significant project, it seems 
reasonable to also report the Group’s unit cost base 
on a fully inclusive basis. The Group’s fully inclusive 
unit costs are $3,642 per tonne (2013: $3,152) 
or $1.65/lb (2013: $1.43/lb). The main increase 
at the fully inclusive level comes from increased 
depreciation and amortisation charges in 2014 as a 
result of the fair value accounting for the acquisition 
of the additional 40% share in the Kounrad project. 
Balance Sheet
As a result of the completion of the Kounrad 
transaction there has been a significant uplift to 
the Group’s asset base during 2014 to $216.3 
million (2013: $161.5 million). 
Following the acquisition of the remaining 40% 
in the subsoil user licence, intangibles assets 
increased to $81.6 million (2013: $16.7 million) 
including a fair value uplift of $54.0 million and 
additional goodwill arising on the transaction of 
$11.0 million (2013: $9.3 million).
 
During 2014, there were additions to property, 
plant and equipment of $11.3 million (2013: 
$1.9 million). The majority of this spend was 
incurred on construction work at Kounrad for the 
SX-EW plant expansion. 
At 31 December 2014, non-current trade and 
other receivables were $6.4 million (31 December 
2013: $17.1 million). The large reduction is a 
consequence of the change from joint operation 
accounting to 100% consolidation of the 
Kounrad entities which resulted in the removal 
of the amounts recoverable from related parties 
(31 December 2013: $11.7 million).
The outstanding balance of $6.4 million (2013: 
$5.4 million) represents the amount owed to 
the Group by the Kazakhstan authorities for 
recoverable VAT. The amount has been audited by 
the tax authorities on a number of occasions. The 
conclusion from the authority’s audit work was 
that the VAT amount claimed has been determined 
correctly and was supported by the required 
documentary evidence. Despite this, the amount 
remained unpaid as at 31 December 2014. 
The Group is working closely with its advisors and 
local partners to recover the outstanding VA T. 
The planned means of recovery will be through a 
combination of the local sales of cathode copper to 
effectively offset VA T liabilities and by a successful 
appeal to the authorities. Following an unsuccessful 
appeal in 2014, a further appeal was lodged in 
January 2015 by the local tax advisors and the final 
outcome may not be known for a further 12 months. 
During 2014, 476 tonnes of copper were sold locally 
(2013: 189 tonnes). 
At 31 December 2014, current trade and other 
payables were $4.3 million (31 December 2013: 
$11.9 million). The large decrease is a consequence 
of $8.1 million of 2013 corporate income tax paid 
in April 2014. During 2014, instalment payments 
of $8.5 million were paid towards the 2014 
corporate income tax liability and at 31 December 
2014 approximately $0.8 million remained 
outstanding. The deferred tax liability has increased 
to $20.6 million (31 December 2013: $9.7 million) 
and this relates primarily to the completion of the 
Kounrad transaction during 2014. 
Significant changes to equity occurred during the 
period as a direct consequence of the completion 
of the Kounrad transaction and the subsequent 
issue of 21,211,751 Ordinary Shares to Mr Kenges 
Rakishev on 23 May 2014 as consideration for 
the transaction. On 23 July 2014 the Company 
allotted and issued 3,500,000 Ordinary Shares to 
the trustee of the Central Asia Metals Limited Share 
Trust (the Employee Benefit Trust).  CENTRAL ASIA MET ALS PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014

Cash Flows
During the year the Group generated $47.2 million 
(2013: $41.1 million) from operations which resulted 
in the Group’s cash balances increasing to $46.3 
million (2013: $44.5 million) as at 31 December 
2014. 
The return of $17.9 million of funds (2013: 
$19.7 million) to shareholders through dividends 
was the main outflow of cash during the year 
within the Group.
As mentioned previously, $16.6 million of 
corporate income tax was paid during 2014.  
This included $8.1 million of 2013 corporate 
income tax paid in April 2014 and payments of 
$8.5 million towards the 2014 corporate income 
tax liability. 
The Group purchased property, plant and 
equipment of $11.0 million (2013: $2.5 million) 
of which $1.4 million (2013: nil) was in relation to 
the commissioning of the boiler at Kounrad and 
$8.0 million (2013: nil) in relation to the Stage 
1 SX-EW expansion programme. The remaining 
balance of $1.6 million (2013: $2.5 million) was in 
relation to sustaining capex at Kounrad.
Foreign Exchange
The Group operates overseas and is exposed to 
foreign currency movements. During 2014, the 
Kazakhstan T enge devalued by almost 20%. Given 
that the Group’s operations in Kazakhstan generate 
their income in US dollars through the export of 
copper, the immediate impact of the devaluation 
in 2014 and of any future devaluation should be 
positive in relation to the Group’s cost base in 
Kazakhstan. It is estimated that approximately 60% 
of the cost base in Kazakhstan is denominated in 
Kazakhstan T enge. 
The Board will continue to monitor the situation and 
respond accordingly should a further devaluation 
occur. During 2014 the Board’s response was to 
increase salaries for staff in the country by 10%. 
The Group does not keep large amounts of cash in 
Kazakhstan T enge and as at 31 December 2014  
held the US dollar equivalent of $0.4 million (2013: 
$0.6 million). During 2014, the Group reported a 
$1.9 million foreign exchange gain (2013: $0.2 
million), relating to the transactional gains of foreign 
currency assets and liabilities at the reporting date. 
Copper Price 
During 2014, the copper price came under 
pressure and fell by 18% over the course of the 
year. Indeed, this reduction in copper prices was 
exacerbated in early January 2015 by a further 
reduction in copper prices. Despite these reductions, 
the Group remains profitable due to the low costs 
of production at Kounrad.
The Group policy has always been to sell 
the copper at ‘spot’ prices in line with the 
contractual conditions associated with the offtake 
arrangements. A review of this policy during the 
year by the Board concluded that, whilst such 
an approach is still felt to be appropriate for the 
Group due to the lack of any debt financing and 
the low costs of production, the ability of the 
management team to respond to movements in 
the copper price was considered appropriate.
Consequently, the Board has approved a minor 
change to the Group’s Treasury policy that allows 
limited hedging up to a maximum of 30% of the 
Group’s rolling 12 month production. It is felt that 
this policy would allow management to combine 
the benefits of an exposure to the copper price for 
its shareholders whilst also facilitating the ability 
for management to put in place limited hedging to 
cover the cost base.
As at the time of writing this report no hedges 
were in place. 
Dividend 
As part of these annual results, the Board 
has the intention to propose a 7.5 pence per 
Ordinary Share final dividend for 2014, making 
a total dividend for the year of 12.5 pence 
(2013: 9 pence). Having raised $60 million at 
IPO in September 2010, this latest dividend will 
increase the amount returned to shareholders in 
dividends and share buy backs since the listing to 
approximately $53 million. 
The Company’s dividend policy is that it will 
return a minimum of 20% of the attributable 
revenues generated from the Kounrad project 
to shareholders. During 2014, inclusive of the 
proposed 2014 final dividend, the Company 
returned 28% of attributable revenues to 
shareholders (2013: 29%). 
The Directors recognise that there are currently 
insufficient reserves available in the Company for 
distribution and are proposing to rectify this by 
completing a court approved capital reduction 
scheme by cancelling the Company’s share 
premium account and transferring such reserves 
to retained earnings. This process is expected to 
become effective on or around 13 May 2015. The 
Company undertook a previous capital reduction 
scheme in 2013. On completion of the capital 
reduction scheme it is expected that the 2014 
final dividend will be paid in June 2015.
Financing Growth
The total capital cost for the Kounrad expansion 
is estimated at $35 million phased over the next 
three years, including approximately $9.4 million 
already spent up to 31 December 2014. This 
expenditure is in addition to the estimated $6.5 
million that will be spent on sustaining capital 
expenditure for the plant and Kounrad site during 
the three-year period. 
As at 31 December 2014, the Group had $46.3 
million of cash in the bank of which $33.6 
million was held in London and $12.7 million in 
Kazakhstan to cover the expansion costs and 
working capital requirements in country and 
instalment payments of Corporate Income T ax.
 
The Group has no debts outstanding as at 31 
December 2014 and with the cash reserves at its 
disposal is confident that it has sufficient funds 
available to finance the dividend policy in the 
coming years, complete the capital expansion 
plans at Kounrad and provide the Company with 
the financial flexibility to support the growth of 
the business.

in Kazakhstan. This project currently generates 100 % of CAML’s 
revenue and employs 95 %of its staff.
Corporate Social Responsibility 
Overview
The primary focus of CAML’s CSR activity is at 
the Kounrad project in Kazakhstan. This project 
currently generates 100% of CAML’s revenue and 
employs 95% of the staff. Given the importance 
the CAML Board attaches to its CSR activity in 
the Group’s operations, the CSR Director, Nick 
Shirley, has been based on site at Kounrad since 
July 2013.
Having established himself in the role, the main 
priority for the CSR Director and his site based 
team during 2014 has been the continued 
integration of the Group CSR policies and 
initiatives into the day to day activities on 
site at Kounrad. The aim has been to raise the 
environmental profile and awareness in all CAML 
activities at Kounrad, maintain positive and 
constructive working relations with all the local 
and national stakeholders and communities 
whilst also ensuring the continual improvement 
of all the health and safety aspects of running an 
operational mine and processing facility.
Whilst the focus has clearly been on Kounrad, 
the CSR activities associated with the Group’s 
development project at Copper Bay, Chile and 
amongst its UK workforce are also the subject of 
regular review. 
The CSR Committee, comprising of Executive 
and Non-Executive Directors of CAML, meet on 
a quarterly basis to discuss and review progress 
with regards to the various CSR initiatives being 
conducted across the Group. The main objectives 
for 2014 were to ensure local compliance with 
all the relevant Kazakhstan health and safety, 
environmental and social standards. Whilst 
this is an essential starting point for the local 
operations at Kounrad, the Group also prides 
itself in attempting to implement and adhere to 
international CSR standards for the mining sector. 
This is not always possible but the CSR team have 
endeavoured to implement the recommendations 
from the various internal and external audits 
and inspections undertaken at Kounrad during 
2013 and 2014. 
These audits and inspections were instigated by 
the CSR Committee following internal appraisals 
based on a desire to continually improve CSR 
activities across the Group and more particularly 
in the short term at Kounrad. As a result, a series 
of objectives and targets were agreed for CSR 
activity at Kounrad and positive progress has been 
made over the course of the year in their delivery.

Health and Safety 
CAML are committed to the health and safety of 
its workforce, contractors and visitors. During 2014 
the number of safety engineers responsible for the 
day to day safety on site was increased from two to 
four as construction activities commenced for the 
expansion of the Kounrad plant facility. The safety 
engineers are firmly embedded within the onsite 
project team and work closely with them to ensure 
that safety risks are identified, incidents and near 
misses reported, and action taken immediately to 
ensure that these are rectified where possible. 
There is currently a combined workforce on site of 
approximately 330 personnel including contractors 
and during 2014 some 400,000 man-hours were 
worked with no lost time injuries. As a result of 
one lost time accident that occurred in June 2014, 
Kounrad Copper Company LLP unfortunately 
lost their cumulative safety record which was 
approaching one million injury free hours at the 
date of the accident and were subsequently 
reset to zero. T aking this into consideration the 
combined accident free hours worked for both 
local companies, since 2010, now totals 685,000 
man-hours.
There was a significant emphasis in the further 
development of the safety management 
system during 2014 particularly with regards to 
identifying risks within the workplace.  
Risks identified were of widely ranging levels of 
significance, against which mitigation measures 
were developed and implemented to reduce risk. 
In addition to the safety team, the Group employs 
an independent fire and rescue team which has 
a full time presence on site with a dedicated fire 
fighting tender. The Kounrad Project also has, 
Supporting  
traditional festivals
on site, a clinic staffed by 5 qualified nurses on a 
permanent basis, 24 hours a day. In the event of 
a medical emergency there is an ambulance and 
dedicated driver on standby. 
As in the previous year a significant number of 
training courses were undertaken in 2014 both for 
the workforce and the safety engineers themselves, 
including the identification and reporting of near 
miss incidents in order to minimise the risk of 
a potentially more serious accident occurring. 
Similarly, in the drive for continual improvement 
external training was also provided.
In 2014 CAML’s safety systems were audited 
to determine compliance to national and 
international safety systems. In addition, a 
number of safety initiatives were introduced 
during 2014. These included an award for the 
best safety improvement suggestion which has 
proved to be successful amongst the employees. 
All suggestions are reviewed on a quarterly basis 
by a dedicated committee consisting of the senior 
management team and an award is given for the 
best safety suggestion. 
During the year there has also been a drive to 
determine where working conditions of employees 
can be improved. One of the most significant of 
these has been with regards to reducing the levels 
of acid mist in the EW workshop by improving the 
ventilation and mist suppressant systems.  CENTRAL ASIA MET ALS PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014

DELIVERING TO 
OUR COMMUNITIES
Protecting the Environment 
Protecting the environment at the Kounrad 
site is one of the key priorities for the Group. 
Consequently, the Company committed 
significant resources both in terms of finance 
and additional manpower to undertake its 
environmental activities. 
Throughout the year there was continual 
emphasis on the inspection and control of 
site activities and this resulted in there being 
no environmental incidents to report. The 
environment team is now fully integrated within 
the site operations team and this makes for better 
coordination of effort and assessment of risk.
Environmental management systems were further 
developed during the year. These management 
systems and independent audits, together 
with the environmental inductions given to 
all employees and contractors when they first 
visit the site, help to minimise the risk of an 
environmental incident on site. They also ensure 
that environmental issues are considered at every 
stage in the Kounrad project development. 
During 2014, CAML appointed SRK Consulting 
to undertake a detailed hydrogeological and 
geochemical analysis of the Eastern dump 
leaching operation. As part of this study a series of 
bench and field trials were initiated to determine 
the absorption and retardation potential of PLS 
species in groundwater. This report was part of a 
wider study costing over $200,000 to investigate 
the potential mitigation measures that could 
be implemented in the possible event of the 
migration of PLS beyond the cut-off trench. 
On site, 120 boreholes are regularly monitored 
with regards to groundwater levels and quality. 
As can be seen from the below diagram, in excess 
of 100 boreholes are located in three ‘protection’ 
rings at distances of 50m, 100m and 300m 
respectively from the main PLS collector trench. 
These boreholes enable the environment team to 
both monitor the groundwater conditions and also 
to extract solutions should any measurements 
indicate a higher than acceptable level of any 
deleterious materials. There is an intensive 
monitoring programme on site with our own 
dedicated team and also external independent 
contractors monitoring and controlling samples 
taken from the boreholes.
Further studies in 2014 included a review and 
update of the water balance for the Eastern dump 
area which concluded that the total estimated 
recovery of PLS from the leaching process is in the 
order of 99%. 
At the Western dump area, increased 
environmental monitoring was undertaken 
throughout the year and a further programme 
of site investigations will be undertaken in 2015 
to ensure suitable baseline information prior 
to commencing leach operations in 2017. In 
addition, the Group obtained approval for the 
Kazakhstan Environmental Impact Assessment 
on the Western dumps. This approval is part 
of the overall project documentation required 
prior to commencing leaching operations. It is 
expected that the overall project will be approved 
by the Ministry of Investment and Development 
in Q2 2015.

Serving the Community 
The Board places a high degree of importance on 
the Group’s local interaction with the community 
and stakeholders wherever it has operations. 
The Company feels that it has built strong 
relationships over the past 7 years with the local 
community and stakeholders in the neighbouring 
towns of Kounrad and Balkhash.  
The Company is also active regionally and 
nationally in sponsoring and supporting a wide 
variety of meetings and conferences across 
Kazakhstan associated with the mining industry.
As a consequence of the Group’s successful 
business at Kounrad, there are often requests 
for site visits from both politicians and local 
community groups. These site visits are welcomed 
by the Kounrad staff as an opportunity to 
highlight the valuable contribution that the 
Kounrad operation has made to the region both 
in terms of local employment opportunities 
and productivity. It is also an opportunity to 
emphasise the importance the Company attaches 
to the protection of the local environment.
During 2014, CAML continued to provide social 
donations to the local community with an emphasis 
on health and education. Key projects funded by 
CAML in 2014 included the extensive renovation 
of the sports hall for one of the schools in the 
neighbouring Kounrad village and the provision 
of cardiological equipment for the medical centre 
in Kounrad. Funds were also contributed towards 
enabling a group of foster children to participate in a 
sporting competition in the republic of Georgia.
In late 2014, the Group responded extremely 
quickly to an urgent request from the local Akim to 
provide financial assistance towards the emergency 
repair of the boilers that supply hot water and 
heating to every household in the Kounrad village. 
Taxation and Employment 
In addition to the various local social contributions 
that the Group makes, CAML also pays significant 
taxation in Kazakhstan. Since production 
commenced in 2012, CAML has contributed 
$49.8 million in taxation to the government of the 
republic of Kazakhstan. 
The Kounrad operation currently employs 
approximately 330 people on site inclusive of 
construction staff and is a major employer in the 
local area. Only two members of the full time 
staff at Kounrad have been recruited outside of 
Kazakhstan to provide specific skills and to train 
local personnel as replacements in due course. 
The Group is keen to invest in its own people and 
in addition to the ongoing training conducted by 
the various parts of the business, an educational 
sponsorship scheme has been running for two years 
now. Key staff are encouraged by their local 
managers to apply for the scheme which is aimed 
at developing the best managerial talent within 
CAML. Two of those so far selected are undergoing 
a two year internationally recognised MBA course 
financed by the Company with the intention that 
such staff are then better qualified to meet the 
future management requirements of CAML.

PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERT AINTIES
PRINCIP AL RISKS  
AND UNCERT AINTIES
Nature and impact of risk How we manage the risk
Operational
Leaching Operations – Production
The nature of in-situ leaching means that it is difficult 
to manage the grade and flow of the copper bearing 
solution coming off the dumps at Kounrad. Should the 
flow and/or grade drop, this would lead to a reduction 
in copper cathodes produced.
The Group has conducted extensive testing on the grades and expected recovery of the copper bearing 
solution from the Kounrad dumps. The testing to date has correlated well with the production statistics and 
management have no reason to believe that this correlation will not continue with future operations.
CAML also utilises the services of consultants to regularly review leaching performance and advise on 
operating strategy.
SX-EW Operations
The SX-EW operations have a number of critical 
components, the loss of any one may have a significant 
impact on the production of copper cathodes. 
Interruption to the electricity supply and a failure of the 
rectifier are the biggest risks to continuing operations. 
The loss of other critical components would likely not 
stop operations, but would have an impact on the 
quantity and quality of the copper cathodes produced.
Senior management have completed a review of the critical components of the Kounrad SX-EW facility.  
Where deemed necessary, specific mitigation procedures have been implemented.
The loss of the rectifier would cause long term interruption to copper production. As part of the expansion 
programme a second identical rectifier is being installed. This will ensure that the majority of copper cathode 
production capacity will be maintained upon the loss of a rectifier.
Upon an event of mains power loss; generator capability and secondary power connections have been 
installed to ensure that no damage occurs to the SX-EW facility.
Fire
The SX operations of the Kounrad facility have a 
significant risk of fire due to the materials used in the 
extraction of copper. A fire resulting in the loss of the 
SX facility would interrupt operations for 9-12 months.
A comprehensive fire detection and fighting system has been installed at the Kounrad operations to mitigate 
any fires which break out. Business interruption insurance has been taken out to mitigate the majority of loss 
from a fire event.
Safety, Social and Environmental 
Safety of Employees
The nature of the Group’s operations are inherently 
dangerous. Management place a high priority on the 
health and safety of the Group’s employees, however 
an incident involving the health of an employee is 
always possible which may have a material impact on 
the operations.
The Group’s emphasis on safety is prioritised above all other factors of the business. The establishment of a 
CSR Committee of the Board and the appointment of a CSR Director situated in Kazakhstan at the operations 
shows the commitment of the Group to health and safety.
Assessment of all health and safety risks is ongoing and new equipment go through a risk assessment prior 
to operational use. Operational staff are incentivised to maintain a safe working environment and to utilise 
safe working practises. Occupational environments are continually being assessed to improve the working 
conditions of staff.
An anonymous whistle blowing hotline is available to staff to report unsafe working practises without fear of 
retribution.
Leaching Operations – Environment
The Group’s in-situ leaching operations at Kounrad 
must be carefully managed to ensure that the 
impact of leaching operations with the environment 
is kept to a minimum. A breach of local environmental 
laws may result in the withdrawal of permits to 
operate or the cancellation of the Group’s SUC.
Environmental risk management is given a high profile and is constantly managed by the locally based CSR 
Director, the CEO, the T echnical Director and the CFO. The Group also engages specialist internationally 
renowned consultants to ensure that best practices are employed at the Kounrad site.
Baseline monitoring is carried out in any new areas prior to operations and ongoing monitoring through 
120 boreholes is conducted. If any results are outside normal ranges, senior management is immediately 
informed so that assessment and mitigation procedures can be put in place.
The Board of Directors has ultimate responsibility 
for risk management, but Group staff have a role 
to play in the implementation of policies and 
procedures aligned to mitigate and manage risk.  
In 2015, a Risk Committee was formed consisting 
of senior staff to assist Group staff in the 
identification, analysis, mitigation and review of the 
risks of the business. The Risk Committee will report 
into the Board, on a regular basis, the current risk 
assessment of the business.
Risk assessment begins with the identification 
of risk of the business. This may be through the 
development of a business plan, where operating 
procedures have been modified or where new 
equipment is brought into operation. Risks are 
assessed against the likelihood of the risk event 
occurring and the impact/severity of the risk event. 
Likelihood criteria is ranked from “conceivable” 
through to “highly likely” and impact/severity 
is assessed from “insignificant” through to 
“catastrophic”. 
The criteria against which a risk is assessed 
has been established by the Group, so that a 
standardised assessment can be obtained. Using 
the assessment this is then categorised into a 
priority level. The priority level of the risk event 
is low, moderate, high or extreme, which assists 
management in determining which risks need 
urgent mitigation. CENTRAL ASIA MET ALS PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014

Nature and impact of risk How we manage the risk
Corporate
Political and Country 
The Group’s main operations are located in 
Kazakhstan, which centralises CAML’s risk on one 
country. The government of Kazakhstan may change 
the laws under which the Group operates which may 
have a material impact on the business. Impacts can 
range from State appropriation of the Group’s SUC to 
increases in taxation or restrictions on the transfer of 
monies outside of Kazakhstan.
The Board believes that the best manner in which to manage country and political risk is to ensure that the 
Group employs personnel who have an in depth understanding of the country and political risks.
There are two Board members who are nationals of Kazakhstan. The executive management of the Company 
have over 42 years of business experience in Kazakhstan. Within Kazakhstan, the local Directors and the 
majority of staff are Kazakhstan nationals.
The Board is assessing opportunities for expanding the Group’s business outside of Kazakhstan which will 
spread country and political risk.
Changes to Key Personnel
The Group has a core of highly experienced and skilled 
senior management who are responsible for the 
development and execution of the Group’s business 
strategy. Any changes to the senior management may 
have a material impact on the success of the business.
The Group operates an incentivisation programme which aims to attract and retain the best possible 
candidates for the position. This includes annually reviewing salaries and benchmarking these against industry 
standards. An annual bonus scheme operates for staff, and senior management are able to receive share 
options as determined by the Remuneration Committee.
The Group also places importance on training current staff through internal and external education 
programmes, so that staff are able to progress through the business and fill any temporary vacancies as 
they arise. The Group also maintains close working relationships with external consultants to ensure that if 
there should be a temporary vacancy in areas which no other staff member can fill the role, that the external 
consultants can ensure minimal impact on the business.
The Group does not maintain key risk insurance as management believes that there are sufficient mitigation 
procedures in place to ensure that any loss of key personnel have a minimum impact on the business.
Corporate Growth
The Group is actively pursuing opportunities to grow 
the business through organic growth or by acquisition. 
Should any growth process turn out to be not as 
expected, it may have a material negative impact on 
the profitability of the business.
An expansion plan at Kounrad to increase capacity of the project to 15,000 tonnes per annum is currently being 
implemented. In order to reduce execution risk, the Board decided to expand the existing facility using the 
same technology and construction techniques rather than build a larger new operation on a greenfield site. The 
expansion plan is currently going through the final stages of construction before commissioning in Q2 2015.
Senior management and the Board have examined a number of opportunities for expansion of the business by 
acquisition. All efforts are being made to complete in depth due diligence on potential projects using in-house staff 
and external consultants to minimise the risk of any new project not performing as expected for the Group.
Financial*
Foreign Exchange
The Group’s presentational currency is US Dollars 
(US$) which is due to historical financing of the 
Group’s operations being in US$, capital expenditure 
being incurred primarily in US$ and sales of copper 
cathodes being largely denominated in US$.
The functional currency of each entity is determined 
by the primary economic environment in which that 
entity operates. The functional currencies of the Group 
include US$, KZT and MNT. The material costs incurred 
by the Group are in KZT, US$, and GBP.
During 2014, the Company mitigated foreign exchange exposure by maintaining a small working capital 
balance in KZT. This was significant as the KZT experienced a 20% devaluation against the US$ in February 
2014. As dividends are paid in GBP, the Company maintains a policy of converting US$ to GBP on the day 
that the dividends are announced.
Commodity Pricing
Our copper cathodes are sold on the basis of 
LME pricing which fluctuates daily. Being a single 
commodity company, copper pricing fluctuation can 
have a material impact on our business. During 2014, 
the Group did not operate any formal hedging pricing 
programme and generally took prices based upon the 
‘spot’ market. Changes in pricing can have a material 
impact on the revenues earned by the Group.
The CAML Group policy has always been to sell the copper at ‘spot’ prices in line with the contractual conditions 
associated with the offtake arrangements. A review of this policy during the year by the Board concluded that, 
whilst such an approach is still felt to be appropriate for the Group due to the lack of any debt financing and 
the low costs of production, the ability of the management team to respond to movements in the copper price 
was considered appropriate. Consequently, the Board has approved a minor change to the Group’s Treasury 
policy that allows limited hedging up to a maximum of 30% of the Group’s rolling 12-month production. It is 
felt that this policy would allow management to combine the benefits of an exposure to the copper price for its 
shareholders whilst also facilitating the ability for management to put in place limited hedging to cover the 
cost base.
*A description of other financial risks that the Group is potentially exposed to are contained in note 3 to the financial statements.
If a risk is categorised as high or extreme, then 
senior management will see that the risk event is 
ceased or that risk reduction measures are put in 
place as soon as possible.
All risks following initial assessment have 
consideration given to mitigation plans in order to 
reduce the risk to an acceptable level as assessed 
by senior management. For those risks which are 
deemed significant, detailed analysis is performed 
to ensure that it is appropriately analysed.
All risks identified are recorded in a register 
which is maintained by senior management. The 
“owner” of a risk is tasked with formally reviewing 
the risk on a regular basis and reporting any 
changes back to senior management.
The following risks have been identified as the 
principal risks within the business. They are not set 
out in any order of priority and do not constitute 
the entire risks to the business.

Introduction from the Chairman
Our Board views good practice in corporate governance as key to our 
business’s success. We believe achievement of that success, on an ongoing 
basis, requires the Group to maintain good governance processes and 
continue to enhance these as the Group develops. The encouragement 
of the entrepreneurial drive that exists in our business within appropriate 
governance structures remains key to the building and ongoing delivery of 
shareholder value over the long term. That continues to be our aim and I am 
pleased to be able to say that it is bearing ongoing positive results.
Although under the AIM rules we are not subject to the recommendations of 
any particular governance code, our Board draws on recommendations on 
corporate governance from the Quoted Companies Alliance and on the UK 
Corporate Governance Code in the way it is constituted and operates. Whilst 
compliance with these codes in our case is not mandatory, we do implement 
the recommendations which we feel are appropriate for a company of our 
size and type. This enriches our decision making and helps inform inputs to 
strategy and the monitoring of performance both at our regular meetings 
and otherwise as appropriate through the year. It has the support of our 
Executive and Non-Executive Directors alike.
We are fortunate to have a diverse, talented and committed group of 
Executive and Non-Executive Directors. Our Executive Directors are led by 
Nick Clarke, our Chief Executive Officer, and also include Nigel Robinson, our 
Chief Financial Officer and Howard Nicholson, our T echnical Director. They 
each have great experience in their respective areas of expertise and work 
well as a team and as part of the wider Board.
We are also fortunate to be able to draw on the wide experience of David 
Swan, a Chartered Accountant by background who has broad commercial 
experience across a range of companies; and Robert Cathery who is highly 
experienced in both the resources sector and public markets generally. 
They both bring valuable and diverse perspectives and make significant, 
constructive and independent contributions to our Board.
In addition, we were delighted to appoint to the Board Nurlan Zhakupov in 
2011 and, in conjunction with his transaction with the Company, Kenges 
Rakishev in December 2013. They are both nationals of Kazakhstan where 
our principal operations are based. They provide great local insight as well as 
adding to the overall diversity and different perspectives of the Board.
This international representation contributes to what I believe to be a 
suitably diverse Board. Among them, our Directors have long and valuable 
experience in the mining industry, financial and operational aspects 
of businesses, and publicly quoted companies, operating in different 
geographies around the world. Whilst we recognise the emphasis over recent 
years on gender diversity, we also believe in recruiting the best available 
individual for particular roles. Although our Board is currently comprised solely 
of men, we hope the opportunity will arise in future to appoint women to  
the Board.
Where appropriate, and where there are initially differing views amongst 
Directors, our Board engages in debates that are always constructive 
and sometimes lively. This allows decisions to be reached, following full 
consideration of all views around the table, by consensus. These debates are 
informed by comprehensive reports from each of the Executive Directors and 
by external input for example from the Company’s financial advisors when 
considered appropriate.
We have active Audit, CSR and Remuneration Committees which allow 
different forums for more detailed discussions on matters within their 
terms of reference. These discussions are reported to the full Board where 
they are considered further as appropriate. Our Remuneration Committee 
meets without the Executive Directors present to discuss their remuneration. 
Our Audit Committee meets with the external auditors in the absence of 
management at least once per year.
Of course, the success of our business depends on the great people we 
are fortunate to have working in our operations on a day to day basis. Our 
Executive Directors are regularly on site in Kazakhstan and I and other 
Non-Executive Directors have visited the operations to meet with local 
management. Aside from being an important part of the Board’s role, it is 
always most enjoyable to see the quality of people producing such a high 
standard of operation in our business.
On the following pages are more details of our individual Directors, our Board 
and its Committees. I hope this review of governance provides insight for 
shareholders to the importance my fellow Directors and I place on how the 
Company is governed on their behalf.

GOVERNANCE
Board Role and Effectiveness
The Board of Directors comprises three Executive Directors and  
five Non-Executive Directors. The Board considers that all the Non-Executive 
Directors, other than Kenges Rakishev, are fully independent. Although 
Kenges Rakishev is not considered fully independent due to his substantial 
shareholding in the Company, he is considered otherwise independent 
including independent of management. A summary of certain terms of the 
relationship agreement he has entered into with the Company is included 
later in this report. Consequently, the Directors are of the opinion that the 
Board comprises a suitable balance of Executive and independent Directors.
The Board, through the Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors as well 
as the Executive Directors, maintains regular contact with its investors and 
analysts and seeks to ensure that it develops an understanding of the views 
of major shareholders about the Company.
The Board meets regularly throughout the year and is responsible for 
reviewing and approving the Company’s strategy and monitoring its financial 
activities and operating performance. Day to day management is delegated 
to the three Executive Directors who consult the wider Board on significant 
matters. Consequently, decisions are made promptly following consultation 
amongst the Directors concerned where necessary and appropriate.
All necessary information is supplied to the Directors on a timely basis to 
enable them to discharge their duties effectively and all Directors have access 
to independent professional advice at the Company’s expense, as and when 
required.
The Chairman is available to meet with institutional shareholders to discuss 
any issues and concerns regarding the CAML’s governance. The participation 
of the private and institutional investors at the Annual General Meeting is 
welcomed by the Board.
Relationship Agreement
Kenges Rakishev has entered into a relationship agreement with the 
Company due to his position as a Board member and significant shareholder 
to ensure that transactions entered into between any member of the Group 
and Kenges Rakishev, or any of his associates, are conducted on an arm’s 
length basis and on normal commercial terms.
Mr Rakishev has given certain undertakings, including, to exercise his voting 
rights, insofar as he is able, as a shareholder and as a Board member 
to: (1) ensure that no variations are made to the Company’s Articles of 
Association which would be contrary to the maintenance of the Company’s 
independence; (2) that transactions between Kenges Rakishev (and his 
associates) are made on an arm’s length basis and on, in the Company’s 
opinion, normal commercial terms; and (3) that the Company will make 
decisions for the benefit of shareholders of the Company as a whole and not 
solely for the benefit of Kenges Rakishev.
Internal Controls
The Directors acknowledge their responsibility for the Company’s and the 
Group’s systems of internal controls, which are designed to safeguard the 
assets of the Group and ensure the reliability of financial information for both 
internal use and external publication. Overall control is achieved by a regular 
detailed reporting system covering both technical progress of a project and 
the state of the Group’s financial affairs.
Any system of internal controls can provide only reasonable, and not 
absolute, assurance that material financial irregularities will be detected  
or that the risk of failure to achieve business objectives is eliminated. 
The Directors consider that the system of internal controls operated 
effectively throughout the financial year and up to the date the financial 
statements were signed.
Based on the size and complexity of the Group, the Board of Directors does 
not consider that there is a need for an internal audit function.
Committees
The Board has specific Audit, CSR and Remuneration Committees covering 
three of the areas of the Group’s operation which the Board views as having 
key importance to the Group’s stakeholders. Each of these Committees have 
their own terms of reference which provide the necessary authorities for them 
to operate as they consider appropriate.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises David Swan, Chairman, and Nigel Hurst-
Brown, both of whom are considered independent Directors. David assumed 
the role of Chairman of the Committee when he joined the Board in June 
2014 when the previous Chairman, Dr Michael Price stepped down. All 
members attended all Committee meetings that took place while they were 
members. The Audit Committee’s primary responsibilities are to review the 
effectiveness of the Company’s systems of internal controls, to review with 
the external auditors the nature and scope of their audit and the results 
of the audit, and to evaluate and select external auditors and ensure their 
independence and objectivity.
In accordance with its terms of reference, the Audit Committee held 
meetings during the year with the auditors to review the plans for, and the 
results of the audit of the 2014 accounts. The Chief Financial Officer and 
a representative of the external auditors are normally invited to attend the 
Committee’s meetings. Other Directors, staff and representatives of the 
external auditors may be invited to attend as considered beneficial by the 
Committee.
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Committee
The Company has always been keenly focused on ensuring that the 
environmental and social aspects of its operations are managed to the 
highest possible standards. In recognition of this responsibility, a CSR 
Committee was established by the CAML Board in June 2012. The CSR 
Committee comprises Howard Nicholson, Chairman, David Swan and Nurlan 
Zhakupov. The CSR Committee is tasked with overseeing CSR activities across 
the Group, further details of which are found on pages 26 to 29.
A Group CSR policy has been developed and a copy of it can be found on the 
CAML website at www.centralasiametals.com.
Given the importance which the Group places in this area, the Committee 
meets on a regular basis throughout the year on the same days as most main 
Board meetings. At its meetings, it reviews environmental, health and safety 
and local community related matters. In doing so, it considers reports both 
from Group and local management and from external experts and advisors. 
Matters of particular significance are then also reported to the Board.

Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises Robert Cathery, Chairman, Nigel 
Hurst-Brown and David Swan, all of whom are considered independent Non-
Executive Directors. Robert assumed the role of Chairman of the Committee 
when the previous Chairman, Dr Michael Price stepped down in June 2014. 
All members attended all Committee meetings that took place while they 
were members. The Remuneration Committee reviews the performance of 
the Executive Directors and sets the scale and structure of their remuneration 
and the basis of their service agreements with due regard to the interests of 
shareholders.
In determining the remuneration of Executive Directors, the Remuneration 
Committee seeks to enable the Company to attract and retain executives 
of the highest calibre. The Remuneration Committee also reviews the 
remuneration of other senior management. In addition, it decides whether to 
grant share awards in the Company and, if these are to be granted, who the 
recipients should be.
Under the Company’s share option schemes, nominal priced share options 
have been granted to the Executive Directors during the year as shown in 
note 35 of the financial statements. The shares will generally vest one third 
each year after the date of grant subject to the achievement of performance 
conditions to which the awards are subject. For the awards granted in 
October 2014, the vesting period commences in relation to one-third per 
annum commencing in March 2015 to fit with the Company’s ongoing 
award grant calendar, these being the annual awards in relation to 2014. 
The Company’s policy is to remunerate senior executives fairly in such 
a manner as to facilitate the recruitment, retention and motivation of 
staff. The Remuneration Committee agrees with the Board a framework 
for the remuneration of Executive Directors and senior management of 
the Company. The principal objectives of the Committee are to ensure 
that Executive Directors and members of the senior management of the 
Company are provided incentives to encourage enhanced performance 
and are, in a fair and responsible manner, rewarded for their individual 
contributions to the success of the Company.
Non-Executive Director fees are considered and agreed by the Board 
(excluding the Non-Executive Directors) with no Director participating in any 
decision relating to his own remuneration.
During the year the Remuneration Committee (in relation to the Executive 
Directors) and the Board excluding the Non-Executive Directors in relation 
to the Non-Executive Directors conducted comprehensive benchmarking 
exercises of remuneration in the Company. These were performed in the 
context of the very significant development of the Company over past years 
to ensure that Directors are fairly and not excessively remunerated. This 
included reviews of remuneration for similar roles in comparable companies 
and advice from specialist remuneration advisors.
In line with the results of these remuneration reviews and advice, the  
salaries and fees set out in the Directors’ Report on page 39 took effect  
from 1 January 2015. 
In addition, and as part of the overall remuneration review, the Remuneration 
Committee determined that it was appropriate for Executive Directors to 
continue to receive annual bonuses of up to 100% of salary and to receive 
LTIP awards over shares equivalent in value to up to 100% of salary subject 
in both cases to challenging performance measures.
Nominations Committee
The Directors are of the opinion that, given the size of the Company, there 
is no requirement for a separate Nominations Committee. Accordingly the 
Board takes on this responsibility as and when required.
Risk management
The effective management of risk is critical to the growth and profitability 
of the Group. The Group is exposed to a number of risks within its business 
and has a structured approach to identifying, analysing, managing and 
monitoring such risks. The principal risks and uncertainties are discussed in 
more detail on pages 30 to 31.

DIRECTORS’  
REPORT
The Directors present their report and the audited consolidated financial 
statements for the year ended 31 December 2014.
Details of significant events since the balance sheet date are contained in 
note 34 to the financial statements. 
Principal activities
Central Asia Metals plc (“CAML” or “the Company”) is the holding Company 
for a group of Companies (the “Group”) engaged in:
 ▲ the processing and subsequent production of copper cathodes, from 
secondary mining techniques;
 ▲ the identification, acquisition and development of base and precious 
metals deposits primarily in the Central Asia region but also worldwide.
CAML is domiciled and incorporated in the UK with the registration number 
5559627 and the registered office is: Masters House, 107 Hammersmith 
Road, London, W14 0QH, United Kingdom. 
Review of business
A review of the current and future development of the Group’s business is 
given in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 31 which forms part of, and by 
reference is incorporated in, this Directors’ Report.
Financial risk management has been assessed within note 3 to the financial 
statements.
Proposed Capital Reduction and Dividends
The Company’s dividend policy is that an annual dividend will be paid by the 
Company based on a minimum of 20% of the attributable revenues earned 
from its SX-EW copper project at Kounrad, Kazakhstan. The payments will be 
made by means of an interim and final dividend subject to the Company’s 
cash reserves providing a dividend cover of three times or greater.
During 2014, the final 2013 dividend of 5.0 pence per Ordinary Share of 
$0.01 each (“Share”) was paid on 20 June 2014 and an interim dividend of 
5.0 pence per Share was paid on 31 October 2014.
The Directors intend to propose a final dividend for 2014 of 7.5 pence per 
Share subject to shareholder approval and to the proposed capital reduction. 
This will take the total dividend for 2014 to 12.5 pence per Share. The 
Directors recognise that there are currently insufficient reserves available in 
the Company for distribution and are proposing to rectify this by completing 
a court approved capital reduction scheme by cancelling the Company’s 
share premium account and transferring such reserves to retained earnings. 
This process is expected to become effective on or around 13 May 2015  
after which shareholder approval of the dividend intended to be proposed 
will be sought. The Company undertook a previous capital reduction scheme 
in 2013.
In September 2013 the Company declared dividends amounting to $5.3 
million. Although the Company had sufficient distributable reserves to make 
the dividend payments, the relevant interim accounts had not been filed 
with the Registrar of Companies as required. Consequently payment of the 
dividends was a technical infringement of the Companies Act 2006.
The Directors will propose at the upcoming AGM to appropriate distributable 
profits of the Company to these payments of dividends and to release 
the relevant shareholders from any claims that the Company may have in 
relation to such payments. These financial statements have been drawn 
up on the basis that the technical infringement described above has been 
regularised in the manner described.

be appointed at the AGM. D Swan was appointed a Director by the Board 
since last year’s AGM and accordingly retires and is being proposed for

The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have prepared the Group and parent 
Company financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. Under company 
law, the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and 
the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to:
 ▲ select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 ▲ make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
 ▲ state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European Union have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the 
financial statements; and
 ▲ prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with 
the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE 
MEMBERS OF CENTRAL ASIA MET ALS PLC
Report on the Financial Statements
Our Opinion
In our opinion:
 ▲ Central Asia Metals plc’s Group financial statements and Company financial statements (the “financial statements”) give a true and fair view of the state of 
the Group’s and of the Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2014 and of the Group’s profit and the Group’s and the Company’s cash flows for the year 
then ended;
 ▲ the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the 
European Union;
 ▲ the Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and as applied in accordance 
with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
 ▲ the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
What we have audited
Central Asia Metals plc’s financial statements comprise:
 ▲ the Statements of Financial Position as at 31 December 2014;
 ▲ the Consolidated Income Statement and Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for the year then ended;
 ▲ the Statements of Cash Flows for the year then ended;
 ▲ the Consolidated and Company Statement of Changes in Equity for the year then ended; and
 ▲ the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the financial statements is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union and, as regards the Company financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
In applying the financial reporting framework, the Directors have made a number of subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting 
estimates. In making such estimates, they have made assumptions and considered future events.
Opinion on Other Matter Prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the financial statements.
Other Matters on Which we are Required to Report by Exception
Adequacy of Accounting Records and Information and Explanations Received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 ▲ we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
 ▲ adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by 
us; or
 ▲ the Company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Directors’ Remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, certain disclosures of Directors’ Remuneration specified by law are not made.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Responsibilities for the Financial Statements and the Audit
Our Responsibilities and those of the Directors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities set out on page 41, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other 
person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing. CENTRAL ASIA MET ALS PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014

What an Audit of Financial Statements Involves
We conducted our audit in accordance with ISAs (UK & Ireland). An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This 
includes an assessment of: 
 ▲ whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; 
 ▲ the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and
 ▲ the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the Directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming our own judgements, and evaluating the 
disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide a reasonable basis for us to 
draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures or a combination of both.
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report and Accounts to identify material inconsistencies with the audited 
financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired 
by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for 
our report.

1. General information
Central Asia Metals plc (CAML or the Company) and its subsidiaries (the Group) are a mining and exploration organisation with operations 
primarily in Kazakhstan and a parent holding company based in the United Kingdom.
The Group’s principal business activity is the production of copper cathode at its Kounrad operations in Kazakhstan. The Group also owns various 
exploration projects in Mongolia which are held for sale and has an investment in a copper tailings project in Chile.
CAML is a public limited company, which is listed on AIM and incorporated and domiciled in the UK. The address of its registered office is 
Masters House, 107 Hammersmith Road, London, W14 0QH. The Company’s registered number is 5559627.
2. Summary of significant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below. These policies have 
been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of Preparation
The Group’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting standards (IFRS) and 
IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRSIC) interpretations as adopted by the European Union, and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to 
companies reporting under IFRS. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention with the 
exception of assets held for sale which have been held at fair value. The accounting policies which follow set out those policies which apply in 
preparing the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2014. The Group financial statements are presented in US dollars ($) and 
rounded to the nearest thousand.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires 
management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of 
judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are explained in 
note 4.
Comparative results
The Group commenced production of copper cathodes on 30 April 2012. The cathodes are produced by the SX-EW plant at Kounrad which is 
owned and operated by Kounrad Copper Company LLP (KCC). On 21 October 2013, the ownership of KCC increased from 60% to 100% 
following the acquisition of 40% of KCC. Consequently, the comparative results for the year ended 31 December 2013 comprise only 60% of the 
revenues and costs associated with the Kounrad project for the first nine months of the year but 100% for the final three months of the year. In 
contrast, the results for the year ended 31 December 2014 account for 100% of the revenue and costs associated with the Kounrad project 
throughout the year. 
The impact of the above event makes annual comparisons difficult from the annually reported numbers in several of the notes to the financial 
statements. A more meaningful analysis of the reported revenues and costs can be obtained from the Strategic Report on page 23.
Going concern
The Group meets its day-to-day working capital requirements though its profitable operations at Kounrad. The Group has substantial cash 
balances as at 31 December 2014 and on the date of issue of these financial statements. The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the 
Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the forseeable future. 
The Group sells and distributes its copper cathode product primarily through an offtake arrangement with 90% of the SX-EW plant’s output 
committed as sales for the period up until 31 December 2015. 
The Group therefore continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing its consolidated financial statements. Please refer to notes 6, 23 
and 27 for information on the Group’s revenues, cash balances and trade and other payables.
• New and amended standards and interpretations adopted by the Group.
The following standards have been adopted by the Group for the first time for the financial year beginning on or after 1 January 2014:
Amendments to IAS 32 ‘Financial Instruments: Presentation’ and IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’, clarifying the requirements for 
offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities on balance sheet. The standard does not have a material impact on the Group.
Amendment to IAS 39, ‘Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement’ on the novation of derivatives and the continuation of hedge 
accounting. This amendment considers legislative changes to ‘over-the-counter’ derivatives and the establishment of central counterparties. 
Under IAS 39 novation of derivatives to central counterparties would result in discontinuance of hedge accounting. The amendment provides 
relief from discontinuing hedge accounting when novation of a hedging instrument meets specified criteria. The Group has applied the 
amendment and there has been no significant impact on the Group financial statements as a result.

IFRIC 21, ‘Levies’, sets out the accounting for an obligation to pay a levy that is not income tax. The interpretation addresses what the obligating 
event is that gives rise to pay a levy and when should a liability be recognised. The Group is not currently subjected to significant levies so the 
impact on the Group is not material.
IFRS 10, ‘Consolidated financial statements’ builds on existing principles by identifying the concept of control as the determining factor in 
whether an entity should be included within the consolidated financial statements of the parent Company. The standard provides additional 
guidance to assist in the determination of control where this is difficult to assess. The standard does not have a material impact on the Group.
IFRS 11, ‘Joint arrangements’ focuses on the rights and obligations of the parties to the arrangement rather than its legal form. There are two 
types of joint arrangements: joint operations and joint ventures. Joint operations arise where the investors have rights to the assets and 
obligations for the liabilities of an arrangement. A joint operator accounts for its share of the assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. Joint 
ventures arise where the investors have rights to the net assets of the arrangement; joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method. 
Proportional consolidation of joint arrangements is no longer permitted. The standard does not have a material impact on the Group.
IFRS 12, ‘Disclosures of interests in other entities’ includes the disclosure requirements for all forms of interests in other entities, including joint 
arrangements, associates, structured entities and other off balance sheet vehicles. The standard does not have a material impact on the Group.
IAS 27, ‘Separate Financial Statements’ amendments triggered by IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’ and IFRS 12 to the portion of 
IAS 27 that addresses the accounting for consolidated financial statements. IAS 27, as revised, is limited to the accounting for investments in 
subsidiaries, joint ventures, and associates in separate financial statements. The standard does not have a material impact on the Group.
• New and amended standards and interpretations not yet adopted by the Group 
The following standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards relevant to the Group are not yet effective and have not been 
early adopted by the Company. The items disclosed are those which could have a significant impact on the Group. 
IFRS 9, ‘Financial instruments’, addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. IFRS 9 was 
issued in November 2009 and October 2010. It replaces the parts of IAS 39 that relate to the classification and measurement of financial 
instruments. IFRS 9 requires financial assets to be classified into two measurement categories: those measured as at fair value and those 
measured at amortised cost. The determination is made at initial recognition. The classification depends on the entity’s business model for 
managing its financial instruments and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the instrument. For financial liabilities, the standard retains 
most of the IAS 39 requirements. The main change is that, in cases where the fair value option is taken for financial liabilities, the part of a fair 
value change due to an entity’s own credit risk is recorded in other comprehensive income rather than the income statement, unless this creates 
an accounting mismatch. The standard is not expected to have material impact on the Group. The standard is subject to EU endorsement and 
not mandatory for the Group until 1 January 2018.
IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ was issued in May 2014 which establishes the principles that an entity shall apply to report 
useful information to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from a 
contract with a customer. Revenue will be recognised based on the following five-step model framework:
• Identify the contract(s) with a customer
• Identify the performance obligations in the contract
• Determine the transaction price
• Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract
• Recognise revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation
The standard is subject to EU endorsement and not mandatory for the Group until 1 January 2017. The standard is not expected to have a 
material impact on the Group. 
Amendment to IAS 16 and IAS 38 clarifies that the use of revenue-based methods to calculate depreciation of an asset is not appropriate 
because revenue generated by an activity that includes the use of an asset generally reflects factors other than the consumption of the 
economic benefits embodied in the asset, either property, plant and equipment of intangibles assets. The amendment is not expected to have a 
material impact on the Group. 
Amendments to IAS 19 and amendments to IFRSs 2010-2012 and 2011-2013 cycles, with an effective date for the annual accounting periods 
beginning on or after 1 July 2014. The amendment is not expected to have a material impact on the Group. 
There are no other IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group. CENTRAL ASIA METALS PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014

Basis of Consolidation
(a) Joint Venture Accounting – Kounrad Project
The Kounrad project ownership changes have taken a significant amount of time to complete. Throughout the periods of joint ownership and 
under the terms of the Joint Operating Agreement (JOA), both of the parties had an equal vote on all significant operational, financial and 
planning matters. Consequently, it was concluded that Joint Control existed over the Kounrad project and so, whilst the various transactions have 
been negotiated and submitted for government approval, the Kounrad project has been accounted for in the following manner;
1. The subsoil user licence operations (SUC) under Sary Kazna LLP (SK) are classified as a jointly controlled asset. The assets, liabilities, income and 
expenditure have been proportionately consolidated on a 60:40 basis.
2. All of the operations conducted under Kounrad Copper Company LLP (KCC) have also been proportionately consolidated on a 60:40 basis as 
it has been a jointly owned legal entity. 
The Kounrad transaction resulted in CAML obtaining control over the Kounrad project in two transactions:
1. The first transaction (KCC) was effected in October 2013 by CAML’s wholly owned subsidiary, CAML Kazakhstan BV (CAML BV), acquiring the 
remaining 40% share capital of KCC.
2. The second and final part of the transaction (SUC) was effected in May 2014 by CAML’s wholly owned subsidiary SK acquiring the remaining 
40% economic interest in the SUC.
Following the completion of the Kounrad Transaction on 23 May 2014, the Group now owns 100% of the Kounrad project and during the year 
ended 31 December 2014 has accounted for 100% of the income and expenditure together with 100% of the assets and liabilities of the legal 
entities associated with the Kounrad project. 
Business Combinations – Kounrad Project
The completion of both transactions, being the acquisition of the remaining 40% of KCC and the SUC, resulted in a change in control of the 
Kounrad project from joint control to control by CAML. As such an IFRS 3 Business Combination was deemed to have taken place upon completion.
Details of the accounting treatment for the business combination are contained in note 33.
(b) Other CAML Subsidiaries
The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of CAML and the entities it controls drawn up to 31 December 2014.
Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is 
exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over 
the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date 
that control ceases.
The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary 
is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the Group. 
The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Identifiable 
assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the 
acquisition date. The Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, either at fair value or at 
the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the recognised amounts of acquiree’s identifiable net assets.
If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the 
acquiree is re-measured to fair value at the acquisition date; any gains or losses arising from such re-measurement are recognised in profit or loss.
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised losses/gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses/
gains are also eliminated but considered an impairment indicator of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed 
where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
Non-controlling interests
Non-controlling interests represent the portion of profit or loss and net assets in subsidiaries that are not held by the Group and are presented 
separately within equity in the consolidated statement of financial position distinct from parent shareholders equity.
Where losses are incurred by a partially owned subsidiary, they are consolidated such that the non-controlling interests’ share in the losses is 
apportioned in the same way as profits. Where the subsidiary makes continuing losses such that the non-controlling interests’ share of the 
losses in a period exceeds its interest in equity, the allocation of losses to the minority ceases and the loss is allocated against the parent 
Company holding.

Where profits are then made in future periods, such profits are then allocated to the parent Company until all unrecognised losses attributable to 
the non-controlling interests but absorbed by the parent are recovered at which point, profits are allocated as normal.
Segment reporting
As at 31 December 2014, the Group only had one business segment consisting of an SX-EW copper plant at Kounrad in Kazakhstan. The Group 
operations are controlled from a head office in London, UK but this does not represent a separate business segment.
Foreign currency translation
The functional currency for each entity in the Group is determined as the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates (the 
functional currency). The consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars, which is the Group’s presentation currency.
Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are initially recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional currency rate of exchange ruling at the reporting date. 
All differences are taken to the income statement.
The results and financial position of all the Group entities that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated 
into the presentation currency as follows:
• Assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position presented are translated at the closing rate at the reporting date; 
• Income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates; and 
• All resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income.
On disposal of a foreign entity, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in equity relating to that particular foreign operation is recognised in 
the income statement.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and 
translated at the closing rate.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Cost comprises the 
aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset and includes costs directly attributable to making 
the asset capable of operating as intended.
The cost of the item also includes the cost of decommissioning any buildings or plant and equipment and making good the site, where a present 
obligation exists to undertake the restoration work.
Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life as follows:
• Construction in progress    – not depreciated
• Plant and Equipment    – over 5 to 15 years
• Motor Vehicles     – over 5 to 10 years
• Office Equipment    – over 2 to 10 years
Construction in progress is not depreciated until transferred to other classes of property, plant and equipment.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying 
value may not be recoverable, and are written down immediately to their recoverable amount. Useful lives and residual values are reviewed 
annually and where adjustments are required these are made prospectively.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the 
continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on de-recognition of the asset is included in the income statement.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets comprise goodwill, deferred exploration and evaluation costs, mining licences and permits and computer software.
Goodwill
All business combinations in the Group are accounted for under IFRS 3 using the acquisition method. Any excess of the consideration transferred of 
the business combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is recognised in the 
statement of financial position as goodwill and is not amortised. To the extent that the net fair value of the acquired entity’s identifiable assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities is greater than the consideration transferred, a gain is recognised immediately in the income statement.
After initial recognition, goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses, with the carrying value being reviewed for impairment, 
at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. CENTRAL ASIA METALS PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014
54
Goodwill arising on the Kounrad transaction comprised $20,291,000, being the Group’s 40% share of the amount calculated in accordance with 
IFRS to recognise a deferred tax liability on the difference between the provisional fair value of the newly consolidated assets and liabilities with 
their tax base. This deferred tax liability includes an amount of $9,278,000 calculated on the acquisition of the additional 40% in KCC on 
21 October 2013 with an adjustment in 2014 to increase this amount by $209,933 (note 33). A further deferred tax liability of $10,803,000 was 
calculated on the acquisition of the additional 40% in the SUC in May 2014 (note 33).
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the cash generating unit expected to benefit from the business combination in 
which the goodwill arose. Where the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount, including goodwill, an impairment loss is recognised in 
the income statement.
The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to an entity is taken into account when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the unit.
Deferred exploration and evaluation expenditure
Capitalised costs include costs directly related to any Group exploration and evaluation activities in the relevant area of interest. Exploration and 
evaluation expenditure capitalised includes acquisition of rights to explore, topographical, geological, geochemical and geophysical studies, 
exploration drilling, trenching, sampling and activities in relation to the evaluation of the technical feasibility and commercial viability of 
extracting a mineral resource.
Deferred exploration and evaluation assets are measured at cost less provision for impairment, where required.
Amortisation is charged within administrative expenses in the consolidated income statement on a straight line basis over their expected 
useful lives.
Mining licences, permits and computer software
The historical cost model is applied, with intangible assets being carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment 
losses. Intangible assets with a finite life have no residual value and are amortised on a straight line basis over their expected useful lives with 
charges included in either cost of sales or administrative expenses:
• Computer software    – over 2 to 5 years
• Permits and Mining licences  – over the duration of the legal agreement.
The carrying value of intangible assets is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may 
not be recoverable.
Impairment of non-financial assets
The Group carries out impairment testing on all assets when there exists an indication of an impairment. If any such indication exists the Group 
makes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s fair 
value less costs to sell or its value in use.
Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable 
amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement. 
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current 
market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific to the asset.
The best evidence of an asset’s fair value is the value obtained from an active market or binding sale agreement. Where neither exists, fair value 
less costs to sell is based on the best available information to reflect the amount the Group could receive for the cash-generating unit in an arm’s 
length sale. In some cases this is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis.
A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed if the recoverable amount increases as a result of a reversal of the conditions that originally 
resulted in the impairment. This reversal is recognised in the income statement and is limited to the carrying amount that would have been 
determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised in prior years.
Goodwill is also reviewed annually, as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be 
recoverable. Non-financial assets other than goodwill which have suffered an impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at 
each reporting date.
Disposal groups held for sale
Non-current assets are classified as held for sale and included in discontinued operations when their carrying amount is to be recovered principally 
through a sale transaction and a sale is considered highly probable. They are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell 
if their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.

Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable from sales of metal to an end user, net of any buyers discount and 
value added tax. The value of the consideration is fair value which equates to the spot price on the date of sale or the contractually agreed price.
The costs of delivery to the end customers are effectively borne by the Group through means of an annually agreed buyer’s fee which is offset 
from the selling price. The Group reports both a gross revenue and revenue line which reflects the offset of the buyers discount from the price of 
the copper achieved.
Revenue is only recognised at the point when the following criteria are satisfied:
• The significant risks and rewards of ownership of the product have been transferred to the buyer; 
• No managerial control remains over the metal product; and 
• The amount of revenue earned can be reliably measured.
Inventory
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined using the weighted average method.
The cost of finished goods and work in progress comprises raw materials, direct labour and all other direct costs associated with mining the ore 
and processing it to a saleable product.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less any further costs expected to be incurred to completion. 
Provision is made, if necessary, for slow moving, obsolete and defective inventory.
Current and deferred income tax
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date in the countries 
where the Group’s subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income.
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, the deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial 
recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither 
accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the 
statement of financial position date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax 
liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are only recognised when they arise from timing differences where their recoverability in the short term is regarded as 
being probable.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items are disclosed separately in the financial statements where it is necessary to do so to provide further understanding of the 
financial performance of the group. They are material items of income or expense that have been shown separately due to the significance of 
their nature or amount.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments with original 
maturities of three months or less.
Restricted cash
Restricted cash is cash with banks that is not available for immediate used by the Group. Restricted cash is shown separately from cash and cash 
equivalents on the statement of financial position. 
Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are recorded at cost less provision for impairment.
Share capital
Ordinary Shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a deduction, net 
of tax, from the proceeds.
Treasury shares
Where any Group company purchases the Company’s equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any directly 
attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes) is deducted from equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders until the shares are 
cancelled or reissued. Where such Ordinary Shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable 
incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders. CENTRAL ASIA METALS PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014

Share based compensation
The Group operates two main Share Option Plans, the rules of which were approved by the Board in December 2007 and October 2011. A scheme 
similar in details to the one approved in October 2011 was also set up for the two overseas General Directors with the only difference being a 
specific two year vesting period as opposed to a three year vesting period. The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the 
grant of the options is recognised as an expense. The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the options 
granted, excluding the impact of any non-market service and performance vesting conditions. Non-market vesting conditions are included in 
assumptions about the number of options that are expected to vest. The total amount expensed is recognised over the vesting period, which is 
the period over which all of the specified vesting conditions are to be satisfied. At each reporting date, the entity revises its estimates of the 
number of options that are expected to vest based on the non-market vesting conditions. It recognises the impact of the revision to original 
estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium when the 
options are exercised.
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables do not carry interest and are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method, less provision for impairment.
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are not interest bearing and are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using 
the effective interest method.
Provisions
Provisions for environmental restoration of mining operations are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a 
result of past events; it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and the amount can be reliably estimated. 
Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision due to passage of 
time is recognised as interest expense.
Impairment of financial assets 
The group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or Group of financial assets is 
impaired. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred only if there is objective evidence of 
impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a ‘loss event’) and that loss event (or events) 
has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.
Evidence of impairment may include indications that the debtors or a group of debtors is experiencing significant financial difficulty, default or 
delinquency in interest or principal payments, the probability that they will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation, and where 
observable data indicate that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows, such as changes in arrears or economic 
conditions that correlate with defaults.
For loans and receivables category, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present 
value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred discounted) at the financial asset’s original 
effective interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced and the amount of the loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement. 
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after 
the impairment was recognised (such as an improvement in the debtor’s credit rating), the reversal of the previously recognised impairment loss 
is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
3. Financial risk management
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks; market risk (including foreign currency exchange risk, commodity price risk and 
interest rate risk), tax risk, liquidity risk, capital risk and credit risk. There risks are mitigated wherever possible by the Group’s financial 
management policies and practices described below;
Foreign currency exchange risk
The Group and Company report their financial results in US dollars and consequently they are exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from 
various currency exposures with respect to the US dollar. Foreign currency exchange risk arises from both future commercial transactions where 
projected expenditures are sourced in currencies other than US dollars and from the resulting exchange gains and losses recognised on assets 
and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations within the Group financial statements.

The Group manages its exposure to foreign currency exchange risk associated with material commercial transactions and working capital 
requirements by maintaining controlled amounts of cash in the required currencies.
The primary Group currency requirements:
• British Pounds (GBP) – CAML head office overheads and dividends
• Kazakhstan Tenge (KZT) and US dollars (USD) – working capital requirements for the Kounrad operations 
The Mongolian Tugrik (MNT), Chinese Yuan Renminbi (CNY) and European Euro (EUR) requirements are immaterial to the Group’s operations.
The Group’s main revenue stream from the sale of copper cathode in Kazakhstan is denominated in US dollars.
The following table highlights the major currencies the Group operates in and the movements against the US dollar during the course of the year:

Commodity price risk
Commodity price risk is the risk that the Group’s future earnings will be adversely impacted by changes in the market prices of commodities, 
primarily copper. Management is aware of this impact on its primary revenue stream but knows that there is little it can do to influence the price 
earned apart from a hedging scheme.
Given the low costs of production and the absence of any debt liabilities within the Group, since the commencement of production in late April 
2012, CAML management has always felt that a hedging policy was not required and sold the copper generally on a spot basis. CENTRAL ASIA METALS PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014
58
Given the recent volatility in the copper price, the Board has approved a minor change to the Group’s Treasury policy that allows limited hedging 
up to a maximum of 30% of the Group’s rolling 12 month production. It is felt that this policy would allow management to combine the benefits 
of an exposure to the copper price for its shareholders whilst also facilitating the ability for management to put in place limited hedging to cover 
the cost base. There are currently no hedges in place. 
The following table details the Group’s sensitivity to a 10% increase and decrease in the copper price against the invoiced price. 10% is the 
sensitivity used when reporting commodity price internally to management and represents management’s assessment of the possible change in 
price. A positive number below indicates an increase in profit and other equity where the price increases.

Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk relates to the ability of the Group and Company to meet future obligations and financial liabilities as and when they fall due.
As the Group currently has sufficient cash resources and material income stream from the Kounrad project, the liquidity risk is considered 
insignificant.

All Group’s and Company’s trade and other payables are less than one year for both reporting periods.
Capital risk
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for 
shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal structure to reduce the cost of capital.
The Group manages its capital in order to provide sufficient funds for the Group’s activities. Future capital requirements are regularly assessed 
and Board decisions taken as to the most appropriate source for obtaining the required funds, be it through internal revenue streams, external 
fund raising, issuing new shares or selling assets. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of 
dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
Due to the cash flows being generated at Kounrad from the sale of copper cathode and no debt, the Group’s capital risk is currently perceived as 
minimal although the Board will continue to monitor requirements prudently.
Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that the Group and Company’s financial assets will be impaired by the default of a third party. The Group and 
Company are exposed to credit risk primarily on its cash and cash equivalents as set out in note 23 and on its trade and other receivables as set 
out in note 21.

The Directors have considered the credit exposures and do not consider that they pose a material risk at the present time. The credit risk for cash 
and cash equivalents is managed by ensuring that all surplus funds are deposited only with financial institutions with high quality credit ratings.
The Group is exposed to the risk of not recovering VAT receivable from Kazakhstan tax authorities as set out in note 21.
Interest rate risk
The Group has no borrowings as at 31 December 2014 (2013: nil) and is funded 100% by equity. The Group has no significant cash balances on 
deposit. The Group has limited exposure to interest rate risk.
Tax risk
The taxation systems in Kazakhstan are at an early stage of development. The interpretation and application of tax laws and regulations are 
evolving, which significantly increases the risks with respect to mining and subsoil use operations, and the Group’s investments in Kazakhstan in 
comparison with more developed tax systems.
Tax legislation is subject to different and changing interpretations, as well as inconsistent enforcement. Tax regulation and compliance is subject 
to review and investigation by the authorities who may impose extremely severe fines, penalties and interest charges. The fact that the tax 
authorities have conducted an audit of a particular period does not prevent them from revisiting that period and raising an additional assessment.
In addition, Kazakhstan’s tax system does not recognise the concept of tax authorities giving legally binding rulings on tax issues that are put 
before them. The inconsistent enforcement and the evolution of Kazakhstan tax laws creates a risk of excessive payment of tax or penalties by the 
subsoil users if they fail to comply with tax legislation.
The Group manages this risk by complying locally with all tax regulations and ensuring that its local accounting staff are adequately trained and 
updated regarding any appropriate tax law changes. CAML also receives tax advice on local issues from its tax advisers, PwC Chartered 
Accountants and Statutory Auditors, in Kazakhstan and Mongolia.
The Group’s main receivable is the VAT incurred on purchases within Kazakhstan as explained in note 21. As at 31 December 2014 a total of 
$6,392,885 (2013: $5,436,475) of VAT receivable was still owed to the Group by the Kazakhstan authorities. The Group still remains confident 
about its prospects to recover this outstanding debt and is working closely with its advisers and local partners to achieve this. The planned means 
of recovery will be through a combination of the local sales of cathode copper to effectively offset VAT liabilities and by a successful appeal to 
the authorities.

4. Critical accounting estimates and judgments
The Group has five key areas where critical accounting estimates and judgements are required that could have a material impact on the 
financial statements:
Impairment
As mentioned above estimates are required periodically to assess assets for impairment. These estimates will incorporate the expected future 
commodity prices, estimates of the ore reserves and projected future costs of development and production. This includes an assessment of the 
carrying values of assets held for sale.
The carrying value of the goodwill generated by accounting for the business combination of the Group acquiring an additional 40% in the 
Kounrad project requires an annual impairment review. This review will determine whether the value of the goodwill can be justified by reference to 
the carrying value of the business assets and the future discounted cash flows of the business.
Mineral reserves and resources
The major value associated with the Group is the value of its mineral resources. The value of the resources have an impact on the Group’s 
accounting judgements in relation to depreciation and amortisation, impairment of assets and the assessment of going concern. These resources 
are the Group’s best estimate of product that can be economically and legally extracted from the relevant mining property. The Group’s estimates 
are supported by geological studies and drilling samples to determine the quantity and grade of each deposit.
Significant judgement is required to generate an estimate based on the geological data available. Ore resource estimates may vary from period to 
period. This judgement has a significant impact on impairment consideration and the period over which capitalised assets are depreciated within 
the financial statements.
The resources have been independently verified by Wardell Armstrong International and were classified as JORC Compliant in 2013.
Decommissioning and site rehabilitation estimates
Provision is made for the costs of decommissioning and site rehabilitation costs when the related environmental disturbance takes place. Provisions 
are recognised at the net present value of future expected costs using a discount rate of 8.65% (2013: 6.40%) representing the risk free rate 
(pre-tax) for Kazakhstan.
The provision recognised represents management’s best estimate of the costs that will be incurred, but significant judgement is required as many 
of these costs will not crystallise until the end of the life of the mine. Estimates are reviewed annually and are based on current contractual and 
regulatory requirements and the estimated useful life of mines. Engineering and feasibility studies are undertaken periodically; however significant 
changes in the estimates of contamination, restoration standards and techniques will result in changes to provisions from period to period.
Business combination
The Kounrad Transaction resulted in the Group acquiring the 40% of the joint venture project at Kounrad that it did not previously own. The 
assessment of the fair value uplift of the underlying assets acquired and the treatment of the two legal entities involved in the project required a 
high degree of judgement.
The assessment of the overall project as a business combination for both legal entities, Kounrad Copper Company LLP and Sary Kazna LLP, and the 
impact on that judgement caused by the different stages of completion required a careful review of the overall transaction as opposed to the 
specific nature of the assets being acquired.
The fair value uplift of the assets acquired as a result of that judgement and the resulting accounting treatment have resulted in a significant 
change to both the income statement and the statement of financial position of the business. The details are explained in note 33.
VAT recoverability 
The Group’s main receivable is the VAT incurred on purchases within Kazakhstan as explained in note 21. As at 31 December 2014 a total of 
$6,392,885 (2013: $5,436,475) of VAT receivable was still owed to the Group by the Kazakhstan authorities. The Group still remains confident 
about its prospects to recover this outstanding debt and is working closely with its advisers and local partners to achieve this. 
The planned means of recovery will be through a combination of the local sales of cathode copper to effectively offset VAT liabilities and by a 
successful appeal to the authorities. Following an unsuccessful appeal in 2014, a further appeal was lodged in January 2015 by the local tax 
advisers and the final outcome may not be known for a further 12 months. As a result of the above and the uncertainty regarding timing, the 
Group has classified the VAT receivable as non-current.

5. Segmental information
The Board is the Group’s chief operating decision-maker. Management has determined the operating segments based on the information 
reviewed by the Board for the purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance. The Board considers the business from a geographic 
prospective.
As at 31 December 2014, the Group only had one operating and reporting segment consisting of an SX-EW copper plant at Kounrad in Kazakhstan. 
The head office in London, where the Group operations are controlled, and Copper Bay project (Chile), being an exploration asset in its early 
stages, do not represent separate operating and reporting segments.
Previously reported segments within the Group, namely all the Mongolian operations, are classified as held for sale as at 31 December 2014. In 
June 2014, Bayanresources LLC, a Mongolian incorporated company owned 70% by the Group was sold for nil consideration. 
The Board assesses the performance of the Kounrad project based on a number of key operational and financial measures which relate to copper 
production output, revenues from the sales of copper and the overall costs of producing the copper. All capital related expenditure at the project is 
also closely monitored and controlled.
The segmental results for the year ended 31 December 2014 are as follows:

The total production at Kounrad for 2014 was 11,136 tonnes (2013: 10,509 tonnes) whilst the total quantity of copper sold was slightly higher at 
11,163 tonnes (2013: 10,689 tonnes). The average price achieved from the sale of copper was $6,794 per tonne (2013: $7,114 per tonne).
EBITDA is a non-IFRS financial measure. CAML calculates EBITDA as profit or loss for the year excluding the following items:
• Income tax expense;
• Finance income and expense; 
• Depreciation and amortisation; and 
• Discontinued operations; and Gain on re-measuring to fair value and other income or expenses.
EBITDA is intended to provide additional information to investors and analysts. It does not have any standardised meaning prescribed by IFRS and 
should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. EBITDA excludes the impact of 
cash costs of financing activities and taxes, and the effects of changes in operating working capital balances, and therefore is not necessarily 
indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under IFRS. Other companies may calculate EBITDA differently. CENTRAL ASIA METALS PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014

The Group sells and distributes its copper cathode product primarily through an offtake arrangement with Traxys. The offtake arrangements are 
for a minimum 90% of the SX-EW plant’s output for the period up until 31 December 2015. The copper cathodes are delivered from the Kounrad 
site by rail under an FCA (Incoterms 2010) contractual basis and delivered to the end customers in Turkey. As part of the offtake arrangements, the 
Group sells the copper cathodes at a price linked to the London Metal Exchange (LME) copper price based on an agreed quotational period.
The costs of delivery to the end customers have been effectively borne by the Group through means of an annually agreed buyer’s fee which is 
offset from the selling price (note 8).
During 2014 the Group sold 10,687 tonnes (2013: 10,500 tonnes) of copper through the offtake arrangements. Some of the copper cathodes are 
also sold locally and during 2014 a total of 476 tonnes (2013: 189 tonnes) were sold to local customers.

uplift associated with the transaction of $54,015,555. 
2. There was an additional amortisation charge during the year of $1,209,344 as a result of the fair value uplift in intangible assets. 
As a result of the Kounrad Transaction, the Group has recognised goodwill of $20,291,000.
The Company had no intangible assets as at 31 December 2014 (2013: nil). 
Impairment test for goodwill
The Group currently only has one business segment, namely the Kounrad project located in Kazakhstan which has an associated goodwill balance. 
In accordance with IAS 36 ‘Impairment of assets’ and IAS 38 ‘Intangible Assets’, a review for impairment of goodwill is undertaken annually or at 
any time an indicator of impairment is considered to exist and in accordance with IAS 16 ‘Property, plant and equipment’, a review for impairment 
of long-lived assets is undertaken at any time an indicator of impairment is considered to exist.  
 
The discount rate applied to calculate the present value is based upon the real weighted average cost of capital applicable to the Cash Generating 
Unit (CGU). The discount rate reflects equity risk premiums over the risk-free rate, the impact of the remaining economic life of the CGU and the 
risks associated with the relevant cash flows based on the country in which the CGU is located. These risk adjustments are based on observed 
equity risk premiums, historical country risk premiums and average credit default swap spreads for the period. 
The value in use (VIU) of a CGU is generally lower than its fair value less costs of disposal (FVLCD), due primarily to the fact that the optimisation 
of the mine plans has been taken into account when determining its FVLCD. Consequently, the recoverable amount of a CGU for impairment 
testing purposes is determined based on its FVLCD.  CENTRAL ASIA METALS PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014
68
The key economic assumptions used in the review were:  
– copper price $6,614 per tonne 
– discount rate 8%  
 
The carrying value of the net assets is not currently sensitive to any reasonable changes in key assumptions.

The 52% holding of the Copper Bay Group of companies is presented on a non-diluted basis. On a fully diluted basis the Group holding would be 
50%. The investment in Copper Bay Limited has not been accounted for as a subsidiary and has been classified as an asset acquisition within 
mining licences and permits within the 2013 intangible asset additions of the Group (note 18). 
In June 2014, Bayanresources LLC, a Mongolian incorporated company owned 70% by the Group was sold for nil consideration. 
20. Assets held for sale
The Group continues to hold for sale the assets it owns in Mongolia and is actively seeking to sell the Ereen and Handgait projects. The sale process 
is taking far longer than the CAML Board ever anticipated due to the current political and regulatory uncertainties in the country and the 
implications of a court case brought by the Group’s minority partner on the Ereen project. The Mongolian assets were fully written down in the 
prior year. 
In June 2014, Bayanresources LLC (Alag Bayan exploration project), which was classified as held for sale during the prior year, was sold for nil 
consideration.

The Group’s non-current receivable is the VAT incurred on purchases within Kazakhstan. As at 31 December 2014 a total of $6,392,885 (2013: 
$5,436,475) of VAT receivable was still owed to the Group by the Kazakhstan authorities. The Group still remains confident about its prospects to 
recover this outstanding debt and is working closely with its advisers and local partners to achieve this. The planned means of recovery will be 
through a combination of the local sales of cathode copper to effectively offset VAT liabilities and by a successful appeal to the authorities. 
Following an unsuccessful appeal in 2014, a further appeal was lodged in January 2015 by the local tax advisers and the final outcome may not  
be known for a further 12 months. As a result of the above and the uncertainty regarding timing, the Group has classified the VAT receivable as 
non-current.
Management’s policy is to assess all trade and other receivables for recoverability on a regular basis. A provision is made where doubt exists and 
amounts are fully written off when information comes to light that the amounts due will not be recovered. 
Please refer to note 3 for information on ageing of trade and other receivables.

26. Equity settled share based payments
The Company provides additional rewards to staff, in addition to their salaries and annual discretionary bonuses, through the granting of share 
options in the Company. The Company effectively has two such option schemes in place, the Old Scheme and the New Scheme.
Old Scheme
The first share option plan was introduced by the Company in February 2008 and initially had an exercise price of $6.42. On the recommendation 
of the Remuneration Committee the exercise price for the participants was reduced to $0.68 in February 2010 to reflect the changed economic 
circumstances of the Company and maintain some form of incentive for staff. Only those staff still employed by the Group at this time benefited 
from this decision and those participants who had left the Group maintained an exercise price of $6.42 on their options. The vesting of share 
options in the plan is purely conditional upon time served by the participant and as at 31 December 2014 all options have fully vested.
New Scheme
The second share option plan was introduced by the Company in October 2011. This scheme has an exercise price of effectively nil for the 
participants. The nil-cost share options granted under this scheme vest on the basis of a third annually depending on the achievement by the 
Group and the participant of the performance targets as determined by the CAML Remuneration Committee. Under a separate Non-Executive 
share option plan 2012, Nurlan Zhakupov was granted 100,000 nil-cost options in 2012 which vest on the basis of a third annually, without any 
performance conditions due to his Non-Executive role.
As at 31 December 2014, a total of 330,543 (2013: 520,086) Old Scheme options and 2,017,384 (2013: 2,082,974) New Scheme options 
(including those issued to Nurlan Zhakupov) were outstanding. Share options are granted to Directors and selected employees. The exercise  
price of the granted options is presented in the table below for every grant. In general, options vest in 1/3 tranches over three-year period.  
The Company has the option but not the legal or constructive obligation to repurchase or settle the options in cash.
Movements in the number of share options outstanding and their related weighted average price are as following:

Out of the 2,347,927 outstanding options (2013: 2,603,060), 581,833 options (2013: 1,273,968) were exercisable. Options exercised in 2014 were 
equity settled at the spot price on the date. The related weighted average share price at the time of exercise was $2.65 (2013: $1.92) per share.
An amount of $1,913,617 (2013: $1,588,116) has been credited to the share option reserve and expensed within employee benefits expense from 
continuing operations for the grant of stock options for the year ended 31 December 2014. An additional accrual of $171,572 (2013: nil) has been 
expensed within employee benefits expense from continuing operations for employer’s national insurance contributions. 
In respect of the period between the date an award is issued and the date it is exercised the number of shares covered by such awards is 
increased by up to the value of dividends as if these were reinvested in Company shares at the dates of payment. During the year the additional 
dividend related share options charge was $450,566 (2013: $571,214).
Share options exercised by the Directors during the year are disclosed in note 35.

Employee Benefit Trust
An Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) was set up by the Company during 2009 as a means of incentivising certain Directors and senior management of 
CAML prior to the Initial Public Offering (IPO). All of the shares awarded as part of the EBT scheme vested on the successful completion of the IPO 
on 30 September 2010.
A total of 2,534,688 Ordinary Shares were initially issued as part of the arrangements in December 2009 followed by a further issue of 853,258 in 
September 2010. The shares were issued at the exercise price of $0.68 which was the best estimate of the Company’s valuation at the time. 
Details of the awards to Directors of the Company are contained in note 35.
On 23 July 2014, the Company allotted and issued 3,500,000 Ordinary Shares of US$0.01 each to the EBT. These Ordinary Shares were issued 
with a view to satisfying current awards granted under the Company’s Employee Share Plans together with any future awards that may be 
granted by the Company.

32. Dividend per share
In line with the Company dividend policy, the Company paid $17,932,000 in 2014 (2013: $14,306,000) which consisted of a 2014 interim dividend 
of 5 pence per share and an annual dividend for 2013 of 5 pence per share (2013: special dividend of 3.7 pence per share and an annual dividend 
for 2012 of 7 pence per share).
The Directors have the intention to propose a final dividend in respect of the year ended 31 December 2014 of 7.5 pence per share at the 
forthcoming Annual General meeting (AGM). The Directors recognise that there are currently insufficient reserves available in the Company for 
distribution and are proposing to rectify this by completing a court approved capital reduction scheme by cancelling the Company’s share 
premium account and transferring such reserves to retained earnings. This process is expected to become effective on or around 13 May 2015. 
The Company undertook a previous capital reduction scheme in 2013. 
In September 2013 the Company declared dividends amounting to $5.3 million. Although the Company had sufficient distributable reserves to 
make the dividend payments, the relevant interim accounts had not been filed with the Registrar of Companies as required. Consequently 
payment of the dividends was a technical infringement of the Companies Act 2006.
The Directors will propose at the upcoming AGM to appropriate distributable profits of the Company to these payments of dividends and to 
release the relevant shareholders from any claims that the Company may have in relation to such payments. These financial statements have 
been drawn up on the basis that the technical infringement described above has been regularised in the manner described.
33. Business combination
The Company has been working on the completion of the acquisition of the remaining 40% of the Kounrad project since early 2012. The 
acquisition (collectively known as the Kounrad Transaction) consisted of two key parts; 
• The first transaction involving the transfer of an additional 40% ownership of Kounrad Copper Company LLP (KCC) was completed on 
21 October 2013.
• The second transaction involving the transfer of the remaining 40% economic interest in the subsoil use contract (SUC) remained 
outstanding as at 31 December 2013. This was completed on 23 May 2014.
On completion of the Kounrad Transaction and in line with the agreements, a total of 21,211,751 Ordinary Shares were issued to Mr Kenges 
Rakishev (KR) on 23 May 2014. In addition a cash payment of $1,432,047 was paid to KR on that date in line with the agreements to reflect the 
entitlement to dividends payable. 
As a consequence of the completion of both transactions, the CAML Group became 100% owner of the Kounrad project and, in accordance with 
IFRS 3 Business Combinations, recognized the acquired assets and liabilities of both KCC and the SUC based upon their fair values.  CENTRAL ASIA METALS PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014
76
Consideration 
The fair value of the 21,211,751 Ordinary Shares issued as part of the consideration for the Kounrad Transaction was determined based on the 
published share price of the Company on the relevant dates. In the case of KCC this was 21 October 2013 when the remaining 40% of KCC Shares 
were re-registered and in the case of the SUC transfer it was deemed to be 23 May 2014 when the Kounrad Transaction was finally completed and 
the agreed consideration paid to KR. 
In addition an agreed cash consideration of $1,432,047 was paid on 23 May 2014. This was all allocated as consideration for the additional 
40% shares in KCC as per the legal agreements resulting in a minor adjustment of $1,049,798 to the fair values associated with the assets and 
liabilities of KCC as reported at 31 December 2013. 
The total purchase consideration amounted to $57,685,494 plus an adjustment for settlement of intercompany borrowings of $9,471,000.

Completion of the SUC Transaction
As stated above, the second transaction involving the transfer of the remaining 40% economic interest in the SUC completed on 23 May 2014. 
In accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations, the Group recognised the assets and liabilities based upon their fair values. The fair value 
uplift applied to the assets acquired as part of the SUC transaction has all been applied to the intangible assets of the SUC under Mining 
Licences and Permits resulting in an uplift of $54,015,555.
The Group recognised a gain of $32,409,333 as a result of measuring at fair value its 60% interest in the SUC held before the business 
combination. This gain is included in the consolidated income statement, as a line item “Gain on re-measuring to fair value the existing interests 
on acquisition of control”, in the Group’s income statement for the year ended 31 December 2014. 
Amendments to provisional purchase price allocated in relation to the KCC Transaction as reported at 31 December 2013
As at 31 December 2013, the cash consideration had been apportioned to both the KCC and SUC parts of the Kounrad Transaction. This 
assumption was revised following a review of the detailed legal agreements associated with the transaction. Consequently, the adjustment and 
revised allocation of the cash consideration to the KCC part of the transaction resulted in an additional gain of $629,798 through the income 
statement for the year ended 31 December 2014.

As a result the Group reported a total gain through the income statement, under the line item “Gain on re-measuring to fair value the existing 
interests on acquisition of control”, for the year ended 31 December 2014 of $33,039,131. This reported gain is in addition to the $27,835,000 gain 
reported by the Group in the year ended 31 December 2013 making a reported total gain for the completion of the Kounrad Transaction of 
$60,874,131.
This minor amendment to the allocation of the cash consideration also resulted in an additional fair value uplift associated with the property, plant 
and equipment of KCC. The fair value uplift reported as at 31 December 2013 was $46,392,000 giving a total on completion of $47,441,797.
Goodwill
The goodwill arising on the completion of the Kounrad Transaction amounted to $20,291,043 which includes a minor adjustment of $209,933 
resulting from the reallocation of the cash consideration assigned to KCC as mentioned above. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.
This is the amount of the deferred tax liability which arises on the difference between the assigned fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities 
and their tax base. 
The acquisition costs related to the completion of the transaction in the year ended 31 December 2014 are approximately $105,161 (2013: 
$221,264). These have been charged to administrative expenses in the consolidated income statement.
34. Events after the reporting period 
As explained in note 32, the Directors recognise that there are currently insufficient reserves available in the Company for distribution and are 
proposing to rectify this by completing a court approved capital reduction scheme by cancelling the Company’s share premium account and 
transferring such reserves to retained earnings. This process is expected to become effective on or around 13 May 2015. The Company undertook 
a previous capital reduction scheme in 2013. 
35. Related party transactions
The Group had the following related party balances and transactions during the year ended 31 December 2014. Related parties are those entities 
owned or controlled by the Company, which is the ultimate controlling party of the Group.

the ownership of CAML Kazakhstan BV which is a 100% controlled subsidiary of the Company. The agreed consideration for the acquisition was 
15,336,096 Ordinary Shares in the Company and the value of the 2013 interim dividend associated with those shares. The adjustment and 
revised allocation of the cash consideration to the KCC part of the transaction (note 33) resulted in an increase to the cash consideration and 
therefore the amount receivable from CAML Kazakhstan BV of $420,000. During 2014, CAML Kazakhstan BV repaid $11,270,000 to the 
Company (2013: nil).

Kounrad Transaction
Mr Kenges Rakishev (KR) became a major shareholder of CAML on 23 May 2014 following completion of the Kounrad Transaction. He was 
appointed to the CAML Board on 9 December 2013 following the completion of the first part of the transaction. As a consequence, KR is 
considered a related party in any future dealings he has with the Group. 
KR owns 16.02% and is a Director of JSC Kazkommertsbank. The Group uses the facilities of JSC Kazkommertsbank within Kazakhstan for its 
normal day-to-day banking. 
On 2 July 2014, the Company announced that the SDB Group LLP, an entity 100% owned and controlled by KR, a Non-Executive Director of the 
Company, had entered into a loan agreement whereby security over 21,211,751 Ordinary Shares of US$0.01 each in the capital of the Company 
(the Pledged Shares) held by KR was granted in favour of JSC CenterCredit Bank. 
There is no change in KR’s legal or beneficial shareholding in the Company and he continues to have an interest and voting rights in 21,211,751 
Ordinary Shares. The Pledged Shares will remain subject to the restricted dealing provisions originally agreed with KR and CAML as part of the 
Kounrad Transaction. 
The Company has obtained an undertaking from JSC CenterCredit Bank that should the security be enforced, the Company will be granted a 
priority right to place the shares.
As far as the Group is aware, they do not have any other dealings with companies associated with KR. As part of the obligations on KR for 
completing the Kounrad Transaction, he signed a relationship agreement with CAML setting out the terms of the relationship between KR and 
the Group.

During 2014, a deferred tax liability of $10.8 million has been recognised in respect of the SUC acquisition that occurred in the year. The net 
assets of SUC were recognised in the consolidated financial statements at their fair values at the date of acquisition. 
During 2013, a deferred tax liability of $9.3 million was recognised in respect of the Kounrad Copper Company LLP acquisition that occurred in the 
year. The net assets of KCC were recognised in the consolidated financial statements at their fair values at the date of acquisition. The adjustment 
and revised allocation of the cash consideration to the KCC part of the transaction (note 33) resulted in an increase to the deferred tax liability 
during 2014 of $210,000. 
On both parts of above transaction, the tax base of the individual assets and liabilities remains the same as the pre-acquisition tax base as the 
transaction is considered to be non-taxable. A taxable temporary difference arises as a result of the acquisition of the long term assets where the 
carrying amount is increased to fair value at the date of acquisition but its tax base remains at cost.
The deferred tax liability arising from this taxable temporary difference is recognised in the consolidated financial statements to reflect the future 
tax consequences of recovering the long term assets recognised at fair value. The resulting deferred tax liability affects goodwill.
Where the realisation of deferred tax assets is dependent on future profits, the Group recognises losses carried forward and other deferred tax 
assets only to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit through future taxable profits is probable.
The Group did not recognise other potential deferred tax assets arising from losses of $3.7 million (2013: $2.7 million) as there is insufficient 
evidence of future taxable profits within the entities concerned. Unrecognised losses can be carried forward indefinitely.
At 31 December 2014, the Group had other deferred tax assets of $6.0 million (2013: $4.9 million) in respect of the exploration assets pool, 
depreciation, share based payments and other temporary differences which had not been recognised because of insufficient evidence of future 
taxable profits within the entities concerned.
There are no significant unrecognised temporary differences associated with undistributed profits of subsidiaries at 31 December 2014 and 2013, 
respectively.

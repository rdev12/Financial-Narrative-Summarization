Warning to shareholders
Over the last year many companies have become aware that 
their shareholders have received unsolicited phone calls or 
correspondence concerning investment matters which imply a 
connection to the company concerned. These are typically from 
overseas-based “brokers” who target UK shareholders, offering to 
sell them what often turn out to be worthless or high risk shares in 
US or UK investments.
They can be very persistent and extremely persuasive, and a 2006 
survey by the Financial Services Authority (FSA) has reported 
that the average amount lost by investors is around £20,000. It 
is not just the novice investor who has been duped in this way: 
many of the victims had been successfully investing for several 
years. Shareholders are advised to be very wary of any unsolicited 
advice, offers to buy shares at a discount or offers of free reports 
into the Company.
If you receive any unsolicited investment advice:
•	 	 M ake 	 s u re 	 yo u 	 ge t 	 t he 	 c o r re c t 	 na m e 	 of 	 t he 	 p er s on 	 an d	
organisation and make a record of any other information they 
give you, e.g. telephone number, address etc.
•	 	 Ch e c k 	 that 	 t h ey 	 a re 	 p ro p e r l y 	 au t h or is e d 	 by 	 t he 	 FS A 	 b e f o re

overseas firms who are targeting, or have targeted, UK 
investors, and any approach from such organisations should 
be reported to the FSA so that this list can be kept up to date 
and any other appropriate action can be considered. If you 
deal with an unauthorised firm, you would not be eligible to 
receive payment under the Financial Services Compensation 
Scheme. The FSA can be contacted by completing an online 
form at www.fsa.gov.uk/pages/doing/regulated/law/

internet, on 0845 606 1234.

Our Businesses
Invensys Operations Management
Creation of Invensys Operations Management
The decision has been taken to integrate our three industrial 
automation businesses (Invensys Process Systems (IPS), 
Wonderware and Eurotherm) into a single division, Invensys 
Operations Management. This decision has been driven by 
the convergence of technologies that enable our customers 
to optimise their entire operations, the opportunity to create 
a continuum of solutions and services for the whole industrial 
market and the potential for cost savings from common sales 
and marketing, delivery and back office functions.
We have identified significant growth opportunities from  
more effective coverage of our customer base and attractive 
savings from using common approaches to business 
processes. Some integration activities began earlier in 
the year as a result of common research and development 
requirements between the businesses and the opportunity 
to eliminate redundant infrastructure costs. Throughout the 
remainder of the current year, additional integration will be 
carried out; however, we do not intend to make substantial 
changes to the business strategy, products, services and 
levels of support for our customers. We see this integration as 
a natural evolutionary step, building upon the successes that 
we have already achieved with our strategy of becoming a 
solutions and services provider. We will be reporting Invensys 
Operations Management as a single division going forward.
Process Systems
Invensys Process Systems (IPS) is a global technology, 
software and consulting organisation leading significant 
change in process manufacturing, plant optimisation,  
business operations and enterprise performance. We do this 
by helping our customers to take advantage of the real-time 
convergence of manufacturing and business operations.  
Our market-leading solutions include Foxboro field devices 
and control systems, Triconex® safety systems, SimSci-Esscor™ 
simulation and optimisation applications, and Avantis® 
enterprise asset management. 
Tying all of these capabilities together is the InFusion™ system, 
the world’s first truly open enterprise control system. The 
InFusion system provides a common engineering, automation 
and applications environment that connects, collects and 
leverages all the knowledge and data available from disparate 
systems and technologies, giving greater visibility to operators 
at many levels of business. Using the data and the interpretive 
tools provided by the InFusion system, customers can predict 
the benefits and disadvantages of changing elements of 
complex, interconnected systems. The InFusion system is an 
example of our commitment to being a new breed of open 
integrator for our clients, building systems that work with the 
available technologies for a specific situation, regardless of 
who makes them.
We are a highly valued strategic partner fundamentally 
attached to, and enabling, the world’s premier players in vital 
industries. Our customers are some of the world’s largest 
industrial organisations and include companies that operate 
large oil refineries; plants that process chemicals, gas, liquefied 
natural gas (LNG), power, pharmaceuticals and minerals; and 
pulp and paper mills. As these companies look to maximise 
their performance improvement strategies, they turn to us to 
uncover and advance new integrated approaches to plant, 
manufacturing, supply chain and business operations.
Wonderware also sits within Process Systems and is the 
world’s leading supplier of real-time operations management 
software, with an installed base of over 540,000 active licenses, 
helping customers to manage operations in over 125,000 
plants and facilities worldwide. Our Wonderware software 
transforms data into vital information in order to enable 
customers to synchronise their production operations with 
business objectives, obtaining the speed and flexibility to 
attain sustained profitability. Wonderware software is used  
by OEMs, systems integrators and by end customers in  
virtually every global industry, including food and beverage,  
oil and gas, power, water and wastewater, transportation,  
and mining and metals. It is also used within other Invensys 
division offerings.

offering includes consultancy in the initial project planning 
phase, solution and system design, project management,

Chairman’s Statement
We achieved a creditable operating profit performance with 
good results from our Invensys Operations Management  
and Invensys Rail businesses and a resilient performance from  
our Invensys Controls business in the face of very difficult 
market conditions. 
As I mentioned in last year’s Annual Report, I will be retiring 
from my role as Chairman and director of Invensys after 
this year’s AGM on 17 July 2009. In this, my final statement 
to shareholders, I would therefore like to reflect upon the 
significant achievements that the Group has made during  
the last six years.
I became Chairman of Invensys in 2003. Since then:

has been reduced to the point where we are now debt  
free and have over £300 million of net cash and deposits;
• 	 	 o u r 	 l e g a c y 	 li a b ili t i e s , 	 e x c l u d i n g 	 p e n s i o n s , 	 h a v e 	 r e d u c e d

nearly £1.5 billion in the year to 31 March 2003 to a net 
profit of £133 million;
• 	 	 o u r 	 m a r k e t 	 c a p i t a li s a t i o n 	 h a s 	 i n c r e a s e d 	 f ro m 	 £ 3 5 0 	 m il li o n	 
in 2003 to around £1.6 billion today;

to pay a dividend for the first time since 2003; and

and have been reclassified as a technology company, 
recognising the significant change in our businesses  
during recent years.
It is with some sadness that I have to note that our shareholders 
have lost some of the value of their investment in Invensys in 
recent times, although most of this has been mirrored by the 
declines shown by many companies in our sector: overall our 
relative performance has been in line with our peer group.
I would like to pay tribute to everyone who has been at Invensys 
during my time as Chairman, particularly Ulf Henriksson and 
my other Board colleagues, without whom the Invensys 
recovery could not have happened.
The Board and our people
I am delighted that Sir Nigel Rudd, who became a director 
and Deputy Chairman on 1 January 2009, will be taking over 
from me as Chairman after the AGM. Sir Nigel has a long and 
distinguished industrial career, and is currently Chairman of 
BAA and Pendragon and a non-executive director of BAE 
Systems and Sappi. His previous chairmanships include 
Alliance Boots, Pilkington, Williams Holdings and Kidde, and  
he was also a director and Deputy Chairman of Barclays Bank.

Chairman
Your company has had another good 
year despite the difficult economic 
conditions that have affected the 
global economy.  Invensys plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2009  |  9
Steve Hare, who has been our Chief Financial Officer since 
2006, informed the Board in November 2008 that he will 
be leaving Invensys at the end of May 2009 to pursue a new 
challenge. During his time with us, he has made a great 
contribution by achieving the strong financial position that 
we find ourselves in today, in particular in driving strong 
operational cash flow from each of our businesses and the 
signing of our new five year banking facility in July 2008.  
On behalf of the whole Board, I would like to thank Steve  
for his efforts and wish him every success in the future.
As previously announced, Wayne Edmunds, who is currently 
CFO of Invensys Process Systems, will become our Chief 
Financial Officer from 1 June 2009. Wayne joined the Group 
from Reuters America, where he had been SVP of Finance, and 
has previously held senior financial roles in the technology 
sector, including 17 years with Lucent Technologies. Wayne 
is relocating to the UK and will work out of the Group’s 
headquarters in London. He has been working with Steve Hare 
during the past two months to ensure a smooth handover  
of responsibilities.
Jean-Claude Guez, who has been a non-executive director 
since 2003, will not be seeking re-election at the AGM and 
will be retiring from the Board at the end of that meeting. 
It has been a pleasure working with Jean-Claude over the 
past six years and I am very grateful to him for his significant 
contributions and support during this time. We all wish him 
well in the future.
Dr Martin Read, formerly Chief Executive of LogicaCMG, and 
Francesco Caio, formerly Chief Executive of Cable & Wireless, 
will be joining the Board as non-executive directors on 18 July 
2009. I am delighted that Martin and Francesco have agreed 
to join the Board. They each have enormous experience 
running large international enterprises and I know that they will 
contribute greatly to the next stage of Invensys’ development.
The result of these changes is that Invensys continues to have 
a strong and experienced Board with a good balance of 
executive and non-executive directors. 
I would like to thank everyone at Invensys for their efforts 
during the past year. Many have had to deal with difficult 
markets which have posed additional challenges, and they  
have met these with considerable enthusiasm and expertise.
Dividend
The strength of the Group’s financial position, our excellent 
operational cash flow and the resilience being shown by 
our longer-cycle businesses within Invensys Operations 
Management and Invensys Rail has given the Board confidence 
that this is the right time to pay a dividend to shareholders for 
the first time since 2003. However, in light of current global 
economic conditions, the Board has decided to start at a 
prudent level which should allow a progressive dividend policy 
going forward. The Board has therefore recommended the 
payment of a final cash dividend for the year of 1.5p per share 
which, subject to approval by shareholders at the AGM on  
17 July 2009, will be paid on 7 August 2009 to shareholders  
on the register at 26 June 2009. 
Outlook
Relative to the market, there is strength in demand for our 
projects and solutions within our newly formed Invensys 
Operations Management division, and Invensys Rail has been 
successful in both its core and export markets. This gives us 
confidence that both will continue to perform well during 
the current financial year. Invensys Controls faces continued 
weakness in its markets and we continue to manage it for 
positive cash flow. 
Our strong financial position is enabling us to take further 
actions in the current year to protect profitability and cash flow 
across the Group and, based upon our current expectations, 
we anticipate that restructuring charges in the current year will 
be around £65 million. 
Overall we look to the future with confidence and expect  
to improve our performance in the current year.
Martin Jay 
Chairman 10  |  Invensys plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Chief Executive’s Statement
I am pleased to be able to report that we achieved a robust 
performance during the past year against the background of 
one of the most difficult global economies in decades.
We had strong order intake, which is testimony to our 
customers’ belief in our ability to deliver projects and solutions. 
We had strong cash flow across the Group, which has further 
strengthened our financial position; we are debt free with  
£309 million of net cash and deposits on the balance sheet. 
We have managed our pension assets and liabilities to reduce 
volatility and have agreed the future funding schedule with 
the Trustee of the UK Main Pension Scheme with no change 
to our annual payments. We have undertaken restructuring 
where there has been a need to realign capacity and improve 
productivity. This overall performance has given the Board 
confidence to recommend the resumption of dividend 
payments to shareholders. 
Strategy 
Our vision is to become the unquestioned leader in our 
markets. Our mission is to unlock our potential so that  
we can in turn help our customers to unlock theirs.
We believe that the key to maximising both our customers’  
and our own potential lies in an open approach. This belief 
shapes the way we work, our mindset and approach, and the 
solutions, technologies and products that we develop with  
our customers.
We are committed to collaboration, responsiveness and 
flawless execution.
As an unquestioned leader in providing industries with open 
thinking and open technologies, Invensys provides customers 
with the ability to respond more quickly to an ever-changing 
environment with confidence.
The development of standardised control systems technology 
reflects the movement away from customised equipment 
with proprietary operating systems towards platforms with 
open operating systems. In parallel, industry-standard 
communication specifications have been created to foster 
interoperability and create flexibility in system architectures 
and component selection. Open architectures also create the 
ability to draw information in real time from disparate parts of 
operations control and business support systems to enable 
higher levels of automation and optimisation.
We recognise the importance of these trends to our customers 
and support open architectures in our businesses. For 
example, Wonderware software was created specifically 
to allow broad levels of system integration and data 
communications. It is now in use in around one third of the 
world’s manufacturing plants and increasingly in infrastructure 
operations. The application of communication and integration 
technologies is constantly being expanded and refined, 
including their use across our other businesses. Currently we 
are introducing these technologies into the rail industry to 
support advancements for infrastructure management and 
signalling control rooms.
Social, economic and environmental trends reflect the 
increasing need to run capital-intensive operations such as 
manufacturing, mining, power generation and transportation 
more efficiently. Our businesses have adopted the position 
that we need to work with our customers on their terms. We 
open our thinking to new approaches, collaborate with our 
customers and open the door to new value propositions 
for our customers. This open-minded approach to solving 
customer business issues resulted in an impressive new order 
performance over the past year. 
Outside its core markets, Invensys Rail is developing its 
business in a number of other countries around the world. 
Rather than being a completely global player, we have 
selected a number of key markets in which to develop new 
regional businesses, and to continue our successful strategy of 
developing strong market share where we have an advantage 
in meeting the needs of customers. We have recently placed 
new business development teams into South East Asia, the 
Middle East, India, Germany and Latin America and we are 
already seeing success with several new orders. At the same 
time, we are driving a strong platform and component strategy 
through our development planning. We are developing new 
technical solutions that will facilitate the efficient operation of 
railways, in addition to the fundamental aspect of maintaining 
safety. In particular, we are investing in communications-based 
train control, intelligent operational control systems, European 
Railway Traffic Management System (ERTMS) and unified 
interlocking offerings, all of which we see as important pillars 
that will support our customers in the years to come. 
At Invensys Controls, we have taken aggressive action to 
realign capacity and resources following the declines in its 
consumer cyclical markets while continuing our intense focus 
on improving productivity and generating cash. We are

We believe that the key to maximising 
both our customers’ and our own 
potential lies in an open approach.

concentrating on emerging markets, geographic expansion  
of our heating segment and leveraging our global engineering 
capabilities to support our customers’ new product 
introductions. These actions taken together position us  
well to capitalise upon an eventual market recovery. 
Creation of Invensys Operations Management
The decision has been taken to integrate our three industrial 
automation businesses (Invensys Process Systems, 
Wonderware and Eurotherm) into a single division, Invensys 
Operations Management. This decision has been driven by 
the convergence of technologies that enable our customers 
to optimise their entire operations, the opportunity to create 
a continuum of solutions and services for the whole industrial 
market and the potential for cost savings from common sales 
and marketing, delivery and back office functions.
We have identified significant growth opportunities from  
more effective coverage of our customer base and attractive 
savings from using common approaches to business 
processes. Some integration activities began earlier in 
the year as a result of common research and development 
requirements between the businesses and the opportunity 
to eliminate redundant infrastructure costs. Throughout the 
remainder of the current year, additional integration will be 
carried out; however, we do not intend to make substantial 
changes to the business strategy, products, services and  
levels of support for our customers. We see this integration  
as a natural evolutionary step building upon the successes 
that we have already achieved with our strategy of becoming a 
solutions and services provider. We will be reporting Invensys 
Operations Management as a single division going forward.
Our industrial customers face an expanding set of challenges 
that go beyond the need for increased productivity. They face 
new pressures related to globalisation, shifting demographics, 
environmental issues, energy efficiency and greater complexity 
in the supply chain. They are seeking new ways to optimise 
their operations across their production assets, systems and 
processes. By bringing together our three businesses, we can 
harness technology, domain expertise and service delivery 
capability to provide agile real-time operations capability 
through integrated solutions backed by our deep industry 
knowledge. Our combined portfolio enables us to provide 
“right sized” solutions and delivery mechanisms that meet 
customers’ needs most effectively.
Branding
During the year, we carried out a review of our branding to 
ensure that our visual identity and brand structure reflect 
an open approach and provide differentiation from our 
competitors.
This review has resulted in the new logo and visual identity 
which you see within this document and which more readily 
reflect our status as a technology company, following the 
reclassification by FTSE in June 2008. It also achieves the aim 
of creating the visible differentiation from our competitors 
that we required. Just as importantly, we have simplified our 
multi-tier brand structure to create greater emphasis upon the 
Invensys name. As we gradually implement the new branding 
across the Group’s businesses over the next year, our people 
will become Invensys people and our renowned brands like 
Foxboro, Westinghouse and Wonderware, which are currently 
business names, will become product brands. We want our 
people to embrace our Invensys-wide aspiration to apply an 
open approach to unlocking potential.
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)
Invensys is committed to supporting the principles of 
economic success, environmental stewardship and social 
responsibility. We believe that by acting as a responsible 
corporate citizen, we will not only minimise business risk, 
but also enhance our reputation as a business partner. Our 
CSR report, which starts on page 22, contains more detailed 
descriptions of our achievements. I am pleased to announce 
that we have exceeded our targets for reductions of key 
performance indicators (KPIs) of consumption and waste 
production. I am also pleased that our injury and illness 
incident frequency rates have been reduced again since  
last year.
Invensys is producing a Sustainability Report, which will 
be available for download from our website. Also available 
from our website will be our revised and updated Code of 
Conduct, which summarises our goals and demonstrates our 
commitment to legal and ethical compliance. We believe that 
our performance and our values are things to be proud of and 
should be reported clearly and transparently, which is why we 
have made these documents available.
Our people
In 2008 we listened to our employees through an Invensys-
wide Employee Engagement Survey. We have reviewed and 
collated the results of the Survey, and I am pleased to report 
that our employees’ engagement with Invensys rates highly 
in comparison to other companies which have been through 
significant changes. Based on the findings of the Survey, our 
leaders are developing action plans to ensure that the voice 
of our people is heard. More information on our Employee 
Engagement Survey can be found in our CSR report.
Our people are a great strength, and I am delighted that we 
have such good people across Invensys who are dedicating 
their skills and time to help Invensys to succeed. Their 
commitment and achievements have helped us to deliver a 
robust performance at a time of considerable challenges, and  
I would like to thank them all for their contribution. We will 
strive to give our employees every reasonable encouragement 
and incentive to succeed.

Financial Review
Introduction and summary
I am pleased to report results for the year that in overall terms 
demonstrate that the Group has made a great deal of progress 
on a number of the specific operational and financial priorities 
set out at the start of this year, despite a backdrop of uncertain 
and difficult economic and financial markets. 
In terms of KPIs, highlights for the year include a cash 
conversion in excess of 120%, a free cash flow of £296 million 
and net cash and deposits at 31 March 2009 of £309 million. 
From a financial perspective, my priorities this year have 
centred on strengthening the Group’s balance sheet and cash 
position. These priorities have become increasingly critical as 
the year has progressed due to the economic environment, 
and they support the Group’s strategy of building a strong 
foundation for growth. The key achievements in the year to  
31 March 2009 in respect of this are as follows:
• 	 	 I n 	 J u l y 	 2 0 0 8 , 	 w e 	 s u c c e s s f u l l y 	 c o m p l e t e d 	 a 	 n ew 	 fi v e 	 y e a r	 
£400 million banking facility. This replaced the banking 
facilities put in place during the 2006 Refinancing and 
meets our anticipated financing requirements for the 
foreseeable future. 
• 	 	 W e 	 g e n e r a t e d 	 o p e r a t i n g 	 c a s h 	 fl ow 	 o f 	 £ 2 9 8 	 m il li o n 	 i n 	 t h e 	
year, resulting in cash conversion in excess of 120%. As 
noted in my report last year, my criterion for strong cash 
conversion is 90%+; however, this year we have increased 
our focus on working capital management, both by driving 
significant process improvements and by consistently 
exercising greater rigour in this area. This has helped us to 
achieve what I believe is a superior level of cash conversion. 
• 	 	 T h e 	 h i g h 	 l ev e l 	 o f 	 o p e r a t i n g 	 c a s h 	 fl ow 	 h a s 	 g r e a t l y 	
contributed to the free cash flow of £296 million. Other 
key contributing items are the £95 million we received in

Invensys Rail’s PPP contract and £27 million of income from 
the sale of our shareholding in CompAir Holdings Ltd. In 
addition, there has been an absence of finance costs as a 
r e s u l t 	 o f 	 t h e 	 G ro u p 	 b e c o m i n g 	 d e b t 	 f r e e 	 f o l l ow i n g 	 t h e 	 2 0 0 8	
Refinancing. As noted above, we ended the year with net 
cash and deposits of £309 million. 
• 	 	 W e 	 s u c c e s s f u l l y 	 c o n c l u d e d 	 t h e 	 t r i e n n i a l 	 v a l u a t i o n 	 o f	
our UK Main Pension Scheme with a funding plan that 
is not materially different from our previous plan. This 
has provided us with certainty in respect of funding 
requirements for the next three years, and we continue to 
have a scheme that is managed in a way that minimises the 
level of volatility within it. 
There have been a number of additional key developments in 
t h e 	 y e a r . 	 W e 	 h a v e 	 b e e n 	 r e s p o n s i v e 	 t o 	 t h e 	 m a r k e t 	 c o n d i t i o n s 	
impacting our businesses through implementation of a number 
of major restructuring programmes in our Process Systems and 
Invensys Controls businesses to improve the efficiency of our 
cost base in several areas, including manufacturing. Despite an 
increase in restructuring activity, we still generated an absolute 
level of profit for continuing operations of £142 million and an 
underlying EPS of 14.1p. Further initiatives are under way and 
contingency plans have been developed to help us mitigate 
against potential risks in this difficult environment. Finally, we 
fulfilled our promise to take the necessary actions to enable the 
Board to recommend a dividend.

Taxation
The tax charge for continuing operations was £23 million 
(2008: £30 million), which comprises a current year income 
tax charge of £39 million (2008: £38 million), offset by prior 
year credits of £7 million (2008: £3 million) which result from 
favourable resolution of historic tax disputes, and deferred 
tax credits of £9 million (2008: £5 million). As the Group is 
involved in worldwide operations, Invensys is subject to several 
factors which affect the tax charge and hence the effective tax 
rate. The key factors are the levels and mix of profitability in 
different jurisdictions in which the Group may or may not have 
offsetting tax losses, and the differing tax rates imposed in 
those jurisdictions.
Discontinued operations
The loss from discontinued operations of £9 million relates  
to £11 million of further provisions in respect of prior year 
disposals, mainly Burco and APV, offset by a tax credit of 
£2 million. During the prior year the APV, Safety, Reversing 
Valves and Burco businesses were sold, raising a gross cash 
consideration of £295 million. Profit from discontinued 
operations in the prior year was £167 million, including a gain 
on disposal of £170 million.
Net profit
Net profit decreased to £133 million (2008: £336 million), with 
the prior year including profits from discontinued operations 
of £167 million and the exceptional £95 million credit from the 
PPP settlement. The current year shows lower net finance costs 
and higher exceptional finance income compared with costs in 
the prior year.
Earnings per share
Basic EPS from continuing operations were 17.4p (2008: 21.1p). 
Underlying EPS from continuing operations were 14.1p (2008: 
17.0p), arising from lower operating profit and an increase in 
exceptional items, partly offset by lower finance costs.
Free cash flow
Free cash flow for the year was £296 million (2008: £64 million), 
driven by improved operating cash flow, lower finance costs, 
the receipt of the PPP settlement and proceeds from the sale  
of financial investments.

Capital structure
The Group’s capital structure is as follows:
1
 Restated for the IFRIC 14 adjustment to the pension liabilities.

Comprising:   
 – Equity holders of parent 553 311
 – Minority interests 87 69
 640 380
Total equity
Total equity increased by £260 million due to net profit in the 
year of £133 million, translation exchange gains of £133 million 
and a pension actuarial gain of £10 million, partially offset by 
the effect of IFRIC 14 on the pension liabilities of £20 million.
Minority interests
The minority interest balance is £87 million (2008: £69 million), 
the majority of which relates to the interests of the minority in 
Baan Company NV (in liquidation).
Net cash
Net cash was £286 million (2008: £73 million) with an  
additional £23 million (2008: £nil) held on deposit, resulting 
in a total net cash and deposits balance of £309 million. The 
improvement of £213 million is largely due to the free cash flow 
of £296 million which includes a receipt of £95 million from  
the PPP settlement and £32 million proceeds from the sale  
of financial investments. Offsetting these are payments of  
£50 million for the acquisitions of SAT Corporation and 
Quantum Engineering Inc. 
On 7 May 2008, the Group repaid and cancelled Term Loans 
due in January 2011 of US$190 million and euro 75 million. The 
repayment of the principal amounts, together with accrued 
interest, was made out of cash balances. On 8 May 2008, the 
Group cancelled bonding facilities of £100 million due for 
expiry in December 2010. There were no early redemption 
penalties on either of these transactions.
Capital employed
Capital employed increased by £47 million to £354 million in 
the year, mainly attributable to an increase in goodwill and 
intangibles due to acquisitions of £48 million and exchange 
of £107 million; these increases were offset by a reduction 
in receivables including the receipt of the £95 million PPP 
settlement. The return on operating capital has reduced  
to 49.0% (2008: 53.3%).
Pension liabilities
The IAS 19 valuation of pension assets and liabilities has been 
updated at 31 March 2009, resulting in a net pension deficit of  
£222 million (2008: £218 million); this includes a restriction  
on asset recognition in two of the smaller schemes of £1 million  
(2008: £1 million). In the prior year, the net pension deficit 
includes £1 million of pension assets. The overall increase of  
£4 million is primarily attributable to exchange losses of  
£36 million and the IAS 19 finance charge of £35 million, offset 
by deficit reduction payments of £28 million, contributions 
related to the disposal of a financial asset of £10 million, other 
contributions in excess of service charge of £18 million and an 
actuarial gain of £10 million.
IFRIC 14 (IAS 19 – The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, 
Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction) is 
effective for the first time and has been adopted by the Group. 
This has the effect of increasing the pension liability for the  
UK Main Pension Scheme by £86 million to £94 million at  
31 March 2009; the liability at 31 March 2008 has been restated 
in accordance with IFRIC 14 by £66 million to £76 million. 
Details are shown in Note 25 to the Financial Statements.
For the Group, after applying IFRIC 14, the overall pension 
liabilities at 31 March 2009 are £308 million; the overall 
liabilities at 31 March 2008 have been restated in accordance 
with IFRIC 14 by £66 million to £284 million. 16  |  Invensys plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Financial Review continued
Under the requirements of the Pensions Act 2004, the UK Main 
Pension Scheme was subject to a triennial actuarial review with 
a valuation date of 31 March 2008. The valuation disclosed a 
funding shortfall of £285 million using assumptions agreed 
between the Company and the Trustee of the UK Main  
Pension Scheme.
The updated funding valuation has made no significant change 
to the annual cash flows arising under the funding plan for the 
next three years, which amount to £37 million per annum in the 
next financial year, rising approximately £1 million per annum 
thereafter. The plan extends to March 2017. 
The investment strategy determined by the Trustee continues 
to reflect the mature nature of the UK Main Pension Scheme, 
with the assets predominantly invested in bond or “bond like” 
instruments.
Dividend
The Board is recommending a final dividend of 1.5p per share 
(2008: £nil). The proposed dividend is covered 9.4 times by 
underlying earnings. 
Summary and conclusions
As noted in the introduction to this Financial Review, I am 
pleased with the progress and achievements made in the year 
to 31 March 2009, particularly given the difficult nature of the 
markets and financial environment. The strong focus on cash 
and the balance sheet has resulted in the delivery of some 
excellent results in this area, including ending the year with a 
net cash and deposits balance in excess of £300 million. 
This is a strong foundation on which to move forward into the 
new fiscal year, when we will continue to focus on the themes 
from this year, including a drive for strong cash generation, 
higher levels of productivity and efficiency and successful 
management of our pension liabilities. I am pleased to hand 
this position over to my successor, Wayne Edmunds, and wish 
him every success.

Financial Policies
Statement of accounting policies
The Group’s Financial Statements have been prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) in issue that are endorsed by the European Commission 
and effective at 31 March 2009. The Group’s accounting 
policies under IFRSs are set out in the accounting policies 
section in the Group Financial Statements.
The Parent Company Financial Statements have been  
prepared in accordance with UK Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice (UK GAAP) and include details of  
the Company’s accounting policies.
Treasury policy
The Group’s treasury policy is approved by the Board and 
seeks to ensure that:
• 	 	 a p p ro p r i a t e 	 fi na n c i a l 	 r e s o u rc e s 	 a r e 	 a v a il a b l e 	 f o r 	 t h e	
maintenance and development of the Group’s businesses;
• 	 	 t h e 	 fi n a n c i a l 	 r i s k 	 o f 	 c u r r e n c y , 	 i n t e r e s t 	 r a t e 	 a n d 	 c o u n t e r p a r t y	
credit exposure is understood, measured and managed 
appropriately; and
• 	 	 t h e 	 T r e a s u r y 	 D e p a r t m e n t 	 o p e r a t e s 	 a s 	 a 	 c o s t 	 c e n t r e 	 a n d 	 
that no speculative transactions are undertaken.
Funding, liquidity and treasury management
Operating within the strict controls of the Group’s treasury 
policy, the Treasury Department manages this financial risk, 
ensuring that sufficient funding and liquidity are available to 
meet the expected needs of the Group. In addition to the free 
cash flow of the Group, Invensys adopts a prudent approach 
to liquidity management using a mixture of long-term debt 
facilities and short-term cash deposits. Core funding and 
guarantee issuance is provided by a bank facility which  
matures in July 2013.
Interest rate risk
The Group’s policy is to set the proportion of fixed- and 
floating-rate debt, taking into account several factors 
including: 
• 	 	 t h e 	 fi n a n c i a l 	 l ev e r a g e 	 o f 	 t h e 	 G ro u p ; 	
• 	 	 t h e 	 p ro fi t a b ili t y 	 o f 	 t h e 	 G ro u p 	 i n 	 r e l a t i o n 	 t o 	 t h e 	 b u s i n e s s 	
cycle; and 
• 	 t h e 	 a b s o l u t e 	 l ev e l s 	 o f 	 i n t e r e s t 	 r a t e s .
To implement this policy the Group uses fixed-rate borrowings, 
interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements and currency 
swaps to manage its interest rate exposure.
As at 31 March 2009 and 31 March 2008, in line with the  
Group having a net cash position, Invensys had no significant 
fixed-rate borrowings.
Currency risk
Transaction exposure
Currency transaction exposure arises when the Group’s 
businesses face revenues or costs in a currency other than their 
own. The incidence of this risk varies across the Group and is 
subject to change. Usually, however, the majority of revenues 
and costs will be in the functional currency of the business unit 
undertaking the transaction. Where this is not the case and the 
exposure is significant, it is the Group’s policy for businesses to 
hedge their exposure.
The Group is also subject to exchange risk in making bids, 
particularly on major contracts. The assumption of a specific 
exchange rate within a bid would lead to a change in the 
anticipated margin on the contract should a bid be successful; 
this risk is hedged if significant.
The Group predominantly uses forward currency contracts  
to manage transaction exposure.
Translation exposure
The majority of the Group’s operating capital is employed in 
overseas locations and is denominated in foreign currencies, 
particularly US dollars. As a consequence, changes in 
exchange rates affect both net asset values and reported 
results. This risk is not hedged directly but, to the extent that 
the Group has debt, any that is held in foreign currencies would 
reduce the level of net assets exposed to currency fluctuations. 
The interest expense of any such debt might then also reduce 
the level of earnings exposed to exchange rate movements.
Credit risk
The Group monitors the identity of the counterparties 
with whom it deposits cash and transacts other financial 
instruments so as to control exposure to any territory or 
institution. As far as it is both feasible and practical to do so, 
cash is held centrally by Treasury. Risk is assessed using ratings 
from major credit rating agencies.
Further information on the risks arising from financial 
instruments is included in Note 22 to the Group  
Financial Statements. 18  |  Invensys plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Invensys Operations Management
Process Systems designs, manufactures, installs, tests and 
commissions software and computer-based hardware 
for the automation and regulation of operations, 
the management of certain administrative functions 
of manufacturing businesses, and simulations of 
manufacturing process operations. It delivers solutions 
and consultancy services which improve the productivity 
and safety of customers’ plants.
Markets
Despite the current global economic climate, many of our 
major end markets, particularly in the oil and gas, refining and 
power sectors, have shown resilience. We have seen some 
delays in the award of contracts for some greenfield projects, 
often caused by retendering by main contractors so that 
customers gain the benefit of reduced commodity prices. 
However, the long-term nature of investment decisions within 
these sectors and the needs of customers to improve the 
efficiency of existing plants using our advanced applications 
and solutions such as SimSci-Esscor and InFusion have meant 
that the impact upon our project business has been limited. 
We have seen some weakness in demand and pricing pressure 
within the measurement and instrumentation product sector.
Regionally, there has been continued strength in the Middle 
East and South America, driven by demand for solutions and 
services from the oil and gas sector. In the North America 
market, we have seen increased demand for upgrades and 
efficiency improvements. The level of investment in new 
facilities in Asia Pacific was generally strong, including the 
Chinese nuclear power generating market, but there was a 
slowdown in demand within Europe and Africa, with delays  
on investment decisions caused by the weakening economy.

Developments
During the year, we made significant investments in sales 
and marketing in order to differentiate ourselves from our 
competitors by strengthening our ability to sell high value 
solutions to our customers. Many of our solution offerings 
enable customers to improve the efficiency and financial 
performance of their operations. The benefits of this 
investment are reflected in the increase in order intake  
for the year. 
With the decline in Europe, we are realigning our capacity 
in that market and increasing it in emerging markets. This, 
together with other actions, resulted in a restructuring charge 
in the year of £17 million, which is expected to provide a 
compelling financial return. 
We achieved considerable success in gaining large project 
orders around the world, as we gained benefits from the recent 
investment in sales and marketing.

remote workflow, procedural and general task management 
within industrial plants, typically focussed around asset 
maintenance and compliance applications.  
Performance
Order intake increased by 19% at CER to £1,187 million (2008:  
£870 million), including a number of longer-term solutions 
orders. This reflected the benefit of the increased investment 
of £14 million made into sales and marketing as well as 
our continued investment in research and development. 
Orders grew in all regions and in addition there was a good 
improvement in the size of the pipeline of order prospects. 
Revenue in the period was down 1% at CER at £951 million 
(2008: £830 million) with reduced product revenue offset by  
a good performance in the Middle East.
Operating profit was down 20% at CER at £108 million 
(2008: £117 million) due mainly to the significantly increased 
investments mentioned above. Operating margin was 11.4% 
(2008: 14.1%) with a good improvement in the second half  
of the year. Operating cash flow was £121 million (2008:  
£103 million), resulting in a further improvement in cash 
conversion for the year to 112% (2008: 88%). 
Eurotherm 
Eurotherm provides control, data and measurement 
instrumentation products, solutions and services to 
manage specific parameters of the manufacturing  
process, such as temperature and pressure, for the  
global industrial control and process markets. Eurotherm 
has global expertise in many industrial markets with  
dedicated specialists in key areas including life sciences, 
glass manufacturing, plastics, renewable energy and the 
heat treatment of metals (for industries such as avionics 
and automotive).
Markets
Our markets, particularly in Western Europe and North 
America, have been affected by the economic downturn, with 
a significant deterioration in demand during the second half 
of the year. This was seen across many sectors as customers, 
particularly those directly exposed to the consumer, cut capital 
and maintenance expenditure in the face of significant volume 
reductions in their businesses.
Developments
During the year, we launched EPower™, a new range of 
multiphase power controllers which improve the efficiency 
of power consumption within a manufacturing plant. Initial 
installations are demonstrating up to 5% improvements in 
energy efficiency and we expect sales of this product to 
grow with the increased potential customer base within 
Invensys Operations Management. Also we are enhancing the 
Eurotherm distributed control system (DCS) product so that it 
can address the middle range market in which we currently do 
not have a significant presence. This development will enable 
Invensys Operations Management to provide customers with 
the entire DCS spectrum.
Performance
Orders were down 13% at CER at £116 million (2008:  
£119 million). Revenue was down 10% at CER at £118 million 
(2008: £115 million), mainly due to significantly reduced 
product revenue.
Operating profit was down 62% at CER at £4 million (2008:  
£9 million) caused by the effect of reduced revenue and 
around £1 million of costs associated with a non-recurring 
contractual and operational issue in South Korea. Operating 
margin was 3.4% (2008: 7.8%). However, operating cash flow 
was strong at £10 million (2008: £7 million).
Outlook for Invensys Operations Management
We believe that our strength in the oil and gas refining and 
power sectors will provide resilience driven by the continued 
investment in capacity in developing markets and our 
customers’ focus on improving the efficiency and financial 
performance of their existing operations. In addition, we 
intend to realise the revenue potential and cost savings arising 
from the integration of these businesses into a single division. 
Although the product businesses within Process Systems 
and Eurotherm are likely to continue to experience ongoing 
declines, we expect that the creation of the integrated division 
will provide benefits in the current year. Overall we expect to 
make progress in the current year.

Invensys Rail
Invensys Rail is a multinational leader in delivering state-
of-the-art railway control and communication solutions. 
We enable the world’s railways to help meet the ever-
increasing demand for rail services by providing a range 
of solutions that safely and cost-effectively increase the 
capacity of their networks by increasing frequency and 
maximising operational effectiveness. 
Our broad offering ranges from highly complex integrated 
control centre solutions that supervise and control 
complete railways to sophisticated train-based systems 
that automate train operation and protection, interlocking 
systems that ensure safe running across a network and a 
complete range of trackside products. 
Markets
The world’s rail market remained strong during the year with 
spending underpinned by the need to improve mainline rail 
and mass transit infrastructure, recognising the importance 
of rail as an environmentally sustainable and economically 
efficient means of transport for both passengers and freight. 
In addition, spending shows signs of increasing in some 
markets such as the US and China, where government stimulus 
packages recognise the employment benefits of major capital 
projects during these recessionary times. 
In our core markets, the UK continued at the high levels of 
activity seen in recent years and Spain also saw good levels 
of spending, particularly on the further development of its 
high-speed line network. In the US, the market was satisfactory 
except that demand for trackside and onboard equipment 
softened during the year due to reduced amounts of freight 
traffic caused by the recession. Australia remained good 
despite some deferral of expenditure on new lines for mineral 
freight traffic.

Outside our core markets, we are seeing significant demand in 
many countries, particularly in Latin America and Asia, both in 
terms of stimulus packages and the need to improve transport 
infrastructure to enable economic development.
Developments
During the year we achieved significant success in winning 
contracts both in our core and export markets. In the UK, 
we were awarded several further contracts by Network 
Rail including the enabling signalling works for major 
reconfiguration of Reading Station. We have recently been 
awarded a contract by Crossrail Ltd to work with it to evaluate  
signalling and control solutions for the Crossrail project. Both 
mainline and mass transit rail systems will be considered 
along with other key operational needs for the future railway. 
In Spain, we were awarded £155 million of contracts for the 
signalling of the Madrid-Valencia high-speed line and received 
a letter of award for a £44 million contract for the Barcelona-
Figueras high-speed line.
In export markets, we were awarded a £123 million contract 
by Singapore’s Land Transit Authority for their new Downtown 
Line and also were awarded a similar sized contract for the 
refurbishment of a mass transit line in Latin America. We won 
contracts for installing ERTMS signalling for the Ankara-Konya 
high-speed line in Turkey and for suburban lines in Auckland, 
New Zealand. 
In September 2008, we acquired Quantum Engineering, Inc. 
from its management for a cash consideration of £20 million. 
Based in Jacksonville, Florida, Quantum specialises in  
onboard equipment and positive train control. This acquisition 
will increase our profile within the US railroad marketplace 
while creating new sales opportunities within the operational 
side of its existing US railroad customers. This technology will 
be marketed globally through our international operations, 
opening up the technology to significant new markets.
Performance
Order intake during the year more than doubled compared 
with the prior year to £968 million (2008: £429 million), up 109% 
at CER with strong performance in the UK and Spain together 
with the two large export contracts in Singapore and Latin 
America. Revenue was 9% higher at CER at £636 million (2008: 
£539 million) with particularly strong growth in Spain. 
Operating profit rose to £134 million (2008: £93 million),  
an increase of 32% at CER reflecting the substantial increase 
in volume and a favourable sales mix. Operating margin was 
higher at 21.1% (2008: 17.3%) due to a favourable sales mix and 
contract completions. Operating cash flow was £128 million 
(2008: £93 million), and cash conversion was 96%.
Outlook
The very high levels of orders received in the year gives us 
good visibility into the current year and our pipeline of export 
order prospects remains strong. Although we may see delays 
in the award of some projects and weakness in the US freight 
rail market, we expect that this will be more than compensated  
for by the number of packages around the world involving  
rail infrastructure that are being put in place to stimulate 
economic activity.

Invensys Controls
Invensys Controls designs, engineers and manufactures 
products, components, systems and services used 
in appliances, heating, air conditioning/cooling and 
refrigeration products across a wide range of industries  
in residential and commercial markets, together with 
utility monitoring services in the UK. 
Markets
Market conditions were very challenging across all of the 
division’s markets with significantly reduced customer 
production across most sectors driven by reductions in 
consumer demand in most countries as a result of the current 
economic climate. This was compounded by inventory 
reductions throughout the supply chain, particularly in the 
second half as customers adjusted their capacity in line with 
the reduced demand. 
Developments
Our focus during the year has been on reacting with agility to 
changes in our markets by rapidly adjusting our manufacturing 
capacity to align it with the reduced levels of customer 
demand. These actions have helped to minimise the effect 
of the decline in revenue upon operating profit and cash 
performance. Overheads and factory headcount have been 
significantly reduced as we continue the focus upon improving 
productivity within our plants. Headcount has been reduced  
by 27% to 7,517.
In addition to controlling costs, we are also reducing our 
manufacturing capacity in North America by the closure of 
two further facilities in the US and one in Mexico, consolidating 
manufacturing from these plants into another existing facility  
in Matamoros, Mexico. Total restructuring charges in the year 
were £23 million.

Performance
Orders during the period were £535 million (2008:  
£618 million), down 25% at CER. This decrease was higher  
than the market reduction in shipments due to the effect of the 
reduction in volumes at the higher end of the North American 
market and the loss of a major water heating contract last year. 
Revenue for the year was down slightly less than orders at  
£579 million (2008: £624 million), a 20% decrease at CER. 
Despite the significant reduction in volumes, we have had 
success in protecting the profit and cash performance of 
the business through prior period pricing actions, plant 
productivity improvements and restructuring benefits, offset  
by increased warranty costs arising mainly from supplier 
product issues. Operating profit was down 58% at CER at  
£33 million (2008: £69 million).
However, operating cash flow was very strong at £74 million 
(2008: £85 million), with 224% cash conversion (2008: 123%). 
We spent £18 million during the year on restructuring, 
therefore making an overall cash contribution to the Group  
of £56 million.
Outlook
We are not currently anticipating any improvements in the 
division’s markets and indeed we expect them to deteriorate 
further in the short term. However, we expect that Invensys 
Controls will continue to be profitable and cash generative 
based upon the rigorous control of costs and the increasing 
benefits of restructuring projects as the year progresses.

Corporate Social Responsibility
Invensys is committed to supporting the principles of 
economic success, environmental stewardship and social 
responsibility. We believe that by acting as a responsible 
corporate citizen we will not only minimise business risk, 
but also enhance our reputation as a business partner and 
employer. Further, by advocating and resourcing staff 
development and community engagement, we believe 
that we can differentiate Invensys from other employers 
and create a business where people want to work.
The Invensys Code of Conduct
The Invensys Code of Conduct is the central element of the 
Invensys Compliance Programme. It reflects our commitment 
to acting with integrity and in accordance both with local law 
and our own legal and ethical standards. The Code of Conduct 
applies to all employees in every part of the world, and is also 
intended to act as a guide to acceptable and unacceptable 
business conduct by agents, suppliers and customers. The 
Code of Conduct is expanded upon by policies approved by 
the Board.
As part of a review process of our Compliance Programme, 
and in line with our new Invensys brand and positioning, the 
Code of Conduct was reviewed and redesigned in 2009. This 
new version is to be made available to Invensys employees 
worldwide, and is intended to reflect the changing world 
in which Invensys operates. It will also be available on our 
website. The Code of Conduct is the centrepiece of awareness-
raising activities around the Compliance Programme. 
The Code of Conduct sets out many of the principles of our 
approach to corporate citizenship, including our commitment 
to environmental responsibility, workplace safety and a diverse 
workforce.
Compliance training
The Invensys Code of Conduct and policies are supported 
by training, delivered online as computer-based training and 
also in classroom environments. As part of the Compliance 
Programme, new and expanded training to accompany 
the new Code of Conduct is to be released shortly for all 
employees, accompanied by dedicated training for selected 
employee groups in areas of legal compliance. The training 
programme will help our employees to understand their rights 
and obligations as employees of Invensys, and to be aware of 
situations where caution needs to be exercised in their work.
Sustainability 
We believe that our commitment to sustainability improves our 
prospects of successfully achieving our long-term business 
goals. 
Below we summarise some of our key accomplishments over 
the past year:

Report, which will be available on our website. 
While we are proud of our accomplishments, as a responsible 
company we acknowledge that we have more to do, and look 
forward to reporting on further progress next year.
Sustainability strategy
Over the past year, we strengthened our commitment to 
sustainability by embedding a more formal sustainability 
approach into the strategy and operations of Invensys. Our 
sustainability strategy and annual goals can be summarised in 
three basic aspects that will provide focus for our efforts. 
First, we are committed to reducing our environmental 
footprint. This means that we are focussed on minimising 
waste streams, and efficiently using energy, water and other 
resources. Beyond traditional manufacturing operations, we 
are looking to identify future improvement opportunities 
within product life cycles. We will work cooperatively with 
suppliers to embed sustainable practices in our supply chain 
and to provide offerings (products and services) to support 
our customers’ sustainability objectives. We will continue 
to respond to environmental issues resulting from historical 
manufacturing operations.
Second, we are committed to caring for the well-being of 
employees and communities. This means that we will support 
the “I want to work here” culture within the workplace by 
developing programmes to improve employee wellness. 
We will continue to improve our safety performance and 
compliance with all relevant legal and regulatory requirements. 
We will provide focus to and enhance our community 
involvement efforts.
Finally, we believe that communicating our performance 
transparently is vitally important. This means that we will make 
our successes and challenges public, and accurately report 
financial, environmental and social metrics with material 
impacts on sustainability.
Approximately 8,100 Invensys employees responded to a 
global sustainability survey in early 2009. Approximately 74% 
of responding employees agreed that Invensys conducts 
business in a responsible manner with respect to social, 
environmental and ethical issues (an additional 20% remained 
neutral on the statement). With respect to community  Invensys plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2009  |  23
involvement programmes, employees showed the strongest 
support for ongoing health and environmental initiatives. 
Additionally, 66% of responding employees agreed that they 
understand the concept of sustainability and how Invensys 
is implementing it in our businesses (an additional 24% 
remained neutral on the statement). As this is our first year of 
our formalised sustainability approach, we are pleased with 
the results and we are using the data to improve our employee 
communication and sustainability activities.
Environment
Over the prior year, we continued to collect data on our 
environmental KPIs from our manufacturing locations. As 
a business we set a 5% absolute reduction target at our 
manufacturing locations at the beginning of last year, and have 
set another 5% absolute reduction as a target for next year. 
We have focussed on driving efficiency projects at our 
manufacturing locations and have seen strong year-on-
year reductions in energy, CO
2
, water, hazardous waste and 
non-hazardous waste at levels exceeding our 5% reduction 
targets. However, we recognise that the challenging economic 
environment over the past year has impacted usage of many 
manufacturing facilities and, in conjunction with our efficiency 
projects, has created a higher than expected reduction in the 
absolute KPIs. 
Our Chippenham, UK location has taken steps to move 
towards a “bin-less” office where traditional waste bins have 
been replaced by miniature desktop recyclers, which collect 
waste paper, card, plastic and glass. The scheme has proved 
to be very successful and waste being sent to landfill has been 
reduced by about 36%. Employees in our Chihuahua, Mexico 
location conducted a thorough review of the facility to identify 
the primary users of electrical power. By simply turning off 
lights, refrigeration, and evaporative equipment when not in 
use, a 15% reduction in electrical use was achieved in the first 
month. In Foxboro, US, operators installed controls and float 
switches on the plating line which yielded a 17% reduction in 
the volume of water used and an 11% reduction in the volume 
of wastewater treated.
We are pleased to report for the first time our total CO

airline travel and our non-manufacturing locations.

 nm = not measured.
Our carbon footprint is driven primarily by our manufacturing 
operations (54%), with lower contributions from non-
manufacturing sites (21%), global fleet vehicles (10%) and 
business airline travel (15%). Going forward, we will look at 
ways to manage these other sources closely.
The Board continues to be briefed on Group environmental 
performance and receives monthly reports on any 
violations, citations, environmental releases or fines issued 
by governmental bodies. In the past year, there were no 
environmental releases. However, the Safetran facility in 
Louisville, US, received a notice of violation associated with 
a gap in record keeping from the Kentucky Department for 
Environmental Protection. Corrective actions were instituted 
and no further notices were issued. The Invensys Controls 
facility in Long Beach, US, received a notice of violation from  
the California State Water Resources Control Board for failing 
to make timely payment of the annual fee associated with 
waste discharge. The fee was subsequently paid and no fines 
or further notices were issued.
Health and safety in the workplace
Our strong commitment to safety continues to be reflected in 
our injury/illness incident frequency rates. From April 2008 to 
the end of March 2009, the TRCIR fell 45% from 0.56 to 0.31 
and the LWCIR fell 32% from 0.22 to 0.15. Going into next 
year, we have a goal of continuous improvement in our safety 
performance. We are proud of our significant accomplishments 
in reducing injuries and injury rates, but recognise that we still 
have more progress to make to keep all employees safe.
Beyond traditional injury/illness incident frequency rate 
measurements, we have developed a single Safety Awareness 
Metric (SAM) to drive and measure overall safety performance. 
It measures several leading EHS&S activities at an operational 
level, such as on-time closure of corrective actions, completion 
of EHS training, safety tours/inspections and environmental KPI 
improvements. The SAM is measured and reported monthly, 
and it is integrated into the overall metrics of each of the 
business groups. 
Environmental KPIs 24  |  Invensys plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Our Chief Executive reviews the health and safety performance 
data, including any major incidents, on a monthly basis and 
presents it to the Board. We are pleased to report that there 
were no major incidents, work-related fatalities, or fines issued 
by governmental bodies during the past year. Our Eurotherm 
location in Rockford, US, received a citation from the US 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration concerning 
training and measures to protect employees from hazardous 
chemicals. Corrective actions were instituted and no fines or 
further notices were issued. 
We continued to promote wellness programmes in an effort  
to improve the overall health and well-being of our employees. 
Approximately 97% of our major locations offer wellness 
programmes with an average of four programmes per site. 
The most common wellness programmes offered include 
immunisation, medical tests, local gym access, and healthy 
lifestyle information. Employees responding to a wellness 
survey in early 2009 expressed interest in a variety of wellness 
programme offerings, and the majority of Invensys employees 
recognise that participation in wellness programmes provides 
broad benefits to Invensys as well as to themselves. In an 
effort to continue to promote the “I want to work here” culture, 
Invensys has committed to providing an environment that will 
encourage employees to improve their personal wellness. 
Our Values
Our vision and mission act as a guide in meeting our business 
objectives, but to be meaningful they must be underpinned 
by a set of values that we all share, which are the basis of how 
we conduct ourselves and of how we do business. This year we 
have continued to create an “I want to work here” culture that  
is based on the strong foundation laid in previous years.
In 2007 we launched our mission, vision and objectives. In 2008 
we launched our Invensys values of innovation, agility, integrity, 
meritocracy and courage. More than 1,000 employees took 
part in workshops and meetings to help us develop these. 
At our 2009 Annual Leadership Meeting, five awards were won 
by individuals and teams who exemplify the Invensys Values. 
In 2009, we will drive “Living the Values” in the workplace to 
embed them in our everyday practices.
Diversity in the workforce
As a global company with employees across the world, 
Invensys seeks to recruit the best individual for every position, 
regardless of gender, ethnic or national origin, religion, 
sexuality or any personal characteristic not relevant to their 
work. We continue to respect and support the principles of 
the European Convention on Human Rights and the UNGC by 
ensuring we comply with the labour laws of the countries in 
which we operate and by creating an inclusive and respectful 
culture for our diverse workforce. The Group seeks to  
ensure that fair consideration is given to applications for 
employment received from people with disabilities and we 
offer continued employment, training and advancement  
where possible to employees who are or become temporarily 
or permanently disabled. 
Dialogue with employee representatives and employees 
The Invensys European Employees Forum, together with 
elected employee representatives, promotes dialogue 
with management. This group has regular meetings. 
Globally we communicate with our employees through local 
communications networks, town hall meetings, “skip level” 
meetings and employee newsletters. 
Planning for future skills gaps
Top talent in the organisation is assessed and developed 
through our annual Organisational Capability Review (OCR). 
Through this review we manage internal global career 
progression for key leaders in line with our succession plans 
and also identify and develop future talent. In addition, we  
use this process to ensure that leaders who are not performing 
are given this feedback and given an opportunity to improve 
their performance. 
Aligning individuals with the Group to safeguard  
our future 
During the year we used our goal deployment and 
performance management tools and processes to help 
our employees to understand the organisational goals and 
objectives of Invensys and align them with their own. Line 
managers are required to hold annual performance reviews 
with all employees who report to them, where they can discuss 
their performance, set personal objectives for the coming 
year and, where appropriate, create a personal development 
plan. Approximately 10,500 employees are participating 
in our performance management processes with goals for 
2008/09 and 2009/10 on our integrated system which was 
rolled out in 2008. This equates to 51% of all employees and 
100% of managerial and professional employees. Other staff, 
such as manufacturing employees, are participating in local 
performance management processes.
Competitive remuneration in an evolving environment
One of our values is meritocracy and we strive to offer 
competitive remuneration and benefits in each market in 
which we participate through a system of differentiated 
base pay, cash and equity bonuses based on the individual’s 
contributions to Invensys’ success.
Investing for the future with training 
We are continuing our commitment to target a 2% of payroll 
investment in our employees’ learning and development in 
each Invensys business through a newly established Centre 
of Expertise that was established in March 2009. This practice 
provides support for employees seeking to gain professional 
qualifications, access to leadership development programmes 
and many other learning interventions that enhance their 
knowledge, skills and abilities. 
Employee engagement 
In April 2008 we launched our first Invensys-wide Employee 
Engagement Survey. The response rate was 79%, indicating 
that employees have a strong interest in sharing feedback 
and ideas about how we can improve our Invensys culture. 
Further details regarding health and safety performance can be found  
on our website.

Based on industry benchmarks, Invensys-wide results show 
that employee engagement in Invensys rates highly against 
other companies that have gone through a significant 
transformation, as Invensys has done over the past several 
years. Also, three key drivers for engagement were identified  
at an Invensys level: 
• 	 l e a d e r s h i p 	
• 	 t a l e n t 	 m a n a g e m e n t 	 a n d 	 d ev e l o p m e n t 	
• 	 c u s t o m e r 	 f o c u s 	
Business and functional teams have been working to 
implement action plans they created in response to Survey 
feedback. In 2009, leaders are reporting on their progress 
against action plan commitments during Invensys deep dive 
reviews with the Chief Executive, sharing success stories and 
lessons learnt. The goal is to increase employee engagement 
and spread best practices across businesses and geographies.
We continue to strive to make Invensys a place where high 
performing people choose to be, where they can enhance their 
lives and careers and are motivated to perform at their best 
and continue to better their performance.
Community and charitable investment
We continue to recognise the importance of our relationship 
with the communities in which we operate and encourage 
our businesses and employees to provide support. Given 
the nature of our activities and the structure of the Group, 
community contact is currently organised at a local level by 
site leaders. Our businesses provide a variety of programmes 
such as matching gifts, sponsorship of activities and paid 
volunteer time to allow our employees to participate actively in 
community events. 
Examples of projects our businesses have been involved in 
include:

The businesses within Invensys are encouraged to engage 
with good causes to build relationships in the community and 
enhance workplace morale and cohesiveness. We believe 
that there is a business benefit in doing so as well as a social 
benefit, and we remain committed to acting as a good 
corporate citizen. 26  |  Invensys plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Risks and Uncertainties
Invensys operates globally in varied markets and is affected by 
a number of risks inherent in its activities, not all of which are 
within its control.
The Risk Committee has accountability for overseeing the risk 
management processes and procedures, and reports to the 
Board through the Audit Committee on the key risks facing the 
business. It also monitors the mitigating actions put in place by 
the relevant operational managers to address identified risks. 
As part of the regular review of activities, disclosures in the 
Annual Report have been revised to reflect the global changes 
to the business and the competitive business environment in 
which it operates.
The principal risks, which could cause the Group’s actual 
results to vary materially from historic and expected results,  
are set out below.
The Group faces intense competition, and failure  
to maintain a competitive and technologically  
advanced product range could reduce its margins  
and revenue growth
Invensys operates in highly competitive markets and 
the Group’s products and services are characterised by 
continually evolving industry standards and rapidly changing 
technology, driven by the demands of the Group’s customers. 
Failure to keep pace with technological changes and system 
or application requirements in the industrial sectors may 
result in loss of market share and lower margins. In addition, 
competitors are consolidating and offering a widened product 
portfolio to provide integrated or bundled solutions to 
customers, thus providing enhanced competition to Invensys.
The Group invests in research and development to develop 
new technologies and products to sustain or improve its 
competitive position. However, all new technologies and 
products involve business risk in terms of possible abortive 
expenditure, reputation risk and the potential for onerous 
contracts and customer claims. The Group reviews its portfolio 
of technologies as part of the strategic planning process. 
In addition, the businesses control individual development 
projects through a stage gate review process.
The timing and frequency of substantial contract  
awards, particularly in the Group’s Invensys Rail business, 
are uneven
The revenue of the Group’s Invensys Rail business depends 
on a small number of large railway operators, such as Network 
Rail and London Underground in the UK and other large rail 
and mass transit operators in Europe, Asia Pacific and the US. 
New contract awards are often associated with major transport 
infrastructure upgrades and as a result are by nature large and 
infrequent. Funding for these new projects is often dependent 
on governmental investment decisions, and these may be 
affected by changes in political and economic conditions. As a 
result, the timing of contract awards is uncertain and delays in 
awards may result in volatility in the results of Invensys Rail. The 
business monitors sales activity, sales cover in its order book 
and the impact of potential delays on the expected results to 
allow appropriate mitigating actions to be considered.
The Group’s Process Systems business is reliant on the 
capital expenditure requirements from the oil and gas  
and chemical sectors
A substantial part of the Group’s Process Systems business 
is associated with the supply of technology, software and 
consulting to the oil and gas and chemical industries. Capital 
expenditure requirements from customers in these industries 
are often highly cyclical and linked to the international 
supply, demand and pricing of hydrocarbons. These may 
fluctuate depending on natural events, economic conditions, 
political developments or conflicts involving major oil 
exporting countries. Consequently, in addition to the inherent 
uncertainties of any competitive bid process, demand for 
products and services may fluctuate significantly based on 
the timing of investment decisions made by multinational 
customers.
The business tracks major sales opportunities and regularly 
reviews the status of the order book. Progress against plans  
is monitored through regular operational business reviews.
The Group is subject to ongoing litigation and 
environmental liabilities
As a consequence of the past disposal of a significant number 
of businesses, the Group has retained certain liabilities in 
relation to environmental claims (including the cost associated 
with the remediation of contaminated sites no longer owned 
by the Group), disputed taxes, litigation (including personal 
injury claims arising from alleged exposure to asbestos and 
silica), indemnity claims and other disposal costs relating to the 
disposed businesses. These risks have receded over time as 
warranties and indemnities in relation to past disposals have 
expired, existing disputes have been settled and remediation 
work on contaminated sites has been completed. The Group 
also has environmental liabilities in relation to the remediation 
of vacant sites owned by it. All of the above liabilities are 
subject to a number of uncertainties, assumptions and 
contingencies.
The Group continually monitors the remaining liabilities, 
regularly reviews the related provisions and aims in 
negotiations to limit the risk of future liabilities or disputes. 
However, there can be no assurance that the liabilities will 
not be substantially higher or become payable sooner than 
anticipated, or that the provisions in the Group’s accounts 
in respect of any such liabilities will be sufficient if currently 
unknown liabilities should arise.
Operating in global markets subjects the Group to 
risks associated with changes in political and economic 
conditions and in applicable laws and regulations
The Group operates in global markets, with facilities in  
more than 50 countries. It is subject to a broad range of  
laws, regulations and standards in each of the jurisdictions  
in which it operates. In addition, a number of its production, 
engineering and back office services have been or are in the 
process of being relocated to countries in Asia, Eastern Europe 
and Mexico.
Also, a significant portion of its revenue is from customers 
outside Europe and North America, and the Group has 
become increasingly engaged with the development of new 
business in these markets. This brings increased risk through 
exposure to the different laws, regulations, political and 
economic conditions and other variable factors in these  
growth territories. Invensys plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2009  |  27
These risks are managed principally through regular 
operational business reviews.
The Group may be subject to liability as a result  
of product liability claims
Errors and defects in the Group’s products, systems or 
applications, which may be used in safety-critical applications, 
could cause injury to persons or damage to property and 
equipment. These occurrences could result in claims, loss of 
revenue, warranty costs, costs and damages associated with 
product recalls, litigation, delays in market acceptance or  
harm to the Group’s reputation for safety and quality. Each 
business has an established quality control function, and if an 
event occurs there are processes to investigate and manage 
the occurrence.
The Group could be exposed to deterioration in its 
financial results if the performance improvement 
initiatives of certain of the Group’s operations are  
not successful
In response to increased competition and in order to enhance 
business opportunities, a number of significant business 
improvement initiatives have been identified. The objective 
of these initiatives is to increase market competitiveness 
by changing the mix of products and services offered to 
customers and by improving operational and manufacturing 
efficiencies. Initiatives include the modification of business 
practices and in certain instances the transfer of business 
operations. Although the Group has committed substantial 
resources to complete these performance improvement 
initiatives successfully, there can be no assurance that these  
will ultimately be completed as planned.
These activities are monitored through the regular operational 
review process to confirm progress on their implementation 
and to minimise any associated risks.
The Group may be exposed to liability through the  
actions of joint venture partners, cosource partners  
or its supply chain
The business activities of the Group are often conducted in 
conjunction with joint venture, consortium, codevelopment or 
cosource partners whose day-to-day management actions are 
outside of the control of the Group.
A significant element of the Group’s risk profile is the delivery 
performance of its supply chain. Given the nature of the 
Group’s businesses, a quality or other failure in the supply 
chain could present a risk to safety and delivery which could 
have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, 
financial performance and reputation.
Assessment, mitigation and management of these risks are 
addressed by the businesses in conjunction with the Group’s 
legal, supply chain and risk functions.
Undertaking large, long-term projects exposes the 
Group’s business to risk of loss
A significant amount of the Group’s business involves long-
term projects that can take many months or even years to 
complete. These projects may be subject to delays and cost 
overruns due to delays in equipment deliveries, engineering 
problems, work stoppages, unanticipated cost increases, 
shortages of materials or skilled labour or other unforeseen 
problems inherent in the nature of such projects.
The Group has established a process with clear delegated 
authorities for the approval of major contracts which includes 
a system for the approval of bids submitted to customers. 
Contracts with a large monetary value or onerous contractual 
terms require Board approval. Contract execution is monitored 
against the approved plans.
The Group may be exposed to additional liabilities  
with respect to its UK and US pension plans
The Group has a high proportion of pensioners relative to its 
active workforce. With respect to both the Group pension 
plans for its UK operations and for its US operations, any 
decline in the equity market, improvements in life expectancy, 
changes in expected morbidity rates, long periods of low 
inflation or deflation or future decreases in interest rates 
could increase the funding deficit and require additional 
funding contributions in excess of those currently expected. 
The current deficit funding plan was agreed on the basis of a 
valuation undertaken at 31 March 2008 and anticipates deficit 
recovery contributions being made on a six-monthly basis until 
March 2017. In addition to regular financial reporting under 
IAS 19, the Group regularly monitors the performance of the 
principal UK and US schemes.
If the Group is unable to recruit and retain skilled 
personnel, it may not be able to effectively implement  
its business strategy
The future success of the Group will depend in part upon the 
ability to recruit, develop and retain highly skilled personnel in 
a competitive market environment for technology companies. 
The Group has invested in its human resources function and 
processes to mitigate the risk.
The turbulence in the financial markets and the related 
downturn in business confidence has and will continue  
to have an impact on general business prospects 
In these circumstances a number of commercial risks are 
heightened, including a greater risk of failure of a key customer 
or supplier exposing the Group to financial loss (for example 
bad debts or irrecoverable costs) or business disruption arising 
from the failure to secure required components and services.
If orders are delayed and sales volumes are significantly 
impacted then there is a greater risk that further restructuring 
activities will be required. 28  |  Invensys plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Corporate Governance
Combined Code – principles and compliance
This report has been prepared in accordance with Section 1 
of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance issued by 
the Financial Reporting Council in June 2006 (the Combined 
Code). The report, together with the Remuneration Report 
on pages 33 to 43, describes how the principles set out in the 
Combined Code have been applied.
The Board is committed to high standards of corporate 
governance, and is pleased to report that throughout the year 
under review Invensys has been compliant with the provisions 
of the Combined Code. The Invensys Code of Conduct (which 
is part of a broader Compliance Programme) aims to ensure 
the businesses act with integrity and comply with all laws.
The Board
Composition
The Board is chaired by Martin Jay, who was appointed  
non-executive Chairman in July 2003. At 13 May 2009,  
the Board consisted of two executive directors and 5 non-
executive directors, in addition to the Chairman. Biographies 
of all directors are presented on page 7. Sir Nigel Rudd was 
appointed to the Board as a non-executive director and 
Deputy Chairman with effect from 1 January 2009. The Senior 
Independent Director is Michael Parker, who has held this role 
since 7 December 2006. Mr Parker, as Senior Independent 
Director, is available for shareholders to contact.
Steve Hare has resigned from the Board effective 31 May 
2009 and will be leaving the Company on this date. He will be 
succeeded by Wayne Edmunds who will join the Board and 
become Chief Financial Officer with effect from 1 June 2009. 
As previously announced, Mr Jay will retire as Chairman and as 
a director of the Company at the conclusion of the 2009 AGM 
and will be succeeded by Sir Nigel Rudd. Jean-Claude Guez, 
non-executive director and Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee, will also be retiring at the conclusion of the 
AGM. At that time, Dr Martin Read and Francesco Caio will 
join the Board. Dr Read will succeed Mr Guez as Chairman 
of the Remuneration Committee and join the Nominating 
Committee. Mr Caio will join the Audit Committee and 
Remuneration Committee. 
Executive directors are encouraged not to hold more than  
one external non-executive directorship, which is in line  
with the Combined Code requirement that boards should  
not agree to full-time executive directors taking on more  
than one non-executive directorship. Ulf Henriksson joined  
the board of Hexagon AB as a non-executive director on  
2 May 2007 following a review and confirmation from the  
Board that there was no conflict between the business of the 
Group and Hexagon AB. In line with the Combined Code 
requirement, this is the only non-executive directorship  
that Mr Henriksson holds. Hexagon AB is a Swedish global 
technology group, listed on the Swedish Stock Exchange, 
specialising in measurement technologies, polymers and 
engineering components.
Board independence
The Board meets the Combined Code requirement that at 
least half of the Board, excluding the Chairman, should be 
independent non-executive directors. The Board considers 
that all of the current non-executive directors and Dr Read and 
Mr Ciao are independent for Combined Code purposes.
The Board has a majority of independent non-executive 
directors and a good balance between non-executive and 
executive directors, ensuring that no individual or small group 
dominates the Board’s decision-making. Terms and conditions 
of appointment of non-executive directors are available on 
request from the Company Secretary. The Company’s Articles 
of Association require that one third of all directors shall retire 
at each AGM but that all directors must seek re-election at 
least every three years. In addition, any director who has been 
appointed since the previous AGM must stand for election at 
the AGM following his appointment.
Division of responsibilities
There is a clear division of responsibilities between the 
Chairman and the Chief Executive, which is defined in writing 
and approved by the Board. The Chairman is responsible for 
leadership of the Board and ensuring its effectiveness. He 
facilitates the contribution of the non-executive directors  
and ensures constructive relations between the executive  
and non-executive directors and effective communication  
with shareholders. The Chief Executive is responsible for 
executing the strategy approved by the Board and leadership 
of the Group.
Company Secretary
The Company Secretary is responsible to the Board and 
advises on all corporate governance matters, ensuring that 
all Board procedures are followed and that there is a good 
information flow. To enable the Board to perform its duties, all 
directors have full and timely access to all relevant information 
and to the services of the Company Secretary. The Company 
Secretary is Victoria Hull, who was appointed on 1 January 
2006 and who acts as secretary to all of the committees of the 
Board. Ms Hull is also the General Counsel. The appointment 
and removal of the Company Secretary is decided upon by the 
Board as a whole.
Role and procedures
There is a formal schedule of matters relating to all major 
strategic and financial decisions that are reserved for the 
decision of the Board.
The matters reserved for the Board include approval of the 
financial results and the formulation of strategic and annual 
operating plans. In addition, certain decision-making is 
delegated through structured procedures to committees and, 
for operational matters, to senior management. Although all 
the directors have an equal responsibility for the operations of 
Invensys, the role of the non-executive directors is particularly 
important in ensuring that the strategy and business proposals 
of the executive management team are fully discussed and 
examined to ensure that they meet the long-term interests 
of shareholders and also take account of issues affecting 
employees, customers, suppliers and the many communities 
within which Invensys conducts its business. At least one full 
day’s meeting every year is devoted to the overall strategic 
planning of the Group and, where possible, held off-site. 
The Board delegates specific authorities to its Nominating 
Committee, Audit Committee, Remuneration Committee and 
Contracts Committee. Reports of these committees are set 
out between pages 30 to 43. All directors receive copies of 
all committee minutes and the chairman of each committee 
provides an update on matters of significance at the Board 
meeting following the committee meeting. Invensys plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2009  |  29

Meetings
There is an agreed schedule of Board and committee 
meetings. During the year each of the directors attended such 
scheduled meetings as are set out in the table above. This 
analysis includes the members’ attendance at meetings and 
does not include attendance of other directors attending at  
the invitation of the respective committees.
In addition to the scheduled meetings, the Board met on 
four further occasions, the Remuneration Committee on one 
occasion, the Nominating Committee on eight occasions 
(including all meetings of the Chairman Selection Panel) and 
the Contracts Committee on one occasion. There were also 
informal meetings of the Chairman and the non-executive 
directors without the executive directors being present. 
Board and committees: performance evaluation
The Board has a formal review process with discrete 
components covering the evaluation of the Board’s collective 
performance, the appraisal of the performance of individual 
directors, including the Chairman, and each of the Board’s 
committees.
Evaluation of executive directors is conducted by the Chairman 
and non-executive directors. Appraisal of the non-executive 
directors is led by the Chairman in consultation with all 
directors. Additionally, each non-executive director is asked 
to assess themselves. The evaluation of the Chairman is led by 
the Senior Independent Director in consultation with the other 
non-executive directors, taking into account the views of the 
executive directors. Individual feedback is provided by the 
Chairman to each of the non-executive directors and by the 
Senior Independent Director to the Chairman.
In relation to the evaluation of the Board and its committees, 
an internal questionnaire based on the Combined Code 
provisions is used for this process. The evaluation process 
involves assessment by reference to the relevant roles and 
responsibilities under review, the current terms of reference of 
the committees and best practice. The results of the evaluation 
provide the basis for continuous improvement in the Board’s 
procedures and the Board’s action plans and objectives for the 
following year.
The Board remains satisfied that each ongoing director 
remains committed to his role and that the Board and each  
of its committees remains effective.
Induction and development
On appointment, new directors receive an induction 
programme tailored to their experience, including an induction 
pack comprising relevant information, scheduled meetings 
with key personnel and advisers, and site visits. As part of 
his induction Sir Nigel Rudd, who was appointed as a non-
executive director and Deputy Chairman on 1 January 2009,  
is meeting advisers and senior functional and business leaders 
of the Group. In addition, a programme of visits to the principal 
business sites during 2009/10 has been organised for Sir Nigel 
Rudd. A tailored induction programme for Mr Edmunds, the 
new Chief Financial Officer (effective 1 June 2009), is also 
being developed. 
The continuing development of directors, collectively and 
individually, is mainly effected through the provision to them 
by relevant external and internal advisers of briefings on 
matters of current significance to the Group and also through 
attendance at external briefings. During the year directors 
received regular updates on legislative and regulatory 
developments (e.g. the Companies Act 2006, including 
directors’ conflicts, and the Corporate Manslaughter and 
Corporate Homicide Act 2007) and other matters of legal 
significance. The Board ensures that directors have access to 
independent professional advice on how to discharge their 
responsibilities as directors of the Company.
Directors’ conflicts of interest
The conflict rules introduced by the Companies Act 2006 
require a director to avoid any situation in which he has or can 
have a direct or indirect interest that conflicts or may possibly 
conflict with the interests of the Company unless authorised 
by the Board. At the 2008 AGM, the Company’s Articles of 
Association were amended to allow the Board to authorise 
such conflicts and to impose such limits or conditions as it 
deems necessary. There is no breach of duty if the relevant 
matter has been authorised in advance. 
The Company has established a procedure whereby actual  
and potential conflicts of interest are reviewed regularly  
and in any event annually. Appropriate authorisation is 
required prior to the appointment of any new director,  
and when any new conflict arises for a director or there is  
a change in circumstances that may affect an authorisation 
previously given.
Authorisations are granted by those directors who have no 
interest in the matter being considered and are recorded by 
the Company Secretary in a register of directors’ conflicts.

Board committees
The Board has established a number of standing committees, 
all of which operate within defined terms of reference. 
Membership of the Audit Committee and Remuneration 
Committee is restricted to the independent non-executive 
directors. Reports of the committees are set out below.
Board committees are authorised to engage the services  
of external advisers as circumstances require, at the  
Company’s expense.

a new Chairman on behalf of the Board. The Nominating 
Committee established a special Chairman Selection Panel 
(CSP) to lead the search for the new Chairman and was assisted 
by external advisers. The CSP was chaired by Bay Green, an 
independent non-executive director, and included Mr Jay, 
Jean-Claude Guez, Ulf Henriksson and Pat Zito as members. 
As part of the search a job specification was prepared and an 
assessment made of the time commitment expected from the 
new Chairman. Prior to the appointment of Sir Nigel Rudd as 
successor to Mr Jay, the CSP confirmed with Sir Nigel Rudd  
that he would be able to devote the necessary time to his 
duties at Invensys.
The Nominating Committee also considered the retirement 
of Mr Guez from the Board and conducted a search, with the 
assistance of external advisers, for two new non-executive 
directors. The search included a detailed assessment 
of the current skills and experience on the Board. At the 
recommendation of the Nominating Committee, the Board  
has approved the appointment of Dr Read and Francesco Caio 
following the AGM.
All directors are required to retire by rotation no later than 
the third AGM following their appointment or reappointment. 
No director is proposed for election for a further term of 
three years unless the Nominating Committee has, following 
evaluation, recommended such reappointment to the Board. 
The recommendation of the Nominating Committee on the 
re-election of Michael Parker and the election of Sir Nigel 
Rudd as directors is described in the Notice of Annual General 
Meeting. The terms and conditions of appointment of non-
executive directors are available on request from the Company 
Secretary.

Attendance is shown in the table on page 29. At least once  
a year, the Audit Committee and the external auditor meet 
without management present. At the invitation of the Audit 
Committee, all directors who are not members normally  
attend all meetings. In addition, other senior managers are 
invited as required.

The Audit Committee has guidelines to ensure that the 
independence of Ernst & Young LLP, as the auditor of the 
Group’s Financial Statements, is not impaired by providing 
non-audit services. These guidelines govern the provision 
of non-audit services by Ernst & Young LLP by identifying 
certain non-audit services that the auditor is prohibited from 
providing. Permitted categories of non-audit services are 
approved by the Audit Committee. The engagements for  
non-audit services are subject to formal approval based on  
the level of fees involved. The Audit Committee has agreed 
a pre-approval process whereby certain non-audit services 
up to an agreed value can be provided. Such services are 
subsequently reported to the Audit Committee. Details of the 
amounts paid to Ernst & Young LLP as external auditor during 
the year for audit and other services are set out in Note 5 to the 
Group Financial Statements.
Remuneration Committee report
Details of the Remuneration Committee and its policies, 
together with information on the remuneration and share 
interests of directors, is set out in the Remuneration Report  
on pages 33 to 43.
Contracts Committee
As part of the 2007/08 Board evaluation, it was agreed by 
the Board that a committee should be established to review 
certain tenders and contracts falling within the Board’s terms of 
reference and due for submission to clients in the period when 
there was no scheduled Board meeting to consider them. The 
Contracts Committee was established in September 2008 
for this purpose and during the year met on one occasion. 
Meetings of the Contracts Committee must comprise at least 
one but preferably both executive directors, the Chairman  
(or in his place the Senior Independent Director) and any one 
non-executive director. 
The current terms of reference for the Contracts Committee 
are available on the Group’s website.
Communication with shareholders
Communication with shareholders is at all times given a high 
priority, and a number of means are used to promote greater 
understanding and dialogue with investment audiences. 
In order to develop an understanding of the views of major 
shareholders, the Board receives regular reports from the 
Chief Executive and the Group’s investor relations team. The 
Chairman and the Senior Independent Director are available  
to meet with major shareholders on request.
Shareholders are kept informed of the progress of the 
Group during the course of the year through half-yearly and 
preliminary results, interim management statements and 
other announcements of significant developments that are 
released through the London Stock Exchange and other news 
services. The Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer 
maintain regular dialogue with institutional shareholders and 
participate in sector conferences. Shareholders can also raise 
questions directly with the Company at any time by contacting 
the investor relations team, whose contact details are listed on 
the Group’s website.
Additionally, directors are available at the AGM for 
shareholders’ questions. The Annual Report and Accounts 
is made available to shareholders at least 20 working days 
prior to the AGM. Voting on resolutions proposed separately 
is conducted by polls at general meetings and voting results 
are announced through the London Stock Exchange and 
other news services; the results and proxy levels are available 
on the Group’s website and on request. The Company 
is permitted under the Articles of Association to send or 
supply communications to shareholders electronically, and 
the Company now supplies information such as notices of 
meetings, forms of proxy and annual reports and accounts 
via the Group’s website. Shareholders are notified by email 
or post when new information is available on the website. 
The Company sends hard copy communications to those 
shareholders who have requested to receive communications 
in hard copy form. Shareholders may at any time revoke 
a previous instruction in order to receive hard copies or 
electronic copies of shareholder information. 32  |  Invensys plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Accountability and audit
Internal control 
The Board has ultimate responsibility for the establishment  
and maintenance of an effective system of internal control. 
Each of the Group’s businesses is accountable to the Chief 
Executive and is managed by executive leadership, who 
provide day-to-day control over the business’ operations within 
the strategic guidelines and delegated authorities determined 
by the Board. The Chief Executive is currently Acting President 
of IPS following the departure of the former president; the 
recruitment process for a new leader is under way. 
The internal control system is designed to meet the Group’s 
particular needs and the risks to which it is exposed, but it 
should be appreciated that, however effective a system of 
internal control is, it can provide only reasonable and not 
absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Board has established a structured approach to 
identifying, evaluating, managing, monitoring and reporting 
on key risks facing the Group. The Risk Committee reports 
to the Board through the Audit Committee and presents an 
update at each Audit Committee meeting. The Risk Committee 
is responsible for the system of risk management and for 
the reporting of key risks and the associated mitigating 
management actions. The SVP Business Risk chairs the Risk 
Committee, and its meetings are attended by the Chief 
Financial Officer, the Chief Executive, the General Counsel and 
Company Secretary, the Group Financial Controller, the VP 
Tax and Treasury, the SVP Environmental, Health, Safety and 
Sustainability, the VP Risk Management and Insurance and the 
VP Compliance. During the year, its activities have included 
reviewing the Group’s risk framework (which tracks the 
principal risks and uncertainties faced by the Group across its 
businesses), reviewing the development and implementation 
of the Group’s new Global Compliance Programme and 
assessing a report produced by an external party which 
reviewed the Risk Committee function and its risk monitoring 
processes. A summary of the principal risks facing the Group is 
presented on pages 26 to 27.
In accordance with the Turnbull 2005 guidance, the Board 
confirms that it has undertaken its annual assessment of the 
Group’s system of internal control. Included in the assessment 
undertaken by the Audit Committee were:
• 	 	 c o n s i d e r a t i o n 	 o f 	 t h e 	 k e y 	 r i s k s 	 f a c i n g 	 t h e 	 b u s i n e s s e s 	 a s 	 p a r t

operating planning processes;

processes including organisational structure, the 
application of governance rules and systems, information 
management (including monthly reporting routines) and 
risk management activities;
• 	 	 r e p o r t s 	 r e c e i v e d 	 f ro m 	 b o t h 	 i n t e r n a l 	 a n d 	 e x t e r n a l 	 a u d i t 	
during the course of the year; and
• 	 	 t h e 	 fi n d i n g s 	 f ro m 	 t h e 	 a n n u a l 	 s e l f - a s s e s s m e n t 	 q u e s t i o n n a i r e , 	
which requires all senior managers, from reporting unit 
level upwards, to certify compliance with the Group’s 
financial and operational procedures and controls, 
including environmental, health and safety matters and the 
Invensys Code of Conduct.
Following a detailed review, the Audit Committee reported 
on its findings to the Board. The Board is satisfied that the 
information that it has received throughout the year and for its 
annual review, together with the procedural review framework 
that has been established, is sufficient to enable it to review 
the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal control. 
Whilst areas for improvement in control have been identified 
and actions initiated on account of the above processes, no 
significant shortcomings in internal control were identified as 
a result of the annual assessment. The internal control process 
has been in place for the year under review and up to the date 
of approval of the Annual Report and Accounts.
Internal audit 
Internal audit has a direct reporting line to the Chairman of 
the Audit Committee, and its responsibilities include the 
examination and evaluation of the scope and effectiveness 
of the Group’s system of internal control. The audit plan is 
constructed to provide geographic coverage over broadly a 
three year cycle, with a degree of tailoring to address specific 
risk concerns. During the year, internal audit reported regularly 
to the Audit Committee on its assessment of internal control 
issues arising in the course of its internal audit reviews of 
the Group’s operations. Each year a consolidated review is 
provided to assist the Board in undertaking its own annual 
review of internal control.
In light of the changing nature of the Group’s business, the 
geographic spread of operations and the need for certain 
specialist audit resources (e.g. IT), the majority of internal  
audit work is outsourced to Deloitte LLP. A small function, 
reporting to the SVP Business Risk, has been retained  
to manage the outsourcing contract and undertake certain  
ad hoc assignments.
Whistle-blowing
The Audit Committee reviews the Group’s arrangements under 
which staff can, on a confidential basis, raise concerns about 
potential irregularities, and the arrangements for follow-up 
actions. A helpline is operated by Global Compliance Services 
Inc, an independent company, and is publicised to employees 
via the Invensys Code of Conduct. As part of the new Global 
Compliance Programme the helpline is being more heavily 
promoted across the Group and made more accessible  
for employees.
Any investigations are undertaken by the VP Compliance 
and any material investigations are brought to the immediate 
attention of the Audit Committee which determines 
appropriate follow-up actions. Statistics on the volume and 
general nature of calls are reported annually to the Audit 
Committee and the Board. In addition, staff can raise concerns 
through other means such as electronic or postal mail sent 
to the Board or management, which correspondence is 
investigated in the same manner as concerns raised through 
the helpline. No material issues were reported through these 
processes during the year.

Remuneration Report 
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present the report by the Remuneration 
Committee (the Committee) on directors’ remuneration 
(Remuneration Report) for the year to 31 March 2009.
As set out in the Chairman’s Statement on page 8, Invensys 
has had another good year despite the difficult economic 
conditions that have affected the global economy. Against 
this background, the Committee has applied a clear strategy 
of linking executive directors’ remuneration to stretching 
performance targets and returns to shareholders. 
The Committee believes that the remuneration policy detailed 
in this Remuneration Report is appropriate to enable Invensys 
to recruit the people we need, and retain and motivate those 
already with us at this critical time.
The Committee considers that the individual elements of the 
remuneration package that will apply in 2009/10 constitute an 
appropriate balance between fixed and variable remuneration.
I have enjoyed immensely my time as a director of Invensys and 
I am proud of our successful turnaround. As Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee, I am confident that my colleagues 
on the Committee will ensure that the policy and reward 
structures will continue to support the Company’s strategy  
and the creation of shareholder value.
The Remuneration Report was approved by the Board of 
directors on 13 May 2009 and signed on its behalf by:
Jean-Claude Guez
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee

Dr Martin Read will join the Board following the AGM and will 
succeed Mr Guez as Chairman of the Committee. In addition, 
Sir Nigel Rudd and Francesco Caio will join the Remuneration 
Committee following the AGM.

Committee performance evaluation
As detailed in the Corporate Governance report on page 29, 
the Committee’s performance is reviewed annually both by 
the Board as a whole and by the Committee itself, with the 
emphasis on continued improvement and effectiveness.
Advice
To ensure that the Group’s remuneration practices remain 
market-competitive and compliant, during the year advice was 
received from:

Compliance
The Remuneration Report has been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of Schedule 7A of the Companies 
Act 1985 (the Companies Act) and the Listing Rules of the 
UK Listing Authority. It also describes how the principles set 
out in the Combined Code have been applied in relation to 
remuneration for the current and forthcoming financial years. 
Ernst & Young LLP has audited the contents of the report to the 
extent required by the Companies Act (the tabular information 
on pages 41 to 42 relating to directors’ remuneration and 
directors’ interests over shares and all share incentive plans).
Remuneration strategy
To take account of the ongoing development of the Company 
and of its strategic plan, during 2007 the Committee 
undertook a comprehensive review of all aspects of reward 
for executive directors and senior executives. The results 
of the Remuneration Strategy Review were supported by 
shareholders at the 2007 AGM. The 2008/09 financial year 
reflected some evolution of this reward strategy in order to 
strengthen our competitive market position and support 
further value creation for our shareholders.
These key elements of our remuneration strategy for 2008/09, 
which will be applied in a consistent manner in 2009/10, are 
described in detail below.
Base salary
The Committee determines the level of base salary for each 
executive director annually. For 2008/09 and 2009/10, base 
salaries were set within a market-competitive range based 
on analysis of salaries paid in FTSE 350 companies, taking 
account of the relative complexity, international scope and size 
of comparator companies. The Committee additionally takes 
into account salaries in relevant key competitor companies, 
specific factors relating to the individual (including personal 
performance), internal relativities, wage inflation elsewhere in 
the Group, and overall affordability. In establishing individual 
salary levels, the Committee is conscious that it should pay no 
more than is necessary to retain and motivate the executive, 
while ensuring business objectives are fulfilled. There is no 
automatic adjustment in respect of inflation.
Taking account of the factors above, with effect from 1 April 
2009, the Chief Executive’s base salary remains at £820,000 
(2008: £820,000). As the incumbent Chief Financial Officer 
for 2008/09 (Steve Hare) had indicated his intention to leave 
Invensys, his base salary was not reviewed and his 2008 
base salary of £490,000 will remain effective for the period 
1 April 2009 until he leaves Invensys on 31 May 2009. On 
appointment on 1 June 2009, the base salary of the new Chief 
Financial Officer (Wayne Edmunds) will be £375,000. The 
Committee considers these base salary levels are necessary 
and appropriate to meet its objective of retaining the executive 
directors and maintaining competitive pay levels, having 
taken full account of the performance of the directors and the 
business-critical nature of their contribution.
The next review date for executive directors’ base salaries will 
be 1 April 2010.
Annual incentive arrangements
Performance-related bonuses may be paid under the Executive 
Bonus Plan, which provides annual incentives for the executive 
directors in order to encourage the achievement of predefined 
annual financial objectives and to focus on the most important 
measures of business success, while rewarding them for 
outstanding performance. In this way, the Executive Bonus 
Plan seeks to align the interests of shareholders and those 
participating in it.
Remuneration Report continued  Invensys plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2009  |  35
For 2008/09 the maximum bonus opportunity under the 
Executive Bonus Plan was set at 200% of target (i.e. 200% of 
salary for executive directors), whereby any bonus in excess of 
150% of target (i.e. up to 200% of target) would only be earned 
for the achievement of “super-stretch” performance. 
For 2008/09, the targets for executive directors were 
underlying EPS
1
 and free cash flow per share, weighted 
50%/50%. Bonus payments may also be influenced, through 
exercise of discretion by the Committee, by the achievement 
of personal objectives and broader contextual factors such 
as performance on corporate social responsibility issues. 
In establishing personal objectives and financial targets for 
bonuses, the Committee ensures that no environmental, 
health, safety and sustainability risks are raised by inadvertently 
motivating irresponsible behaviour. The Committee considers 
that these measures of performance are appropriate to support 
continued delivery of the Group’s strategy. 
Each year, the Committee sets out in its Remuneration Report 
the basis on which bonuses have been paid in relation to 
the targets set at the beginning of the financial year under 
review. This ensures that shareholders are able to assess the 
bonus targets and the link between bonuses payable and the 
performance of the business.
The bonuses paid to the executive directors in relation to 
the year under review are set out on page 41. In line with 
the Executive Bonus Plan rules, the salary used for bonus 
calculation purposes is the salary effective from 1 April 2008. 
In respect of 2008/09 actual performance, the bonus payments 
reflect the fact that the predetermined threshold level of 
performance was not achieved for EPS, and free cash flow 
performance was at the maximum (super-stretch) level. The 
aggregate out-turn was, therefore, a bonus payment of 100% of 
the predetermined target. Where applicable, bonus in excess 
of 100% of target (i.e. 100% of salary for executive directors)  
is paid in deferred shares (in accordance with the Deferred 
Share Plan), which will be transferred to the individual after 
three years. No deferred shares were awarded for 2008/09,  
as performance was at the target level.
Having rigorously reviewed the results achieved against 
the performance targets set for 2008/09, the Committee 
is satisfied that the targets it had set up front were very 
challenging and that the bonuses awarded reflected the 
level of financial performance in an extremely difficult global 
economic environment. Group free cash flow performance 
was exceptional when considered against the global economic 
backdrop.
The Committee has carefully reviewed the financial targets to 
be applied for the Executive Bonus Plan for 2009/10 against 
the background of global economic uncertainty, and is of 
the opinion that they are as stretching as the targets set for 
2008/09. 
For 2009/10 the maximum bonus opportunity under the 
Executive Bonus Plan will remain at 200% of target (i.e. 200% 
of salary for executive directors), whereby any bonus in 
excess of 150% of target (i.e. up to 200% of target) would only 
be earned for the achievement of truly outstanding super-
stretch performance. The financial bonus targets for executive 
directors will again be underlying EPS and free cash flow, 
weighted 50%/50%. 
 
1
  See Note 11 to the Financial Statements.
For 2009/10, any bonus earned in excess of target (100% of 
salary for executive directors) will be paid in deferred shares 
which will only be transferred at the end of a three year period. 
Deferred shares will only be forfeitable in the event of dismissal 
for cause.
Long-term incentive arrangements
The 2007 LTIP was approved by shareholders at the 2007 
AGM. Awards were made in 2007/08 and 2008/09 under the 
2007 LTIP. A separate award was implemented for the Chief 
Executive in 2007 as outlined on page 38.
The maximum annual award level for executive directors 
and other participants will normally be 200% of base salary 
(although the Committee has discretion to make awards in 
excess of this level in exceptional circumstances). Vesting of 
awards is based on meeting stretching performance targets 
over a three year performance period and, subject to meeting 
all relevant conditions, shares will normally be released to 
participants as soon as possible following the third anniversary 
of the award. The satisfaction of all performance targets will be 
subject to external verification.
For 50% of an award, the performance measure is relative TSR 
performance measured on a local currency basis against that of 
the constituents of the Standard & Poor’s Global 1200 Capital 
Goods Index. This measure was chosen to provide a focus on 
delivering high levels of return to shareholders. The Standard 
& Poor’s Global 1200 Capital Goods Index was selected as the 
comparator group because its constituents represent a wide 
grouping of over 100 companies that have businesses that are, 
in whole or in part, similar to or in competition with some or all 
of those operated by Invensys, and cover a wide geographic 
range including the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific.
25% of the TSR part of an award will vest for performance equal 
to the unweighted mean of the Index constituents, excluding 
outliers. The calculation will not be weighted by reference to 
market capitalisation of Index constituents to avoid any single 
large company unduly influencing the results. For similar 
reasons, an equal number of outliers at the top and bottom  
of the TSR range will be excluded.
100% of the TSR part of an award will vest for outperformance 
of the mean of Index constituents (excluding outliers) 
equivalent to upper quartile performance. For 2007/08 and 
2008/09 awards this was calculated by the Committee’s 
remuneration advisers as outperformance by a factor of 1.3 
(i.e. 30%) over the three year performance period. For awards 
to be made in 2009/10 the level of outperformance equivalent 
to upper quartile performance has been calculated to be a 
factor of 1.25 (i.e. 25%). In the opinion of the Committee’s 
remuneration advisers, this level of outperformance is 
equivalent to upper quartile, so that the level set for 2009/10 
is no less stretching than that applied to the 2007/08 and 
2008/09 LTIP awards. 
For awards made in 2008/09, the TSR performance period for 
the Company and each constituent of the Index will be based 
on the three month average to 31 March 2011 compared with 
the three month average to 31 March 2008.
For awards to be made in 2009/10, the TSR performance 
period for the Company and each constituent of the Index 
will be based on the three month average to 31 March 2012 
compared with the three month average to 31 March 2009. 36  |  Invensys plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2009
For the other 50% of an award, the performance target will be 
the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in underlying EPS. 
This measure was chosen to provide a focus on delivering 
stretching internal financial targets.
For the 2008/09 award, 25% of the EPS part of the award will 
vest for EPS CAGR of 10.7%. 100% of the EPS part of the award 
will vest for EPS CAGR of 22.4%. Growth will be measured from 
a base of 17.0p, it being the 2007/08 underlying EPS.
For the 2009/10 award the Committee carefully reviewed 
the EPS targets in light of the global economic environment 
as well as factors specific to the Company and determined 
that 25% of the EPS part of the award will vest for EPS CAGR of 
5%. 100% of the EPS part of the award will vest for EPS CAGR 
of 13%. In the opinion of the Committee these targets are 
appropriately stretching. Growth will be measured from a  
base of 14.1p, it being the 2008/09 underlying EPS.
The Committee will have discretion to exclude from the 
calculation matters such as one-off items of a non-recurring 
nature, to ensure that the focus is on underlying growth in EPS.
The Committee will in all cases retain discretion to ensure 
that, as a condition for the vesting of shares, the underlying 
overall performance of the Company has been satisfactory. 
For the TSR part of the award, factors that will be taken into 
account will include EPS growth and the Group’s cash position. 
Vested awards will include an additional number of shares 
representing the value of any dividends that would have been 
paid on those vested shares had they been held throughout 
the vesting period.
The performance conditions do not apply to 30% of an award 
for executive participants below executive director level. This  
is to address specific recruitment and retention issues facing 
the Group.
If a participant resigns or is dismissed for cause before 
shares are released, they will be forfeited. If a participant’s 
employment ceases due to ill health or disability, performance 
will be measured at the normal vesting date and the award will 
then be pro rated based on the period of service, save that 
the Committee may moderate the application of the pro rata 
reduction if it considers that the participant’s contribution to 
the business would not be properly recognised if the award 
was scaled down. The Committee will have discretion to 
accelerate vesting in compassionate circumstances.
In the event of a change of control during the performance 
period, performance will be measured at the latest possible 
date before the change of control to assess the proportion 
vesting based on performance. The proportion of the award 
that may be released will then be time pro rated.
The Committee will have discretion to disapply the impact of 
time pro rating and to permit up to 100% of awards to vest on a 
change of control if, due to exceptional business circumstances 
to be assessed by the Committee, returns to shareholders are 
considered to be at a superior level.

Other share schemes
2007 CEO Special Award
In 2007 the Committee determined that the Chief Executive 
would participate in a one-off long-term incentive award, 
known as the 2007 CEO Special Award (Special Award), in 
addition to his normal annual award under the 2007 LTIP.
Subject to meeting very demanding performance conditions, 
the Special Award entitles Ulf Henriksson to 1,608,554 shares, 
being 700% of Mr Henriksson’s 2007/08 base salary (£750,000).
The Special Award is subject to a three year performance 
period. 50% of vested shares will be released at the end of the 
performance period, with the other 50% being released after a 
12 month holding period. The performance measures applying 
to the Special Award reflect those applying to the 2007 LTIP 
with some elements being more demanding. The Special 
Award is split into two layers, each of which vests on a different 
basis. For the first layer, equal to 200% of base salary, 20% 
will vest for threshold performance and 100% for maximum 
performance. For the second layer, equal to 500% of base 
salary, there will be no vesting for threshold performance, but 
100% will vest for maximum performance. Vesting in each layer 
will be on a straight-line basis between these points. For each 
layer of the Special Award 50% will vest based on TSR and 50% 
based on EPS growth, as for the 2007 LTIP. However, for the TSR 
part of the Special Award, maximum vesting will require more 
stretching performance, equivalent to upper quintile. This 
means outperformance of the mean of the Standard & Poor’s 
Global 1200 Capital Goods Index constituents by a factor of 
1.4 (i.e. 40%). The general rule is that the award will lapse if the 
Chief Executive leaves employment, although shares may be 
released in defined good leaver cases.
1998 Senior Executive Long Term Incentive Plan
(1998 LTIP)
For awards made during 2005/06, 2006/07 and 2007/08 
under the 1998 LTIP, vesting is conditional on the Company’s 
TSR relative to a basket of 12 global comparators over a three 
year performance period, and on meeting specific “underpin” 
targets. 25% of an award vests for median performance 
with full vesting requiring upper decile performance. 50% 
of vested shares are released at the end of the performance 
period and the remainder after one year, subject to continued 
employment. The usual annual award level for executive 
directors was 200% of base salary per annum.
No further awards can be granted under the 1998 LTIP and 
awards are now made under the 2007 LTIP.
Turnaround Bonus Overlay Plan (TBOP)
On a transitional basis, the Committee operated the TBOP 
in 2005/06 and in 2006/07. The TBOP was subject to the 
same performance targets as the Executive Bonus Plan, but 
only commenced payment where an above target level of 
performance was achieved. At target, no payment was due 
with the potential bonus increasing, on a straight-line basis,  
to 100% of salary if the maximum bonus was earned.
To align the interests of executive directors and shareholders, 
any bonuses earned under the TBOP are paid in shares, with 
50% of the shares awarded being released following the first 
anniversary of those shares being awarded and the other 50% 
being released following the second anniversary. Release  
of the final tranche of shares under the TBOP will occur on  
1 June 2009.
Restricted Share Plan (RSP)
The Company also operates an RSP which grants executive 
management participants restricted share awards, nominal/nil 
price options or cash awards over Invensys shares. Release of 
the shares is generally subject to continued employment at the 
relevant date, although shares may be released early in defined 
good leaver cases or with the consent of the Committee. The 
executive directors did not receive RSP awards during the 
financial year.
Savings Related Share Option Scheme
The Company has a Savings Related Share Option Scheme for 
operation in the UK and an Overseas Savings Related Share 
Option Scheme for operation in other countries. The Schemes 
enable employees to purchase shares in the Company at a 
favourable price, using the proceeds of a savings account 
to which they make monthly contributions for a three year 
period. Executive directors are eligible to participate in the 
Scheme, which operates in the UK within specific tax legislation 
and is therefore not subject to performance conditions. The 
last invitation under the UK Scheme was in 2004 although, 
following a review by the Committee, a further invitation will  
be offered under both Schemes in 2009/10. 
Dilution limits
The Company has, at all times, complied with the dilution  
limits contained within its share plans (principally a limit of  
10% in 10 years). In the 10 year period to 31 March 2009 awards 
made under the Company’s share schemes represented  
3.12% (2008: 2.89%) of the Company’s issued ordinary share 
capital. Shares to satisfy the TBOP, the deferred share element 
of the Executive Bonus Plan and the RSP will be purchased in 
the market.
Employee benefit trust
The Company has an employee benefit trust which is 
administered by an independent trustee and which holds 
ordinary shares in the Company to meet the various  
obligations under its executive share schemes, as appropriate. 
The trust held 414,534 ordinary shares at 31 March 2009 (2008: 
1,766,545).
Share Ownership Guidelines
The Share Ownership Guidelines, requiring executives to build 
up and maintain a shareholding over time, were introduced 
in 2004/05 and were amended with effect from 2007/08 
and thereafter such that, except as required to meet tax 
obligations, executives have to retain at least 50% of the shares 
(100% of shares for executive directors) which vest under 
all executive share incentive plans or the payment of annual 
incentives in shares, until the minimum level of shareholding  
is achieved.
The following requirements as to the minimum level of 
retention will apply:
• 	 E x e c u t i v e 	 d i r e c t o r s 	 – 	 2 0 0 % 	 o f 	 b a s e 	 s a l a r y
• 	 E x e c u t i v e 	 L e a d e r s h i p 	 T e a m 	 – 	 5 0 % 	 o f 	 b a s e 	 s a l a r y
• 	 O t h e r 	 p a r t i c i p a n t s 	 – 	 2 5 % 	 o f 	 b a s e 	 s a l a r y
In conjunction with the introduction of the Special Award, 
the Chief Executive will build up to an increased level 
of shareholding of 300% of base salary. This increased 
requirement will continue to apply until May 2010. Thereafter, 
the normal 200% of base salary under the Share Ownership 
Guidelines will apply.
Remuneration Report continued  Invensys plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2009  |  39
Service contracts
Policy
The Combined Code and guidelines issued by institutional 
investors recommend that notice periods of no more than one 
year be set as an objective for executive directors and that 
any payments to a departing executive director should be 
determined having full regard to the duty of mitigation.  
It is the Company’s policy to achieve these objectives  
wherever possible.
Specific contracts
Set out below is a summary of the main provisions of the 
service contracts of those executive directors who served 
during the year:
 Mr Hare will leave the Company on 31 May 2009 following his 
resignation. No termination payment will be made to him. His 
LTIP share awards were forfeited on his resignation. However 
the Committee has determined that his deferred share award 
(which he would otherwise receive on 24 July 2011) will vest on 
31 May 2009. The 2006/07 TBOP award will vest in accordance 
with its terms on 1 June 2009. He will receive his 2008/09 
annual bonus payment notwithstanding that he is leaving 
before the payment date, and the Committee has determined 
that he will be eligible for an annual bonus in respect of his two 
months’ service in 2009/10.
As a result of the Company recharging a proportion of  
Mr Henriksson’s employment costs to the US businesses,  
Mr Henriksson incurs both US and UK tax liabilities in respect 
of his employment duties undertaken in the US. Deloitte LLP 
has advised Invensys that the UK tax liabilities paid by Mr 
Henriksson in respect of such duties should be refunded to  
him by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC). However, such 
refund has been delayed pending a determination by the  
US and UK tax authorities of the relevant treaty provisions.  
In view of the material prejudice suffered by Mr Henriksson  
as a result of this temporary double taxation, Invensys 
Systems Inc has, since the year end, advanced £546,000 to 
Mr Henriksson, being an amount equal to refunds due from 
HMRC. This loan will be repayable on HMRC refunding the 
amount to Mr Henriksson. It is possible that further advances 
will be made to Mr Henriksson under this arrangement.
Mr Edmunds will be employed as Chief Financial Officer 
under a service contract with the Company dated 5 April 
2009 as from 1 June 2009. The contract can be terminated 
by either party by giving the other not less than 12 months’ 
written notice. The Company may elect to pay a sum in lieu 
of notice equal to the basic salary which Mr Edmunds would 
have been entitled to receive under his service contract during 
the notice period, if notice had been given, and the cost to 
the Company of the provisions of certain benefits during 
this period. The Company can elect to pay this lump sum by 
monthly instalments which will reduce by 50% if he obtains 
other employment. As the Company will be requiring Mr 
Edmunds to relocate from the US to the UK in order to fulfil 
his duties as the new Chief Financial Officer, the Company will 
provide certain benefits relating to his relocation including: 
a property rental allowance for the first 12 months following 
appointment; reimbursement of costs reasonably incurred in 
shipping personal effects to the UK; a resettlement allowance 
equal to one month’s base salary; and the services of a housing 
relocation agent. 
Chairman and non-executive directors
Chairman and Deputy Chairman
As previously announced, Mr Jay will retire as Chairman at the 
conclusion of the 2009 AGM. He was appointed non-executive 
Chairman in July 2003 and serves the Company under a letter 
of appointment dated 28 May 2003. This requires, except in 
the case of dismissal for cause, 12 months’ notice by either 
party; on early termination at the request of the Company any 
compensation will be subject to mitigation. No compensation 
will be payable to Mr Jay on his retirement from the Board.
The Committee is responsible for reviewing the Chairman’s 
fees. The Chairman is not involved in any decision on his own 
remuneration. The fees currently paid to the Chairman and 
the other non-executive directors are subject to the limits 
set in the Articles of Association. The Chairman’s fee was 
set on appointment at £250,000 per annum. The Chairman 
participates in the same arrangement as the other non-
executive directors (as set out overleaf) whereby £8,000  
of his fee per annum is paid in shares.
Sir Nigel Rudd, who was appointed a non-executive director 
and Deputy Chairman on 1 January 2009, will succeed Mr Jay 
as Chairman. The terms of Sir Nigel Rudd’s appointment are 
set out in a contract dated 3 December 2008 which requires, 
except in the case of dismissal for cause, 12 months’ notice 
by either party; on early termination at the request of the 
Company any compensation will be subject to mitigation. 
It is expected that Sir Nigel Rudd will spend, on average, 
two days per week in his role as Chairman. From the 
commencement of the Chairmanship, the Company has 
agreed to fund the cost of a car and driver based on two fifths 
of the annualised cost of the provision of such services. 
From the date of his appointment as Deputy Chairman, Sir 
Nigel Rudd’s fee is £150,000 per annum; this will increase to 
£270,000 per annum on appointment as Chairman. Sir Nigel 
Rudd has elected to participate in the same arrangement as 
the other non-executive directors (as set out overleaf) whereby 
£8,000 of his fee per annum is paid in shares.
Non-executive directors
The non-executive directors do not have service contracts 
with the Company. All non-executive directors (including 
the Chairman) are appointed under the Company’s Articles 
of Association, which require that one third of all directors 
(including executive directors) shall retire at each AGM but  
that all directors must seek re-election at least every three 
years. They are also subject to review by the Nominating 
Committee prior to being considered for election or

Notes
1
  In the event of early termination of the director’s service contract (other than 
where summary dismissal is appropriate) the Company has the right to pay, in 
lieu of notice, the salary and contractual benefits which he would have received 
during the relevant notice period. Alternatively, in the case of Mr Hare, the 
Company may continue to provide such benefits during that period.
2
  The Company may elect to pay the amount due in lieu of notice as a single lump 
sum, or pay the first six months’ worth on departure and then on a phased basis 
at six-monthly intervals with appropriate reduction in the event that  
Mr Henriksson finds alternative employment.
3
  The Committee approved in 2007/08 changes to Mr Henriksson’s and 
Mr Hare’s contracts entitling them, in the event of a material adverse change 
to their titles, responsibilities or status following a change of control of the 
Company, to terminate their employment and receive a payment equal to the 
termination payment set out above. 40  |  Invensys plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2009
re-election by shareholders and serve the Company under 
letters of appointment that do not contain any notice period. 
They do not participate in any bonus or performance-related 
plans or any of the Group’s share incentive, option or pension 
schemes.
Fees for non-executive directors other than the Chairman 
are determined by a committee of the Board comprising 
the Chairman and the executive directors. Fee levels are 
determined taking account of time commitments and 
responsibilities, together with comparative market rates  
and benchmarking data. The fees currently paid to  
non-executive directors are subject to the limits set in the 
Articles of Association.
To ensure that the interests of the non-executive directors are 
aligned with those of shareholders, the current fee structure 
for the non-executive directors is a basic fee of £50,000 per 
annum, with £8,000 to be paid in shares. Prior to December 
2008, Mr Zito elected to use his entire non-executive director’s 
basic fee (after tax) to acquire shares on a quarterly basis. Each 
non-executive director has committed to retain these shares 
for the period of their directorship. The remuneration table on 
page 41 includes that part of the fee used to purchase shares, 
and the shares are included in the table of directors’ interests, 
also on page 41.
Additional payments of £10,000 and £8,000 are paid to the 
Chairman of the Audit Committee and to the Chairman of  
the Remuneration Committee respectively.
External directorships
The executive directors are encouraged to hold not more 
than one external non-executive directorship in order to 
broaden their experience for the benefit of the Company. 
Such appointments are subject to approval by the Board, 
and the director may retain any fees paid in respect of such a 
directorship. Mr Henriksson joined the board of Hexagon AB as 
a non-executive director in 2007, from which he retains the fees 
payable of SEK 350,000 (approximately £29,400) per annum. 
Performance graph
The Company is required to include a graph indicating their 
TSR performance (that is, share price assuming reinvestment of 
any dividends) over the last five years relative to a recognised 
equity index. Accordingly, the graph below shows the 
Company’s performance relative to the FTSE 100, which the 
Committee considers an appropriate index for comparison 
purposes as the Company has been a member of the Index 
since June 2008.

Notes
1
 Sir Nigel Rudd was appointed on 1 January 2009 and therefore his emoluments for 2008/09 relate to the period from this date to 31 March 2009.
2
  The emoluments of the highest-paid director, Mr Henriksson, excluding pension rights were £1,990,007 (2008: £2,052,854).
3
  The fee structure for the non-executive directors (including the Chairman and Deputy Chairman) includes £8,000 per annum (or, in the case of Mr Zito, all of his 
fee until December 2008) which, after tax, is used to buy ordinary shares in the Company for each non-executive director as described on page 40. The shares 
purchased on their behalf are included in the table of directors’ interests set out below.
4
  Mr Zito was appointed on 23 May 2007 and therefore his emoluments for 2008 relate to the period from this date to 31 March 2008.
5
  Taxable and other benefits comprise items such as cash allowances in lieu of a company car, life assurance/permanent health assurance, medical care and annual 
health checks. All executive directors are entitled to such benefits. In relation to Mr Henriksson, the Company pays, on a grossed-up basis, certain third-party fees 
incurred for UK and US tax filings and relevant immigration matters.
6
  Any payment due in excess of 100% of salary is paid in ordinary shares in the Company, the vesting of which is deferred (for executive directors) for a period 
of three years. As bonuses for 2008/09 were set at 100% of salary, no amount will be paid in shares. Included in the total for 2008 are the amounts of £274,500 
and £157,380 granted as deferred shares to Mr Henriksson and Mr Hare respectively in respect of their annual bonus for 2007/08. The deferred shares granted in 
respect of the 2007/08 payments are detailed under directors’ interests on page 43.

Dividends
The Board has recommended the payment of a final cash 
dividend for the year of 1.5p per share which, subject to 
approval by shareholders at the AGM on 17 July 2009, will  
be paid on 7 August 2009 to shareholders on the register  
at 26 June 2009.  
Board of directors
The current directors of the Company and their biographical 
details are given on page 7. A statement of their remuneration 
and interests in the ordinary shares of the Company are set out 
in the Remuneration Report on pages 41 to 43.
As previously announced, Martin Jay will retire as Chairman 
and director of the Company at the conclusion of the 2009 
AGM. Sir Nigel Rudd, who was appointed a non-executive 
director and Deputy Chairman on 1 January 2009, will succeed 
Mr Jay as Chairman. Jean-Claude Guez, non-executive director 
and Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, is also retiring 
at the conclusion of the AGM. Steve Hare has resigned from the 
Board effective 31 May 2009 and will be leaving the Company 
on this date. He will be replaced by Wayne Edmunds, who joins 
the Board as Chief Financial Officer on 1 June 2009. Dr Martin 
Read and Francesco Caio will join the Board as non-executive 
directors on 18 July 2009.
The rules governing the appointment and retirement 
of directors are contained in the Company’s Articles of 
Association. At the 2009 AGM, Michael Parker will retire by 
rotation and, being eligible, will offer himself for re-election. 
Mr Jay and Mr Guez also retire by rotation but will not be 
seeking re-election as they will be retiring from the Board at 
the conclusion of the AGM. Sir Nigel Rudd, who was appointed 
during the year, will retire and offer himself for election.
The Chairman’s Explanatory Letter and Notice of AGM explain 
the Board’s reasons for and recommendations regarding the 
re-election of Mr Parker and election of Sir Nigel Rudd. 
The powers of the directors are determined by UK legislation 
and the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the 
Company, together with any specific authorities that may be 
given to the directors by shareholders from time to time, such 
as the power to allot shares and the power to make market 
purchases of the Company’s shares. Further information 
regarding matters reserved for the Board is set out in the 
Corporate Governance report on page 28.
Directors’ indemnity and insurance
In accordance with the Articles of Association, the Company 
has provided to all the directors an indemnity (to the extent 
permitted by the Companies Act 2006) in respect of liabilities 
incurred as a result of their office, and the Company has taken 
out an insurance policy in respect of those liabilities. Neither 
the indemnity nor insurance provides cover in the event that 
the director is proved to have acted dishonestly or fraudulently.
Acquisitions and disposals
On 21 August 2008 the Group acquired SAT Corporation, 
a mobile solutions company based in Houston, for a cash 
consideration of £30 million. The Group also acquired 
Quantum Engineering Inc for a cash consideration of  
£20 million on 17 September 2008. Quantum Engineering 
is based in Jacksonville, Florida, and is a signalling and train 
controls company specialising in onboard equipment.  
No disposals of operations took place during the year.
Capital structure
Details of the authorised and issued share capital, together 
with details of movements in the issued share capital of the 
Company during the year, are shown in Note 27 on page 99. 
The Company has one class of ordinary shares which carry no 
right to fixed income. Each share carries the right to one vote 
at general meetings of the Company. There are no specific 
restrictions on the size of a holding nor on the transfer of 
shares, which are both governed by the general provisions  
of the Articles of Association and prevailing legislation.
The Company operates an employee benefit trust to hold 
shares pending employees becoming entitled to them 
under the Company’s employee share plans. The trust has 
an independent trustee which waives its rights to vote on the 
shareholding. Details of employee share schemes and shares 
held by the Invensys No. 2 Employee Benefit Trust are set out in 
Note 27 on page 100.
Shares acquired through the Company’s employee share plans 
rank pari passu with other shares in issue and have no special 
rights, save that certain share awards involve retention periods 
after vesting. Further, non-executive directors use a proportion 
of their fees to purchase shares in the Company which may not 
normally be transferred during a director’s period of office.
At the 2008 AGM the directors were authorised to issue 
relevant securities up to an aggregate nominal amount of  
£26.3 million (approximately 33% of the issued ordinary 
share capital as at June 2008). Renewal was also sought for 
the directors to allot relevant securities and to allot equity 
securities for cash (up to a maximum aggregate nominal 
amount of £4.0 million) other than on a pre-emptive basis, 
shareholders having previously approved similar resolutions. 
The directors did not use this authority during the year under 
review, other than to issue shares to satisfy awards under the 
Company’s share option and incentive schemes. The directors 
will seek to renew allotment authorities at the 2009 AGM in line 
with revised ABI guidelines. Invensys plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2009  |  45
On 7 May 2008, the Group repaid and cancelled Term Loans 
due in January 2011 of US$190 million and euro 75 million. The 
repayment of the principal amounts, together with accrued 
interest, was made out of cash balances. On 8 May 2008, the 
Group cancelled bonding facilities of £100 million due for 
expiry in December 2010. There were no early redemption 
penalties on either of these transactions.
On 26 November 2008, shareholders approved a capital 
reduction and cancellation of certain reserves by a special 
resolution. This was subsequently sanctioned by the 
High Court of Justice on 21 January 2009. As a result, the 
authorised share capital of the Company was reduced from 
£2,327,418,729.19 divided into 5,600,526,027 ordinary 
shares of £0.10 each, 3,499,780,822 deferred shares of £0.24 
each and 801,285,978 B shares of £1.1574129021 each to 
£1,399,999,999.98 divided into 5,600,526,027 ordinary shares 
of £0.10 each and 3,499,780,822 deferred shares of £0.24 each, 
by cancelling the 801,285,978 B shares. Further details are 
included in Notes 27 and 28 to the Group Financial Statements.
Articles of Association
Any alteration to the Company’s Articles of Association must 
be approved by shareholders in accordance with applicable 
UK legislation. As detailed in the Chairman’s Explanatory Letter 
and Notice of AGM the Company is proposing, subject to 
shareholder approval, certain amendments to the Articles of 
Association to enable provisions in the Companies Act 2006 
(effective from 1 October 2009) to be included.
Substantial shareholders
At the date of this Report, the Company has been notified,  
in accordance with the Disclosure and Transparency Rules,  
of the following interests in the ordinary share capital of  
the Company:
The percentage interests stated are as disclosed at the date on 
which the interests were notified. 
Supplier payment policy
It is the policy of the Group that subsidiary companies should 
develop long-term relationships with suppliers and establish 
terms of trade consistent with established practice in their 
country of operation, and to ensure that suppliers are aware 
of the terms of payment and that such terms are followed. The 
Company is a holding company and has no trade creditors.
Employee policy and development
The Group seeks to ensure that fair consideration is given  
to applications for employment received from disabled 
persons and offers continued employment, training  
and advancement where possible to employees who are  
or become temporarily or permanently disabled.
The Group recognises the need to consult and provide 
information on matters of concern to employees. To satisfy that 
need, the Group provides employees with published financial 
and economic information through its consultative procedures. 
Invensys also encourages the involvement of professional 
and managerial level employees in the Group’s performance 
through the Invensys Performance Management System, which 
reinforces the links between the Group’s business goals, the 
employee’s contribution and his/her remuneration.
Elaboration on these topics and further information concerning 
employees is set out in the Corporate Social Responsibility 
report, which begins on page 22.
Charitable and political contributions
During the year Group donations to charities and community 
causes worldwide were £0.2 million (2008: £0.2 million), 
with UK charities receiving £nil (2008: £nil). The Board is of 
the view that it is not appropriate for the Company to make 
charitable donations given that the Company is only resuming 
the payment of dividends this year. However, many of the 
Group’s subsidiaries are influential companies and important 
employers in their own countries or localities and it is therefore 
believed to be in the best interests of the Group for those 
companies’ community involvement to be maintained at 
reasonable levels. No donations were made to political parties 
(2008: £nil).
Research and development
The Group carries out research and development in support  
of its activities. During the year, expenditure on the research 
and development of new products and processes amounted  
to £114 million (2008: £100 million).
Change of control
Pursuant to section 992 of the Companies Act 2006, the 
directors disclose that in the event of a change of control in the 
Company, (i) the banking facility described in Note 21, totalling 
£400 million at 31 March 2009, could cease to be available to 
the Group; and (ii) a Master Service Agreement dated 15 May 
2007, made with Genpact International, Inc for the provision of 
outsourced business services in relation to certain finance and 
related functions, would become terminable at the option of 
the Company. 
For legal and practical reasons, the rules of the various 
employee share plans operated by the Company set out the 
consequences of a change of control of the Company.
The Remuneration Committee has approved changes to 
Ulf Henriksson’s and Steve Hare’s service contracts entitling 
them, in the event of a material adverse change to their title, 
responsibilities or status following a change of control of 
the Company, to terminate their employment and receive 
a payment equal to the termination payment set out in the 
Remuneration Report on page 39. A similar provision is 
included in the new Chief Financial Officer’s service contract.
Auditors
In accordance with section 234ZA(2) of the Companies Act 
1985, each of the directors at the date of approval of this  
report confirms that, so far as the director is aware, there is  
no relevant audit information of which the Company’s  
auditor is unaware, and that the director has taken all the steps  
that he ought to have taken as a director in order to make 
himself aware of, and to establish that the auditor is aware  
of, any relevant information. Ernst & Young LLP has expressed 
willingness to continue in office as auditor and, in accordance 
with the recommendation of the Audit Committee, resolutions 
proposing its reappointment and to authorise the directors to 
determine its remuneration will be proposed at the 2009 AGM.

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities in Respect of the Preparation of the Accounts 
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the Financial Statements in accordance with applicable 
United Kingdom law and those International Financial 
Reporting Standards adopted by the European Union or,  
in the case of the Company’s Financial Statements, UK GAAP.
In relation to the Group Financial Statements, the directors  
are required to prepare financial statements for each financial 
year which present fairly the financial position of the Group  
and its financial performance and cash flows for that period.  
In relation to the Company’s Financial Statements, the directors 
are required by law to prepare financial statements for each 
financial year that give a true and fair view of the state of the 
affairs of the Company and its profit and loss for that period. In 
preparing the Company and Group Financial Statements, the 
directors are required to:
• 	 	 s e l e c t 	 s u i t a b l e 	 a c c o u n t i n g 	 p o li c i e s 	 a n d 	 t h e n 	 a p p l y 	 t h e m	
consistently;
• 	 	 p r e s e n t 	 i n f o r m a t i o n , 	 i n c l u d i n g 	 a c c o u n t i n g 	 p o li c i e s , 	 i n 	 a	
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information;
• 	 	 p ro v i d e 	 a d d i t i o n a l 	 d i s c l o s u r e s 	 w h e n 	 c o m p li a n c e 	 w i t h 	 t h e	
specific requirements in applicable accounting standards 
is insufficient to enable users to understand the impact of 
particular transactions, other events and conditions on the 
entity’s financial position and financial performance; and 
• 	 	 s t a t e 	 t h a t 	 t h e 	 C o m p a n y 	 a n d 	 t h e 	 G ro u p 	 h a v e 	 c o m p li e d 	 w i t h	
applicable accounting standards, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the Financial 
Statements.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting 
records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and of the Group and 
enable them to ensure that the Financial Statements comply 
with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the International 
Accounting Standards Regulation. They are also responsible 
for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group, 
and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely 
to affect its future development, performance and position are 
set out in the Business Review on pages 12 to 27. The financial 
position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and 
borrowing facilities are described in the Financial Review on 
pages 12 to 17. Note 22 to the Financial Statements includes 
the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing 
its capital; its financial risk management objectives; details 
of its financial instruments and hedging activities; and its 
exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk. The principal risks 
and uncertainties facing the Group are set out on pages 26  
and 27.
While the Group is facing difficult and uncertain trading 
conditions in some of its markets, it is generally in a sound 
financial position with net cash, a £400 million banking facility 
in place until 2013, and well-established relationships with key 
customers and suppliers. Therefore, the directors believe that 
the Group is well placed to manage its business risks despite 
the current uncertain economic outlook.
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company and Group have adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt  
the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.
Directors’ responsibility statement
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
a)  the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 
2009, prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted for use in the European 
Union, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation as a whole; and
b)  the Business Review includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business and the 
position of the Company and the undertakings included in 
the consolidation as a whole, together with a description of 
the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.

Independent auditor’s report to the shareholders of Invensys plc
We have audited the Group Financial Statements (Financial 
Statements) of Invensys plc for the year ended 31 March 
2009 which comprise the consolidated income statement, 
consolidated balance sheet, consolidated cash flow statement, 
consolidated statement of recognised income and expense, 
accounting policies, the related Notes 1 to 37 as at 31 March 
2009. These Financial Statements have been prepared under 
the accounting policies set out therein.
We have reported separately on the Parent Company Financial 
Statements of Invensys plc for the year ended 31 March 2009 
and the information in the Remuneration Report that  
is described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members  
as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies 
Act 1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we 
might state to the Company’s members those matters we  
are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for  
no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we  
do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than 
the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our 
audit work, for this report or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the Financial Statements in accordance with applicable 
United Kingdom law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union as set  
out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the Financial Statements in 
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements 
and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Financial 
Statements give a true and fair view, the Financial Statements 
have been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation  
and the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent 
with the Financial Statements. We also report to you if, in 
our opinion, we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit, or if information 
specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and  
other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance statement 
reflects the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions  
of the 2006 Combined Code specified for our review by  
the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we 
report if it does not. We are not required to consider whether 
the Board’s statements on internal control cover all risks  
and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the 
Group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and 
control procedures.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report 
and consider whether it is consistent with the audited Financial 
Statements. This other information comprises the Board  
of Directors, the Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive’s 
Statement, Business Review, Corporate Governance Report, 
Remuneration Report, Directors’ Report, Statement of 
Directors’ Responsibilities, Financial Summary and listing  
of Principal Subsidiaries as at 31 March 2009. We consider  
the implications for our report if we become aware of any 
apparent misstatement or material inconsistencies with the 
Financial Statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to  
any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the  
Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination,  
on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and 
disclosures in the Financial Statements. It also includes an 
assessment of the significant estimates and judgements  
made by the directors in the preparation of the Financial 
Statements, and of whether the accounting policies are 
appropriate to the Group’s circumstances, consistently  
applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all  
the information and explanations which we considered 
necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence  
to give reasonable assurance that the Financial Statements  
are free from material misstatement, whether caused by  
fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion  
we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation  
of information in the Financial Statements.

Statement of compliance
The Group’s consolidated Financial Statements have been 
prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union (EU) and 
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. 
Basis of preparation
The accounting policies which follow set out the policies and 
measurement bases that have been applied in preparing the 
Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2009. The 
consolidated Financial Statements are presented in sterling 
and all amounts are rounded to the nearest million (£m) unless 
otherwise indicated.
The Group’s date of transition to IFRSs was 1 April 2004.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated Financial Statements comprise Invensys plc 
and its subsidiaries for the financial year to 31 March each year. 
The Group does not currently have any material associates. 
The Financial Statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the 
same reporting year as the Parent Company, using consistent 
accounting policies.
All intragroup balances and transactions have been eliminated. 
The results of subsidiaries sold or acquired during the year are 
consolidated up to, or from, the date control passes.
All business combinations are accounted for using the 
purchase method. The cost of the business combination 
is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity 
instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at 
the date of exchange, plus costs directly attributable to the 
acquisition. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and 
contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are 
measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, 
irrespective of the extent of any minority interest. The excess  
of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share 
of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
In accordance with the exemption permitted by IFRS 1,  
First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting 
Standards, applied by the Group on transition to IFRS,  
business combinations prior to IFRS transition have not  
been restated to comply with IFRS 3, Business Combinations.
Changes in accounting policies
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those  
of the previous financial year except as follows:
The Group has adopted the following new and amended 
IFRSs and International Financial Reporting Interpretations 
Committee (IFRIC) interpretations during the year. 
IAS 39 & Amendments to IAS 39 and IFRS 7 —  
   IFRS 7    Reclassification of Financial Assets
IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements 
IFRIC 14  IAS 19 — The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset,  
    Minimum Funding Requirements and  
their Interaction
The principal effects of these changes are as follows:
IFRIC 14, IAS 19 – The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset,  
Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction 
This interpretation sets out when refunds or reductions in 
future contributions to a defined benefit scheme should be 
regarded as available in accordance with IAS 19, Employee 
Benefits, how a minimum funding requirement might affect 
the availability of reductions in future contributions and when 
a minimum funding requirement might give rise to a liability. 
The Group has adopted IFRIC 14 with effect from 1 April 
2008 in line with its transitional provisions and comparative 
information has been restated accordingly. This has resulted 
in the recognition of an additional liability for the irrecoverable 
element of a potential future surplus in the UK Main Pension 
Scheme at 31 March 2008 and 31 March 2009. In accordance 
with the Group’s accounting policy for defined benefit schemes 
under IAS 19, the movement in the irrecoverable element of the 
potential pension surplus is taken directly to the consolidated 
statement of recognised income and expense. 
The net pension liability of £284 million at 31 March 2008 has 
been restated by an increase in liability of £66 million. The 
additional liability recognised at 31 March 2009 is £86 million. 
The corresponding movement recognised in the consolidated 
statement of recognised income and expenditure in the year 
ended 31 March 2008 is £66 million and £20 million in the 
year ended 31 March 2009. Further details of the impact of 
this change in accounting policy is given on the face of the 
consolidated statement of recognised income and expense 
and in Note 25.
Other than the changes noted above, adoption of these 
standards and interpretations has not had any material effect 
on the Financial Statements of the Group. 
Exceptional items
Exceptional items are material items of income and 
expense that should be separately disclosed to assist in the 
understanding of the Group’s financial performance and 
in making projections of future results. Such items may be 
operating or non-operating in nature. Exceptional items are 
presented separately on the face of the income statement and 
analysed in the Notes to the Financial Statements.
Foreign currencies
The presentation currency of the Group and functional 
currency of Invensys plc is sterling.
The Financial Statements for each of the Group’s subsidiaries 
are prepared using their functional currency. The functional 
currency is generally the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which an entity operates. 
Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the 
exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are retranslated at the exchange rates ruling at 
the balance sheet date. Exchange differences arising are 
recognised in the income statement unless:
a) the monetary assets or liabilities to which they relate form 
the hedging instrument in a cash flow hedging relationship 
that qualifies for hedge accounting; or
Accounting policies Invensys plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2009  |  55
b)  the monetary assets or liabilities to which they relate form 
part of a net investment in a foreign operation;
in which case they are recognised directly in equity.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical 
cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange 
rate as at the date of the initial transaction.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities measured at fair value 
in a foreign currency are translated at the rates prevailing 
when the fair value was determined. Gains and losses arising 
on retranslation are included in the income statement for 
the period, except for exchange differences arising on non-
monetary assets and liabilities where the changes in fair value 
are recognised directly in equity.
Financial statements of foreign operations
The trading results of overseas subsidiaries are translated 
into sterling at average rates of exchange ruling during the 
year. Assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiaries, including 
goodwill, are translated into sterling at closing rates of 
exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. All resulting 
exchange differences are recognised directly in a separate 
component of equity. On disposal of a foreign operation, any 
cumulative exchange differences held in equity are transferred 
to the consolidated income statement, as part of the profit or 
loss on sale.
Translation differences that arose before the date of transition 
to IFRS were deemed to be zero at that date. As a result, if 
a foreign operation is sold, there is no exchange difference 
recognised in the income statement relating to the period prior 
to that date.
Revenue
Composition of revenue
Revenue comprises the invoiced value of goods and services 
supplied by the Group excluding intragroup transactions 
and sales taxes. Revenue relating to construction contracts, 
including long-term service provision contracts, represents 
the value of work performed during the year determined by 
reference to the stage of completion of the contract. Discounts 
given to customers against list prices, such as trade or volume 
discounts, are deducted in arriving at the value of revenue. 
Settlement discounts are reported as an expense in the  
income statement.
Recognition of revenue and profits
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the 
economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can 
be reliably measured. The specific methods used to recognise 
the different forms of revenue earned by the Group are set  
out below.
Sale of goods
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the 
significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods 
have passed to the buyer and the amount of revenue can be 
reliably measured. For sales of software solutions, revenue 
is recognised when a signed contract exists, delivery to the 
customer has occurred, no significant vendor obligations 
remain and collection of the sales proceeds is considered 
probable. A contract to deliver goods, including software 
solutions, that requires significant production, modification, 
customisation or integration of the goods, is accounted for  
in its entirety as a construction contract.
Profit is recognised at the time of sale.
Construction contracts and rendering of services
Revenue from construction contracts and long-term service 
provision contracts is recognised by reference to the stage of 
completion of contract activity at the balance sheet date. This 
is normally determined by the proportion that contract costs 
incurred to date bear to the estimated total contract costs, 
except where this would not be representative of the stage 
of completion. If the nature of a particular contract means 
that costs incurred do not accurately reflect the progress of 
contract activity, an alternative approach is used such as the 
achievement of pre-determined contract milestones.
Variations in contract work, claims and incentive payments are 
included in revenue from construction contracts when certain 
criteria are met. Variations are included when the customer 
has agreed to the variation or acknowledged liability for the 
variation in principle. Claims are included when negotiations 
with the customer have reached an advanced stage such that 
the customer is certain to accept the claim. Incentive payments 
are included when a contract is sufficiently advanced that it 
is probable that the performance standards triggering the 
incentive will be achieved.
Profit attributable to contract activity is recognised if the final 
outcome of such contracts can be reliably assessed. On all 
contracts, full provision is made for any losses in the year in 
which they are first foreseen.
Revenue from services provided on a short-term or one-off 
basis is recognised when the service is complete.
When a transaction combines a supply of goods with the 
provision of a significant service, revenue from the provision 
of the service is recognised separately from the revenue from 
the sale of goods by reference to the stage of completion of 
the service unless the service is essential to the functionality 
of the goods supplied, in which case the whole transaction is 
treated as a construction contract. Revenue from a service that 
is incidental to the supply of goods is recognised at the same 
time as the revenue from the supply of goods.
Research and development
All research expenditure is expensed as incurred. 
Development expenditure is expensed as incurred unless it 
meets the criteria for recognition as an intangible asset (see 
policy on Other intangible assets).
Pension costs and other post-retirement benefits
For defined benefit plans, the service cost of providing 
retirement benefits to employees during the year is charged 
to operating profit or loss in the year. The cost of providing 
benefits under the defined benefit plans is determined 
separately for each plan using the projected unit credit 
actuarial valuation method. The full cost of providing 
amendments to benefits in respect of past service that vests 
immediately is also charged to operating profit or loss in 
the year. The expected return on the assets of the schemes 
during the year based on the market value of scheme assets at 
the start of the financial year is included within other finance 
charges — IAS 19. This also includes a charge representing the 
expected increase in liabilities of the schemes during the year, 
arising from the liabilities of the scheme being one year closer 
to payment. Differences between actual and expected returns 
on assets during the year are recognised in the statement of 
recognised income and expense in the year, together with  56  |  Invensys plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Accounting policies continued
differences from changes in assumptions. The net surplus or 
deficit on defined benefit pension schemes is reported on the 
balance sheet within the pension asset or liability. 
For defined contribution schemes the amount charged 
to the income statement in respect of pension costs is the 
contributions payable in the year. Differences between 
contributions payable in the year and contributions actually 
paid are shown either as accruals or prepayments in the 
balance sheet.
Goodwill
On a business combination, the net fair value of the identifiable 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is assessed and 
adjustments are made to bring the accounting policies of 
businesses acquired into alignment with those of the Group. 
The excess of the price paid over the Group’s interest in the 
fair value of identifiable net assets acquired is included in 
intangible assets as goodwill. Any costs of integrating the 
acquired business are taken to the income statement.
Goodwill arising on business combinations before 1 April 2004 
has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amount subject 
to being tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill written 
off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been 
reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent 
profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment annually, 
or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying value may be impaired, and it is 
subsequently carried at cost less accumulated impairment 
losses. The Group’s policy on testing assets for impairment is 
set out under ‘Impairment of non-financial assets’ below.
Gains and losses on the disposal of a business include the 
carrying amount of goodwill relating to the business sold.
Internally generated goodwill is not recognised as an asset.
Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. The cost 
of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is the 
fair value at acquisition date. The cost of separately acquired 
intangible assets, including computer software, comprises  
the purchase price and any directly attributable costs of 
preparing the asset for use. Amortisation begins when an  
asset is available for use and is calculated on a straight-line 
basis to allocate the cost less residual value of assets over  
their estimated useful lives using the following annual rates  
or useful lives:
Development costs  10 to 25%
Computer software costs  10 to 25%
Patents, trademarks and licenses  Shorter of period of the 
   agreement or 15 years
Useful lives are examined on an annual basis and adjustments 
where applicable are made on a prospective basis. No 
intangible assets other than goodwill are considered to have 
indefinite useful lives.
Expenditure incurred on development projects is capitalised 
as an intangible asset if it meets the recognition criteria set out 
in IAS 38, Intangible Assets. These require it to be probable 
that the expenditure will generate future economic benefits 
and can be measured reliably. To meet these criteria, it is 
necessary to be able to demonstrate, among other things, the 
technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that  
it will be available for use or sale.
Costs incurred in the preliminary stage of a development 
project are considered to be research costs, and are 
recognised in the income statement as incurred. These 
costs are incurred to determine the product concepts and 
alternatives, evaluate the alternatives and related risks, 
assess the technical feasibility of concepts, make the final 
selection from the possible alternatives and prepare the 
high level design and project planning. The costs incurred 
in the following development stage for substantially new or 
improved products are assessed against the IAS 38 criteria and 
considered for recognition as an asset when they meet those 
criteria. These costs are generally incurred in developing the 
detailed product design, software configuration and software 
interfaces; the coding of software, building of prototypes and 
integration of the software with hardware; and testing and 
releasing the product to manufacture and pilot production. 
Development expenditure directed towards incremental 
improvements in existing products does not qualify for 
recognition as an intangible asset.
In general the costs of developing software products that  
are sold in packaged form and not integrated and sold  
with hardware are not recognised as intangible assets.  
The uncertainties associated with the functionality of these 
products mean that technical feasibility is achieved only 
immediately prior to or after field trial tests at customer sites. 
As a result minimal or no costs are considered to meet the  
IAS 38 criteria for recognition.
An intangible asset acquired in a business combination 
is recognised separately from the goodwill arising on the 
business combination if the asset’s fair value can be measured 
reliably, regardless of whether the asset had been recognised 
previously by the acquiree.
Property, plant and equipment
Items of property, plant and equipment are carried at cost 
less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment 
losses. The cost of property, plant and equipment comprises 
purchase price and directly attributable costs.
Items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated 
to their residual values on a straight-line basis over their 
estimated useful lives at the following rates applied to  
original cost:
Freehold land  nil
Freehold buildings  2 to 2.5%
Leasehold properties  Over the period of the lease
Plant and equipment  7 to 35%
Useful lives and residual values are examined on an annual 
basis and adjustments, where applicable, are made on  
a prospective basis.
Impairment of non-financial assets
At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether there is 
any indication that any non-financial asset (excluding goodwill) 
may be impaired. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually 
whether or not there is any indication of impairment. Goodwill 
was also tested for impairment at the date of transition to IFRS.  Invensys plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2009  |  57
If there is an indication of impairment, the Group makes an 
estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount. Where the carrying 
amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount the asset is 
written down to its recoverable amount and an impairment loss 
is recognised in the income statement.
An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value 
less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an 
individual asset. If the asset does not generate cash inflows that 
are largely independent of those from other assets or groups 
of assets the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to 
which the asset belongs is determined.
The calculation of an asset’s value in use uses a discount  
rate that reflects the asset specific risks and the time value  
of money.
Leased assets
Assets held under finance leases are capitalised and included 
in property, plant and equipment at fair value or, if lower, the 
present value of the minimum lease payments. Capitalised 
leased assets are subsequently depreciated over the shorter 
of the lease term or the asset’s useful life. Obligations related 
to finance leases, net of finance charges in respect of future 
periods, are included as appropriate within liabilities. Lease 
payments are apportioned between the finance charges and 
reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate 
of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance 
charges are charged directly against income.
Other leases are classified as operating leases. Lease 
payments, including any premium paid at the outset of the 
lease, made under operating leases are recognised as an 
expense over the lease term on a straight-line basis.
The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains 
a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at its 
inception date and an assessment of whether the fulfilment  
of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset 
or assets or the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset.
A reassessment is made after inception of the lease only if one 
of the following applies:
(a) there is a change in contractual terms, other than a renewal 
or extension of the arrangement;
(b) a renewal option is exercised or extension granted, unless 
the term of the renewal or extension was initially included  
in the lease term;
(c) there is a change in the determination of whether fulfilment 
is dependent on a specified asset; or
(d)  there is a substantial change to the asset.
Where a reassessment is made, lease accounting commences 
or ceases from the date when the change in circumstances 
gave rise to the reassessment for scenarios a), c) or d) and at the 
date of renewal or extension period for scenario b).
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and estimated net 
realisable value. Provision is made for obsolete and slow-
moving items. Cost comprises the cost of raw materials, 
determined on a first-in, first-out cost basis, and an appropriate 
proportion of labour and manufacturing overheads based 
on normal operating capacity, to reflect the costs incurred in 
bringing the product to its present location and condition.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, call deposits 
and other short-term liquid investments with original maturities 
of three months or less.
Cash and short-term deposits at the balance sheet date are 
offset against bank loans and overdrafts where formal rights  
of set-off exist and there is an intention to settle on a net basis.
Taxation
Income tax on profit or loss
Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises 
current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the 
income statement except to the extent that it relates to items 
recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised  
in equity.
Current tax
The current tax payable is based on taxable profit for the year 
and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous 
years. Taxable profit differs from profit reported in the income 
statement as it excludes items that are never taxable or 
deductible, or which are taxable or deductible in other years. 
The Group’s current tax assets and liabilities are calculated 
using tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax
Deferred income tax is accounted for using the balance sheet 
liability method, providing for temporary differences between 
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial 
statements and the corresponding amounts used for taxation 
purposes. Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the 
extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available 
against which the asset can be utilised. 
No deferred income tax asset or liability is recognised in 
respect of temporary differences associated with investments 
in subsidiaries where the Group is able to control the timing 
of reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that 
the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable 
future. Such assets and liabilities are also not recognised if the 
temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial 
recognition (other than in a business combination) of other 
assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the 
taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed 
at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that 
it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be 
available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset 
to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred income tax assets are 
reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to 
the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable profit will be 
available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to 
be utilised.
Deferred income tax is measured at the tax rates that are 
expected to apply in the periods in which the asset is realised 
or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws that  
have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance 
sheet date. 58  |  Invensys plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset only if  
a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets 
against current tax liabilities and they relate to income taxes 
levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends  
to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments
The Group primarily uses forward foreign currency contracts to 
manage its exposures to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. 
These instruments are accounted for as hedges when they are 
designated as hedges at the inception of the contract. The 
Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments 
for financial trading purposes.
All derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair 
value in the balance sheet. The fair values of forward foreign 
exchange contracts are calculated by reference to forward 
exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles.
The designation of derivative financial instruments as hedges is 
carried out according to the Group’s risk management policies. 
Hedges fall into three categories:
(a) Fair value hedges, which hedge the exposure to changes  
in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability;
(b) Cash flow hedges, which hedge exposure to variability 
in cash flows that is attributable to either a particular risk 
associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly 
probable forecast transaction, or the foreign currency risk 
of a firm commitment; and
(c) Net investment hedges, which hedge exposure to changes 
in the value of the Group’s net investment in foreign 
operations due to changes in exchange rates.
The accounting treatment for these categories is outlined 
below:
Fair value hedges
When a hedging instrument is remeasured at fair value, any 
resulting gain or loss is recognised in the income statement. 
Any gain or loss on the hedged item that is attributable to the 
hedged risk is adjusted against the carrying amount of the 
hedged item and similarly recognised in the income statement.
Cash flow and net investment hedges
The portion of the gain or loss on a hedging instrument that is 
determined to be an effective hedge is recognised in equity. 
Any ineffective portion of the gain or loss is recognised in 
the income statement. When a hedged cash flow related to a 
hedged item results in the recognition of a non-financial asset 
or liability, the associated gains or losses previously recognised 
in equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset 
or liability. For all other cash flow hedges, the gains or losses 
that are recognised in equity are transferred to the income 
statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects 
the income statement. In the case of a net investment hedge, 
this takes place on disposal.
Where borrowings are used to hedge the Group’s net 
investment in foreign operations, the portion of the gain or loss 
on the borrowings that is determined to be an effective hedge, 
in accordance with IAS 39, is recognised in equity. Any gains or 
losses arising from changes in fair value of derivative financial 
instruments that do not qualify as hedges are recognised in the 
income statement.
Derivative instruments held by the Group’s pension and 
post-retirement benefit schemes are accounted for within the 
schemes themselves and are reflected in the Group Financial 
Statements within the amounts reported for those schemes.
Other financial assets
The Group’s other financial assets are classified as either 
available-for-sale, at fair value through profit or loss, or held-
to-maturity. These financial assets are recognised initially at 
fair value and subsequently measured as follows: (a) at fair 
value for available-for-sale financial assets. Gains and losses 
are recognised in equity except for impairment losses, interest 
and dividends arising from these assets which are recognised 
in the income statement; (b) at fair value for financial assets at 
fair value through profit or loss. Net gains or losses are based 
on changes in fair value; and (c) at amortised cost, using the 
effective interest rate method, for held-to-maturity financial 
assets. Changes to the carrying amount of held-to-maturity 
assets are recognised in the income statement.
Trade and other receivables are measured at amortised cost 
less any provision for impairment. Trade and other receivables 
are discounted when the time value of money is considered 
material. Any change in their value is recognised in the  
income statement.
Debt instruments
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair  
value of the consideration received less directly attributable 
issue costs. 
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings 
are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest rate method. This cost is computed as the 
amount initially recognised minus principal repayments, 
plus or minus the cumulative amortisation of any difference 
between the initially recognised amount and the maturity 
amount. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account 
any issue costs, and any discount or premium on settlement. 
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement 
through the amortisation process and when the liabilities  
are derecognised.
Financial guarantee contracts
A financial guarantee contract is a contract issued by the 
Group that requires the Group to make specified payments 
to reimburse the holder of the guarantee for a loss it incurs 
because a specified debtor fails to make payment when due 
in accordance with the original or modified terms of a debt 
instrument. In a very limited number of cases, the Group has 
issued such contracts to guarantee certain borrowings by  
third parties.
Financial guarantee contracts are initially recognised at fair 
value and subsequently measured at the higher of (a) the 
estimated outflow of resources required to meet any present 
obligation under the contract (in accordance with IAS 37, 
Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets), and 
(b) the amount initially recognised less, when appropriate, 
cumulative amortisation recognised in accordance with  
IAS 18, Revenue.
Derecognition of financial instruments
A financial asset or liability is generally derecognised when  
the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled  
or expires.
Accounting policies continued Invensys plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2009  |  59
Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another 
from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the 
terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an 
exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the 
original liability and the recognition of a new liability, and the 
difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised  
in the income statement.
Impairment of financial assets
At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether a financial 
asset or group of financial assets is impaired.
Assets carried at amortised cost
Assets carried at amortised cost, such as loans and receivables, 
are impaired if there is objective evidence that an impairment 
loss has been incurred. The loss is measured as the difference 
between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of 
estimated future cash flows (excluding future expected credit 
losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial 
asset’s original effective interest rate (i.e. the effective interest 
rate computed at initial recognition). The carrying amount of 
the asset is reduced through use of an allowance account and 
the amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement.
The assessment considers whether objective evidence  
of impairment exists individually for financial assets that are 
individually significant, and individually or collectively for 
financial assets that are not individually significant. If it is 
determined that no objective evidence of impairment exists  
for an individually assessed financial asset, the asset is 
included in a group of financial assets with similar credit risk 
characteristics and that group of financial assets is collectively 
assessed for impairment. Assets that are individually assessed 
for impairment and for which an impairment loss is recognised 
are not included in a collective assessment of impairment.
If the amount of a recognised impairment loss decreases 
in a subsequent period, and the decrease can be related 
objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was 
recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is 
reversed. The reversal is recognised in the income statement, 
to the extent that the carrying value of the asset does not 
exceed its amortised cost at the reversal date.
For trade receivables, a provision for impairment is made 
when there is objective evidence (such as the probability of 
insolvency or significant financial difficulties of the debtor) that 
the Group will not be able to collect all of the amounts due 
under the original terms of the invoice. The carrying amount of 
the receivable is reduced through use of an allowance account. 
Impaired debts are derecognised when they are assessed as 
uncollectible.
Available-for-sale financial investments
If an available-for-sale asset is impaired, an amount comprising 
the difference between its cost (net of any principal payment 
and amortisation) and its current fair value, less any impairment 
loss previously recognised in the income statement, is 
transferred from equity to the income statement. Reversals  
in respect of equity instruments classified as available for sale 
are not recognised in the income statement. Reversals  
of impairment losses on debt instruments are reversed  
through the income statement, if the increase in fair value  
of the instrument can be objectively related to an event 
occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in the 
income statement.
Share-based payment
The Group operates various equity-settled and cash-settled 
share schemes.
For equity-settled share options, the services received from 
employees are measured by reference to the fair value of 
the share options. The fair value is calculated at grant date 
using a valuation model and recognised in the consolidated 
income statement, together with a corresponding increase in 
shareholders’ equity, on a straight-line basis over the vesting 
period, based on an estimate of the number of options that 
will eventually vest. Vesting conditions, other than market 
conditions, are not taken into account when estimating the fair 
value. Market conditions are those conditions that are linked to 
the share price of the Company.
For equity-settled share award schemes, the fair value is 
calculated based on the share price at the grant date and, 
where applicable, any market vesting conditions, and 
expensed over the vesting period based on the number of 
shares expected to vest. No expense is recognised for awards 
that do not ultimately vest, with the exception of awards where 
vesting is conditional upon a market condition; these are 
treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market 
condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance 
conditions are met.
For cash-settled share awards, the services received from 
employees are measured at fair value and recognised in the 
consolidated income statement as an expense over the vesting 
period with recognition of a corresponding liability. The fair 
value of the liability is remeasured at each reporting date and 
at the date of settlement with changes in fair value recognised 
in the consolidated income statement.
In accordance with the exemption permitted by IFRS 1, First-
time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, 
applied by the Group on transition to IFRSs, the requirements 
of IFRS 2, Share-based Payment, have not been applied to 
equity instruments granted on or before 7 November 2002 and 
those vesting before 1 January 2005.
Treasury shares
Own equity instruments which are reacquired (treasury shares) 
are deducted from equity. No gain or loss is recognised in 
profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of 
the Group’s own equity instruments. Treasury shares are 
purchased and held by the Employee Share Trust to meet 
future distributions of shares to employees under the Group’s 
various share option and share award schemes.

The Group expects to adopt these standards and interpretations 
in accordance with their effective dates. The directors do 
not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and 
interpretations will have a material impact on the Group 
Financial Statements in the period of initial application.
Upon adoption of IFRS 8, the Group will be required to 
adopt the ‘management approach’ to reporting on the 
financial performance of its operating segments, so that the 
segment information to be reported would generally be 
what management uses internally for evaluating segment 
performance and deciding how to allocate resources to 
operating segments. The Group has evaluated the effect of 
this standard and considers that its adoption will not have a 
significant impact on the segment information reported, which 
is already consistent with the information used internally by the 
Group. There will be no effect on reported income or net assets.
Critical accounting judgments, estimates and assumptions
In applying the Group’s accounting policies, management is 
required to make judgments and assumptions concerning the 
future in a number of areas. Actual results may be different 
from those estimated using these judgments and assumptions. 
The key sources of estimation uncertainty and critical 
accounting judgments that have a significant risk of causing 
a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
Impairment of goodwill
The Group determines whether goodwill is impaired at least  
on an annual basis. This requires an estimation of the ‘value 
in use’ of the cash-generating units to which the goodwill 
is allocated. Estimating a value in use amount requires 
management to make an estimate of the expected future  
cash flows from the cash-generating unit and also to choose  
a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present  
value of those cash flows. The carrying amount of goodwill  
at 31 March 2009 was £306 million (2008: £215 million). Details 
of the key assumptions used in testing for impairment and 
the sensitivity of the calculations to any reasonably possible 
change in those assumptions are given in Note 13. 
Pension and post-retirement benefits
The cost of defined benefit pension plans and other post 
employment medical benefits is determined using actuarial 
valuations. The actuarial valuation involves making assumptions 
about discount rates, expected rates of return on assets, future 
salary increases, mortality rates and future pension increases. Due 
to the long term nature of these plans, such estimates are subject 
to significant uncertainty. The net pension liability at 31 March 
2009 is £308 million (2008: £284 million). Further details, including 
an analysis of the sensitivity of the UK Main Pension Scheme to 
changes in the principal assumptions, are given in Note 25. 
Development costs
Costs incurred in developing new products are capitalised 
in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy for other 
intangible assets. These costs arise mainly in the Process Systems 
and Invensys Rail businesses. Determining the amounts to be 
capitalised requires management to make assumptions and 
estimates regarding the expected future cash generation of 
new products and the expected period of benefits. At 31 March 
2009, the carrying amount of capitalised development costs 
was £109 million (2008: £81 million). Further details including an 
explanation of impairment losses recognised are given in Note 14.
Provisions and contingent liabilities
The Group currently recognises provisions for a number of 
liabilities including environmental claims and onerous lease 
rentals. The amounts recognised for provisions represent 
the best estimate of the probable outflow of resources 
embodying economic benefits that will be required to settle 
these liabilities. No provisions are recognised for contingent 
liabilities. Contingent liabilities are possible obligations whose 
existence will be confirmed only by uncertain future events, 
or current obligations that are not recognised because it is 
not probable that they will result in an outflow of resources 
embodying economic benefits or because the amount of the 
obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.  Invensys plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2009  |  61
The determination of whether a liability should be disclosed 
as a contingent liability or recognised as a provision requires 
judgements to be made on the existence of a present obligation 
and the probability of future events. When a provision 
is required, the amount recognised is determined using 
judgements and assumptions, based on current knowledge,  
to estimate the amount and timing of future cash outflows 
arising from the liabilities. At 31 March 2009, the estimated 
amount of liabilities requiring provisions was £211 million 
(2008: £162 million). Further details are given in Note 24. Details 
of the Group’s contingent liabilities are set out in Note 30.
Construction and long-term service provision contracts 
The Group’s Process Systems and Invensys Rail businesses 
undertake projects that frequently span more than one 
accounting period and are accounted for as construction or 
long-term service provision contracts. The Group’s accounting 
policies for these projects require revenues and costs to be 
allocated to individual accounting periods and the consequent 
recognition at period end of contract assets or liabilities for 
projects still in progress. The application of these policies 
requires management to apply judgement in estimating the 
total revenue and total costs expected on each project. Such 
estimates are revised as a project progresses to reflect the 
current status of the project and the latest information available 
to management. Project management teams perform regular 
reviews to ensure the latest estimates are appropriate.  
The amount of revenue relating to projects accounted for 
as construction or long-term service provision contracts 
recognised in the year ended 31 March 2009 was £1,110 
million (2008: £1,070 million). The net amount due to contract 
customers on projects in progress at 31 March 2009 was  
£25 million (2008: £92 million due to contract customers). 
Further details of amounts due from and to contract customers 
are included in Note 18. 62  |  Invensys plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2009

  The increase in audit fees for local statutory audits for the year ended 31 March 2009 is attributable to movements in foreign exchange rates and an increase in the 
number of subsidiaries audited by the Group’s auditors. The audits of these subsidiaries were previously performed by other audit firms.

  Fees for other services payable for the year ended 31 March 2009 include £0.7 million relating to completion accounts of disposed companies and £0.4 million 
for work performed in relation to the Company’s reduction of capital.

7 Foreign exchange losses on financial items
Foreign exchange losses on financial items are £nil (2008: £21 million). This includes £8 million (2008: £13 million gain) of foreign 
exchange losses relating to derivatives used in the management of the Group’s cash, offset by £8 million (2008: £nil) of foreign 
exchange gains on corresponding cash balances and intra-group loans which do not form part of the lenders’ net investment in 
foreign operations. Following the repayment of external loans in March and May 2008, the Group no longer has any significant external 
borrowings. As a result, foreign exchange losses in the year attributable to such borrowings were £nil (2008: £34 million).
In the year ended 31 March 2008 foreign currency borrowings were held as an economic hedge by reference to the Group’s underlying 
cash generation by currency. However, they were not accounted for as net investment hedges under IAS 39 and consequently exchange 
differences arising on these borrowings were recorded in the income statement. 68  |  Invensys plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2009

The standard rate of UK corporation tax was reduced from 30% to 28% in the Finance Act 2008 with effect from 1 April 2008. The total 
tax charge for the year of £21 million (2008: £40 million) is lower (2008: lower) than the standard rate of UK corporation tax of 28%  
(2008: 30%). The key factors are explained below:

(iii) Factors that may affect future tax charges
As the Group is involved in worldwide operations, Invensys is subject to several factors which may affect future tax charges, principally 
the levels and mix of profitability in different jurisdictions in which the Group may or may not have offsetting tax losses, and the various 
tax rates imposed in those jurisdictions. 
(iv) Franked Investment Income Group Litigation Order
In December 2006, Invensys filed a claim in the High Court for compensation arising from the payment of advance corporation tax and 
from satisfying liabilities to corporation tax arising from the receipt of dividends from non UK resident subsidiaries. Invensys contends 
that these tax liabilities were incurred in breach of its EU community law rights. Invensys joined a Group Litigation Order with over  
20 other corporates from whom two test cases were selected to proceed to trial on a representative basis.
In December 2006, the European Court of Justice issued its guidance to the UK High Court on the compatability of certain UK tax 
provisions within EU community law. The test cases returned to the UK High Court for the full hearing in July 2008, with the UK High 
Court issuing its judgement on 27 November 2008.
The UK High Court judgement in November 2008 found in favour of the claimants on certain key aspects of the claim. The judgement 
concluded, inter alia, that dividends received from EU subsidiaries should be, and should have been, effectively exempt from UK 
taxation. It also concluded that certain dividends received from EU subsidiaries before 5 April 1999 and, in some limited circumstances, 
after 1993 from outside the EU, should have been treated as franked investment income with the consequence that advance 
corporation tax need not have been paid. The case will now proceed to the Court of Appeal. Depending on the outcome of the appeal, 
a further reference to the European Court of Justice may be necessary before the issue is ultimately resolved.
Given the importance of the matters it is expected that appeals will ultimately be taken to the House of Lords and therefore this process 
may take several years to complete. Given the complexity and uncertainty over the issues raised it is not possible to predict the amounts 
and final outcome with any reasonable certainty. As a result no contingent asset has been recognised in these Financial Statements.
 
10 Discontinued operations
No operations have been discontinued in the year to 31 March 2009. Additional costs have been incurred relating to prior year 
disposals. Discontinued operations in the prior year comprised the APV, Safety, Reversing Valves and Burco businesses which were  
all sold in the year ended 31 March 2008.

The basic earnings/(loss) per share for the year has been calculated using 799 million shares (2008: 795 million), being the weighted 
average number of shares in issue during the year, excluding those held as Treasury shares which are treated as cancelled, and the profit 
after taxation and minority interests for continuing operations, discontinued operations and total Group as shown above.
An additional earnings per share calculation for continuing operations has been included since the directors consider that this gives 
useful additional indications of underlying performance. This is based on earnings before exceptional finance costs and income, foreign 
exchange losses on financial items and PPP settlement credit.
The diluted earnings/(loss) per share has been calculated in accordance with IAS 33, Earnings per Share without reference to 
adjustments in respect of certain share options which are considered to be anti-dilutive.
There have been no significant transactions involving ordinary shares or potential ordinary shares between the reporting date and the 
date of completion of these Financial Statements. 72  |  Invensys plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2009

There was £nil (2008: £nil) depreciation charged in the year in respect of assets held under finance leases.
Leased assets are pledged as security for the related finance lease. The title to plant and machinery with a carrying amount of £1 million 
(2008: £1 million) has been pledged as security for liabilities.
Included in plant and equipment at 31 March 2009 was an amount of £6 million (2008: £9 million) relating to expenditure for plant and 
equipment in the course of construction.
Impairment losses of £16 million comprise £11 million in Process Systems and £2 million within Corporate due to property and 
freehold land impairments as a result of current market conditions and £3 million for the write-down of assets in relation to the closure 
of manufacturing plants within Invensys Controls business. (2008: £4 million comprising £3 million for the write-down of assets in 
relation to the closure of manufacturing plants within the Invensys Controls business and £1 million of property impairments within the 
Eurotherm business). The recoverable amounts of these assets were estimated based on their fair value less costs to sell. Fair values 
were determined based on an assessment of the current market values of the assets and past experience of sales of similar assets. Invensys plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2009  |  73

Annual impairment test
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.  
The recoverable amounts of each of the CGUs are determined from ‘value in use’ calculations using cash flow projections over  
a five year period.
The key assumptions for the ‘value in use’ calculations are:
• 	 r e v e n u e 	 v o l u m e s ;
• 	 r e v e n u e 	 p r i c e s ;
• 	 o p e r a t i n g 	 c o s t s ;
• 	 g r o w t h 	 r a t e 	 a s s u m p t i o n s 	 f o r 	 ye a r s 	 f o u r 	 a n d 	 fi v e 	 o f 	 t h e 	 c a s h 	 fl o w 	 p r o j e c t i o n s ;
• 	 g r o w t h 	 i n 	 p e r p e t u i t y 	 a p p l i e d 	 t o 	 c a l c u l a t e 	 t h e 	 t e r m i n a l 	 v a l u e ; 	 a n d
• 	 d i s c o u n t 	 r a t e .
Expected revenue volumes, revenue prices and operating costs are those included in the most recent financial annual operating 
plans approved by management. They reflect management’s current expectations for each CGU taking account of expected future 
developments in markets and operations.
Cash flows for years four and five are projected at a growth rate appropriate for the relevant CGU. These growth rates take into 
consideration forecast GDP growth rates for the countries of operation, expected market growth rates for those regions and the levels 
of growth achieved historically by the CGU and forecast in the periods covered by the annual operating plan. Lower growth rates are 
applied in perpetuity to calculate the terminal value for each CGU. These rates do not exceed the average long-term growth rate for 
the relevant markets. A discount rate is derived for each CGU by adjusting the Group’s weighted average cost of capital to reflect the 
relative level of risk associated with the CGU’s cash flow projections. The discount rate is a pre-tax rate. These discount rates and growth 
rates by CGU are as follows:

In all cases the recoverable amounts of these CGUs were in excess of their carrying values and no impairment arose in the year  
(2008: £nil).
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions
With respect to the assessment of ‘value in use’ of all CGUs except Eurotherm, management believes that no reasonable possible 
change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of those CGUs to exceed its recoverable amount. With 
respect to Eurotherm the details are tabulated below:

  Impairment losses of £1 million in the year ended 31 March 2009 relate to the write-down of a specific development asset in Invensys Rail. The future revenues 
expected to be derived from the asset have been significantly delayed during the year and are no longer sufficiently certain to support continued recognition of 
the asset. The carrying amount of the asset has been written down to £nil. (2008: £1 million related to specific development assets in Invensys Rail. The technology 
represented by those assets was no longer expected to be used as intended following the PPP settlement and its recoverable amount was reassessed accordingly). 76  |  Invensys plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2009

Unrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it is probable 
that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. The Group has unrecognised 
income tax losses of £1,191 million with a tax value of £372 million (2008: £1,081 million with a tax value of £339 million) available for 
offset against future profits. Included in unrecognised tax losses are losses of £54 million (2008: £40 million) that will expire within  
four years.
A deferred income tax asset has not been recognised on temporary differences of £533 million with a tax value of £167 million  
(2008: £494 million with a tax value of £158 million, as restated for the adoption of IFRIC 14) in respect of pension and other retirement 
benefit obligations and other deductible temporary differences.
The above tax values include the impact of changes in tax rates in various territories.
The Group has unrecognised capital losses of £782 million (2008: £1,966 million) that are only available for offset against future capital 
gains. Included in capital losses are losses of £206 million (2008: £1,401 million) that will expire within four years. Other capital losses 
may be carried forward indefinitely.
The temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries for which a deferred income tax liability has not been recognised, 
aggregate to £533 million (2008: £998 million). No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group  
is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not  
reverse in the foreseeable future. Going forward, no significant tax charge would be expected to arise from the reversal of these 
temporary differences given that a dividend exemption is expected to be introduced in the UK with effect from 1 July 2009 such that 
dividends received in the UK from overseas subsidiaries will be exempt from UK taxation, assuming the draft legislation is enacted 
without changes. Invensys plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2009  |  77

Available-for-sale investments
Available-for-sale financial assets consist of investments in listed ordinary shares and therefore have no fixed maturity date or coupon 
rate. These investments were not acquired with the intention of selling them in the near term. Financial assets with a carrying amount  
of £25 million classified as held for sale in the September 2008 half-yearly Financial Statements were sold for £27 million during the 
second half of the year ended 31 March 2009.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
The investments classified as at fair value through profit or loss represent investments in unlisted securities that offer the Group the 
opportunity for return through fair value gains. The amounts reported at 31 March 2008 related to Nikkei-linked securities with final 
maturity dates between 2010 and 2020. These securities were sold during the year ended 31 March 2009 for £5 million. Market values 
were determined by external security dealers using pricing models, based on various financial factors including bond prices, foreign 
exchange rates, interest rates and the Nikkei Index prices. The total amount of the change in fair value estimated using a valuation 
technique that was recognised in the income statement during the year was £2 million (2008: £1 million). These assets were classified  
as held for trading.
Held-to-maturity investments
Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities that the 
Group’s management has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity. They are included in non-current assets unless the 
investment is due to mature within 12 months of the balance sheet date. Held-to-maturity investments comprise £9 million of US 
Treasury Notes held to defease the covenants in the Group’s remaining 144A Bonds and £14 million of deposits held to secure certain 
bonding facilities (2008: £nil).
Details of the Group’s principal subsidiary undertakings are included in the listing of Principal Subsidiaries on page 135.

Trade receivables are recorded net of an allowance for estimated irrecoverable amounts from the sale of goods. The average credit 
period taken on sales of goods is 56 days.
The allowance that has been made for estimated irrecoverable amounts from the sale of goods is £14 million (2008: £9 million).  
This allowance has been determined by reference to past default experience. The impairment loss recognised in the year as a result  
of irrecoverable receivables balances is £7 million (2008: £1 million gain).
Trade and other receivables are predominantly non-interest bearing. Other receivables include amounts owed by associated 
undertakings, interest receivable, refundable deposits, refunds due in respect of VAT, sales and payroll taxes, commissions earned  
and insurance recoveries.

Generally the Group does not hold any collateral as security against trade receivables that are impaired or past due but not impaired. 
The Group performs credit verification procedures on all customers. Receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis.
Further information on the Group’s approach to credit risk in relation to trade and other receivables is given in Note 22.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of current and non-current trade and other receivables approximates to their fair value. 80  |  Invensys plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2009

Cash and cash equivalents attract interest based on relevant national LIBID equivalents. Short-term deposits have an average maturity 
of 12 days (2008: 2 days). The fair value of cash and cash equivalents is not materially different from their book value. For information  
on the exposure of the Group’s cash and cash equivalents balances to credit risk refer to Note 22.
Restricted cash and short-term deposits
As an international Group, Invensys has operations in a number of territories (such as China, Brazil and India) which place restrictions  
on the ability of subsidiaries to lend money to other Group entities outside those territories. However, distributions to the Group  
are permitted from audited reserves. At 31 March 2009 restricted cash and cash equivalents held in such territories totalled £73 million  
(2008: £58 million).
Where banks that are not part of the Group’s lending syndicate provide substantial local bonding facilities, current market conditions 
dictate that they may require collateral which can be provided in the form of a letter of credit (issued under the Group’s syndicated 
facility) or a cash deposit. Given the Group’s net cash position, a deposit can be the most cost-effective way of providing such collateral.
Cash and cash equivalents include £22 million (2008: £31 million) of cash collateral held in the ordinary course of business to provide 
security for local bonding facilities.

covenants in relation to financial ratios; acquisitions are permitted up to £100 million per annum in aggregate, in addition the proceeds from certain disposals may 
also be used for acquisitions; dividends are allowed, provided they are paid out of the previous year’s free cash flow (this restriction does not apply if the Company 
has an investment grade rating).

As at 31 March 2009, the committed syndicated loan facilities available to the Group comprised a £400 million multicurrency credit 
facility with a term of five years from July 2008. The facility is available for drawdown as loans, letters of credit or guarantees. This facility 
replaced the banking facilities put in place during the 2006 Refinancing. The available facilities at 31 March 2009 were £400 million of 
which £217 million was drawn other than as a cash advance.

  These loans and borrowings were secured by fixed and floating charges over certain Group companies’ assets. At 31 March 2008 £1 million of such loans were 
classified as current liabilities.
2
  The borrowers had the right to prepay these facilities at par on five days notice. The lenders had the right to seek early repayment following any ‘Event of Default’ 
or ‘Change of Control’. These facilities carried maintenance covenants that included a maximum ratio of debt to earnings, a minimum level of interest cover and a 
maximum level of capital expenditure. The covenants measured these as a number and had to show performance better than a defined scale, which changed over 
the period of the facilities. The Group showed ratios better than those required by the relevant agreements. Failure to satisfy these covenants would have allowed 
the lenders to call for immediate repayment of loans made to the Group.

  These loans were repaid in full and cancelled on 7 May 2008.

22 Financial risk management and financial instruments
The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise bank and other loans, cash and cash equivalents, other financial assets, trade 
and other receivables and trade and other payables. The Group also enters into derivative transactions, primarily forward currency 
contracts. This note explains the nature and extent of the risks arising from financial instruments; how those risks arise; the objectives, 
policies and processes used by the Group for managing the risks; and the methods used to measure the risks.
Overview of treasury policy
The Group manages its exposure to risks arising from its use of financial instruments by the application of its treasury policy.
The Group’s treasury policy is approved by the Board and seeks to ensure that:
• 	 a p p r o p r i a t e 	 fi n a n c i a l 	 r e s o u r c e s 	 a r e 	 a v a i l a b l e 	 f o r 	 t h e 	 m a i n t e n a n c e 	 a n d 	 d e v e l o p m e n t 	 o f 	 t h e 	 G r o u p ’ s 	 b u s i n e s s e s ;
• 	 	 t h e 	 fi n a n c i a l 	 r i s k 	 o f 	 c u r r e n c y , 	 i n t e r e s t 	 r a t e 	 a n d 	 c o u n t e r p a r t y 	 c r e d i t 	 e x p o s u r e 	 i s 	 u n d e r s t o o d , 	 m e a s u r e d 	 a n d 	 m a n a g e d	 
appropriately; and
• 	 	 t r e a s u r y 	 o p e r a t e s 	 a s 	 a 	 c o s t 	 c e n t r e 	 a n d 	 t h a t 	 n o 	 s p e c u l a t i v e 	 t r a n s a c t i o n s 	 a r e 	 u n d e r t a k e n .
Aside from the redemption of virtually all of the Group’s foreign currency borrowings (in advance of the significant weakening of 
Sterling), there have been no significant changes in the Group’s exposures to risk, and its approach to managing those exposures,  
in the year ended 31 March 2009 compared to the year ended 31 March 2008.
Policy in respect of the major areas of treasury management is set out below.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations as they fall due.
Operating within the strict controls of the Group’s treasury policy, the Treasury Department manages this risk, ensuring that sufficient 
funding and liquidity is available to meet the expected needs of the Group. In addition to the free cash flow of the Group, Invensys 
adopts a prudent approach to liquidity management using a mixture of long-term debt facilities and short-term cash deposits. Core 
funding and guarantee issuance is provided by a bank facility which matures in July 2013. This facility is described further in Note 21(ii), 
including the amount of undrawn committed facilities available which is a key measure of the Group’s liquidity.
Liquidity management is centralised through cash pooling arrangements and inter-company funding structures, under the control 
of the Treasury Department. In countries where cash pooling arrangements cannot be implemented, cash balances are monitored to 
ensure that surplus amounts are repatriated and deficits adequately funded. The Treasury Department maintains sufficient back-up 
liquidity in the form of available cash balances and committed facilities.
Standard business practices include the strict application of credit control procedures to ensure the collection of cash from customers 
in accordance with agreed credit periods and terms that result in positive cash flows over the life of a construction or long-term service 
provision contract whenever possible. Invensys plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2009  |  83

Interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to risk arising from the effect of changes in floating interest rates on the level of interest it pays on its borrowings 
and receives on its cash deposits.
The Group’s policy is to set the proportion of fixed- and floating-rate debt, taking into account several factors including:
• 	 t h e 	 fi n a n c i a l 	 l e v e r a g e 	 o f 	 t h e 	 G r o u p ;
• 	 t h e 	 p r o fi t a b i l i t y 	 o f 	 t h e 	 G r o u p 	 i n 	 r e l a t i o n 	 t o 	 t h e 	 b u s i n e s s 	 c yc l e ; 	 a n d
• 	 t h e 	 a b s o l u t e 	 l e v e l s 	 o f 	 i n t e r e s t 	 r a t e s .
To implement this policy the Group uses fixed-rate borrowings, interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements and currency swaps  
to manage its interest rate exposure.
As at 31 March 2009 and 31 March 2008, in line with the Group having a net cash position, Invensys had no significant fixed  
rate borrowings. 
The interest rate profiles of the Group’s cash and cash equivalents and short and long-term borrowings are set out in Notes 20 and 21 
respectively. All other financial assets and liabilities of the Group are non-interest bearing and a statement has been made to that effect 
in the relevant balance sheet notes.
Interest rate risk sensitivity analysis
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, 
of the Group’s profit before tax (through the impact on floating rate cash and borrowings). There is no impact on the Group’s equity.  
The same assumptions have been used for the years ended 31 March 2009 and 2008.

Currency risk
Transaction exposure
Currency transaction exposure arises when the Group’s businesses face revenues or costs in a currency other than their own.  
The incidence of this risk varies across the Group and is subject to change. Usually however, the majority of revenues and costs will be  
in the functional currency of the business unit undertaking the transaction. Where this is not the case and the exposure is significant,  
it is the Group’s policy for businesses to hedge their exposure.
The Group is also subject to exchange risk in making bids, particularly on major contracts. The assumption of a specific exchange rate 
within a bid would lead to a change in the anticipated margin on the contract should a bid be successful; this risk is hedged if significant.
The Group predominantly uses forward currency contracts to manage transaction exposure.
Translation exposure
The majority of the Group’s operating capital is employed in overseas locations and is denominated in foreign currencies, particularly 
US dollars. As a consequence, changes in exchange rates affect both net asset values and reported results. This risk is not hedged 
directly, but to the extent that the Group has debt, any that is held in foreign currency would reduce the level of net assets exposed  
to currency fluctuations. The interest expense of any such debt would then also reduce the level of earnings exposed to exchange  
rate movements.
The Group’s exposure to foreign currency risk is as follows:
 US dollar  Euro  Other (excl GBP)  US dollar  Euro  Other (excl GBP)

The effect on profit is derived by applying the assumed strengthening/weakening percentage to the net amount of unhedged 
monetary assets held in a currency that is not the functional currency of the Group entity holding those assets. The effect on equity is 
derived by applying the assumed strengthening/weakening percentage to the net assets of Group entities whose functional currency  
is other than sterling.
Price risk
The Group’s exposure to changing market prices on the value of financial instruments has an impact on the carrying value of financial 
assets that are classified as available-for-sale and on financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.
The Group monitors changes in the carrying amounts of these assets and any resulting change in exposure to price risk in order to 
ensure that its investment in these assets remains appropriate.
On 31 March 2009, the total carrying value of these financial assets was £nil (2008: £7 million, of which £6 million related to investments 
in unlisted securities as described in Note 16). These securities were sold during the year. Invensys plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2009  |  85
Credit risk 
The Group is exposed to risk if a counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations. Such a risk arises 
principally in relation to receivables due from customers and cash deposited with banks or other financial institutions.
The Group monitors the identity of the counterparties with whom it deposits cash and transacts other financial instruments so as  
to control exposure to any territory or institution. As far as it is both feasible and practical to do so, cash is held centrally by treasury.  
Risk is assessed using ratings from major credit rating agencies.
The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets is represented by their respective carrying values as at the balance sheet 
date (see (i) on page 86). Credit risks arising from acting as guarantor are disclosed in Note 30. 
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group. 
Details of collateral held as security and other credit enhancements in respect of receivables are given in Note 19.
Based on past experience, the directors believe that there is no significant credit risk associated with receivables that are neither past 
due nor impaired. The Group trades only with recognised, creditworthy third parties, and performs credit verification procedures on  
all customers. Receivable balances, including uninvoiced receivables reported as amounts due from contract customers, are monitored 
on an ongoing basis.
The Group has not renegotiated the terms of any significant financial assets such that those assets would have been past due or  
impaired had the terms not been renegotiated.
Derivatives
Derivatives are used to manage the interest rate and currency risks described above and further detail is provided below.
Capital management
The credit facility in place at 31 March 2009 provides liquidity for the Group until July 2013 and supports the objectives of the Group. 
This facility is described further in Note 21(ii). Investigations are continually undertaken to review alternative financing arrangements.  
In making those considerations the Board takes into account the cost of any refinancing compared to the benefits, which include terms 
and conditions, the cost of funding and repayment schedules.
There were no significant changes in the Group’s approach to capital management during the years ended 31 March 2009 and 2008.
The Group’s capital structure is as follows:

On 21 January 2009, Invensys completed a restructuring of its reserves which facilitates the payment of dividends from earnings realised 
after that date.
Net cash was £286 million (2008: £73 million) with an additional £23 million of other current financial assets resulting in net cash and 
deposits of £309 million. The improvement of £213 million is largely due to the free cash flow of £296 million which includes a receipt  
of £95 million from the PPP settlement and £32 million proceeds from the sale of financial investments. Offsetting these are payments  
of £50 million for the acquisitions of SAT Corporation and Quantum Engineering Inc. 86  |  Invensys plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2009

(i) Classification and fair values of financial assets and liabilities
The following table sets out the classification, carrying amounts and fair values of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities. The fair 
value is defined as the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arm’s length transaction between informed and 
willing parties. Where market values are not available, fair values have been calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest 
rates translated at year end exchange rates. Provisions have been included where there is a contractual obligation to settle in cash.
The fair value of financial assets and liabilities at 31 March was:

 The directors consider that the carrying amount of these financial assets and liabilities approximates to their fair value.
The Group has, in the ordinary course of business, provided indemnities to banks in respect of performance guarantees issued to 
customers. The fair value of such indemnities is not material as the likelihood of any liability arising from them is considered remote.
In a very limited number of cases, the Group has guaranteed certain borrowings by third parties. At 31 March 2009, the maximum 
credit risk to the Group arising from these guarantees was £2 million (2008: £3 million), being the total amount of such borrowings 
outstanding at that date.
Financial assets with a carrying value of up to £1 million (2008: £156 million) are subject to charges relating to such loans.
(ii) Derivative financial instruments
A summary of derivative financial instruments is as follows:

The Group uses derivatives to hedge interest rate risk, currency transaction exposure and currency translation exposure. The figures  
in the above table are analysed by category as set out below:
Interest rate swaps
Interest rate swaps were not used during the year ended 31 March 2009. During the year ended 31 March 2008 the Group used 
interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its US$ denominated bank borrowings. The last of these 
swaps expired in October 2007. No interest rate swaps were in place at 31 March 2008. During the year ended 31 March 2008, these 
instruments were designated and effective as cash flow hedges. £nil was transferred to the income statement during the year to  
31 March 2008 in respect of hedged interest cash flows.
Foreign exchange swaps and forwards used to hedge transaction exposure
The Group uses foreign exchange swaps and forwards to hedge currency exposure arising from sales and purchases made by the 
Group’s businesses in currencies other than their own functional currency. The turnover (i.e. notional principal) of such derivatives 
(which typically have a term of less than one year), excluding swaps, in the year to 31 March 2009 was £273 million (2008: £258 million) 
and their fair value at 31 March was:
     Fair  Fair

     £m  £m 
Derivative assets       2   1 
Derivative liabilities       (4) —
      (2)  1 
All of these instruments are designated and effective as cash flow hedges. £2 million relating to hedged cash flows that have not  
yet impacted the income statement have been deferred and recognised in equity at 31 March 2009 (2008: £nil). £4 million expense 
(2008: £2 million gain) has been transferred to the income statement during the year to 31 March 2009 in respect of contracts which 
matured. This amount is included within cost of sales in the income statement.
Foreign exchange swaps and forwards used to hedge translation exposure
The Group uses foreign exchange swaps and forwards to match the currency profile of its net debt to that of its net assets, revenue and 
earnings and ensure that it has sufficient cash available to meet its payment obligations by currency as they fall due. The fair value of 
such derivatives (which typically have a term of less than one year) is set out below:

Changes in the fair value of such derivatives are taken directly to the income statement. £8 million was charged to foreign exchange 
losses in the income statement in the year to 31 March 2009 (2008: £13 million credit), see Note 7.
(iii) Ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement
No amounts were recognised in the income statement relating to the ineffectiveness of cash flow hedges (2008: £nil).

Warranties are provided for in the normal course of business based on an assessment of future claims with reference to past claims. 
Such costs are generally incurred over the product life cycle. The actual amount of costs that will be incurred will depend upon the level 
and nature of future claims.
Restructuring provisions cover committed costs, the majority of which are expected to be incurred within one year of the balance  
sheet date.
Provisions for environmental remediation are made when a clean-up is probable and the amount can be determined reliably. This 
generally coincides with a commitment to a formal plan or, if earlier, on divestment or closure of inactive sites. These costs are expected 
to be incurred over the next 30 years.
Provisions for onerous contracts relate to lease rentals in respect of vacant property and the costs of other onerous contracts.  
An onerous contract is a contract in which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic 
benefits expected to be received under it. The provisions represent the best estimate of the unavoidable costs remaining under the 
current contractual terms of the contracts. These liabilities are expected to crystallise largely within the next 15 years.
Other provisions principally relate to legal claims, claims under workers’ compensation or similar employee disability benefit schemes 
and other miscellaneous obligations. These liabilities are expected to crystallise largely within the next five years. The costs are 
estimated based on the expected outcome of the legal claim or obligation. The amount of the final liability and timing of payment,  
if any, is dependent upon the final outcome of any litigation or other negotiation involved.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of provisions equates to their fair value. Invensys plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2009  |  89
25 Pensions and post-retirement benefits
(i) Defined contribution schemes
The Group operates many defined contribution schemes. Pension costs in respect of defined contribution schemes represented 
contributions payable in the year and amounted to £12 million (2008: £11 million). At 31 March 2009, there were £1 million (2008:  
£1 million) of outstanding contributions included in payables.
(ii) Defined benefit schemes — general
The Group operates many funded and unfunded defined benefit pension and post-retirement schemes. Contributions to the defined 
benefit schemes are made in accordance with the recommendations of the independent actuary of the relevant scheme. There are two 
main funded defined benefit schemes in the UK and US, together with other smaller schemes in the rest of the world. The main UK and 
US schemes are final salary in nature.
The principal Group scheme covering the majority of UK employees is the Invensys Pension Scheme. The Invensys Pension Scheme is  
a funded defined benefit scheme. The assets of this scheme are held separately from those of the Group. These assets are managed by 
trustees, who are required to act in the best interests of the schemes’ beneficiaries. The Trustee Board is made up of nine directors, four 
nominated by the Company and five by the members. The Company is responsible for appointing the Chairman from the Board. The 
last full actuarial valuation of the Scheme for funding purposes was carried out with a valuation date of 31 March 2008 by independent 
actuaries using the projected unit credit method for valuing the liabilities. This latest valuation has not made a significant change to the 
Scheme’s funding plan for the next three years. The assumptions that had the most effect on the results of this valuation for funding 
purposes are those relating to the discount rate and inflation on scheme liabilities and mortality assumptions.
There are numerous schemes operated by overseas subsidiaries. Of these the largest US scheme is assessed annually by an actuary, and the 
other overseas defined benefit schemes are normally assessed periodically by independent actuaries in accordance with local practice.
The Group also operates a number of non-pension post-retirement benefit plans, the majority of which relate to the provision of 
medical benefits to retired former employees of the Group’s subsidiaries in the US. These schemes are generally unfunded.
The last full valuations of all schemes on an IAS 19 basis have been updated to 31 March 2009 to reflect market conditions and material 
events in the plans.
(iii) Defined benefit schemes — major assumptions
The major assumptions made when valuing the liabilities of funded and unfunded schemes under IAS 19 are as follows:

(2008: 9.5% declining to 5.0%; 2007: 9.0% declining to 5.0%).

  The inflationary pension increases granted for the UK scheme in the year were 3.10% (2008: 3.70%; 2007: 3.20%). The pension increase assumptions used are in line 
with RPI, subject to a floor of 3.0% and a ceiling of 5.0%.
The demographic assumptions which were consistently applied for the main schemes are as follows:
Invensys Pension Scheme (UK)
Standard actuarial mortality tables PA92 were adopted using year of birth and medium cohort projections. Probability of death at each 
age was multiplied by 122% for males and 135% for females. Future improvements in life expectancy have been allowed for in line with 
medium cohort improvements subject to a floor of 1.00% for males and 1.25% for females.
By way of illustration the impact of the application of these mortality tables on the expected longevity of pensioners is shown below:
      Years
Retiring today at age 65:    Male    20.9
   Female    23.3
Retiring in 20 years at age 65:    Male    22.7
   Female    25.6
Invensys Pension Plan (US)
The mortality table adopted was the RP 2000 Table for combined employee/annuitants, projected to 2006 using projection scale AA.
Sensitivities
Invensys Pension Scheme (UK)
The Invensys Pension Scheme (UK) is the largest scheme within the Group, representing 75% of gross liabilities of all defined benefit 
schemes. The principal sensitivities, with all other variables held constant, are illustrated below:

(iv) Adoption of IFRIC 14
As stated in the accounting policies, the Group has adopted IFRIC 14 (IAS 19 — The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding 
Requirements and their Interaction) in these Financial Statements. In line with the transitional provisions of IFRIC 14, the change in 
accounting policy is effective from 1 April 2008, with the comparatives restated accordingly. Only the UK Main Pension Scheme has 
been affected by the adoption.
The Group is committed to making payments to the Invensys Pension Scheme under a deficit funding plan agreed with the Trustees. 
Where the present value of the agreed funding payments exceeds the liability in respect of the Scheme as measured under IFRS, and 
would therefore, when paid, give rise to a surplus as measured under IFRS, IFRIC 14 requires a provision to be made for any part of that 
surplus that would not be recoverable. Any surplus on the Invensys Pension Scheme ultimately repaid by the Trustees would currently 
be subject to a 35% tax charge prior to being repaid. IFRIC 14 effectively requires a liability for this tax to be recognised at the relevant 
balance sheet date.
At 1 April 2007, the net defined benefit obligation was £243 million, and the net present value of liabilities arising from future minimum 
funding requirements was £219 million. After taking account of those future funding requirements, the net position remains a deficit, 
therefore there is no surplus to be recovered and hence no liability to tax thereon. The impact therefore of adopting IFRIC 14 as at  
1 April 2007 is £nil. The table below shows the position at each of the subsequent balance sheet dates.

for the two years presented. The movement in the irrecoverable element of the potential pension surplus is taken directly to the 
consolidated statement of recognised income and expense.

As required by IAS 19 liabilities for each scheme are determined using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method. This is an 
accrued benefits valuation method that discounts the best estimate of future cash flows and makes allowance for projected earnings.
If the UK Main Pension Scheme were to be wound up, the relevant employers would be responsible, under section 75 of the Pensions 
Act 1995 to fund the UK Main Pension Scheme up to the levels of the cost of buying out the benefits for all scheme members with an 
insurer. This cost would be considerably more than the value placed on the ongoing liabilities for accounting purposes. The deficit in 
the UK Main Pension Scheme calculated on a winding up basis was approximately £1.4 billion as at 31 March 2008, the date of the last 
actuarial valuation. This will be reviewed and updated at the next valuation. 96  |  Invensys plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2009

The expected return on each asset class has been determined on the basis of market expectations for the rate of return on each asset 
class over the life of the related obligation, at the balance sheet date. In respect of the UK Main Pension Scheme, Government and 
Corporate Bond indices have been used to set the expected rate of return on bonds, and a risk premium has been applied to determine 
the expected long-term rate of return on equity investments. Similar processes are applied to other schemes.
The investment strategy determined by the Trustees of the Invensys Pension Scheme continues to reflect the mature nature of the 
Scheme with assets predominantly invested in bonds or bond like investments. Invensys plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2009  |  97

Regarding rates of contributions for future years, following the triennial valuation of the UK Main Pension Scheme (valuation date  
31 March 2008) contributions to the UK Main Pension Scheme will be made at the rate of 19.8% of pensionable salaries up to the date 
of the next triennial valuation. In addition, the Company will continue to make annual supplemental contributions to the scheme. These 
amount to £37 million in the year ending 31 March 2010, £38 million in the year ending 31 March 2011 and £39 million in the year ending 
31 March 2012 increasing by £1 million per annum until 31 March 2014 and then £2 million per annum thereafter until 2017. Where 
the proceeds from the sale of a business exceed £1 million, at least 8% of the proceeds net of tax and costs will be paid as additional 
contributions to the UK Main Pension Scheme. The funding plan is subject to revision after the next triennial valuation which will have 
a reference date of 31 March 2011. Under the US plan, the Company’s agreement with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation 
provided for additional contributions of 4% of net proceeds from future disposals.

Terms and conditions of the above financial liabilities are as follows:
Trade payables are non-interest bearing and are on average normally settled on 55-day terms. Interest payable on the Group’s major 
borrowing facilities is settled quarterly throughout the financial year. Other payables include sales taxes, social security and payroll 
taxes, payroll creditors, customer advances (not related to construction contracts), payments received from customers in advance of 
work performed on construction contracts and commissions payable. They are non-interest bearing. The majority of non-current other 
payables will mature in more than one year but in less than two years; there is a small proportion that will mature in over five years. The 
maturity profile of trade and other payables classified as financial liabilities is given in Note 22.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of both current and non-current trade and other payables approximates to their fair value. Invensys plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2009  |  99

As part of the capital reduction undertaken by the Company on 22 January 2009, the Company allotted, issued and subsequently 
cancelled 801,285,978 B shares of £1.1574129021 each (£927 million). The B shares were issued on 20 January 2009 by way of a bonus 
issue to ordinary shareholders on the basis of one B share for every one ordinary share held. The new B shares were paid up in full 
by applying the full amount of the Company’s merger reserve. The B shares had limited rights, in particular they carried no rights to 
participate in the profits of the Company, no rights to participate in the Company’s assets, save on a winding up, and no right to attend 
or vote at any general meeting of the Company. The B shares were not admitted to trading on the London Stock Exchange or any 
other market and no share certificates were issued in respect of them. All the B shares were cancelled as part of the capital reduction 
approved by the High Court of Justice in England and Wales at a final hearing on 21 January 2009. Further details of the capital 
reduction are included in Note 28.
Shares reserved for issue under share options and awards
During the year the Company issued 4,347,302 ordinary shares of 10p each pursuant to the exercise of options under the Invensys

Capital reduction and cancellation of certain reserves
On 26 November 2008 the shareholders of Invensys plc approved proposals for a capital reduction and the cancellation of certain 
reserves in order to create distributable reserves and allow the payment of dividends. The capital reduction subsequently received 
approval from the High Court of Justice in England and Wales at a final hearing on 21 January 2009 and became effective the following 
day. The capital reduction and cancellation of reserves were achieved as follows:
a)  the amount standing to the credit of the merger reserve of the Parent company (£927 million) was capitalised by way of a bonus issue 
of newly created B shares (see Note 27);
b)  the newly created B shares were cancelled (see Note 27);
c)  the amount standing to the credit of the capital redemption reserve (£923 million) was cancelled;
d)  £392 million of the balance standing to the credit of the share premium account was cancelled; and
e)  the balance remaining in the reserves of the Parent company after the elimination of its deficit was transferred to a special reserve 
which will remain pending the protection or consent of creditors (or contingent creditors) of the Parent company in existence at the 
date of the capital reduction.
Nature and purpose of other reserves
Share premium account
This reserve records the consideration premium for shares issued at a value that exceeds their nominal value.
Capital redemption reserve
This reserve arose when the Company repurchased its own shares for cancellation as part of a return of capital programme and is 
non-distributable. Subsequently, in the year ended 31 March 2005, 3,499,780,822 deferred shares of 24p each were cancelled, in 
accordance with their terms of issue. The total balance on the reserve was cancelled as part of the Court approved capital reduction  
on 22 January 2009.
Capital reserve
Previously the Group merger reserve, this reserve was created on the merger of BTR plc and Siebe plc in February 1999 and  
is non-distributable. £927 million of the balance on the reserve, representing the balance on the Parent company’s merger reserve,  
was applied to pay up in full the B shares issued as part of the capital reduction on 22 January 2009.
Special reserve
This reserve represents the balance remaining after the elimination of the deficit in the reserves of the Parent company following  
the capital reduction on 22 January 2009. The reserve will remain pending the protection or consent of creditors (or contingent 
creditors) of the Parent company in existence at the date of the capital reduction. The reserve is non-distributable.
Cash flow hedge reserve
This reserve records, for each hedged item in an effective cash flow hedge, the cumulative change in fair value of the expected future 
cash flow on the hedged item from the inception of the hedge relationship. 102  |  Invensys plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2009

Foreign exchange reserve
The foreign exchange reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the Financial Statements of foreign 
subsidiaries. It is also used to record the foreign exchange on net investments in these subsidiaries.
 
29 Share-based payment plans
The Company operates various share schemes under which options and awards have been granted and are outstanding as  
detailed below:
Plans for senior employees
Executive share options
Invensys 1998 Senior Executive Share Option Scheme
Grant details
An executive share option scheme under which options have been granted to directors and senior executives at no cost. Options are 
exercisable between the third and tenth anniversary of the grant date at a price equal to the average middle market quoted price of the 
Company’s shares over the five dealing days which precede the date of grant. Options are satisfied by the issue of new shares or in the 
case of awards granted as share appreciation rights, in cash.
Vesting requirements
Performance requirements: (a) for grants made prior to 25 July 2001, earnings per share (EPS) performance of RPI + 12% over a three 
year period to be applied each year until the earlier of when the condition is met or the measurement period the last financial year of 
which is the year preceding that in which the option will lapse; and (b) for grants made on 17 June 2002 and after, total shareholder 
return (TSR) performance against a peer group of the FTSE100 over a performance period of three, four or five years commencing on 
the date of grant. 40% would be exercisable if the median position is achieved, rising to 100% if upper quartile position is achieved. 
Between these two points the option would vest on a straight-line basis. If the performance condition is not met in full at the first 
measurement then it would be retested against the fixed base in years four and five. If the median position is not achieved by the end  
of the fifth year the option would lapse. No performance conditions are attached to the option granted to Mr Henriksson under  
a separate arrangement on 1 June 2004.
Service requirements: the general rule is that the option will lapse if the participant leaves employment, although options may be 
exercisable for a certain period of time in defined good leaver cases or with the consent of the Remuneration Committee.
Scheme use
No options were granted during the years ended 31 March 2009 or 31 March 2008. The Company can no longer make grants under this 
scheme as the scheme expired in July 2008.
Details of executive share options outstanding under this scheme including the option granted to Mr Henriksson under a separate 
arrangement on 1 June 2004, are as follows:

Closed option schemes
In addition, during the year ended 31 March 2009, there were executive share options outstanding under the Siebe plc Share Option 
Scheme 1993 and the BTR Executive Share Option Scheme (1995). Grants are no longer made under these closed schemes, the last 
grant having been made under the Siebe plc Share Option Scheme 1993 in March 1999. There were no outstanding options under  
these schemes as at 31 March 2009 (2008: 29,534 options with a weighted average remaining contractual life of 0.4 years).
Long-term incentives
Invensys 1998 Senior Executive Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
Grant details
A long-term incentive plan under which awards are granted to executive directors and senior executives at no (or nominal) cost. 
Depending on the country in which the participant is resident the award would be delivered using one of the following mechanisms: 
(a) a nominal price option award which is a right to acquire shares for a nominal payment (unless the Company determines otherwise); 
(b) a conditional share award; or (c) a cash award (granted in respect of a notional number of shares). Awards are normally subject to a 
three year performance period, commencing on the date of award, followed by a retention period. For awards granted prior to 22 July 
2005 the retention period was two years; for awards made on or after 22 July 2005, 50% of any shares vesting on satisfaction of the 
performance requirements will be released at the end of the performance period with the other 50% being deferred for one year.
Vesting requirements
Performance requirements:
TSR test
TSR ranked against a peer group, selected at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee (with no retesting opportunities). TSR  
must rank at the median position (when the peer group is ranked in descending order of TSR) in order for 25% of the shares subject to 
the award to be available (subject to the retention period), rising to 100% of the shares if the upper decile position is achieved. Between 
these positions, the number of shares will be calculated on a straight-line basis. If at least the median position is not achieved the whole 
award will lapse. The peer groups selected for the relevant awards are as follows:
• 	 a w a r d s 	 g r a n t e d 	 p r i o r 	 t o 	 2 2 	 J u l y 	 2 0 0 5 : 	 t h e 	 c o m p a n i e s 	 t h a t 	 c o m p r i s e d 	 t h e 	 F T S E 	 M i d 	 2 5 0 	 I n d e x 	 o n 	 t h e 	 d a t e 	 o f 	 g r a n t ; 	 a n d

Schneider, Siemens, Smiths Group and Yokogawa.
Overall performance test
The Remuneration Committee must be satisfied that: (a) for awards granted prior to 22 July 2005 there has been a sustained delivery 
over the performance period, regarding the trading performance of continuing operations, disposal proceeds and reduction in Group 
indebtedness; (b) for awards granted on or after 22 July 2005 that two underpins have been met: (1) achievement of stretching internal 
free cash flow targets; and (2) efficient management of legacy liability items; and (c) for awards granted on or after 1 June 2006 that two 
underpin tests have been met: (1) relating to the successful completion of the 2006 Refinancing and in addition that there has been  
a sustained improvement in the underlying financial performance of the Group; and (2) efficient management of legacy liability items. 
Service requirements: the general rule is that the award will lapse if the participant leaves employment, although shares may 
be released subject to the satisfaction of the performance conditions in defined good leaver cases or with the consent of the  
Remuneration Committee.
Scheme use
No awards were granted under this scheme during the year ended 31 March 2009. Given that no further awards could be granted under 
the LTIP after July 2008, a new share-based long-term incentive plan, the Invensys 2007 Long Term Incentive Plan was established and 
approved by shareholders at the 2007 Annual General Meeting. Details of this scheme are given below.
Grants made during the year ended 31 March 2008 are detailed below:

  During the year ended 31 March 2008, the Remuneration Committee exercised its discretion to depart from the rules of the 1998 LTIP in a specific termination case 
(not related to an executive director). This award of 143,179 shares was therefore treated as a forfeiture of the original award, followed by a new grant (with a life  
of three months only, representing the date of agreement to the date of termination). This resulted in a shorter weighted average expected award life than is usual.  
The remaining grants during the year were therefore 85,894 shares. 104  |  Invensys plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2009

2007 Senior Executive Long Term Incentive Plan (2007 LTIP)
Grant details
A long-term incentive plan under which awards are granted to executive directors and senior executives at no (or nominal) cost. 
Depending on the country in which the participant is resident the award would be delivered using one of the following mechanisms: 
for awards granted up to and including 7 March 2008 (a) a nominal price option award which is a right to acquire shares for a nominal 
payment (unless the Company determines otherwise); (b) a conditional share award: or (c) a cash award (granted in respect of a nominal 
number of shares); and for awards granted from 8 March 2008 to date (a) a nominal price option award which is a right to acquire shares 
for a nominal payment (unless the Company determines otherwise); or (b) a conditional share award. Awards are normally subject to  
a three-year performance period, commencing on the date of award. There is no retention period.
Vesting requirements
Performance requirements: awards will be subject to two independent performance conditions. For executive directors (a) 50% of an 
award will be based on growth in the Company’s TSR relative to the constituent companies of the Standard & Poor’s Global 1200 Capital 
Goods Index; and (b) 50% of an award will be based on the compound annual growth rate in the Group’s earnings per share. For all other 
participants (a) 35% of an award will be based on growth in the Company’s TSR relative to the constituent companies of the Standard 
& Poor’s Global 1200 Capital Goods Index; and (b) 35% of an award will be based on the compound annual growth rate in the Group’s 
earnings per share. There are no performance conditions applying to the remaining 30% of an award. In addition, the Remuneration 
Committee retains discretion to ensure that, as a condition for vesting of shares, the underlying overall performance of the Group must 
be satisfactory.
Service requirements: the general rule is that the award will lapse if the participant leaves employment, although shares may be 
released, subject to satisfaction of the performance conditions, in defined good leaver cases.
Scheme use
The 2007 LTIP is used as the Group’s main share-based long-term incentive plan under which share awards are granted. The first grants 
under this plan were made in the year ended 31 March 2008.

2007 CEO Special Award (Special Award)
Grant details
Approved by shareholders at the 2007 Annual General Meeting, the Special Award is a one-off conditional share award granted to the 
Chief Executive equal to 700% of his 2007/08 base salary. The Special Award is subject to a three-year performance period. 50% of 
vested shares will be released at the end of the performance period with the other 50% being released after a 12 month holding period.
Vesting requirements
Performance requirements: the performance measures applying to the Special Award reflect those applying to the 2007 LTIP with some 
elements being more demanding. The Special Award is split into two layers, each of which vests on a different basis. For the first layer 
equal to 200% of base salary, 20% will vest for threshold performance and 100% for maximum performance. For the second layer equal 
to 500% of base salary, there will be no vesting for threshold performance, but 100% will vest for maximum performance. Vesting in each 
layer will be on a straight line basis between these points.
For each layer of the Special Award 50% will vest based on TSR and 50% based on EPS growth, as for the 2007 LTIP. However, for the 
TSR part of the Special Award, maximum vesting will require more stretching performance equivalent to upper quintile. This has been 
calculated by the advisers to the Remuneration Committee as means outperformance of the mean of the Standard & Poor’s Global 1200 
Capital Goods Index constituents by a factor of 1.4 (i.e. 40%). 
Service requirements: the general rule is that the award will lapse if the participant leaves employment, although shares may be released 
in defined good leaver cases.
Scheme use
The Special Award is a one-off grant at no cost.
No grants were made in the year ended 31 March 2009. The one-off grant made during the year ended 31 March 2008 is detailed below:

Invensys Restricted Share Plan (RSP)
Grant details
A restricted share plan whereby awards, to be satisfied by the transfer of existing issued shares or in cash, are granted to certain senior 
employees at no cost. The vesting period for awards is determined separately for each award. Vesting periods normally fall between one 
and five years.
Vesting requirements
Performance requirements: awards are not subject to a specific performance condition apart from continued employment throughout 
the vesting period and satisfactory personal performance.
Service requirements: the general rule is that the award will lapse if the participant leaves employment, although shares may be released 
in defined good leaver cases or with the consent of the Remuneration Committee.
Scheme use
The plan is operated predominantly for senior executives in special circumstances, such as recruitment and retention situations.

Turnaround Bonus Overlay Plan (TBOP)
Grant details
The Company introduced the TBOP in 2005/06 under which executives had the opportunity to receive a supplemental bonus of 
up to 100% of their base salary in respect of the relevant financial year to be paid in shares upon reaching specified target levels of 
performance. The TBOP operated in addition to the existing Executive Bonus Plan (EBP). Any bonuses earned under the TBOP (the 
Overlay Bonus) are payable in shares with 50% of the shares awarded being released following the first anniversary of those shares being 
awarded and the other 50% being released following the second anniversary.
Vesting requirements
Performance requirements: the amount of the Overlay Bonus (which in turn determines the level of the award) is set by reference to the 
performance targets specified for the executive in the EBP.
Service requirements: release of the shares is generally subject to continued employment at the relevant date although shares may be 
released early in defined good leaver cases or with the consent of the Remuneration Committee. Invensys plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2009  |  107
Scheme use
The first grant under the TBOP was made on 1 June 2006. It was originally anticipated that the TBOP would be operated up to and 
including the financial year 2007/08. However, as a result of the changes made to the annual incentive arrangements for 2007/08 
onwards (as detailed in the Remuneration Report), the TBOP ceased to be operated one year early. The final awards under the TBOP 
were granted in the year ended 31 March 2008 in respect of the financial year 2006/07.
No grants were made in the year ended 31 March 2009. Grants made during the year ended 31 March 2008 are detailed below:

The TBOP awards outstanding at the end of the year have a weighted average remaining contractual life of 0.1 years (2008: 0.5 years).
Deferred Share Plan (DSP)
Grant details
The DSP was introduced in 2007/08 to replace the TBOP. Any bonus earned under the EBP for 2007/08 in excess of target performance 
was paid in deferred shares, with any bonus earned up to the target performance being paid in cash. The shares are released to the 
individual after three years in the case of executive directors and two years for all other participants. All awards are satisfied by shares 
purchased in the market.
For 2008/09 onwards the DSP is only used for executive directors and members of the Office of the CEO; in all other respects the same 
terms apply as outlined in the previous paragraph.
Vesting requirements
Performance requirements: the amount of shares granted is set by reference to the performance targets specified for the executive 
in the EBP.
Service requirements: save where a participant is dismissed for cause before the relevant release date, shares under award will be 
released to participants on the release date, unless the Remuneration Committee in its absolute discretion should decide on a different 
release date.
Scheme use
The first grant under the DSP was made on 24 July 2008 and was used for all participants in the EBP who earned bonuses in excess of 
target. In the future, where applicable, bonus in excess of target performance will only be paid in deferred shares to executive directors 
and members of the Office of the CEO. Bonus payments for all other members of the EBP will be paid entirely in cash.
Grants made during the year ended 31 March 2009, the first year in which grants were made under the plan, are detailed below:

30 Commitments and contingencies
Capital expenditure
Capital expenditure for property, plant and equipment contracted at the balance sheet date but for which no provision has been made 
in the accounts amounted to £1 million (2008: £1 million).
Operating leases
The Group has entered into commercial leases on certain land and buildings, motor vehicles and items of plant and equipment. Land 
and buildings leases are generally subject to periodic rent reviews. Some leases have renewal options. These are at the option of the 
Group, sometimes subject to a minimum notice period. In some cases rent escalations are set out in the lease contract. There are no 
material contingent rents payable. No significant restrictions are placed upon the Group by entering into these leases.

The Group leases a small proportion of its plant and equipment under finance leases, but does not currently have any significant finance 
lease arrangements. The average effective borrowing rate for the year ended 31 March 2009 was 5% (2008: 8%). The fair value of the 
Group’s lease obligations approximates to their carrying amount.
The Group’s finance lease liabilities are secured against the assets to which they relate. Invensys plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2009  |  111
Contingent liabilities
Group companies have given performance guarantees to certain subsidiaries (and certain former subsidiaries prior to disposal) in the 
normal course of business. Counter-indemnities have been received from purchasers in the case of guarantees given in favour of former 
subsidiaries. At the balance sheet date, the directors are not aware of any circumstances that may give rise to a liability to the Group 
under these performance guarantees.
In a very limited number of cases, the Group has guaranteed certain borrowings by third parties. At 31 March 2009, the maximum 
contingent liability to the Group arising from these guarantees was £2 million (2008: £3 million), being the total amount of such 
borrowings outstanding at that date.
No member of the Group is engaged in, nor (so far as the directors are aware) has pending, or is threatened by, or has against it any 
legal or arbitration proceedings which may have a significant effect on the financial position of the Group.

32 Analysis of business combinations and business disposals
(i) Business combinations
Year ended 31 March 2009
On 21 August 2008, Invensys plc acquired 100% of the share capital of SAT Corporation, a Houston-based mobile solutions  
company, for a cash consideration of £30 million. On 17 September 2008, Invensys plc acquired 100% of the share capital of Quantum 
Engineering Inc., a signalling and train controls company specialising in onboard equipment, from its management, for a cash 
consideration of £20 million. The acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. The Group Financial 
Statements include the results of SAT Corporation and Quantum Engineering Inc., for the period from their date of acquisition to  
31 March 2009. As these business combinations are individually immaterial, the following information is presented in aggregate for  
the acquired businesses.
The fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired businesses at the dates of acquisition were:
     Previous  Fair value

     value  on acquisition 
     £m  £m
Property, plant and equipment      0.8  0.8

Inventories     1.9  1.9 
Cash and cash equivalents      2.5  2.5 
Trade and other payables      (1.9) (4.5)
Net assets      5.9  15.2 
Goodwill arising on acquisition       35.5 
Total acquisition cost       50.7 
The total acquisition cost comprised:
— cash paid       50.3 
— costs directly attributable to the acquisition       0.4 
      50.7 
Cash outflow on acquisition:
— cash paid       (50.7)
— net cash acquired with acquisition       2.5 
Net cash outflow       (48.2)
The acquired businesses contributed an operating profit of £0.6 million to the Group for the period from acquisition to 31 March 2009.
If the combination had taken place at the beginning of the year, the Group’s revenue from continuing operations would have increased 
to £2,303 million and the operating profit before exceptional items for the Group would have increased to £245 million.
The goodwill recognised above is attributed to the expected synergies and other benefits from combining the assets and activities  
of SAT Corporation and Quantum Engineering Inc. with those of the Group. These benefits do not meet the criteria for recognition  
as intangible assets separately from goodwill.
Changes to provisional amounts disclosed in the half-yearly Financial Statements
At the time of publication of the half-yearly Financial Statements, the fair values of the acquired businesses had been provisionally 
determined. Adjustments have been recognised to those provisional values in the second half of the year ended 31 March 2009 
resulting in an increase in the net assets acquired of £2.8 million. The adjustments relate mainly to intangibles (£5.4 million increase)  
and deferred tax included within trade and other payables (£2.7 million decrease). As a result of these adjustments the amount of 
goodwill recognised has decreased by £2.6 million. Invensys plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2009  |  113
Year ended 31 March 2008
On 1 July 2007 Invensys plc acquired 100% of the share capital of Cimnet, Inc., a Manufacturing Execution System software company 
based in Pennsylvania, for a cash consideration of £12 million. The acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of 
accounting. The consolidated Financial Statements include the results of Cimnet for the nine month period from the acquisition date  
to 31 March 2008.
The fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of Cimnet as at the date of acquisition were:
     Previous  Fair value 
     carrying  recognised

Net (liabilities)/assets      (0.1) 3.1 
Goodwill arising on acquisition       8.9 
Total acquisition cost       12.0 
The total acquisition cost comprised:
— cash paid       11.6 
— costs directly attributable to the acquisition       0.4 
      12.0 
Cash outflow on acquisition:
— cash paid       (12.0)
— net cash acquired with acquisition       0.1 
Net cash outflow       (11.9)
Cimnet contributed an operating profit of £0.7 million to the Group for the period from acquisition to 31 March 2008.
If the combination had taken place at the beginning of the year, the Group’s revenue from continuing operations would have increased 
to £2,109 million and the operating profit before exceptional items for the Group would have remained at £254 million.
The goodwill recognised above is attributed to the expected synergies and other benefits from combining the assets and activities  
of Cimnet with those of the Group. These benefits do not meet the criteria for recognition as intangible assets separately from goodwill. 114  |  Invensys plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2009

(ii) Business disposals
No operations have been discontinued in the year to 31 March 2009. Additional costs have been incurred relating to prior year

33 Directors’ loan
Mr Henriksson incurs both US and UK tax liabilities in respect of his employment duties undertaken in the US. Deloitte LLP has advised 
Invensys that the UK tax liabilities paid by Mr Henriksson in respect of such duties should be refunded to him by HM Revenue and 
Customs (HMRC). However, such refund has been delayed pending a determination by the US and UK tax authorities of the relevant 
treaty provisions. In view of the double taxation suffered, Invensys Systems Inc. advanced £546,000 on 14 April 2009 to Mr Henriksson, 
being an amount equal to the expected refunds due from HMRC. This loan is free of any interest and will be repayable within five 
business days from the date of HMRC making the refund to Mr Henriksson. Invensys plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2009  |  115

13 May 2009
We have audited the Parent Company Financial Statements 
(Company Financial Statements) of Invensys plc for the year 
ended 31 March 2009 which comprise the Company balance 
sheet, Accounting policies and the related Notes 1 to 14. These 
Company Financial Statements have been prepared under the 
accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited the 
information in the Remuneration Report that is described as 
having been audited.
We have reported separately on the Group Financial 
Statements of Invensys plc for the year ended 31 March 2009.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members as 
a body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies 
Act 1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we 
might state to the Company’s members those matters we 
are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no 
other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do 
not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit 
work, for this report or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors

Parent Company accounting policies
Basis of accounting
These accounts are prepared under the historical cost 
convention and in accordance with applicable UK accounting 
standards. The policies are consistent with the previous year 
except for the adoption of the following amended standards:
—  Amendments to FRS 26 (IAS 39) and FRS 29 (IFRS 7): 
Reclassification of Financial Assets 
— Amendment to FRS 17, Retirement Benefits
The amendment to FRS 17 mainly affects the disclosure 
requirements of the standard and has resulted in minor 
changes to the information contained in Note 9. Adoption 
of these amendments has not had any material effect on the 
Financial Statements of the Company.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate 
ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated  
at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
All exchange differences are included in the profit and loss 
account for the year.
Pension costs and other post-retirement benefits
For defined benefit plans, the service cost of providing 
retirement benefits to employees during the year is charged 
to operating profit or loss in the year. The cost of providing 
benefits under the defined benefit schemes is determined 
separately for each scheme using the projected unit credit 
actuarial valuation method. The full cost of providing 
amendments to benefits in respect of past service that vests 
immediately is also charged to operating profit or loss in the 
year. The net surplus or deficit on defined benefit pension 
schemes is reported on the balance sheet within the pension 
asset or liability.
For defined contribution schemes the amount charged to 
the profit and loss account in respect of pension costs is 
the contributions payable in the year. Differences between 
contributions payable in the year and contributions actually 
paid are shown either as accruals or prepayments in the 
balance sheet.
Investments in subsidiary undertakings
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are held at cost less 
provisions for impairment where a permanent diminution in 
value has been identified.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense when incurred.
Debt instruments
Borrowings are stated at net proceeds received after 
deduction of issue costs. The issue costs of debt instruments 
are amortised over the life of the instrument using the effective 
interest rate method.
Taxation
Deferred income tax is recognised in respect of all timing 
differences that have originated but not reversed at the 
balance sheet date where transactions or events have occurred 
at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more tax, or 
a right to pay less tax, in the future. Timing differences arise 
from the inclusion of income and expenditure in taxation 
computations in periods different to those in which they are 
included in the Financial Statements.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent 
that it is considered more likely than not that there will be 
suitable taxable profits from which the underlying timing 
differences can be deducted.
Deferred income tax is measured on an undiscounted basis 
at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in 
which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws 
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Share-based payment
The Company operates various equity-settled and cash-settled 
share schemes. For equity-settled share options, the services 
received from employees are measured by reference to the 
fair value of the share options. The fair value is calculated at 
grant date using a valuation model and recognised in the profit 
and loss account, together with a corresponding increase in 
shareholders’ equity, on a straight-line basis over the vesting 
period, based on an estimate of the number of options that 
will eventually vest. Vesting conditions, other than market 
conditions, are not taken into account when estimating the fair 
value. Market conditions are those conditions that are linked to 
the share price of the Company.
For equity-settled share award schemes, the fair value is 
calculated based on the share price at the grant date and, 
where applicable, any market vesting conditions, and 
expensed over the vesting period based on the number of 
shares expected to vest. No expense is recognised for awards 
that do not ultimately vest, with the exception of awards where 
vesting is conditional upon a market condition; these are 
treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market 
condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance 
conditions are met.
For cash-settled share awards, the services received from 
employees are measured at the fair value of the liability and 
recognised in the profit and loss account on a straight-line 
basis over the vesting period. The fair value of the liability 
is remeasured at each reporting date and at the date of 
settlement with changes in fair value recognised in the profit 
and loss account.
In accordance with the transitional arrangements in FRS 20 
(IFRS 2), Share-based Payment, the requirements of FRS 20 
have not been applied to equity instruments granted on  
or before 7 November 2002 and those vesting before  
1 January 2005.
Treasury shares
Own equity instruments which are reacquired (treasury shares) 
are deducted from equity. No gain or loss is recognised in 
profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of 
the Group’s own equity instruments. Treasury shares are 
purchased and held by the Employee Share Trust to meet 
future distributions of shares to employees under the Group’s 
various share option and share award schemes. 
Dividend income
Revenue is recognised when the Company’s right to receive 
payment is established. 120  |  Invensys plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2009
1 Loss attributable to the Parent Company
The loss dealt with in the accounts of the Parent Company, Invensys plc, is £428 million (2008: £374 million profit). In accordance with  
the exemption granted under section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, a separate profit and loss account for the Company has not  
been presented.
 
2 Fees for audit and other services
Fees paid to the Company’s auditors for the audit of the Financial Statements were £0.1 million (2008: £0.1 million).
Fees paid to the Company’s auditors for non-audit services to the Company itself are not disclosed in the Company Financial 
Statements of Invensys plc because the Group Financial Statements are required to disclose such fees on a consolidated basis.

The Company operates one unfunded defined benefit pension scheme. The last full valuation of the scheme on a FRS 17 (IAS 19) basis 
has been updated to 31 March 2009, to reflect market conditions and material events in the plan.
The Company also participates in the UK Main Pension Scheme, which is the principal Group scheme covering the majority of UK 
employees. The UK Main Pension Scheme is a funded defined benefit scheme. However, the Company is unable to separately identify 
on a consistent and reasonable basis its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the Group’s defined benefit scheme to which it 
participates, mainly because of the difficulty in obtaining accurate information for disposed companies and the subjective nature of any 
allocation basis. Therefore the Company accounts for this scheme as a defined contribution scheme, in accordance with the provisions 
of FRS 17. The scheme is currently in deficit on an IAS 19 basis using the projected credit actuarial valuation method to determine the 
scheme’s liabilities. Details of the scheme and its deficit are included in Note 25 to the Group Financial Statements in accordance with 
the accounting and disclosure requirements of IAS 19, which are generally equivalent to those of FRS 17. 
Pension costs in respect of the UK Main Pension Scheme represented contributions payable in the year and amounted to £1 million 
(2008: £1 million). At 31 March 2009, the outstanding contributions included in creditors were £nil (2008: £nil).

B shares
As part of the capital reduction undertaken by the Company on 22 January 2009, the Company allotted, issued and subsequently 
cancelled 801,285,978 B shares of £1.1574129021 each (£927 million). The B shares were issued on 20 January 2009 by way of a bonus 
issue to ordinary shareholders on the basis of one B share for every one ordinary share held. The new B shares were paid up in full 
by applying the full amount of the Company’s merger reserve. The B shares had limited rights, in particular they carried no rights to 
participate in the profits of the Company and no rights to participate in the Company’s assets, save on a winding up, and no right to 
attend or vote at any general meeting of the Company. The B shares were not admitted to trading on the London Stock Exchange or any 
other market and no share certificates were issued in respect of them. All the B shares were cancelled as part of the capital reduction 
approved by the High Court of Justice in England and Wales at a final hearing on 21 January 2009. Further details of the capital 
reduction are included in Note 11.

Capital reduction and cancellation of certain reserves
On 26 November 2008 the shareholders of Invensys plc approved proposals for a capital reduction and the cancellation of certain 
reserves in order to create distributable reserves and allow the payment of dividends. The capital reduction subsequently received 
approval from the High Court of Justice in England and Wales at a final hearing on 21 January 2009 and became effective the following 
day. The capital reduction and cancellation of reserves were achieved as follows:
a)  £1,373 million of the profit and loss account considered by the Directors to be non-distributable as at 31 March 2008, as it arose 
from the profit on transfer of Group companies to other Group companies where there was no qualifying consideration, was 
transferred to a new, separate reserve, ‘other non-distributable reserves’;
b)  the amount standing to the credit of the merger reserve (£927 million) was capitalised by way of a bonus issue of newly created  
B shares (see Note 10);
c)  the newly created B shares were cancelled (see Note 10);
d)  the amount standing to the credit of the capital redemption reserve (£923 million) was cancelled;
e)  £392 million of the balance standing to the credit of the share premium account was cancelled; and
f)  the balance remaining in the reserves of the Company after the elimination of its deficit was transferred to a special reserve which 
will remain pending the protection or consent of creditors (or contingent creditors) of the Company in existence at the date of the 
capital reduction.
The amount of profit and loss account reserves available for distribution is £18 million. The remaining balance is non distributable as it 
arose prior to the date of the court approval described above.
12 Commitments and contingencies
Operating leases
The Company has no operating lease obligations.
Contingent liabilities
The Company has given performance guarantees to certain subsidiaries (and certain former subsidiaries prior to disposal) in the  
normal course of business. Counter-indemnities have been received from purchasers in the case of guarantees given in favour  
of former subsidiaries.
These performance guarantees include guarantees in respect of lease obligations. As at 31 March 2009, provisions in the Group 
accounts included £9 million (2008: £8 million) in respect of leases guaranteed by the Company.
At the balance sheet date, the directors are not aware of any circumstances that may give rise to a liability to the Company under 
performance guarantees.
The Company is not engaged in, nor (so far as the directors are aware) has pending, or is threatened by, or has against it any legal or 
arbitration proceedings which may have a significant effect on its financial position.
 
13 Share-based payment plans
The Company operates various share schemes under which options and awards have been granted and are outstanding as  
detailed below:
Plans for senior employees
Executive share options
Invensys 1998 Senior Executive Share Option Scheme
Grant details
An executive share option scheme under which options have been granted to directors and senior executives at no cost. Options are 
exercisable between the third and tenth anniversary of the grant date at a price equal to the average middle market quoted price of the 
Company’s shares over the five dealing days which precede the date of grant. Options are satisfied by the issue of new shares or in the 
case of awards granted as share appreciation rights, in cash.
Vesting requirements
Performance requirements: (a) for grants made prior to 25 July 2001, earnings per share (EPS) performance of RPI + 12% over a three 
year period to be applied each year until the earlier of when the condition is met or the measurement period the last financial year of 
which is the year preceding that in which the option will lapse; and (b) for grants made on 17 June 2002 and after, total shareholder 
return (TSR) performance against a peer group of the FTSE100 over a performance period of three, four or five years commencing on 
the date of grant. 40% would be exercisable if the median position is achieved, rising to 100% if upper quartile position is achieved. 
Between these two points the option would vest on a straight-line basis. If the performance condition is not met in full at the first 
measurement then it would be retested against the fixed base in years four and five. If the median position is not achieved by the end of 
the fifth year the option would lapse. No performance conditions are attached to the option granted to Mr Henriksson under a separate 
arrangement on 1 June 2004.
Service requirements: the general rule is that the option will lapse if the participant leaves employment, although options may be 
exercisable for a certain period of time in defined good leaver cases or with the consent of the Remuneration Committee. 126  |  Invensys plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2009

Long-term incentives
Invensys 1998 Senior Executive Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
Grant details
A long-term incentive plan under which awards are granted to executive directors and senior executives at no (or nominal) cost. 
Depending on the country in which the participant is resident the award would be delivered using one of the following mechanisms: 
(a) a nominal price option award which is a right to acquire shares for a nominal payment (unless the Company determines otherwise); 
(b) a conditional share award; or (c) a cash award (granted in respect of a notional number of shares). Awards are normally subject to a 
three year performance period, commencing on the date of award, followed by a retention period. For awards granted prior to 22 July 
2005 the retention period was two years; for awards made on or after 22 July 2005, 50% of any shares vesting on satisfaction of the 
performance requirements will be released at the end of the performance period with the other 50% being deferred for one year.
Vesting requirements
Performance requirements:
TSR test
TSR ranked against a peer group, selected at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee (with no retesting opportunities). TSR  
must rank at the median position (when the peer group is ranked in descending order of TSR) in order for 25% of the shares subject to 
the award to be available (subject to the retention period), rising to 100% of the shares if the upper decile position is achieved. Between 
these positions, the number of shares will be calculated on a straight-line basis. If at least median position is not achieved the whole 
award will lapse. The peer groups selected for the relevant awards are as follows:

Overall performance test
The Remuneration Committee must be satisfied that: (a) for awards granted prior to 22 July 2005 there has been a sustained delivery 
over the performance period, regarding the trading performance of continuing operations, disposal proceeds and reduction in Group 
indebtedness; (b) for awards granted on or after 22 July 2005 that two underpins have been met: (1) achievement of stretching internal 
free cash flow targets; and (2) efficient management of legacy liability items; and (c) for awards granted on or after 1 June 2006 that two 
underpin tests have been met: (1) relating to the successful completion of the 2006 Refinancing and in addition that there has been  
a sustained improvement in the underlying financial performance of the Group; and (2) efficient management of legacy liability items.
Service requirements: the general rule is that the award will lapse if the participant leaves employment, although shares may be released 
subject to the satisfaction of the performance conditions in defined good leaver cases or with the consent of the Remuneration Committee.
Scheme use
No awards were granted under this scheme during the year ended 31 March 2009. Given that no further awards could be granted under 
the LTIP after July 2008, a new share-based long-term incentive plan, the Invensys 2007 Long Term Incentive Plan was established and 
approved by shareholders at the 2007 Annual General Meeting. Details of this scheme are given below.
No grants were made during the year ended 31 March 2008 and 31 March 2009.

Invensys 2007 Senior Executive Long Term Incentive Plan (2007 LTIP)
Grant details
A long-term incentive plan under which awards are granted to executive directors and senior executives at no (or nominal) cost. 
Depending on the country in which the participant is resident the award would be delivered using one of the following mechanisms: 
for awards granted up to and including 7 March 2008 (a) a nominal price option award which is a right to acquire shares for a nominal 
payment (unless the Company determines otherwise); (b) a conditional share award: or (c) a cash award (granted in respect of a nominal 
number of shares); and for awards granted from 8 March 2008 to date (a) a nominal price option award which is a right to acquire shares 
for a nominal payment (unless the Company determines otherwise); or (b) a conditional share award. Awards are normally subject to a 
three-year performance period, commencing on the date of award. There is no retention period.
Vesting requirements
Performance requirements: awards would be subject to two independent performance conditions. For executive directors (a) 50% of 
an award would be based on growth in the Company’s TSR relative to the constituent companies of the Standard & Poor’s Global 1200 
Capital Goods Index; and (b) 50% of an award would be based on the compound annual growth rate in the Group’s Earnings Per Share. 
For all other participants (a) 35% of an award would be based on growth in the Company’s TSR relative to the constituent companies of 
the Standard & Poor’s Global 1200 Capital Goods Index; and (b) 35% of an award would be based on the compound annual growth rate 
in the Group’s Earnings Per Share. There are no performance conditions applying to the remaining 30% of an award. In addition, the 
Remuneration Committee retains discretion to ensure that, as a condition for vesting of shares, the underlying overall performance of 
the Group must be satisfactory.
Service requirements: the general rule is that the award will lapse if the participant leaves employment, although shares may be 
released, subject to satisfaction of the performance conditions, in defined good leaver cases. 128  |  Invensys plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2009

2007 CEO Special Award (Special Award)
Grant details
Approved by shareholders at the 2007 Annual General Meeting, the Special Award is a one-off conditional share award granted to the 
Chief Executive equal to 700% of his 2007/08 base salary. The Special Award is subject to a three-year performance period. 50% of 
vested shares will be released at the end of the performance period with the other 50% being released after a 12 month holding period.
Vesting requirements
Performance requirements: the performance measures applying to the Special Award reflect those applying to the 2007 LTIP with 
some elements being more demanding. The Special Award is split into two layers, each of which vests on a different basis. For the first 
layer equal to 200% of base salary, 20% will vest for threshold performance and 100% for maximum performance. For the second layer 
equal to 500% of base salary, there will be no vesting for threshold performance, but 100% will vest for maximum performance. Vesting 
in each layer will be on a straight line basis between these points.
For each layer of the Special Award 50% will vest based on TSR and 50% based on EPS growth, as for the 2007 LTIP. However, for the 
TSR part of the Special Award, maximum vesting will require more stretching performance equivalent to upper quintile. This has been 
calculated by the advisers to the Remuneration Committee as outperformance of the mean of the Standard & Poor’s Global 1200  
Capital Goods Index constituents by a factor of 1.4 (i.e. 40%).
Service requirements: the general rule is that the award will lapse if the participant leaves employment, although shares may be 
released in defined good leaver cases.
Scheme use

Invensys Restricted Share Plan (RSP)
Grant details
A restricted share plan whereby awards, to be satisfied by the transfer of existing issued shares or in cash, are granted to certain senior 
employees at no cost. The vesting period for awards is determined separately for each award. Vesting periods normally fall between  
one and five years.
Vesting requirements
Performance requirements: awards are not subject to a specific performance condition apart from continued employment throughout 
the vesting period and satisfactory personal performance.
Service requirements: the general rule is that the award will lapse if the participant leaves employment, although shares may be 
released in defined good leaver cases or with the consent of the Remuneration Committee.
Scheme use
The plan is operated predominantly for senior executives in special circumstances, such as recruitment and retention situations. 130  |  Invensys plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2009

Turnaround Bonus Overlay Plan (TBOP)
Grant details
The Company introduced the TBOP in 2005/06 under which executives had the opportunity to receive a supplemental bonus of 
up to 100% of their base salary in respect of the relevant financial year to be paid in shares upon reaching specified target levels of 
performance. The TBOP operated in addition to the existing Executive Bonus Plan (EBP). Any bonuses earned under the TBOP (the 
Overlay Bonus) are payable in shares with 50% of the shares awarded being released following the first anniversary of those shares 
being awarded and the other 50% being released following the second anniversary.
Vesting requirements
Performance requirements: the amount of the Overlay Bonus (which in turn determines the level of the award) is set by reference to the 
performance targets specified for the executive in the EBP.
Service requirements: release of the shares is generally subject to continued employment at the relevant date although shares may be 
released early in defined good leaver cases or with the consent of the Remuneration Committee.
Scheme use
The first grant under the TBOP was made on 1 June 2006. It was originally anticipated that the TBOP would be operated up to and 
including the financial year 2007/08. However, as a result of the changes made to the annual incentive arrangements for 2007/08 
onwards (as detailed in the Remuneration Report), the TBOP ceased to be operated one year early. The final awards under the TBOP 
were granted in the year ended 31 March 2008 in respect of the financial year 2006/07.
No grants were made in the year ended 31 March 2009. Grants made during the year ended 31 March 2008 are detailed below:

The TBOP awards outstanding at the end of the year have a weighted average remaining contractual life of 0.2 years (2008: 0.5 years).
Deferred Share Plan (DSP)
Grant details
The DSP was introduced in 2007/08 to replace the TBOP. Any bonus earned under the EBP for 2007/08 in excess of target performance 
was paid in deferred shares, with any bonus earned up to the target performance being paid in cash. The shares are released to the 
individual after three years in the case of executive directors and two years for all other participants. All awards are satisfied by shares 
purchased in the market.
For 2008/09 onwards the DSP is only used for executive directors and members of the Office of the CEO; in all other respects the same 
terms apply as outlined in the previous paragraph.
Vesting requirements
Performance requirements: the amount of shares granted is set by reference to the performance targets specified for the executive 
in the EBP.
Service requirements: save where a participant is dismissed for cause before the relevant release date, shares under award will be 
released to participants on the release date, unless the Remuneration Committee in its absolute discretion should decide on a different 
release date.
Scheme use
The first grant under the DSP was made on 24 July 2008 and was used for all participants in the EBP who earned bonuses in excess of 
target. In the future, where applicable, bonus in excess of target performance will only be paid in deferred shares to executive directors 
and members of the Office of the CEO. Bonus payments for all other members of the EBP will be paid entirely in cash.

Invensys Savings Related Share Option Scheme
Grant details
The scheme operates in the UK, is based on a savings plan and is offered to eligible full and part-time employees. Options may be 
granted at up to a 20% discount to the market price of the Company’s shares immediately preceding the date of invitation. The vesting 
period for the options is three years.
Vesting requirements
Performance requirements: the scheme operates in the UK within specific tax legislation and is therefore not subject to performance 
conditions other than that a participant is required to complete the savings contract in order to exercise their options.
Service requirements: the general rule is that the option will lapse if the participant leaves employment, although options may be 
exercisable for a certain period of time in defined good leaver cases.
Scheme use
The use of the scheme and potential future launches are reviewed on a regular basis and a further invitation will be offered under the 
scheme 2009/10. No options were granted under this scheme during the years ended 31 March 2009 or 31 March 2008. No options 
remained outstanding at 31 March 2008.

been used to calculate the fair value of all awards granted during the year.
Share-based payment expense
The Company recognised total expenses of £2 million (2008: £5 million) related to equity setted share-based payment transactions 
during the year.

dividend for the year ended 31 March 2009 is 1.5p per ordinary 
share (2008: nil).
ShareGift
Shareholders with small holdings of shares who do not wish to sell 
because the sale commission applied would be disproportionate

Mackintosh Foundation operates a charity share donation scheme.

W1K 3HN or by telephone on +44 (0)20 7930 3737 or online

Warning to shareholders
Over the last year many companies have become aware that 
their shareholders have received unsolicited phone calls or 
correspondence concerning investment matters which imply a 
connection to the company concerned. These are typically from 
overseas-based “brokers” who target UK shareholders, offering to 
sell them what often turn out to be worthless or high risk shares in 
US or UK investments.
They can be very persistent and extremely persuasive, and a 2006 
survey by the Financial Services Authority (FSA) has reported 
that the average amount lost by investors is around £20,000. It 
is not just the novice investor who has been duped in this way: 
many of the victims had been successfully investing for several 
years. Shareholders are advised to be very wary of any unsolicited 
advice, offers to buy shares at a discount or offers of free reports 
into the Company.
If you receive any unsolicited investment advice:
•	 	 M ake 	 s u re 	 yo u 	 ge t 	 t he 	 c o r re c t 	 na m e 	 of 	 t he 	 p er s on 	 an d	
organisation and make a record of any other information they 
give you, e.g. telephone number, address etc.
•	 	 Ch e c k 	 that 	 t h ey 	 a re 	 p ro p e r l y 	 au t h or is e d 	 by 	 t he 	 FS A 	 b e f o re

•	 	 T he 	 FS A 	 al s o 	 mai n t ai n s 	 on 	 it s 	 webs i t e 	 a 	 li s t 	 of 	 u n au t h or is e d 	
overseas firms who are targeting, or have targeted, UK 
investors, and any approach from such organisations should 
be reported to the FSA so that this list can be kept up to date 
and any other appropriate action can be considered. If you 
deal with an unauthorised firm, you would not be eligible to 
receive payment under the Financial Services Compensation 
Scheme. The FSA can be contacted by completing an online 
form at www.fsa.gov.uk/pages/doing/regulated/law/
alerts/overseas.html or, if you do not have access to the 
internet, on 0845 606 1234.

will be included in Company mailings.

 THE RANK GROUP PLC: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015  5 We are 
Improving
 business
performance
Dear shareholder
Strategy
In August 2014, Rank’s chief executive, 
Henry Birch, set out the Group’s strategy 
to create long-term sustainable growth 
for the Group and its shareholders 
through the following ﬁ ve pillars:
1. Create a compelling 
multi-channel offer;
2. Build a strong digital capability; 
3. Invest in our brands and marketing;
4. Continue to develop our venues; and
5. Harness technology to improve our 
customer experience and drive 
operating efﬁ ciency.
The Group has made signiﬁ cant progress 
towards its strategic objectives and has 
delivered a very strong operating 
performance across all the brands. 
More detail of progress made in 2014/15 
is outlined on pages 25 to 31.
Financial performance
The Group has performed strongly in 
the year, with every brand improving 
its proﬁ tability on a like-for-like basis.
I am particularly delighted that H2 
saw an improvement on H1 despite the 
headwind from the imposition of Remote 
Gaming Duty (“RGD”) from 1 December 
2014. Overall revenue was up 4% to 
£738.3m, with a like-for-like stabilisation 
in our Mecca venues and strong growth 
in our brand digital channels ahead of 
the implementation of the new digital 
platform. The reduction in bingo duty 
to 10% offset the introduction of RGD at 
15% during the year and has resulted in 
a net beneﬁ t of £4.7m, which, along with 
improvements across all brands, led to 
a 9% growth in EBITDA to £126.3m. 
Cash ﬂ ow remains strong and we 
ended the year with net debt 61% 
lower at £52.9m.
Operating responsibly
The Rank board is fully committed to 
upholding the licensing objectives, as set 
out in the Gambling Act 2005, with the 
aim of ensuring that all our customers 
enjoy our products responsibly. 
Following two speciﬁ c cases, the UK 
Gambling Commission brought to our 
attention deﬁ ciencies in the application 
of our policies and procedures relating 
to anti-money laundering and responsible 
gambling. We are taking remedial actions 
and have commissioned an externally 
led review of our responsible gambling 
and anti-money laundering controls to 
provide us with further assurance that 
we are taking appropriate steps in these 
areas. We will continue to aim for the 
highest standards, in keeping with our 
commitment to upholding the 
licensing objectives. 
National living wage 
The introduction of the national living 
wage will impact the last quarter of 
2015/16. In common with other leisure 
operators, the Group has a number 
of employees who will beneﬁ t from 
its introduction. This will result in 
additional operating costs but the 
Group believes a majority of these 
can be mitigated over time.
Taxation
From 30 June 2014, bingo duty was 
reduced from 20% to 10% and resulted 
in a £11.3m tax reduction in the year. 
This duty cut funded a reduction 
in prices to our customers, the 
recommencement of a venues 
refurbishment programme and an 
increase in Mecca’s capital investments 
in product and technology.
From 1 December 2014, RGD at 15% was 
applied to all online gambling revenue 
generated by customers in the UK. The 
cost to the Group in the year was £6.6m.
VAT claims
Following the Court of Appeal decision 
regarding claims for overpaid VAT on 
certain types of amusement machines, 
Rank applied for leave to appeal to 
The Supreme Court. Rank was granted 
permission and the appeal was heard 
on 21 April 2015. On 8 July 2015, The 
Supreme Court issued their decision in 
favour of HMRC, which concludes this 
line of litigation. Rank repaid £25.2m of 
the £30.7m received in connection with 
these claims to HMRC in May 2014 and 
has fully provided for the remainder. As a 
consequence, the decision has no impact 
on Rank’s ﬁ nancial performance or 
balance sheet strength in 2014/15 
or future periods.
Listing Rules 
On 7 July 2014 the Company made 
a formal submission to the UK Listing 
Authority (“UKLA”) requesting it to 
modify LR 6.1.19 R, so that it could 
continue to be a premium listed 
Chairman’s letter
6  THE RANK GROUP PLC: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015

all of the Group’s 11,000 employees 
for their endless enthusiasm, hard 
work and commitment.”
company with a slightly lower free ﬂ oat 
percentage than 25%. On 27 August 
2014 the UKLA formally agreed to 
modify LR 6.1.19 R to accept a free 
ﬂ oat of 23%.
On 18 February 2015, GuoLine Overseas 
Limited (“GuoLine”), a subsidiary of 
Hong Leong Company (Malaysia) Berhad 
(“Hong Leong”), sold 50 million ordinary 
shares in Rank, thereby reducing Hong 
Leong’s interest in Rank’s shares to 
approximately 56.09%. As a result the 
Group now has a free ﬂ oat of greater 
than 25% and is no longer in breach 
of LR 6.1.19.
Management team changes
On 23 September 2014, Colin Cole-
Johnson joined Rank as group director of 
digital and cross-channel services. Colin 
has over 15 years’ international digital 
gaming experience and is responsible for 
the integration and delivery of Rank’s 
multi-channel offer.
During 2014/15, Phil Urban left the 
Group after serving six years as managing 
director of Grosvenor Casinos and has 
been succeeded by Mark Jones (formerly 
managing director of Mecca).
On 5 January 2015, Martin Pugh joined 
Rank as managing director of Mecca. 
Martin has a wealth of experience in 
marketing, gambling and multi-site 
leisure, having previously run Virgin 
Active UK and Camelot’s UK business.
On 9 September 2015, Paul Richardson 
will join the Group’s management team 
as group director of strategy and 
corporate development. Paul is a former 
investment banker and corporate lawyer, 
who has worked both in an advisory 
and management capacity in the gaming 
sector. Most recently he was a senior vice 
president of international development 
at Galaxy Entertainment Group, one of 
the largest casino operators in Macau.
Management incentivisation
On 22 April 2015, a general meeting 
was held at which two resolutions were 
put to the Company’s shareholders for 
consideration and approval. The ﬁ rst was 
regarding proposed amendments to the 
Group’s long-term incentive plan for its 
employees and executive directors and 
further details can be found on pages 
64 to 65. The second resolution was 
regarding proposed amendments to 
the directors’ remuneration policy. Both 
resolutions proposed were approved by 
the Company’s shareholders and further 
detail can be found on the Company’s 
corporate website at www.rank.com/en/
investors/shareholder-centre/
shareholder-meetings.html.
Board
On 1 June 2015, Chris Bell joined Rank’s 
board as a senior independent director 
and will also serve on Rank’s audit 
committee. Chris brings with him 
extensive experience of the gambling 
industry and considerable corporate 
experience and is an excellent addition 
to the board.
On 1 September 2015, Susan Hooper will 
join our board and she will seek election 
by shareholders at our forthcoming 
annual general meeting on 15 October 
2015. Details of her background and 
experience can be found in our notice of 
annual general meeting. Shaa Wasmund 
will not be seeking re-election at our 
annual general meeting and I would like 
to take this opportunity to thank her for 
her contribution to the board.
Dividend
The board targets a progressive and 
sustainable dividend. This dividend policy 
reﬂ ects the strong cash ﬂ ow characteristics 
and long-term earnings potential of 
the Group, whilst allowing it to retain 
sufﬁ cient capital to fund ongoing 
operating requirements, investment and 
balance sheet management. The board 
is recommending a ﬁ nal dividend of 
4.00 pence per share to be paid on 
21 October 2015 to shareholders on the 
register at 11 September 2015. This will 
take the full year dividend to 5.60 pence 
per share, a 24% increase on last year. 
The Group’s dividend cover has as a 
result reduced to 2.6 times from 2.8 
times in the prior year.
Finally, the board and I would like 
to thank all of the Group’s 11,000 
employees for their endless enthusiasm, 
hard work and commitment. I am always 
impressed by how each member of staff 
strives to provide the best customer 
experience and I am delighted that their 
efforts are recognised in improved 
business performance.
Current trading and outlook
Trading in the short seven-week period 
to 16 August 2015 has continued in line 
with the trends seen in 2014/15 and is 
in line with management’s expectations.
Rank remains in a strong ﬁ nancial 
position, possesses market leading 
brands and has a clear strategy for 
long-term growth.

 THE RANK GROUP PLC: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015  11 We are 
crea ting 
a mul ti-
channel 
future 
for rank
How has your first full year 
been? What have been the 
highlights and the lows?
My ﬁ rst full year has been a busy one, 
but one that I ﬁ nish feeling really 
positive about the business. And that 
is a sentiment that I think is reﬂ ected 
throughout the Group, driven most 
tangibly by our performance. It is 
difﬁ cult not to be positive with all 
our brands in growth both at the 
revenue and proﬁ t level. 
Growth in digital revenue – at 21% – 
is particularly pleasing and, in fact, 
if you compare just our second half 
performance, year-on-year, we are up 
25%. To some extent that digital growth 
is ahead of our external “schedule”, in 
that we haven’t yet moved to our new 
platform or implemented any signiﬁ cant 
changes. But it doesn’t surprise me, in 
that we have been making a number 
of incremental changes across the 
business – from launching new content 
and product (such as our new Mecca iPad 
app and a new device-agnostic front-end, 
giving consistency across PC, tablet and 
mobile) to improvements in our customer 
payments and VIP management. 
We’ve also hired a number of people and 
restructured the way we work, putting in 
place teams that work across our digital 
brands, including mobile, marketing, 
design, user experience, payments and 
customer contact. I believe we’ve now 
got a really strong digital team in place 
that can grow the business rapidly over 
the coming years. 
Another highlight has been Mecca’s retail 
performance this year. At ﬁ rst sight, stable 
revenues on a like-for-like club basis looks 
unremarkable. But against a backdrop of an 
industry that has faced declining revenues 
for many years, it is extremely encouraging. 
We’ve been candid about some of the 
challenges we face in Mecca – and these 
persist – but there is now a real sense of 
optimism and purpose within the 
Mecca business. 
And across the wider business – in 
Grosvenor and in Enracha – I feel we’ve 
got the right teams and strategies in 
place combined with a feeling of 
momentum and positive change. 
It is also gratifying to see our improved 
performance reﬂ ected in share price 
appreciation and to see new investors 
on our shareholder register.
Chief Executive’s Q&A
There have been few lows, but they have 
included taking the decisions to close some 
of our bingo venues. These are decisions 
that we never take lightly and we are aware 
of the impact they can have on the lives 
of our employees and our customers. But 
against that we face the reality that, whilst 
Mecca remains a very proﬁ table business, 
there is a small tail of venues that are 
unproﬁ table, either because of local 
dynamics, shifts in demographics or rents 
that become unsustainably high for us. 
In those circumstances, when we can exit 
lease commitments of under-performing 
venues, we need to be prepared to make 
those difﬁ cult decisions.
Finally – and this is not an issue unique 
to Rank – I have at times wished we 
could do things faster. When we do 
something we tend to do it well, but 
I would like to engender greater 
impatience and urgency throughout 
the business. That’s changing, and 
we deﬁ nitely have no shortage of ideas 
to put into action, so I expect to see 
a tangible difference in outlook and 
output in the coming years.
12  THE RANK GROUP PLC: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015
Strategic report How is Rank’s strategy 
progressing? What further 
changes can we expect to see?
We outlined our strategy alongside our 
preliminary results last year. Our strategy 
itself hasn’t changed over the last 
12 months, but we have made good 
progress on a number of fronts. As 
outlined on pages 15 to 19, our strategy 
is focused on ﬁ ve key areas with digital 
growth and a multi-channel future at the 
heart of it. Gambling has arguably been 
slower than some other sectors, most 
notably retail and banking, at creating a 
compelling multi-channel proposition 
for customers. But I have no doubt that 
we will get there as an industry and that 
customers will place greater value on 
companies who can offer a joined up 
retail and digital experience than on 
digital-only operators. I also believe 
that Rank, with its membership-based 
retail businesses, loyalty programmes 
and strong service culture, is best 
placed in our industry to deliver that 
multi-channel experience. 
More broadly, our strategy now has greater 
credence within the business. We’ve taken 
the time to communicate what we are 
trying to do and why we are doing it 
throughout the Group. We’ve also moved 
the strategy on from ideas and principles 
to detailed speciﬁ c initiatives and projects 
and, crucially, have put timetables and 
capital requirements around our plans. 
We’re going to be busy for the next 
18 months and beyond. We are also 
comfortable that, despite building a 
company for the future, the investment 
required does not signiﬁ cantly alter the 
capital requirements that we’ve seen 
over the last few years, and that we can 
continue to grow our top and bottom lines.
What has the new management 
team brought to the Group?
We have made a number of changes in 
management over the course of the last 
year, such that half of our executive team 
are new in role within the last 14 months. 
Those appointments have brought a 
renewed sense of energy and purpose 
to the business and I think our recent 
improved performance is a testament 
to that. I feel we now have a really good 
combination of those with longevity of 
service and industry experience balanced 
with those having experience and skills 
gained in adjacent industries and sectors. 
At the heart of our management team 
has been an emphasis on collaboration, 
in the recognition that although we run 
a number of separate businesses and 
brands, there is much that is common 
to them all and that by pooling skills, 
resource and experience we have much 
to gain. We’re starting to see the ﬁ rst 
beneﬁ ts of a more collaborative approach 
across our brands and I think it can give 
us advantages in a number of areas over 
our single brand/business competitors. 
We’ve also made changes in management 
beneath the executive team, bringing in 
new talent, ideas and ways of working. But 
I am a believer that talent management is a 
project that is never complete – companies 
are living organisms and, whilst needing 
to maintain an element of stability and 
continuity, we need to constantly evolve 
and shape our management and teams 
for an ever-changing future. 
What are your key priorities 
for the next 12 months?
We have two main priorities for the next 
12 months. The ﬁ rst is to maintain our 
performance improvement. Rank has 
 “ Growth in digital 
revenue – at 21% – 
is particularly pleasing.”
had a really strong 12 months and 
we need to make sure we continue 
that momentum into the next ﬁ nancial 
year. We have the headwind of a whole 
year of digital gaming taxes (the “point 
of consumption tax” introduced in 
December 2014) versus the seven 
out of 12 months just passed, and our 
comparators will be that much more 
difﬁ cult coming out of a strong year. 
But against that, we have an ongoing 
schedule of initiatives and improvements 
that should continue to grow our 
business and we remain conﬁ dent 
that we’ll deliver on this objective. 
The second priority is to put in place 
some of the key building blocks for 
future growth. Most obvious amongst 
these is the launch of our new digital 
platform, supplied by Bede. Not only 
do we expect this to drive improved 
performance in our digital business, 
but it will be a key part in joining up 
our retail and digital systems. Those 
retail systems will also be upgraded 
with a multi-channel world in mind, 
albeit within the following ﬁ nancial 
year. The next 12 months will also see 
the launch of a new bingo club format 
and a new digital brand, both with clear 
growth potential, but grounded within 
a modest capital commitment. 
Whilst these two priorities can 
sometimes work against each other – 
new platforms often result in periods 
of disruption for a business – we are 
conﬁ dent that we will deliver on these 
two priorities and will have a business 
in fantastic shape this time next year 
with compelling future prospects.

ON OUR STRA TEGY
In the markets where we operate, Rank 
is one of the few gaming companies in a 
position to provide customers a genuine 
multi-channel gaming offer. We have 
a number of key assets, including a 
portfolio of more than 150 venues, 
our membership-based model with 
approximately three million members, 
our loyalty and rewards programmes 
and the high levels of engagement that 
our team members enjoy with customers.
We will build on this position by investing 
in a range of improvements designed 
to make it simpler, more convenient and 
more rewarding for customers to engage 
with us across multiple channels. These 
improvements include the development 
of a single customer account, a single 
customer wallet and a single customer 
rewards programme, as well as a number 
of other content- and technology-related 
initiatives. These are large and complex 
programmes which will take time to 
deliver but which we believe will give 
Rank an important competitive advantage.
Activity in 2014/15
 ~ Grosvenor Casinos service app: A new 
app, My Casino, was launched in Q4 
2014/15. The app provides customers 
with information on all our UK casino 
venues from location and directions to 
virtual tours of every casino.
 ~ Tri-channel launch of content: 
Grosvenor Casinos had its ﬁ rst ever 
simultaneous launch of a tri-channel 
game. Prowling Panther was launched 
across retail, mobile and desktop 
supported by a cross-channel 
promotion. Revenues for each 
channel exceeded typical levels.
 ~ Progress towards a new digital 
platform: In January 2015, we 
announced that we would be working 
with Bede Gaming to develop a new 
platform for our digital business. As part 
of the selection process, we conducted 
an extensive technical and business 
evaluation of a number of platform 
providers and Bede Gaming was chosen 
on the basis of the quality of its product, 
its open architecture allowing a linking 
of systems and multiple sources of 
games content and its willingness to 
enter into a collaborative partnership 
which gives Rank the ability to own its 
technology in the future should it 
choose to do so. A more modern and 
functional digital gaming platform will 
drive additional digital revenue and will 
be a key component in creating a 
multi-channel offer.
 ~ Bring Your Own Device (“BYOD”) 
trial in Mecca: Four venues took part 
in offering customers Mecca Max 
content on both customer and club 
Android devices. The trial has provided 
Mecca with clarity over where 
investment and further development 
are required prior to a programme 
being rolled out across the remaining 
retail estate. 
 ~ Grosvenor Casinos loyalty scheme: 
During the year Grosvenor Casinos’ 
loyalty scheme, Play Points, was rolled 
out across a further 14 venues taking 
the total venues participating to 46. 
This was in addition to the previous 
year’s roll out across its digital channel 
to create the Group’s ﬁ rst cross-channel 
rewards programme. 
 ~ Grosvenor Casinos Black & Gold 
cards: During 2014/15 both card 
schemes were launched, targeting 
higher spending customers. The scheme 
provides improved customer beneﬁ ts 
and aims to improve customer spend, 
retention and visit frequency.
Priorities for 2015/16
 ~ Digital platform migration: 
Preparation for the migration of 
meccabingo.com and grosvenorcasinos.
com websites is underway and the 
Group is targeting a full migration 
to Bede Gaming’s platform by 
Q3 2015/16.
 ~ Mecca Services app: During the 
2015/16 year we plan to launch a 
Mecca version of the My Casino app 
to bring the same useful tool to our 
Mecca customers.
 ~ Progress towards single account 
and single wallet: Work will start 
on upgrading and integrating 
Grosvenor Casinos and Mecca 
retail management systems.

 THE RANK GROUP PLC: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015  15
Strategic report Rank has built strong positions in 
venue-based gaming which we seek 
to replicate across our digital channels 
(online and mobile). In 2014/15, our 
digital operations generated 12% of 
Group revenue whereas digital channels 
now represent around 30% of Great 
Britain’s gambling market (excluding 
National Lottery), presenting a 
signiﬁ cant growth opportunity. We 
recognise that we need to enhance our 
capability in this area if we are to meet 
the changing needs of our customers 
and to capture a greater share of the 
digital market.
Activity in 2014/15
 ~ Bede Gaming appointment: Please 
see ‘Creating a compelling multi-
channel offer’ section above.
 ~ New Mecca website with a single 
responsive and adaptive front end 
for desk top, tablet and mobile 
devices: Through Mecca’s insight into 
customer behaviour and preferences, 
Mecca was able to design, create and 
launch one of the UK’s ﬁ rst responsive, 
adaptive and customisable digital 
bingo services consistent across all 
digital channels.
 ~ Continued focus on digital customer 
acquisition conversion and 
retention: This contributed to digital 
revenue increasing by 21% and now 
accounts for 12% of Group revenue. 
 ~ Single teams across marketing, 
mobile, design and user experience: 
Following the appointment of Colin 
Cole-Johnson as group director of 
digital and cross-channel services, 
a shared service digital team was 
created across our brands to develop 
centres of expertise and remove 
unnecessary duplication.
 ~ Expansion of talent: In addition to 
building a stronger cross-brand team 
the Group has hired a number of 
individuals with speciﬁ c functional 
experience who have been involved 
in growing and transforming digital 
gaming businesses.
 ~ Decision to move Enracha to Bede 
Gaming: As with Mecca and 
Grosvenor Casinos, it is important 
that Enracha’s online operations are 
hosted on a suitable platform and 
cost efﬁ ciencies are realised. Therefore 
during the year the decision was made 
to also migrate Enracha’s digital 
operations to Bede Gaming. Enracha’s 
digital channel is planned to be 
re-launched by 2016/17.
Priorities for 2015/16
 ~ Digital Poker product development: 
As the UK’s leading land-based poker 
operator we are looking to upgrade 
and improve our digital poker offer. 
Work will commence on this in the 
2015/16 ﬁ nancial year.
 ~ Sports betting product: Rank is 
looking to complement its leading 
gaming offer with a sports betting 
product via a third party partnership. 
We do not see this as a signiﬁ cant 
revenue opportunity for the Group 
but believe it will improve our offer 
to customers and can be done 
without signiﬁ cant cost.
 ~ New digital brands: Work will 
commence on creating additional 
brands for our digital channels. 
These new brands will provide an 
opportunity to attract customers who 
are looking for something different 
to Mecca and Grosvenor Casinos.

Strategic report 3
Our casinos and bingo venues remain 
the bedrock of Rank’s business, providing 
entertainment for millions of customers 
each year and generating the majority 
of the Group’s revenue and proﬁts. By 
continuing to invest in our venues 
(in terms of product, environment and 
service) and by creating new ones, we are 
constantly evolving and enhancing the 
experiences that we offer to customers, 
and in doing so growing our revenue.
Activity in 2014/15
 ~ New casino opened in Southend: 
In September 2014 Grosvenor Casinos 
opened a new 26.5k sq ft venue in 
Southend at a capital cost of £6.1m, 
comprising table gaming, slots and 
poker, with a restaurant area and bar 
outside the licensed gambling ﬂ oor. 
Initial trading has been slower than 
expected since opening, but in recent 
months we have seen an improvement 
in trading.
 ~ Refurbishment of the Gloucester 
Road casino: During the year our 
successful Gloucester Road casino in 
London was refurbished at a capital 
cost of £0.5m. This investment 
enabled us to protect one of our 
key venues within the competitive 
London casino market.
 ~ Oldbury casino licence: As part of 
the Group’s strategy to fully utilise 
its existing assets, a previously 
non-trading casino licence was opened 
in December 2014 alongside Mecca’s 
Oldbury venue.
 ~ Refurbishment of our Bournemouth 
casino: £1.4m was spent in the year 
on refurbishing the Bournemouth 
casino which was one of the 19 
acquired from Gala Coral. 
 ~ Luton 2005 Act: Following Rank’s 
successful bid for the 2005 Act casino 
licence in Luton, works are underway 
to refurbish and extend the current 
Luton casino to accommodate the 
permitted additional product. The 
total capital cost will be approximately 
£4.8m and is due to be completed by 
September 2015.
 ~ Light refurbishment of eight Mecca 
venues: Capital investment into our 
Mecca venues was increased in the 
year following the reduction in bingo 
duty, with eight venues undergoing 
refurbishments at a total capital 
cost of £1.3m. 
 ~ Enracha rebrand: During the year 
three further venues in Spain were 
rebranded to Enracha at a capital 
cost of £0.6m.
Priorities for 2015/16
 ~ Commitment to three new bingo 
venues: In line with our continuing 
commitment following the reduction 
in bingo duty, Mecca will continue to 
develop its venues offer with at least 
one new format venue to be opened 
in 2015/16.
 ~ Expansion of key casino sites: As 
part of Grosvenor Casinos’ on-going 
refurbishment programme, and 
dependent on planning, we expect to 
upgrade three to ﬁ ve existing casinos 
within the next ﬁ nancial year. As with 
previous casino refurbishments the 
aim will be to provide our customers 
with more modern product and 
an enhanced gaming experience. 
These upgrades will include our 
London Park Tower, Coventry 
and Nottingham casinos.
 ~ Grosvenor ‘sparkles’: 18 Grosvenor 
Casinos venues will be enhanced in 
the year at a total cost of £4.5m. Each 
‘sparkle’ will comprise numerous low 
cost investments ranging from new 
uniforms and carpets to upgrades of 
smoking terraces in each venue. 
 ~ Light refurbishment of eight Mecca 
venues: The increased capital 
investment in Mecca venues will 
continue into 2015/16 with eight 
additional venues receiving 
a refurbishment in the year at an 
estimated total capital cost of £2.1m.

The development of a group of well-
deﬁned, relevant and resonant brands is 
critical for the success of our ambition. 
At Rank, we enjoy ownership of a 
number of well-known brands with 
strong levels of afﬁnity amongst 
customers. We intend to invest more 
in the development of our brands and 
in the marketing support required to 
release their potential.
Activity in 2014/15
 ~ A single cross brand digital 
marketing team: Please refer to 
the ‘Building digital capability’ 
section above.
 ~ New Mecca marketing director 
appointed: Anna Shirley joined Mecca 
in August 2015 as marketing director 
for Mecca with responsibility for both 
Mecca’s retail and digital channels. 
Anna brings a wealth of experience 
of both national and local marketing 
from some of the UK’s leading brands 
such as Sainsbury’s and Freemans.
 ~ New advertising agency 
appointed across both brands: This 
will result in a more productive and 
efﬁ cient relationship.
 ~ New Mecca and Grosvenor Casinos 
TV adverts: New adverts were aired in 
the period promoting both our digital 
and retail channels.
 ~ New Grosvenor Casinos logo design: 
Following consultation with our 
customers we took the step to 
simplify the Grosvenor Casinos logo 
to improve its recognition and better 
accommodate its digital format.
 ~ Increased VIP teams in Grosvenor 
Casinos: During the year VIP 
managers were deployed across our 
London venues. The managers are 
focused on improving customer care 
levels and VIP customer retention.
 ~ Increased marketing spend: Total 
marketing spend, including free bets, 
increased by 19% to £75.5m in the 
year with a particular focus on TV 
advertising to promote multi-channel.
Priorities for 2015/16
 ~ Continue to incrementally increase 
marketing spend: Overall marketing 
expenditure will increase but will be in 
keeping with increases in revenues and 
ensuring a return on marketing 
investment.
 ~ Review of our customer relationship 
management, business intelligence 
and insights capability: The Group 
has access to a signiﬁ cant amount of 
data on how our customers interact 
with each of its brands. We will be 
starting work on implementing new 
ways of storing, accessing and 
interrogating this data, thus enabling 
us to react better to our customer 
needs and behaviours.
 ~ Review sponsorship opportunities: 
The Group will look at further 
opportunities in the coming year 
to build on the sponsorship activity 
carried out in 2014/15 which 
contributed to improved brand 
awareness and in club events.

of opportunities to harness technological 
developments to offer our customers 
more engaging experiences and to 
achieve sustainable growth in 
operating margins.
Activity in 2014/15
 ~ Server-based slots roll out in Mecca: 
1,000 new and 1,315 upgraded 
server-based machines were rolled 
out across 81 Mecca venues in the 
year, representing 44% of Mecca’s 
gaming machines estate. These will 
provide an enhanced customer 
experience with high deﬁ nition 
screens offering a wide choice of 
content and access to promotional 
features. These machines have Ticket 
In Ticket Out (TiTo) functionality to 
reduce cash handling costs.
 ~ Mecca Max roll out: Mecca Max is 
a key component in the delivery of 
improved efﬁ ciency and proﬁ tability 
within Mecca’s venues. By increasing 
the capacity more customers have 
the opportunity for electronic bingo, 
therefore reducing cash handling 
costs. 5,600 units were purchased 
in the year of which 2,200 units 
were incremental.
 ~ Bring Your Own Device (“BYOD”) 
trial: Please refer to the ‘Creating 
a compelling multi-channel offer’ 
section above.
 ~ Labour scheduling in Grosvenor 
Casinos venues: A central rota 
system for Grosvenor Casinos was 
implemented in the year. The system 
enables management to monitor 
labour scheduling per venue and 
hence optimise allocation of 
labour resources.
Priorities for 2015/16
 ~ iBeacon trial: iBeacon technology 
enables us to communicate with our 
customers via their mobile devices on 
entering one of our venues. A low cost 
trial will be carried out with an initial 
focus on establishing how many of 
our customers’ devices are open to 
this method of communication. 
 ~ Improved electronic roulette: To 
increase spin rates and improve table 
choice, the Group is looking at ways 
to broadcast electronic roulette game 
play from one casino to another.
 ~ Cashless systems in our venues: 
Mecca will be looking at ways to 
further reduce the amount of cash 
that is handled within its venues to 
decrease cash handling costs and 
meet our customers’ growing needs. 
 ~ Launch of progressive Blackjack 
jackpot: We are rolling out a new 
progressive jackpot across our UK 
casino estate.

 THE RANK GROUP PLC: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015  19 How we manage risk
Rank operates a comprehensive risk management methodology 
which is closely integrated to its management structure to 
provide clear oversight and governance of the risks which 
are considered to be material to its business, and to maintain 
continual surveillance of its operating environment for 
emerging risks. 
The approach endeavours to ensure that a clear risk appetite 
is set that balances risks and opportunities to contribute to 
the achievement of the Group’s strategic objectives. 
The board has responsibility for the risk framework and 
establishing the Group’s risk appetite, as well as ensuring 
that risk controls are built into management’s approach to 
operations. The audit committee holds the responsibility for 
assessing the effectiveness of the risk management systems 
which are in place and undertaking independent review of 
the risk mitigation plans which have been designed for 
material risks. 
Our risk management process

Risk management
Rank’s risk committee (further information can be found on 
page 56) meets on a monthly basis with a remit to conduct 
a thorough review of the risk register and to ensure that 
management are working effectively to identify and manage 
risks as they arise and on a continual basis. Working sessions 
of the committee are held with departmental and divisional 
management to ensure that risks are being identiﬁ ed in a 
timely manner and effective action plans put into place. This 
approach ensures that risk is identiﬁ ed in both a ‘top-down’ 
and a ‘bottom-up’ manner from the various management 
levels of the organisation to give assurance that risk registers 
are comprehensive. 
Group internal audit works in support of the risk committee 
to help manage risk identiﬁ cation and conduct independent 
reviews of both the business’ risks and its progress in 
performing the mitigating action plans agreed for any 
relevant risks, the status of which is reported to the 
risk committee monthly.

Volatility of gaming win
Win percentages for gambling activities can vary 
over a short period of time, although they will stabilise 
over a longer period. The business is also vulnerable to the 
potential impact of a small number of customers who can 
create volatility from the level of their gaming win. Win 
percentages may also be affected by misfeasance or any 
other problems with the accurate running of the game.

Loss of licences
Rank’s gaming licences are fundamental to its operation. 
In the British venues part of the business there is a 
requirement to hold an operator’s licence from the 
UK Gambling Commission (the body responsible for 
regulating commercial gambling in Great Britain) in 
respect of each of the licensed activities undertaken. 
Additionally, it is necessary to hold premises licences 
from the relevant local authority in which each venue 
is situated, one for gambling activities and one for the sale 
of alcohol. Our UK customer facing transactional websites 
require a licence from the Alderney Gambling Control 
Commission. With effect from 14 September 2014, an 
operator’s licence for our remote operations has been 
required from the UK Gambling Commission. Our 
operations in Spain and Belgium are also subject to 
licensing requirements in the jurisdictions and local 
areas in which they operate.
 Stable
The loss of licences 
could have an adverse 
effect on our business 
and proﬁ tability and 
prevent us from 
providing gambling 
services.
Rank has a dedicated compliance 
function that is independent of 
operations and a separate internal 
audit function that is independent of 
both operations and the compliance 
function. Rank maintains a strong 
and open relationship with the UK 
Gambling Commission and the other 
relevant regulatory bodies in all 
jurisdictions in which we operate.

Strategic report Risk Impact Mitigation
Business continuity and disaster recovery
Due to the venues based nature of much of the business, 
the Group’s signiﬁ cant reliance on technology, and the 
criticality of staff in serving customers and running the 
business, serious disruptive events such as building ﬁ re, 
pandemic or serious technology failure may cause an 
interruption to the ability to operate elements of the 
business if business continuity and disaster recovery 
plans failed to operate successfully.

 Stable
If business continuity 
and disaster recovery 
plans failed to operate 
successfully the business 
would experience delays 
in recovering critical 
revenue generating 
activities or operational 
processes, such as 
ﬁ nancial reporting, 
causing both ﬁ nancial 
and reputational 
damage.
A Group business continuity plan 
is in place and regularly reviewed. 
Departmental plans are required for 
all critical departments and premises, 
and managed by the director of 
security. IT plans were reviewed in 
light of the transfer of risk arising 
through the engagement of IT 
outsourced supplier Tata Consultancy 
Services and suitable plans are in 
place for their operations. 
Wage rise inﬂ ation
We employ a large number of employees at or just above 
the minimum wage. The introduction of the national 
living wage will increase our costs. Further changes to 
employment regulations could have an adverse impact on 
the Group’s results.

Information technology risk
Risk Impact Mitigation
Reliance on technology
The Group is highly dependent on complex technology 
and advanced information systems with many interfaces 
and a signiﬁ cant number of separate suppliers. The 
pace of business change and development means that 
IT changes such as new software coding, systems 
enhancements and new software application integrations 
are undertaken continually and consequently these 
systems are inherently vulnerable to experiencing 
malfunctions, failures, or cyber attacks such as viruses 
or hacker intrusion. Comprehensive technology resilience 
and systems protection measures are in place but it is 
difﬁ cult to detect all threats and vulnerabilities in order 
to prevent all service interruptions and problems.

If our prevention 
measures for technology 
attacks should fail our 
reputation may be 
harmed and customers 
deterred from using our 
services which may in 
turn have a material 
adverse effect on our

Failures in service 
provision could also 
render the Group unable 
to serve customers 
during such service 
interruptions, again 
having an adverse effect 
on revenue and proﬁ t.
The IT outsourcing to Tata 
Consultancy Services has 
substantially enhanced the resources 
for providing business support and 
resilience around key systems. 
Over the past year a substantial 
amount of investment has been put 
into enhancing the security, network

Supply
As of 30 June 2015 the number of casino licences operating 
in Great Britain was 149. All but two of these casinos were 
licensed under the 1968 Act and when the 1968 Act was 
superseded by the 2005 Gambling Act (“the 2005 Act”) 
the rights of these casinos were “grandfathered”.
2005 Act casino – market status
During 2014/15 there was no signiﬁ cant progress made 
regarding the awarding of 2005 Act casino licences. Following 
the Group’s successful bid for the Luton 2005 Act casino 
licence, a capital investment of £4.8m is currently underway 
to refurbish and extend the existing Luton casino. Works are 
due to be completed by September 2015. During the year Rank 
submitted its stage 2 application for the large 2005 Act casino 
licence in Southampton. Rank’s application is currently 
under review by Southampton’s council along with six 
other applications.

A recovery in win margin in the second half of the year, 
bringing the full year back to a normal win margin, 
contributed to a 6% growth in retail revenue for the 
year. Operating proﬁ t grew by 10% principally due to an 
improved London performance despite a £1.4m increase 
in irrecoverable VAT (£0.8m relating to the prior year) 
and higher operating costs.
Following a successful bid, Grosvenor Casinos was awarded the 
2005 Act casino licence for Luton in June 2014. The existing 
Luton casino will house the 2005 Act licence and, as a result, 
is currently undergoing refurbishment and extension works 
to accommodate the additional permitted product. The total 
capital cost will be approximately £4.8m and the works are 
due to be completed by September 2015.
On 25 September 2014, a new casino was opened in Southend 
at a capital cost of £6.1m. Initial trading has been slower than 
expected since opening, but in recent months we have seen 
an improvement in trading.
As part of our estate rationalisation programme aimed at 
improving long-term proﬁ tability, we closed two of our 
under-performing casinos. Our New Brighton casino was 
closed in July 2015 following a disappointing trading 
performance since its opening in April 2012. We also closed 
our smaller Osborne Road casino in Portsmouth in August 
2015 and plan to transfer its licence to our highly successful 
Portsmouth casino at Gunwharf Quays. Subject to planning 
permission being granted the additional licence will be 
operating in H1 2015/16.

 THE RANK GROUP PLC: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015  27 Venues regional analysis
The casinos estate is split into three key areas – London, 
Provinces and Belgium. To better illustrate the differences 
across the estate, the above analysis has been provided.
London performed strongly in the year with revenues up 13% 
driven by a stronger win margin and major player activity in 
H2. During the year Grosvenor Casinos’ top 50 customers 
contributed approximately £4.6m of additional revenue 
compared to the average recorded over the last four years 
(including 2014/15). Operating proﬁ t grew by 22%. 
Provincial revenue grew by 3% in the year driven by a 2% 
increase in customer visits. Excluding the impact from the 
opening of Southend, admissions were broadly ﬂ at against last 
year which is in line with the latest available data for the UK 
casino market. This lack of visit growth was disappointing and 
will be a focus for the coming year. Comparable revenue was 
up 2%, driven by increased spend per visit offset by a lower 
win margin. Disappointingly, operating proﬁ t fell by 3% 
in the year due to higher irrecoverable VAT, start-up losses 
at Southend, a lower win margin and other one-off costs.

Like-for-like venues revenue beneﬁ ted from an increase in 
spend per visit, driven by product enhancements, but this 
was offset by a 3% fall in like-for-like customer visits. This 
like-for-like revenue performance is pleasing as it follows two 
years of revenue declines. Total venues revenue fell in the 
period by 2% driven by the closure of six under-performing 
venues in the year. Operating proﬁ t increased by 37% due 
to lower operating costs, predominantly due to lower bingo 
duty and lower labour costs.
Investment in bingo
In line with the Group’s commitments following the reduction 
in bingo duty to 10% the Group has invested in the following 
programmes in the year:
1. Investment in facilities
 ~ Venue refurbishment programme recommenced: Total 
capital expenditure of £1.3m on refurbishing eight venues 
during the year, with a further eight refurbishments 
planned for 2015/16.
 ~ New bingo venues: The Group remains committed to opening 
three new bingo venues. A new format club is currently 
in development and is planned to open in 2015/16. It will 
form part of Mecca’s sustainable investment model and will 
leverage off Mecca’s popular electronic bingo product offer.
 ~ Increased maintenance expenditure: An additional 
£1.1m was spent in the year, a 85% increase on last year. 
 ~ WiFi upgrade: As part of the brand’s drive to improve 
customer experience, WiFi trials were carried out in 
our venues in the year.
2. Improved value to customers
 ~ Reduced main stage bingo pricing: £3.4m of the bingo 
duty saving was allocated to reduce the price of bingo 
books in the year.
 ~ Enhanced customer prizes: £1.5m was spent on new 
in-venue events with enhanced prizes.
3. Improvement in product
 ~ Mecca Max units: £2.2m was spent in the year on 5,600 new 
hand held Mecca Max units of which 2,200 were incremental. 
Digital performed strongly in the year with revenues up 11%, 
driven by an increase in customer numbers and improved customer 
retention. Operating proﬁ t fell by 11% following the introduction 
of RGD on 1 December 2015, costing £4.9m in the year.

Six loss-making venues were closed in the year as part of 
Mecca’s drive to create a more proﬁ table and sustainable

Digital customers numbers grew by 17% in the year following

Rank’s purpose is for our customers to enjoy our 
products responsibly.
How it affects our performance and position
Rank is very much aware that, whilst the principal purpose 
of our businesses is to provide an exciting and entertaining 
experience for our customers, there is also a need to protect 
those few customers who may be most at risk of gambling-
related harm.   
With that in mind, Rank continues to develop its pioneering 
responsible gambling policy under the award winning “Keep 
it Fun” banner. This is designed to make information about 
playing responsibly easily accessible to all customers, not just 
those with the potential to develop problems. 
Innovative means of communicating information in accessible 
ways include the use of ﬁ lm clips both on our dedicated 
http://keepitfun.rank.com website and sent out as social 
media messaging, along with the display of the Keep it Fun 
logo and website address on all casino gaming tables.
Our policies and actions
At Rank, our approach is to seek a more sophisticated 
understanding of the problem and to use that understanding

 THE RANK GROUP PLC: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015  33
Strategic report Our employees
Rank is made up of 11,000 enthusiastic and committed 
individuals, who have a desire to deliver the best experience 
for our customers.
How it affects our performance and position
Our people bring our brands to life by striving to deliver 
a market leading gaming experience. Rank’s people are its 
greatest asset and are the main reason why people choose 
our brands and stay with us.
We understand that the support and development of our 
staff are critical if we are to achieve our strategic goals. 
Our policies and actions
Training 
During 2014/15, we invested £635,000 in delivering 
270,000 hours of training to our employees, helping 
them to develop the skills required to do their jobs.
Career development
Our career development programme is designed to enable 
our employees to progress within Rank, offering mobility 
between brand and Group teams, and the opportunity to 
work within different areas of operation and to participate 
in cross-group projects.
During 2014/15, nearly all team members participated in 
career development training. In addition, 861 of our 
employees achieved a promotion in the year.
Leadership and engagement
Rank’s senior management team has an obligation to the 
Group’s employees to set clear direction and expectations 
and to provide regular and motivational feedback. Our team 
member engagement scores tell us how effective we are in 
meeting this need. In 2014/15, team member engagement 
was in line with that seen in the prior year, at 79%.
Health and safety
We at Rank understand that we must keep our employees 
and customers safe at all times. We recognise the challenges 
and look continually to improve our approach to health 
& safety in order to promote a positive and understood 
culture which in turn will help eliminate and reduce 
injuries and ill health.
We will provide our employees with the tools required to 
carry out their work safely and we encourage our employees 
to be both passionate and practical about keeping themselves, 
our customers and our sites safe at all times.
We encourage our employees to advise us of any health 
and safety issues in their workplace so that we can look at 
eliminating or reducing the risk and ﬁ nally we will all work 
together to reduce health and safety risks to a minimum.

34  THE RANK GROUP PLC: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015
Strategic report Disability
Rank is committed to ensuring that people with disabilities 
are supported and encouraged to apply for employment with 
the Group and to achieve progress whilst employed. Disabled 
persons will be treated so that they have an equal opportunity, 
so far as is justiﬁable, to be selected, trained and promoted.
In order that people with disabilities may have an equal 
opportunity of being recruited, the Group strictly applies its 
Equal Opportunities and Recruitment Policies. In particular, 
Rank takes reasonable steps to ensure that interview 
arrangements are such that disabled persons may attend 
without embarrassment or difﬁculty. It also ensures that any 
enquiries made about an applicant’s health prior to offering 
a job are limited to establishing whether the applicant will be 
able to comply with a requirement to undergo an interview 
or other assessment; whether a duty to make reasonable 
adjustments is, or will be, imposed on the Group in relation 
to the applicant in connection with a requirement to undergo 
an interview or other assessment; whether the applicant will 
be able to carry out a function that is intrinsic to the work 
concerned; or for the purpose of monitoring diversity in the 
range of persons applying to the Group to work. The Group is 
also committed to making such reasonable adjustments to 
premises, work practices and equipment as are necessary to 
enable a disabled person to take up employment with Rank.
Career development opportunities are communicated as 
appropriate to all employees and those with disabilities 
are encouraged to apply as detailed in the Group’s Equal 
Opportunities Policy. Both internal and external training 
opportunities are provided where they are appropriate to 
employees’ current occupations or potential opportunities 
and to the needs of the business. Where appropriate, outside 
training providers are required to demonstrate that they are 
able to accommodate persons with a disability before the 
Group will approve their usage. The provision of internal 
courses is relocated as necessary in order to ensure that 
persons with disabilities may attend, and the human resources 
department is responsible for making suitable arrangements 
with regard to the venue of the event or to the format in 
which any supporting course materials are provided.
During performance appraisal meetings in particular, managers 
are required to pay special attention to the views of disabled 
employees on career development issues such as access to 
training/development events and/or opportunities, and are 
expected to enquire whether there is anything that the Group 
may reasonably do to help the person develop and use their 
abilities at work.
We will never be able to reduce risk or achieve high standards 
of health and safety without the active involvement of staff at 
all levels; from directors and heads of departments developing, 
resourcing and driving risk reduction methods and feeding 
back those methods to our employees. By listening to our 
employees and our customers and by analysing the accidents 
that occur, our appreciation of risks will evolve as will our 
approach to help improve health and safety at Rank.
Diversity
Rank is committed to providing equal opportunities for all 
of our employees. Our diversity policy ensures that every 
employee is treated equally and fairly and that all employees 
are aware of their responsibilities.
The policy conﬁrms that there will be no direct or indirect 
discrimination in respect of age, disability, religious belief, 
gender, sexual orientation, race, colour, marital status, political 
belief and nationality, or any other category deﬁned by law in 
all aspects of employment including recruitment, promotion, 
and opportunities for training, pay and beneﬁts.
Please refer to page 50 which outlines the board’s 
diversity policy.
The charts on page 34 provide a breakdown of the gender 
of directors and employees at the end of the ﬁnancial year.

 THE RANK GROUP PLC: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015  35 Operating responsibly – continued
Where an employee becomes disabled, whether through 
accident, illness or injury, every reasonable and practicable 
consideration will be given to ensuring that they may remain 
in employment. Any situations involving an employee who 
becomes disabled require the involvement of human resources, 
who monitor the employee’s disability and provide advice 
during their ongoing employment. The Group may take a 
variety of steps to enable continuing employment, for example 
making adjustments to premises; transfer to an alternative 
position which is vacant or to a different location/place of work; 
alteration of working hours; time off during working hours 
for rehabilitation, assessment or treatment; training and/or 
re-skilling; modiﬁcation or purchase of appropriate equipment; 
and provision of supervision and assistance. All necessary advice 
and counselling will be provided for the employee concerned 
by human resources, who will also consult external specialist 
organisations as appropriate. The Group welcomes suggestions 
from disabled employees regarding adjustments which could 
assist with their ability to undertake their role.
 “We challenge all of our teams to 
consider what they can contribute 
to the communities that they serve.”
Human rights
Given the nature of our business and its geographical spread 
we have not included information on human rights issues 
as required by the Companies Act 2006 Regulations 2013. 
The Group does take into account the rights provided by 
the Human Rights Act 1998 and the European Convention 
on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms in its policies 
and in how it operates. In an employee context, for example, 
the right to a private and family life is taken seriously and 
this is reﬂ ected in relevant employee policies.
Our communities
Rank has continued its long history of community 
involvement and charitable fund raising.
How it affects our performance and position
Our venues are often cited as “community hubs” – particularly 
our Mecca venues. We challenge all of our teams to consider 
what they can contribute to the communities that they serve.
Our policies and actions 
In February 2014, we launched Rank Cares to support the 
work of the Carers Trust to help those who help others in 
need of care. Around three out of every ﬁ ve people in Britain 
today provide care for another – often a sick or elderly relation. 
The Carers Trust provides support, advice and relief for those 
undertaking what is often very physically and emotionally 
draining work.
We have set ourselves a target of raising £0.9m for the Carers 
Trust and at 30 June 2015 we had raised £0.8m. The funds are 
distributed within the communities in which they are raised, 
via a series of grant panels.
To celebrate Rank Cares raising over £0.5m a thank you and 
celebration event was held in March 2015. In her capacity as 
president of Carers Trust, The Princess Royal attended to give 
her thanks and to hand out some awards.
In addition, Rank Cares provides a framework for team 
members to volunteer their time to help the Carers Trust, 
often utilising hidden talents to bring relief and happiness 
to these selﬂess carers.
During 2014/15, Rank also participated in activities to 
support the following organisations:
 ~ Dame Kelly Holmes Trust;
 ~ Cancer Research; and
 ~ Other local charities.

Rank and the environment – Greenhouse gas (GHG) emission
This is the fourth year of like-for-like reduction in gas and 
electricity consumption achieved by the various initiatives 
coordinated via our internal opportunities database as well 
as assistance from our team members on site.
We are now in our sixth year of monitoring electricity and gas 
through Automatic Meter Reading (“AMR”) and are looking to 
renew the gas AMR equipment across the estate. We have now 
also installed water AMR in the majority of our Scottish clubs. 
Half hourly gas and electricity data is issued weekly to the 
managers of each venue and to our Environmental Champions 
(one per venue) and in addition we communicate via our 
dedicated environmental website and regional road shows 
held annually. 
Food waste segregation and collection has been rolled out 
across the venues estate with a resultant improvement in 
landﬁ ll diversion. This currently stands at 78.42% and we 
envisage being well over 80% by December 2015.
Our Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme (“ESOS”) surveys 
have been completed and we are about to review the data 
to identify our next set of opportunities.
We are progressing with new control systems and strategies 
as we replace old R22 chillers or other equipment as well as 
on-going reviews of new technologies. 
 THE RANK GROUP PLC: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015  37 Delivering for shareholders
Group revenue for the 12-month period from continuing 
operations rose by 4% to £738.3m, while Group operating 
proﬁ t before exceptionals of £84.0m was 16% higher than 
the prior period.
Adjusted net interest payable for the 12 months was in line 
with the prior period.
Adjusted earnings per share was up 18% year on year at 14.6p.
Taxation
The Group’s effective corporation tax rate on continuing 
operations was 22.9% (2013/14: 22.2%) based on a tax charge 
of £17.0m on adjusted proﬁ t before taxation and a tax credit 
on exceptionals of £1.3m. The Group’s effective corporation 
tax rate for 2015/16 is expected to fall within the range of 21% 
to 23% as a result of the reduction of UK corporation tax rates. 
The Group had a cash tax rate of 3.0% on adjusted proﬁ ts 
following refunds received in the year. These arose following 
the submission of the 2012/13 tax returns which included 
the amusement machines VAT repayment to HM Revenue 
and Customs (“HMRC”). Taking into account this refund, 
the adjusted cash tax of 15.6% reﬂ ects the utilisation of capital 
allowances and losses in the Group (2013/14: 16.7%). This 
adjusted cash tax rate was in line with management’s 
expectations. The Group is expected to have a cash tax rate of 
17.5% to 20.0% in 2015/16, excluding any tax payable on the 
resolution of a number of legacy issues. This is lower than the 
Group’s effective corporation tax rate due to the utilisation of 
capital allowances and losses in the Group.
Rank’s appeal regarding claims for overpaid VAT on certain 
types of amusement machines was heard at The Supreme Court 
on 21 April 2015. The Supreme Court’s decision, which is ﬁ nal, 
was subsequently released on 8 July 2015 in favour of HMRC. 
Rank repaid £25.2m of the £30.7m received in connection with 
 Improving 
Performance
Financial review
these claims to HMRC in May 2014 and has fully provided for 
the remainder. As a consequence, the decision has no impact 
on Rank’s ﬁ nancial performance or balance sheet strength in 
2014/15 or future periods.
As highlighted in last year’s report, the Group previously 
participated in a disclosed tax avoidance scheme. The scheme 
will be litigated through the courts and the case is expected to 
be heard in December 2016. Under new tax rules implemented 
last year, HMRC can request payment of the amounts under 
dispute in advance of any Tax Tribunal. The Group has still 
not yet received any request for payment, with the amounts 
at dispute worth up to £21.7m excluding any interest due.

Strategic report Exceptional items
In order to give a full understanding of the Group’s ﬁ nancial 
performance and aid comparability between periods, the 
Group reports certain items as exceptional to normal trading. 
Full details of the Group’s exceptional items are provided 
in note 4.
Financial structure and liquidity
At 30 June 2015, net debt was £52.9m compared with net debt 
of £137.0m at 30 June 2014. The net debt comprised £120.0m 
in bank term loans in respect of the acquisition of the former 
Gala casinos, £8.6m in ﬁ xed rate Yankee bonds, £11.8m in 
ﬁ nance leases and £2.1m in overdrafts, offset by cash at bank 
and in hand of £89.6m.
The Group’s banking facilities comprise two £60.0m bi-lateral 
term loans (reduced from £70.0m in the year) and four £20.0m 
bi-lateral revolving credit facilities with its relationship banks 
totalling £200.0m. These facilities require the maintenance of 
a minimum ratio of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation 
and amortisation (‘EBITDA’) to net interest payable; a 
minimum ratio of EBITDA plus operating lease charges to net 
interest payable plus operating lease charges; and a maximum 
ratio of net debt to EBITDA, tested quarterly and biannually 
depending on the facility. The Group has complied with its 
banking covenants.
The Group’s term loans and revolving credit facilities are due 
to expire in May 2016 and January 2017 respectively. The 
Group has been working with its relationship banks and 
anticipates replacement facilities will be signed shortly.
The Group’s balance sheet continued to strengthen in the year 
with leverage falling from 1.2 times to 0.4 times at 30 June 2015.

During 2014/15, Rank invested £8.8m in making 
improvements to its Grosvenor Casino venues; this included 
£4.0m to complete the new Southend casino that opened 
in September 2014, £1.4m on a major refurbishment of its 
Bournemouth casino (ex-Gala Coral), £0.5m to modernise its 
London Gloucester Road casino and £0.9m on works to extend 
and refurbish its Luton casino to accommodate the awarded 
2005 Act casino licence. Grosvenor Casinos also spent £1.3m 
on rolling out the brand’s loyalty scheme, Play Points, across 
the acquired venues from Gala Coral, £2.3m on a variety of 
IT upgrades, and £0.9m on developing its digital channel 
with the balance on minor capital works.
Mecca increased its level of investment into its venues estate 
in line with its commitment to HM Treasury following the 
10% reduction in bingo duty. A total of £9.5m was spent in 
the year which included £1.3m on venue refurbishments and 
£2.2m on Mecca Max units. £1.9m was also invested in the 
brand’s digital channel with the majority spent on re-designing 
the meccabingo.com website and app development. 
Central capital expenditure of £5.6m included £3.4m on 
migrating the Group’s digital business to its new platform 
provider, Bede Gaming.
During 2015/16, we plan to invest approximately £50m.
Total capital committed at 30 June 2015 was £2.8m, of which 
£1.4m related to completing the extension and refurbishment 
of Grosvenor’s Luton casino and £1.0m related to the new 
online gaming platform. 
Going concern
In adopting the going concern basis for preparing the 
ﬁ nancial information, the directors have considered the 
issues impacting the Group during the period as detailed in 
the strategic report on pages 1 to 43 and have reviewed the 
Group’s projected compliance with its banking covenants 
detailed above. The Group is in the advanced stages of 
negotiating replacement bank facilities and, based on the 
Group’s cash ﬂ ow forecasts and operating budgets, the 
directors believe that the Group will generate sufﬁ cient cash 
to meet its requirements for at least the next 12 months from 
the date of approval of the ﬁ nancial statements and comply 
with its banking covenants.

 THE RANK GROUP PLC: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015  39 Taxation
In the year 2014/15 the Group’s businesses have generated 
£159.6m (2013/14: £189.4m) for the UK Exchequer and local 
government in direct and indirect taxes and local business 
rates. The year-on-year reduction is due to lower corporation 
tax payments. Rank has provided employment to 11,000 
(2013/14: 11,000) people across the Group. The broader 
impact of Rank’s operations, including taxes paid by supplier 
companies, is harder to quantify but no less signiﬁ cant. 
Taxation represents a signiﬁ cant proportion of the Group’s 
total outgoings, as can be seen from the chart below:
Taxation
Group taxation     32%
Employment costs   26%
Depreciation/amortisation     6%
Payments to suppliers    28%
Other     8%
Tax strategy
Rank’s tax strategy is to fully comply with statutory tax 
obligations and maintain good relationships with tax 
authorities, to partner the business in providing relevant 
tax advice and to enhance shareholder value. 
Rank operates in a highly regulated and highly taxed industry 
and aims to engage effectively with governments to ensure 
that Rank’s economic and societal contributions are 
understood and valued.
It remains Rank’s objective to ensure that all taxes are correctly 
accounted for and that tax returns are completed accurately 
and on time and that any tax liabilities are paid. There are 
sufﬁ cient processes and controls in place to ensure that this 
objective is met. Rank has continued to progress and resolve 
certain current and historic tax issues in the UK and abroad in 
the past year through working co-operatively with the local tax 
Contributing 
to our Communities
Rank is committed to contributing to the communities and 
economies where it is established; this includes paying tax.
Tax fact ﬁ le
authorities. The Group aims to conclude tax audits as quickly 
as possible whilst also defending its position robustly with a 
view to protecting shareholder value and taking into account 
the cost of defending audits in relation to the amounts of 
tax at stake.
The Group’s tax strategy is regularly reviewed and approved 
by the Board and supported by the use of appropriate advisors. 
Where disputes arise over the interpretation and application of 
tax legislation, the Group will seek to resolve any differences 
by discussing the merits of its position with the relevant tax 
authority. In the event that agreement cannot be reached, 
Rank will consider litigation provided that the grounds of 
appeal stand a good chance of success and that there is 
sufﬁ cient tax at stake to warrant the cost of litigation.
Effective tax rate
The Group’s effective corporation tax rate in 2014/15 was 
22.9% (2013/14: 22.2%) based on a tax charge of £17.0m on 
adjusted proﬁ t before taxation. This is in line with the Group’s 
anticipated effective tax rate of 22% to 24%. The effective 
corporation tax rate for 2015/16 and future periods is expected 
to be 21% to 23%, reducing in line with the reduction to UK 
corporation tax rates but remaining 1% to 3% above the UK 
statutory tax rate as a result of some overseas proﬁ ts being 
taxed at higher rates and depreciation of assets that do not 
qualify for capital allowances. Further details on the taxation 
charge are provided in note 7.
Cash tax rate
In the year ended 30 June 2015 the Group had a cash tax rate 
of 3.0% on adjusted proﬁ ts following refunds received in the 
year. These arose following submission of the 2012/13 tax 
returns which included the amusement machines VAT 
repayment to HMRC. Taking into account this refund, the 
adjusted cash tax rate of 15.6% on adjusted proﬁ ts reﬂ ects 
the utilisation of capital allowances and losses in the Group 
(2013/14: 16.7%). The Group is expected to have a cash tax 
rate of approximately 17.5% to 20.0% in the year ended 
30 June 2016, excluding any tax payable on the resolution 
of a number of legacy issues. This is lower than the Group’s 
effective corporation tax due to the utilisation of capital 
allowances and losses in the Group.
40  THE RANK GROUP PLC: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015
Strategic report Gaming tax reform
Rank considers that the current tax regime for gaming in 
Great Britain remains unduly complex, which has resulted in 
volatility in the past. For instance, our roulette based product 
attracts duty rates that vary from 15% to 50% of Gross Gaming 
Revenue depending which venues they arise in. Rank is in 
favour of a simpler regime that encourages sustained growth 
and investment. 
More details of Rank’s position are detailed in our paper 
‘Responsible Taxation: Fairness, Responsibility and 
Sustainability’ which is available at www.rank.com.
From 1 July 2014 , the rate of bingo duty reduced from 20% to 
10%. The reduction provided an important boost for Britain’s 
bingo clubs, which provide a range of social and economic 
beneﬁ ts for the communities they serve. By reducing the rate 
of bingo duty, the government has created the basis for Rank’s 
increased investment and innovation in the bingo sector and 
Rank has committed to a programme of further investment 
and job creation in its bingo clubs as a direct consequence of 
the reduction in duty. For further detail on investments made 
in the year refer to Mecca’s operating review on pages 30 to 31.
In Budget 2014 it was also conﬁ rmed that remote gambling 
would be taxed on a place of consumption basis from 
1 December 2014. Tax at 15% is now payable on any gambling 
revenue generated from consumers in the UK, which is the 
overwhelming majority of the Group’s digital revenue.
Spain
In 2011, the Spanish government invited online operators to 
apply for remote gaming licences and introduced tax changes 
which levied gaming duty on a place of consumption basis. 
Remote gaming duty was introduced at a rate of 25% of 
revenue. This differs from the taxation of land-based 
businesses, which although taxed at similar rates (of between 
12% to 25%), are taxed on stakes received rather than revenue 
generated. Rank currently does not generate online revenue 
in Spain.

UK £159.6m

Belgium
The Belgian government introduced a taxation and licensing 
framework for online gaming companies in 2011. Companies 
may only apply for an online gaming licence in Belgium if 
they already hold a land-based gaming licence and are subject 
to remote gaming duty at a rate of 11%. Rank holds two digital 
licences that it allows two third party operators to use in 
exchange for a revenue share.

 THE RANK GROUP PLC: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015  41 VAT claims
Since 2006, Rank has invested signiﬁ cant resource in pursuing 
litigation to reclaim overpaid VAT. In all, Rank has received 
£284.2 million of VAT and interest relating to this litigation. 
Following ﬁ ve rulings in Rank’s favour from the UK courts, 
Rank’s case was referred to the Court of Justice of the European 
Union (“ECJ”). The decision of the ECJ was published on 
10 November 2011. The decision led HM Revenue & Customs 
to concede the bingo element of Rank’s claims. However, 
the element of Rank’s claim relating to amusement machines 
(totalling £30.7m) was referred back to the UK courts. Rank’s 
case was heard at the Court of Appeal in May 2013 with the 
decision being found in HMRC’s favour. Following the Court 
of Appeal decision, Rank repaid amounts to HMRC in respect 
of the claim.
Rank was granted permission to appeal to The Supreme Court 
and this hearing took place in April 2015. The Supreme Court 
released its decision in July 2015, in which it decided in favour 
of HMRC and the decision, which is ﬁ nal, concludes this 
litigation. Rank had fully provided for the amounts to be 
repaid in the 2013/14 and consequently the decision has 
no impact on Rank’s ﬁ nancial performance or balance 
sheet strength in 2014/15 or future periods.
At present, HMRC accepts that taxpayers are entitled to receive 
interest on repayments caused by HMRC’s error. Such interest 
is calculated on a simple basis. However, there is ongoing 
litigation that such interest should be calculated on a 
compound basis. The UK High Court (having been referred 
back by the Court of Justice of the European Union (“ECJ”)) 
found in favour of the litigant and HMRC appealed the 
decision. The appeal was heard at the Court of Appeal in 
March 2015, with the Court of Appeal releasing its decision in 
May 2015, in which it agreed with the High Court’s decision. 
HMRC are, however, likely to seek permission to appeal to 
The Supreme Court. Rank has made a protective claim for 
compound interest, which if successful could be worth in 
excess of £100m. It is possible that Rank may be required 
to take separate litigation even if the litigant is ultimately 
successful as HMRC consider that the existing judgment 
is not clear enough or general enough to be applied to 
other claimants.

Corporate governance
 “The board is committed to

managed and that rigorous and 
transparent procedures allow 
this to happen.”
Ian Burke, 
Chairman
Focus in 2014/15
Throughout the year under review, our board agenda has 
been structured to allow for regular updates on our principal 
strategic initiatives. Technology has been a particular focus 
during the year, with several presentations from our chief 
information ofﬁ cer and his direct reports on IT strategy 
and cyber risk.
The introduction by the UK Gambling Commission of the 
requirement for an annual assurance statement has been the 
subject of board brieﬁ ngs during the year and was the key 
focus of a discussion with representatives of the UK Gambling 
Commission and the majority of the Rank board in June 2015.
Compliance with the licensing objectives has also been a 
particular focus following the UK Gambling Commission 
bringing to our attention deﬁ ciencies in the application of 
our policies and procedures relating to anti money laundering 
and responsible gambling. I and all my board colleagues are 
fully committed to the licensing objectives and we need to 
ensure that we embed a culture into our company that takes 
these issues seriously at all levels. Enhanced due diligence and 
responsible gambling will be a continued focus on individual 
board member casino visits. We are aiming for the highest 
standards in keeping with our commitment to upholding 
the licensing objectives.
Dear shareholder
We are reporting this year against the 2012 version of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code (“the Code”) and related 
guidance. Other than Code provision A.3.1 (chief executive 
not to become chairman), Rank has since 1 June 2015 been 
in full compliance with the Code. The board continues to be 
of the view that it is in the best interests of all shareholders 
that I continue in the role of non-executive chairman 
notwithstanding that I was previously chief executive. 
Appointment of senior independent director
On 5 May 2015 we announced the appointment of Chris Bell 
as senior independent director with effect from 1 June 2015. 
The search for a senior independent director was led by me 
with the assistance of Owen O’Donnell and with support 
from other members of the nominations committee. 
Mr Bell’s is an excellent appointment for Rank as he has over 
20 years’ experience in the gambling industry. Since Mr Bell’s 
appointment on 1 June 2015 and his replacement of me on 
the board’s audit committee, Rank is now in compliance with 
Code provisions A.4.1 (requirement for a senior independent 
director) and C.3.1 (audit committee to comprise at least three 
independent non-executive directors). Governance
50  THE RANK GROUP PLC: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015
Diversity
The board, supported by the nominations committee, 
continues to value diversity in its broadest sense when 
considering non-executive director appointments. In addition 
to considering gender and ethnicity, the board will look to 
achieve the appropriate balance of skills, experience and 
knowledge of the gambling industry as a whole. The board 
retains its aspiration stated in last year’s report to increase the 
proportion of women on the board to 25% by 30 June 2016. 
Details of the gender breakdown of directors, senior 
management and the Group as a whole can be found 
on page 34 of our strategic report. 
Leadership and effectiveness
This year we conducted an independent external review of the 
effectiveness of the board for the ﬁ rst time. Further details of 
that review can be found on pages 53 and 54. The board agreed 
a number of actions following the review and areas of focus 
over the coming year will be individual director evaluation and 
development, the board’s engagement with strategy and the 
development of leadership.
Relations with shareholders
The board as a whole takes responsibility for ensuring that 
satisfactory dialogue with shareholders takes place. During 
the year the board, through its remuneration committee 
chairman, conducted an extensive engagement with its largest 
shareholders, further details relating to which can be found 
on page 76. All shareholders are welcome to attend our annual 
general meeting which is taking place at 11am on Thursday, 
15 October 2015 at our Maidenhead headquarters.
Conclusion
I would like to take this opportunity to extend my gratitude 
to all my board colleagues for their contributions this year. We 
have had some excellent debates conducted with openness and 
constructive challenge. I would also like to thank in particular 
Shaa Wasmund, who will not be seeking re-election at the 
forthcoming annual general meeting, for her contribution 
since she joined the board in November 2012.

Introduction

 ~ board effectiveness;
 ~ audit committee;
 ~ nominations committee; and
 ~ ﬁ nance committee.
The report of the remuneration committee is set out separately 
in the directors’ remuneration report on pages 62 to 77.
Compliance with the Code
Save in relation to Code provisions A.3.1 (chief executive 
not to become chairman), A.4.1 (requirement for a senior 
independent director) and C.3.1 (audit committee to comprise 
at least three independent non-executive directors), the board 
conﬁ rms that it has complied with the provisions of the Code 
throughout the year ended 30 June 2015. Please see pages 52 
and 55 for an explanation as to why the board has not 
complied with Code provisions A.3.1, A.4.1 and C.3.1. 
This corporate governance statement forms part of the 
directors’ report and accordingly is approved by the board 
and signed on its behalf by the company secretary. Certain 
parts of this corporate governance statement have been 
reviewed by the Company’s auditors, Ernst & Young LLP, 
for compliance with the Code, to the extent required. 
In this corporate governance statement the following 
abbreviations are used:

Insurance and indemnity
The Company has arranged insurance cover and indemniﬁ es 
directors in respect of legal action against them to the extent 
permitted by law. Neither applies in situations where a director 
has acted fraudulently or dishonestly.
Conﬂ icts of interest
The directors have a statutory duty to avoid conﬂ icts of 
interest. In accordance with our articles of association, we 
have adopted a policy and procedure for managing and, if 
appropriate, authorising actual or potential conﬂ icts of interest.
Directors are required to disclose any other new appointments 
before agreeing to take them on, so that any conﬂ icts of 
interest can be identiﬁ ed and addressed.
The board also assesses conﬂ icts of interest before making any 
new appointments.
Division of responsibilities
When in 2014 Mr Burke indicated that he would like to 
retire from executive management of the business, the board 
wished to retain the established line of communication with 
Guoco and was pleased when Mr Burke agreed to become 
non-executive chairman on the appointment of Mr Birch as 
chief executive on 6 May 2014. The board is aware that this 
is not in compliance with Code provision A.3.1, but believes 
it to be in the best interests of all shareholders at this time.
There is a clear division of responsibilities for the chairman 
and chief executive.
Chairman
The chairman is charged to:
 ~ manage the business of the board, preside over meetings 
and seek prompt and appropriate decisions;
 ~ work with the company secretary to ensure directors receive 
accurate and clear information for the proper execution of 
their duties;
 ~ oversee effective communication with shareholders;
 ~ keep the Group’s progress and development under review;
 ~ ensure the chief executive’s Group objectives, policies and 
strategies are consistent with lasting shareholder value;
 ~ evaluate the board and its committees; and
 ~ ensure the Group’s governance is effective and in line 
with best practice.
Chief executive
The chief executive’s role is to:
 ~ manage and promote the Group’s long-term proﬁ table 
development;
 ~ exercise stewardship of intellectual property, human and 
ﬁ nancial resources and ensure that the relevant policies 
are implemented;
 ~ plan strategy and prepare objectives and policies for 
board approval;
 ~ ensure action is taken to achieve strategies, objectives and 
policies, as approved by the board;
 ~ ensure objectives, policies and strategies are adopted for 
each Group business, that appropriate budgets are set for 
them individually, that their performance is monitored, 
and that guidance is given when needed;
 ~ take responsibility for Group health and safety policies;
 ~ make sure the Group complies with all relevant legislation; and
 ~ lead ongoing communication with employees.
Non-executive directors
The directors are satisﬁ ed that there are proper procedures in 
place to ensure that:
 ~ they are receiving accurate and clear information for the 
proper execution of their duties;
 ~ the Group’s objectives, policies and strategies are consistent 
with enhancing shareholder value;
 ~ they are able to keep the Group’s progress and development 
under review;
 ~ they have an opportunity to challenge constructively, and 
help develop, proposals on strategy;
 ~ there are effective communications with all shareholders; and
 ~ the Group’s governance is effective.
Senior independent director
As senior independent director since 1 June 2015, Chris Bell 
is available to talk with shareholders who have questions 
or concerns. Led by the senior independent director, the 
non-executive directors met and reviewed the chairman’s 
performance without him being present.
The Company was without a senior independent director 
from the resignation of Colin Child on 18 March 2014 to 
the appointment of Chris Bell with effect from 1 June 2015. 
The Company was therefore not in compliance with Code 
provision A.4.1 for 11 out of the 12 months of the year 
under review. 
Effectiveness
The composition of the board
Size and structure
The nominations committee keeps the board’s size and 
structure under review. The nominations committee is of the 
view that the board is well balanced, providing a collective 
competence to suit the Group’s developing needs and an 
appropriate blend of executive and non-executive skill. We 
believe that all our directors are suitably qualiﬁ ed to help 
steer and challenge Group strategy.
More than half of our board excluding the chairman 
is independent:

board meeting
Information and support
Assisted by the company secretary, the chairman is responsible 
for ensuring that directors receive accurate and timely 
information on all relevant matters. 
The directors receive a monthly report of current and forecast 
trading results and treasury positions, as well as updates on 
shareholder views. 
A rolling programme of items sets the agenda for board 
discussion. This is regularly reviewed and updated to cover 
topical issues and developments.
Comprehensive brieﬁ ng papers on substantive agenda items 
are circulated at least ﬁ ve working days before meetings where 
possible. These contain detailed background information, 
thus freeing time for informed debate.
We operate an open-door policy between the board and 
the management team. Members of the management team 
also make regular board presentations to ensure a ﬂ ow of 
operational information reaches the directors in a timely way.
All directors have access to the advice and services of the 
company secretary and, if required, may take independent 
advice and/or professional development at the 
Company’s expense.
Evaluation
An independent external review of the effectiveness of the 
board was conducted this year by Dr Tracy Long of Boardroom 
Review Limited. Neither Dr Long nor Boardroom Review 
Limited provides other services to the Group or has any other 
connection with the Group. The evaluation was conducted 
over a period of three months including interviews with each 
of the directors and the company secretary, observation of a 
board meeting and a review of selected board papers. 
The principal terms and conditions of appointment for each 
director are set out on pages 67 to 68 and pages 71 to 74, and 
their interests in Rank shares are detailed on page 74. 
Board diversity
During the period under review, the nominations committee 
has continued to consider the issue of diversity in the context 
of the board and is mindful of the beneﬁ ts that diversity brings 
to the board. The board is committed to improving further its 
gender diversity and to ensuring that all appointments are 
made regardless of gender. Details of the gender breakdown of 
directors, senior management and the Group as a whole can be 
found on page 34 of our strategic report.
Committees
The composition and chairmanship of our board committees 
are considered annually and have been considered during the 
period under review. 
Commitment
The terms of appointment of non-executive directors are 
outlined on page 68 of the directors’ remuneration report. 
All non-executive directors are required to disclose their other 
signiﬁ cant commitments both before appointment and 
following subsequent changes so that the board can satisfy 
itself that each of the directors has sufﬁ cient time to allocate 
to the Company to discharge his responsibilities effectively.
Neither Henry Birch nor Clive Jennings currently holds any 
directorships outside the Rank Group. Executive directors are 
not permitted to take up non-executive directorships outside 
the Group. 
Development
Induction
During the period under review, one new non-executive 
director was appointed to the board. The non-executive 
director was given a comprehensive induction programme, 
which included meetings with senior management and site 
visits accompanied by the ﬁ nance directors of the casino and 
bingo businesses. 
Skills and knowledge
All directors are given regular written brieﬁ ngs with regard to 
matters affecting the Group’s businesses, such as the political 
and regulatory environment. Additionally, at the board’s 
request, the Group’s auditor keeps the board abreast of key 
impact items such as political and regulatory initiatives with 
regard to narrative reporting, executive remuneration, going 
concern and the role of the audit committee.
Directors are invited to identify to the company secretary or 
human resources director any desired skills and knowledge 
enhancements that they require so that appropriate training 
can be arranged.
Additionally, once a year, the directors have an opportunity 
to review and agree their respective training and development 
needs during their one-on-one meetings with the chairman.

The review was designed to help the board prepare for the 
future, by building on existing strengths, and identifying and 
preparing for the challenges ahead. The review considered 
the balance, skills and experience of the board and focused 
on three key aspects: board environment, the work of the 
board and use of time.
Following completion of the review, the board received a 
discussion document outlining an independent view of the 
board’s strengths and future challenges. Dr Long also discussed 
the ﬁ ndings of the evaluation individually with each director, 
the company secretary and the performance of each director 
with the chairman. Dr Long then presented her discussion 
document to the February 2015 board meeting. The board 
considered and discussed Dr Long’s observations and 
recommendations following which a number of actions were 
agreed for incorporation into the way that the board would 
operate during the remainder of 2015 and beyond. Areas of 
focus over the year will be individual director evaluation and 
development, the board’s engagement with strategy, and the 
development of leadership.
Additionally, in June 2015 the chairman conducted 
individual interviews with each board member to discuss their 
contributions during the year. The non-executive directors 
met privately to discuss the effectiveness of the board and its 
committees during the year and agreed that, overall, the board 
had functioned effectively during the period under review and 
that its committees continued to discharge their duties in line 
with their respective terms of reference.
The chairman together with two non-executive directors 
evaluated the performance of the chief executive by means 
of a questionnaire and meeting. The outcome was then fed 
back to and discussed with the other non-executive directors. 
The non-executive directors also met privately without the 
chairman present to review the performance of the chairman. 
Re-election
All new directors must stand for election at the ﬁ rst annual 
general meeting after their appointment and, thereafter, at 
intervals of no more than three years. Non-executive directors 
are engaged for an initial period of three years and must stand 
for election and re-appointment in the same way. Rank’s 
articles of association require one third of serving directors 
to retire annually.
Chris Bell was appointed to the board since the last annual 
general meeting and is therefore required to submit himself 
for election at the forthcoming annual general meeting on 
15 October 2015.
The Company complies with the Code’s requirement for 
annual re-election of directors of FTSE 350 companies. 
Therefore all other directors will submit themselves for 
re-election at the forthcoming annual general meeting 
with the exception of Shaa Wasmund. Ms Wasmund will 
be retiring from the board with effect from the conclusion 
of the forthcoming annual general meeting.
Relations with shareholders
Dialogue with shareholders
The board as a whole takes responsibility for ensuring that 
satisfactory dialogue with shareholders takes place. As at 
30 June 2015, 56.09% of our shares were held by our majority 
shareholder, Guoco, and a further 36.84% were held by 20 
institutional shareholders.
Given that Rank is a 56.09% subsidiary of Guoco, the chief 
executive and other members of Rank’s executive management 
team meet with representatives of Guoco four times a year 
to discuss business performance and other issues that could 
impact their ﬁ nancial statements.
We speak with our institutional shareholders and city 
analysts through a programme of investor relations and regular 
meetings with principal shareholders conducted by our chief 
executive, ﬁ nance director and director of investor relations. 
All directors receive reports to keep them in touch with 
shareholder opinion. During the period under review, a total 
of 48 meetings with 41 shareholders was attended by one or 
more of the chief executive and ﬁ nance director. 
Formal brieﬁ ngs on shareholder opinion are circulated to 
the board after presentation of the Company’s interim and 
annual results.
The principal method of communicating with all our 
shareholders is via our corporate website, www.rank.com. 
Information can be provided in paper format but only when 
shareholders speciﬁ cally request this.
Constructive use of the annual general meeting
All shareholders are welcome to attend our annual general 
meeting (“AGM”). Private investors are encouraged to 
ask questions. The chairman and chairmen of the audit 
and remuneration committees are all present. 
Shareholders are invited to vote on the formal resolutions 
contained in the notice of meeting, which is published at least 
20 working days beforehand. The business presentation, voting 
results and a summary of the questions and answers are made 
available at www.rank.com, or in printed format on request. 
Shareholders may also use electronic means to vote – or 
appoint a proxy to vote on their behalf – at the annual 
and other general meetings of the Company.
Next AGM
The 2015 AGM will be held on 15 October 2015 and the full 
text of the notice of meeting, together with explanatory notes, 
is set out in a separate document at: www.rank.com/en/

Role of the audit committee
The audit committee assists the board in reviewing and 
maintaining internal controls, the management of risk 
and our compliance with the law and regulation.
It has responsibility for and reviews the effectiveness of the 
Group’s internal audit function.
It also assesses the integrity of all public ﬁ nancial statements 
before their submission to the board, ensuring we present a 
fair, balanced and understandable assessment of the Group’s 
ongoing position and prospects. 
Any changes in accounting policies are authorised by 
the committee, which also reviews the objectivity and 
effectiveness of our external auditor every year.
The committee oversees the Company’s internal code of 
conduct and monitors our whistleblowing procedures 
through which employees may, in conﬁ dence, raise concerns 
about possible improprieties in areas of ﬁ nancial reporting, 
ﬁ nancial control and other ethical matters. 
The committee is regularly updated on accounting and 
legislative changes through brieﬁ ng papers from the auditor, 
ﬁ nance director and others.
The committee’s terms of reference are available from the 
Company’s website at: www.rank.com/en/investors/corporate-
governance/terms-of-reference.html, or by writing to the 
company secretary.
Audit committee membership and meetings
Since 1 June 2015 the audit committee has consisted of three 
independent non-executive directors. However, following the 
resignation of Colin Child on 18 March 2014, the Company’s 
chairman joined the committee on a temporary basis pending 
the recruitment of a new independent non-executive director. 
That was in breach of Code provision C.3.1 which requires 
the audit committee to consist of at least three independent 
non-executive directors.
The board is satisﬁ ed that the committee has recent and 
relevant ﬁ nancial experience. 
A rolling agenda and topical items determine the committee’s 
discussions. The committee met formally three times in the 
period under review.
At the invitation of the audit committee chairman, the chief 
executive, ﬁ nance director, company secretary, director of 
group ﬁ nancial control and director of internal audit normally 
attend committee meetings, as does the external auditor. Other 
directors are encouraged to attend at least one committee 
meeting a year at which the auditor is present.
The internal and external auditors also meet the 
committee without executive directors and other 
employees being present.

56  THE RANK GROUP PLC: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015
To maintain control and direction over strategic, ﬁ nancial, 
operational and compliance issues, the board has put in place 
formally deﬁ ned lines of responsibility and delegation 
of authority. 
Established procedures are geared to identify, evaluate and 
manage signiﬁ cant risks and to monitor the Group’s businesses 
and performance.
This framework is reviewed annually and is designed to 
safeguard shareholders’ investments and the Group’s assets, 
while ensuring that proper accounting records are maintained. 
Senior management is responsible for making sure that 
controls and procedures are enforced and that the board is 
informed of any risks and control issues that arise.
Financial control: there is a comprehensive system for 
reporting ﬁ nancial results to the board, a budgeting process 
incorporating an approved budget and bi-annual re-forecasts. 
The chief executive and ﬁ nance director hold monthly review 
meetings with brand managing directors and their respective 
directors of ﬁ nance.
Financial reporting control: detailed policies and 
procedures are in place to ensure the accuracy and reliability 
of ﬁ nancial reporting. 
Strategic control: the board reviews the Group’s strategic plans 
annually and regularly reviews strategic progress.
Operational control: our procedures are laid down in detailed 
manuals and reinforced by employee training. Each business 
unit carries out a monthly self-audit to test key controls and 
report weaknesses to operational management.
Compliance control: Across the Group we have teams whose 
responsibility it is to ensure day-to-day adherence to all 
legislation to which our operations are subject, including 
gambling, anti money laundering and health and safety. 
Senior executives and the internal audit team are responsible 
for monitoring overall compliance. They report to the audit 
committee and the board. In light of the deﬁ ciencies in the 
application of the Group’s policies and procedures relating 
to anti money laundering and responsible gambling that were 
brought to our attention by the UK Gambling Commission, 
the board has commissioned an externally-led review of our 
anti money laundering and responsible gambling controls to 
ensure that they are ﬁ t for purpose.

Risk management
As part of its risk oversight role, the board as a whole, 
including the audit committee, satisﬁ es itself that the 
necessary steps are taken to foster a culture of risk-adjusted 
decision-making throughout the Group. The board strives 
to ensure that risk management is an integral component of 
the Group’s corporate strategy, culture and value generation 
process. The board’s view is that risk management should be 
neither an impediment to the conduct of business nor a mere 
supplement to the Group’s overall compliance programme.
The risk management process is reviewed by the audit 
committee on behalf of the board and monitored regularly 
by the Group’s risk committee which comprises the chief 
executive, ﬁ nance director, company secretary, chief 
information ofﬁ cer and director of internal audit. Other 
employees attend meetings of the risk committee by 
invitation, as appropriate, depending on the speciﬁ c agenda 
items to be discussed at the meeting. The risk committee 
meets monthly and its primary purpose is to:
 ~ review the corporate risk register;
 ~ carry out ‘deep-dive’ reviews into speciﬁ c departments’ 
and functions’ risk registers; and
 ~ provide a forum to remedy lack of progress in making 
agreed risk-mitigation actions happen.
Key areas of focus for the risk committee during the year 
under review are set out on page 21 of the strategic report.
Compliance with the Bribery Act 2010 and HM Treasury 
Financial Sanctions forms part of the general risks and 
internal controls reported to the board. Our audit committee 
also reviews management’s bi-annual reports on anti money 
laundering, internal and external fraud, whistleblowing, 
code of conduct and inadvertent breaches of legislation. 
During the year the audit committee has also continued to 
review progress against management’s information security 
improvement plan. 
Internal control framework
Our system of internal control is designed to manage rather 
than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives, 
and provides reasonable, not absolute, assurance against 
material misstatement or loss. It controls, rather than 
eliminates, any human error, deliberate misconduct or 
uncertain events.   THE RANK GROUP PLC: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015  57
The executive directors and senior management meet 
regularly with representatives from the businesses to address 
ﬁ nancial, human resource, risk management and other 
control issues.
At its meetings in the year to 30 June 2015 the audit 
committee examined the effectiveness of the Group’s 
approach to internal control by reviewing changes to 
controls made during the year; approving a revised 2014/15 
internal operational audit plan, a revised corporate and 
systems audit cycle; and reviewing the structure of the 
internal audit department and the level of internal audit 
resource. The committee also reviewed action plans to 
address failings or weaknesses identiﬁ ed in the Group’s 
system of internal control.
This process has been in place during the period and up to the 
date of approval of this annual report and ﬁ nancial statements. 
It has been reviewed by the board and meets the Financial 
Reporting Council’s internal control guidance to directors.
Internal audit
The audit committee has responsibility for the internal audit 
function and the director of internal audit reports directly 
to the chairman of the audit committee. Our internal audit 
team provides an objective and continuous stream of data 
and opinion on risk management and control. To avoid bias, 
it is entirely independent of the business operations under 
audit and line management is to the chairman of the audit 
committee. The audit committee agrees the annual audit plan 
and reviews audit reports produced by the internal audit team. 
The scope of the audit coverage is deﬁ ned by the audit 
committee and covers all systems, procedures and activities 
of all operations, departments and functions within the 
Group, including projects, policy developments, ﬁ nancial 
and non-ﬁ nancial processes. 
The internal audit team seeks to determine whether the 
system of risk management, control and governance processes, 
as designed and operated by management, is adequate and 
functioning in such a manner as to ensure that:
 ~ risks are appropriately identiﬁ ed and managed in line with 
the Company’s risk appetite;
 ~ operations are run with sufﬁ cient and adequate controls 
and in an efﬁ cient and effective manner;
 ~ signiﬁ cant ﬁ nancial, managerial and operating information 
is accurate, reliable and timely;
 ~ employee actions are in compliance with policies, standards, 
procedures, and applicable laws and regulations; and
 ~ relevant laws, rules and regulations are complied with 
in the operation of the business.
To embed control further, the scores used by internal audit 
to monitor each business unit’s controls performance also 
affect operational management bonuses. 
The director of internal audit makes regular presentations 
to the audit committee and reporting includes comparative 
and trend analysis. During the period under review the audit 
committee had three closed sessions with the director of 
internal audit without executive management being present.
Code of conduct
Rank has an employee code of conduct that sets out our values 
and principles and guides everyone’s behaviour. Adherence to 
the code is important. It upholds our reputation and 
relationships, inside and outside the Company.
The audit committee is responsible for monitoring 
management reports on employee conduct, including 
our whistleblowing procedures.
Whistleblowing
Rank aims to maintain a culture of openness, honesty 
and opposition to fraud, corruption and unethical business 
conduct. It is Rank’s policy to implement and maintain 
procedures that promote ethical business conduct and 
reduce the risk of fraud and other irregularities, enabling 
early detection, investigation and reporting. Rank has a fraud 
and unethical business conduct whistleblowing policy which 
sets out the ways in which employees can voice their concerns 
about suspected fraud, corruption or unethical business 
conduct. During the period under review two frauds came to 
light within Grosvenor’s retail casino business in circumstances 
where it would appear that others not directly involved must 
potentially have had suspicions that they never raised with 
anybody. This has led management and the committee to 
question whether Rank’s whistleblowing policy is sufﬁ ciently 
effective. Although reports are made under the Group’s 
whistleblowing policy, the matters which are the subject of 
the reports are rarely related to fraud or unethical business 
conduct, and are more often than not related to human 
resource issues. Managers in the businesses are being consulted 
as to how best to address the cultural resistance to using the 
whistleblowing policy for matters for which the policy is 
intended. Once the feedback has been received, where 
appropriate, changes to the policy and its communication 
will be made to see whether this encourages a better quality 
of whistleblowing.
Financial reporting and signiﬁ cant ﬁ nancial issues
The committee assesses whether suitable accounting policies 
have been adopted and whether management has made 
appropriate estimates and judgements. The committee 
reviews accounting papers prepared by management which 
provide details of the main ﬁ nancial reporting judgements. 
The committee also reviews reports by the external auditor 
on the full year and half year results which highlight any 
issues with respect to the work undertaken on the full year 
audit and the half year review.
Signiﬁ cant accounting issues considered by the committee 
during the year included:
 ~ EBITDA multiples and discount rates applied for 
impairments;
 ~ impairment review of intangible assets and property, 
plant and equipment;
 ~ review of provisions, including those in relation to 
property leases and indirect tax;
 ~ review of ongoing direct tax issues;
 ~ treatment of exceptional items; and
 ~ contingent assets and liabilities. Governance
58  THE RANK GROUP PLC: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015
Audit committee activity in 2014/15
In addition to those items detailed under internal control, risk 
management and ﬁ nancial reporting and signiﬁ cant ﬁ nancial 
issues, during the year under review the committee’s business 
has included the following:
 ~ full and half-year results;
 ~ principal judgemental accounting matters affecting 
the Group;
 ~ ﬁ nance systems strategy;
 ~ external audit plans and reports including auditor 
observations and recommendations as a result of controls 
testing completed for the purposes of the 2013/14 and 
2014/15 audits;
 ~ internal audit plans and key reports;
 ~ information security and cyber risk;
 ~ external and internal theft and fraud;
 ~ anti money laundering;
 ~ litigation; 
 ~ whistleblowing and code of conduct reports; and
 ~ impact of the revised UK Corporate Governance Code 
(September 2014 edition) which will apply to the 
Company with effect from its 2015/16 ﬁ nancial year.
Signiﬁ cant ﬁ nancial judgements
Before recommending the half-year and full-year ﬁ nancial 
statements to the board for approval, the committee reviewed 
the following key accounting issues that rely on signiﬁ cant 
ﬁ nancial judgements.
Impairments – for goodwill and indeﬁ nite life assets not 
subject to amortisation, the Group performs an annual 
impairment review. In addition, the Group also reviews 
assets that are subject to amortisation or depreciation for 
events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the 
carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating unit may 
not be recoverable. The Group considers each venue to 
be a cash-generating unit and therefore the review covers 
in excess of 150 individual cash-generating units.
The committee reviewed management’s impairment review 
process including, where applicable, the cash ﬂ ow projections 
and discount rates used to derive a value in use. This included 
considering the impairment reversal arising in Spain of £1.6m 
where performance at the club in Girona has seen a sustained 
performance recovery following the closure of a competitor.
The committee was of the view that the net impairment 
reversal recognised of £1.9m was appropriate. Further details 
of the impairment charges and reversals are disclosed in note 4.
The committee also considered the impairment review 
undertaken in relation to the investment in subsidiary 
undertakings held by the Company, including the 
appropriateness of the key inputs into the valuation 
model. The committee was of the view that the impairment 
reversal of £259.9m was appropriate.
Property lease provisions – at both the half and the full year, 
the committee considered the Group’s approach to property 
lease provisions, the discount rates applied and management’s 
recommendations, in order to satisfy itself how management 
came to its best estimate of property lease obligations.
The committee noted that the Group has a number of property 
leasehold contracts and was of the view that appropriate 
provision had been made against those property leases where 
the unavoidable costs exceed the expected economic beneﬁ t 
expected to be derived from the property. Further details of the 
property lease provision held are disclosed in note 22 and the 
exceptional adjustments made in the current year are disclosed 
in note 4.
In addition, the committee was also updated in respect of 
certain property leasehold contracts where the rights and 
obligations but not the legal titles have been transferred to 
third parties such that the Group remains potentially liable 
in the event of default by the third party. Should default occur 
then the Group would normally have recourse to one or more 
guarantor entities. These leasehold contracts include 11 
remaining property leases, with lease durations of between 
17 months and 98 years and a current annual obligation 
(net of sub-let income) of approximately £1.1m, that were 
transferred concurrent to the £211m sale and leaseback in 
2006. The committee noted the risk associated with the 
transfer of such property leasehold contracts but that the 
Group has not to date been notiﬁ ed of any default, or 
intention to default, in respect of the transferred leases. 
Further details of this contingent liability are disclosed in note 32.
Indirect tax provisions – the committee received and 
considered an update paper covering the Group’s indirect tax 
issues, including the Group’s various VAT claims, at both the 
half and the full year. The committee noted the adverse 
decision of the Supreme Court in favour of HMRC regarding 
claims for overpaid VAT on certain types of amusement 
machines between 2002 and 2005 but that a full provision 
has been made for amounts not yet repaid.
The committee was of the view that management’s best 
estimate of the liability was appropriate. Details of the 
indirect tax liability recognised are disclosed in note 22.
Direct tax – the committee received and considered an update 
paper covering the Group’s ongoing direct tax issues at both 
the half and full year. These issues cover both discontinued 
operations with historic tax audits and continuing operations 
where tax returns submitted have been, or are likely to be, 
challenged by the relevant tax authority. The committee 
considered the £16.9m release from income tax payable 
following the successful conclusion of a transfer pricing 
dispute relating to a discontinued operation in an overseas 
jurisdiction during the year. The committee was of the view 
that the release and the disclosure of a potential further refund 
of between £2.5m and £4.0m in respect of amounts previously 
paid as a contingent asset were appropriate. 
The committee was of the view that management’s best 
estimate of the liability for the remaining issues was 
appropriate. See note 18 for details of the direct tax 
liability recognised.
Contingent assets and liabilities – the Group, as noted in 
the areas of signiﬁ cant judgement above, has had to consider 
the accounting treatment of a number of potential assets and 
liabilities. This requires management to apply judgement in 
assessing the probability of occurrence or non-occurrence of 
one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the 
control of the Company.
Corporate governance – continued  THE RANK GROUP PLC: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015  59
The audit committee receives tri-annual updates from 
management, incorporating legal advice as appropriate, 
on the accounting treatment for potential assets and liabilities 
in relation to disclosure or recognition. The committee is of 
the view that management has appropriately treated such 
items in the ﬁ nancial statements. Details of the contingent 
assets and liabilities disclosed are included in notes 31 and 
32 respectively. 
The audit committee also considers whether these signiﬁ cant 
ﬁ nancial judgements should be classiﬁ ed as exceptional.
Principal risks and uncertainties
Details of the Group’s principal risks and uncertainties, 
and what we are doing to address them, can be found on 
pages 21 to 23 of the strategic report. Additionally, details 
of the ﬁ nancial risks that the Group faces can be found in 
note 20 to the ﬁ nancial statements.
Committee evaluation
The committee’s performance during the period under review 
was assessed via conﬁ dential questionnaires with committee 
members and other individuals who support its work. Results 
were then reviewed by the committee chairman and discussed 
with the board. The board agreed that the committee 
continued to perform effectively.
Assessment of effectiveness of external audit process
Agreement on how best to assess the effectiveness of the 
external audit process was discussed between the audit 
committee chairman, the ﬁ nance director, company secretary 
and director of group ﬁ nancial control and a proposal agreed. 
That proposal was put to the other audit committee members 
for agreement. Part of the effectiveness of the external audit 
process was assessed by the use of a questionnaire which posed 
questions in relation to different aspects of the external audit 
process. Those individuals employed by Rank most actively 
involved with the day-to-day aspects of the audit provided 
responses to certain questions asked of them. The views of 
Rank employees involved with the audit were considered, 
discussed and summarised and provided to audit committee 
members for discussion amongst themselves. 
In addition to a private meeting between the audit committee 
chair and the external audit partner, the committee met with 
the auditor following each audit committee meeting in a 
closed session without executive directors to assess the 
objectivity and accuracy of ﬁ nancial reporting and to hear 
any other observations that the auditor had to make.
Audit tendering
The committee has noted the requirements regarding 
audit tender and rotation of the audit engagement partner. 
The Company’s external audit was most recently tendered 
during 2009, resulting in a change of external auditors and 
the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP at the Company’s 
annual general meeting on 22 April 2010. There was a change 
of external audit partner following completion of the 30 June 
2014 year-end formalities. The committee will continue to 
give consideration to the timing of the next formal tender in 
the light of the then prevailing regulatory requirements. The 
committee does not anticipate that a tender will be undertaken 
during the 2015/16 ﬁ nancial year. There are no contractual 
obligations that restrict the choice of external auditors.
Auditor
Having reviewed their performance throughout the period, 
our conclusion that Ernst & Young LLP’s effectiveness is 
satisfactory enables us to recommend their reappointment 
for 2014/15.
The auditor, Ernst & Young LLP, is willing to continue in ofﬁ ce 
and a resolution that they be re-appointed at a remuneration 
to be agreed by the audit committee will be proposed at the 
forthcoming annual general meeting.
Relations with external auditor
Our auditor is employed to express an opinion on the ﬁ nancial 
statements. It reviews the systems of internal ﬁ nancial control 
and the data contained in the ﬁ nancial statements to the 
extent necessary to express its opinion. 
It discusses with management the reporting of operational 
results and the ﬁ nancial position of the Group, and presents 
ﬁ ndings to the audit committee.
Information
The directors in ofﬁ ce at the date of this report are not aware 
of any relevant information that has not been made available 
to the auditor and each director has taken steps to be aware 
of all such information and to ensure it is available to the 
Company’s auditor.
Non-audit work
The audit committee oversees the nature and amount of any 
non-audit work undertaken by the auditor to ensure they 
remain independent. Consequently, the committee is 
required to approve in advance all non-audit services 
above a speciﬁ ed value. 
When seeking external accountancy advice in relation to 
non-audit matters, the Group’s policy is to invite competitive 
tenders where appropriate. It is also the Group’s policy to 
balance the need to maintain audit independence with the

Appointments to the board
The nominations committee is comprised of the chairman, all 
independent non-executive directors and the chief executive. 
The formal terms of reference of the nominations committee 
are available on our website at www.rank.com/en/investors/
corporate-governance/terms-of-reference.html, or by written 
request to the company secretary. 
The nominations committee is responsible for identifying 
relevant talent and nominating all board appointments with due 
regard for the beneﬁ ts of diversity on the board, including gender.
During the year under review the committee met formally on 
six occasions.
The main issues which the committee discussed during the 
year under review were:
 ~ the search for a senior independent director;
 ~ succession planning;
 ~ chairmanship and membership of board committees;
 ~ board composition; and
 ~ board diversity.
Board and committee composition
The nominations committee keeps the board’s size and 
structure under review. The nominations committee is of the 
view that the board is well balanced, providing a collective 
competence to suit the Group’s developing needs and an 
appropriate blend of executive and non-executive skill. 
We believe that all our directors are suitably qualiﬁ ed to 
help steer and challenge Group strategy.
The composition and chairmanship of our board committees 
are considered annually and have been considered once during 
the period under review. 
Board diversity
During the period under review, the nominations committee 
has continued to consider the issue of diversity (including 
gender diversity) in the context of the board and is mindful 
of the beneﬁ ts that diversity brings to the board. 
The board’s diversity policy is to recruit the best candidate 
having regard to the skills and experience required, but with 
a mind to diversity, including gender diversity. The directors 
have conﬁ rmed their stated aspiration to achieve 25% female 
representation on Rank’s board by 30 June 2016.
Details of the gender breakdown of directors, senior 
management and the Group as a whole can be found 
on page 34 of the strategic report.

Appointment of senior independent director
The key focus of the committee during the year has been to 
identify and recruit a new non-executive director to act as the 
Company’s senior independent director and to join the audit 
committee of the board. For this purpose, the services of an 
external search ﬁ rm, Zygos LLP, were engaged to assist in 
identifying potential candidates. Zygos LLP is independent 
and is a signatory to the ‘Voluntary Code of Conduct’ 
(“VCC”) on gender diversity and best practice. The 
nominations committee appointed a sub-committee 
consisting of the chairman and another non-executive 
director to review the external search ﬁ rm’s long list of 
potential candidates and agree a short list. 
All board members were invited to meet two of the short-
listed candidates and following a further meeting of the 
committee, one candidate, Chris Bell, was recommended to 
the board for appointment. The board was unanimously in 
favour of appointing Chris Bell to the board to act as senior 
independent director and to serve on the audit committee 
of the board and he was so appointed with effect from 1 June 
2015 for an initial term of three years subject to election at 
the forthcoming annual general meeting and thereafter 
subject to re-election at subsequent annual general meetings. 
Re-appointment of a non-executive director
The nominations committee considered the re-appointment 
of Lord Kilmorey as a director. By the time of this year’s 
annual general meeting in October 2015, Lord Kilmorey will 
have served as an independent director for almost three and 
a half years. Lord Kilmorey’s diverse experience in commerce 
and industry, and in Government, are attributes which are of 
signiﬁ cant beneﬁ t to the Rank board and therefore, on the 
recommendation of the nominations committee, the board 
re-appointed Lord Kilmorey until the conclusion of the 
Company’s 2016 annual general meeting (subject to re-
election at the Company’s 2015 annual general meeting).
Senior independent director
As senior independent director since 1 June 2015, 
Chris Bell is available to talk with shareholders who have 
questions or concerns. Led by the senior independent 
director, the non-executive directors met and reviewed 
the chairman’s performance without him being present.

Annual Statement
Introduction
On behalf of the board, I have pleasure in presenting Rank’s 
directors’ remuneration report for the year ended 30 June 
2015. There are two parts to the report:
 ~ The ﬁ rst sets out Rank’s executive remuneration strategy 
and policy which was approved by shareholders on 
22 April 2015 (the “Policy Report”); and
 ~ The second describes how the remuneration policy has 
been implemented during the year ending 30 June 2015 
(the “Annual Remuneration Report”).
The text of the Policy Report is included for ease of reference 
only. At the Company’s forthcoming annual general meeting 
on 15 October 2015, shareholders will be invited to approve 
the Annual Remuneration Report (by way of a non-binding 
advisory vote). 
Performance outcome
The Group has performed strongly in the year, with all brands in 
growth with revenue up 3%, with a like-for-like stabilisation in 
our Mecca venues and strong growth in both our digital brands 
ahead of the implementation of the new digital platform.

Committee activity during the year
The key focus of the committee during the year has been 
to ensure alignment of remuneration policy with the 
Group’s business strategy and to ensure that the Company’s 
remuneration policy continues to be motivating, performance-
related and retention focused. With this in mind the 
committee embarked on a review of the long-term incentive 
arrangements for the senior management team. During 
the ﬁ rst quarter of the current calendar year the committee 
received feedback from shareholders on proposals for a new 
long-term incentive plan. More information on this is set 
out on page 76. Not all shareholders hold the same views on 
executive remuneration and the committee has to balance 
the different perspectives. Above all, the committee needs to 
ensure that the remuneration arrangements enable Rank to 
attract, retain and motivate skilled directors and other senior 
executives of the highest calibre so as to deliver optimal 
returns for shareholders which are sustainable. In conclusion, 
the committee will continue to be mindful of the concerns 
of shareholders and other stakeholders, and welcomes 
shareholder feedback on issues related to executive 
remuneration.

Policy Report
The policy on remuneration of directors (the “Policy”) is set 
out on the following pages and is provided for information 
only. A binding resolution was put to, and approved by, 
shareholders at a general meeting held on 22 April 2015 and 
this report has only been updated to reﬂ ect current director 
appointments, actual director remuneration for 2014/15, the 
approved long-term incentive plan (see pages 72 to 73) and is 
not being put to shareholders at the 2014/15 AGM.
A copy of the approved Remuneration Policy is available at: 
www.rank.com/en/investors/corporate-governance/terms-of-
reference.html
Remuneration and components
The committee reviews the Company’s remuneration 
philosophy and structure each year to ensure that the 
remuneration framework remains effective in supporting the 
Company’s strategic objectives and fairly rewards individuals 
for the contribution that they make to the business, having 
regard to the size and complexity of the Group’s operations 
and the need to motivate and attract employees of the 
highest calibre.
The performance of Rank is dependent upon the quality of its 
directors, senior executives and employees and therefore the 
Group seeks to attract, retain and motivate skilled directors 
and senior executives of the highest calibre, without paying 
more than is necessary. In order to attract such individuals 
the committee needs to ensure that the remuneration packages 
properly reﬂ ect an individual’s duties and responsibilities, 
are appropriate and competitive, sensitive to pay elsewhere 
within the Group and directly linked to performance.
Committee’s approach to setting pay policy
The committee intends that the base salary and total 
remuneration of executive directors should be in line with 
market median. Remuneration is benchmarked against 
rewards available for equivalent roles in suitable comparator 
companies, with the aim of paying neither signiﬁ cantly above 
nor below the median for each element of remuneration at 
par target performance levels.
The committee also considers general pay and employment 
conditions of all employees within the Group and is sensitive 
to these, to prevailing market and economic conditions and 
to governance trends when assessing the level of salaries and 
remuneration packages of executive directors and other 
members of the executive committee. 
The total remuneration package links corporate and individual 
performance with an appropriate balance between short- and 
long-term elements, and ﬁ xed and variable components. 
The policy is designed to incentivise executives to meet the 
Company’s key objectives, and so a signiﬁ cant proportion 
of total remuneration is performance related.
The committee considers that the targets set for the different 
components of performance-related remuneration are both 
appropriate and sufﬁ ciently demanding in the context of the 
business environment and the challenges facing the Group. Governance

Directors’ remuneration report – continued
Future policy table
The key components of executive directors’ remuneration, as applicable from 22 April 2015, are summarised below:
Component
Purpose and link to 
business strategy
Mechanics
Operation and performance framework
Base 
salary
To attract and retain 
skilled, high-calibre 
individuals to 
deliver the Group’s 
strategy.
Base salaries are reviewed annually and are appropriately set to reﬂ ect: 
 ~ the role’s scope, responsibility and accountabilities; 
 ~ market data;
 ~ general rates of increase across the Group; and
 ~ the performance and effectiveness of the individual.
Any increase will take effect on 1 January of the following year.
Insured 
and other 
beneﬁ ts
Insured and other 
beneﬁ ts are offered 
to executive 
directors as part 
of a competitive 
remuneration 
package.
Insured beneﬁ ts comprise private healthcare insurance for executive directors and 
dependants, life assurance and permanent health insurance. 
Other beneﬁ ts comprise a cash car allowance and the fuel cost of all mileage 
(private and business). The amount of the cash car allowance is reviewed 
periodically by the committee in the light of market conditions.
Retirement 
provisions
Rewards sustained 
contribution and 
encourages 
retention.
Executive directors are automatically enrolled in The Rank Group Workplace Pension 
Scheme (the “Pension Scheme”) in accordance with the Company’s obligations under 
the Pensions Act 2008. The Company will contribute into the Pension Scheme at the rate 
of 10% of the executive director’s base salary. If the executive director chooses to opt out 
of his automatic enrolment in the Pension Scheme he is entitled to receive a cash 
allowance of an annual amount equivalent to 10% of basic salary.
Annual 
bonus
Motivates the 
achievement of 
annual strategic, 
ﬁ nancial and 
personal 
performance. 
Rewards individual 
contribution to the 
success of the 
Company.
Rank operates an annual cash bonus scheme in which executive directors participate. 
Under the scheme an annual bonus pool is created based on the return on shareholder 
funds over a one-year period. 
The bonus plan operates on a pool system with sharing rates varying based on performance 
above a threshold. The mechanics of the plan are set by the committee at the start of the year 
with payment made after the year end following the committee’s assessment of performance 
relative to targets. The primary performance measure is the return on shareholder funds, 
as this determines the size of the pool. The allocation of the pool between individuals is at the 
committee’s discretion in light of the achievement of annual ﬁ nancial and strategic goals as 
well as individual performance. A full description of the performance measures in place and 
how this determines the bonus pool will be provided in the Annual Remuneration Report. 
The scheme operates a threshold level of performance below which no bonus is paid. 
However, the resulting pay-out, as a percentage of salary, will vary year-on-year in line 
with bonus pool funding.
Long-term 
incentive 
plan
The long-term 
incentive plan is 
intended to align 
the interests of the 
executive directors 
and shareholders 
through the 
creation of 
shareholder value 
over the long term.
The Rank Group Plc 2010 Long-Term Incentive Plan is currently the only long-term 
equity-based incentive scheme in place for the executive directors and other senior executives. 
Executive directors may receive contingent share awards which have the ability to vest 
after a three-year period based on the achievement of speciﬁ ed performance targets. 
The committee may apply a further holding period to all or part of the award to further 
align directors’ interests with those of shareholders.
The committee will determine measures and targets at the beginning of each cycle to 
ensure continuing alignment with strategy. Performance targets may relate to both ﬁ nancial 
and non-ﬁ nancial measures linked to the Company’s long-term business strategy, including 
but not limited to:
 ~ Group EBITDA;
 ~ Group proﬁ t after tax;
 ~ Group annual active customers;
 ~ Group digital revenue;
 ~ Group ROCE; and
 ~ Strategic objectives of the Group.  THE RANK GROUP PLC: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015  65
Maximum
Ordinarily any increases in executive directors’ 
base salaries will be limited to those received 
by the wider workforce during the year 
(except for reasons of promotion or salary being 
determined to be signiﬁ cantly out of line with 
market median).
The committee retains the discretion to offer relocation assistance in the 
form of an allowance or otherwise to support the movement of executive 
talent across the business. If provided, the committee aims to ensure 
payments are not excessive and support business needs. As such, relocation 
assistance will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis taking into account 
factors such as the individual’s circumstances and the geographies involved, 
meaning that there is no prescribed formula for calculating the level or 
structure of payments.
It is anticipated that the provision of insured 
and other beneﬁ ts will not exceed 10% of salary. 
The committee may exceed this should the cost 
of the beneﬁ ts provided change in accordance 
with market conditions or in the event of the 
payment of relocation assistance.
The committee retains the discretion to honour all contractual pension 
arrangements agreed prior to the application of this Policy. Details of such 
arrangements are disclosed in the Annual Remuneration Report.
For all new appointments the maximum 
pension contribution (deﬁ ned contribution 
or cash supplement) will be 10% of base salary.
Legacy arrangements to be honoured 
(% of salary): FD – 15%
The measures governing the allocation of the pool to executive directors 
will be set and disclosed retrospectively on an annual basis, to the extent 
this is not commercially sensitive.
The annual bonus plan is discretionary and the committee reserves the 
right to adjust payments up or down. Any such adjustment would only 
be in exceptional circumstances which would be outlined in the relevant 
year’s Annual Remuneration Report. Clawback provisions do not apply to 
the annual bonus plan.
To allow the committee to assess the quality of earnings over the year and 
to introduce an element of retention into the scheme, any cash bonuses 
earned by the executive directors will be subject to a six-month deferral 
period and will be paid in the December following the 30 June ﬁ nancial 
year end. 
CEO: 100% of base salary
FD: 80% of base salary
The following amounts will vest in accordance with performance:
There is no threshold level of performance under the plan.
Maximum: 100%
Other points on the vesting schedule will be determined by the committee 
when the performance targets are set.
At the end of the performance period, the committee will have absolute 
discretion to determine the extent to which the awards will vest, if at all, 
on account of underlying company performance. If discretion is applied, 
the level and reasons for its application will be fully disclosed in the 
following year’s Annual Remuneration Report. 
Clawback and malus provisions will apply to awards made under the plan.
Normal maximum per annum award levels 
(% of salary)
CEO: 200%
FD: 133%
An exceptional maximum per annum award 
level of 400% of salary is also effective under 
the policy. The committee does not intend to 
use the exceptional maximum beyond the ﬁ rst 
year of the policy where, for technical reasons, 
a higher maximum is required to implement the 
new long-term incentive plan. In this ﬁ rst year 
the actual value, at grant, of active awards will 
not exceed the normal maximum levels 
speciﬁ ed above. More detail will be available 
in the Annual Remuneration Report. Governance

Additional notes to the Policy table
Setting of performance measures and targets 
The committee reviews and selects performance measures 
at the beginning of each award cycle under both the annual 
bonus plan and the long-term incentive plan, being informed 
by the short- and long-term priorities of the Group at the time. 
The committee considers the Group’s key performance 
indicators and strategic business plan when selecting measures 
and calibrating targets. Details of these are included in the 
Annual Report each year. Factors that the committee may 
consider include the benchmark return rate on shareholder 
funds, strategic plan, the annual budget, analysts’ forecasts, 
economic conditions, individuals’ areas of responsibility, the 
committee’s expectations over the relevant period and input 
from the major shareholder.
Differences in the remuneration policy for executives 
relative to the broader employee population
The remuneration policy in place for the executive directors is 
informed by the structure operated for the broader employee 
population. Pay levels and components vary by organisational 
level but the broad themes and philosophy remain consistent 
across the Group:
 ~ salaries are reviewed annually with regard to the same 
factors as set out in the Policy table for executive directors;
 ~ consistent with executive directors, senior executives 
together with general and some operational managers of 
our business units participate in an annual bonus plan with 
bonus pool funding dependent on proﬁ t performance of 
the Group or brand depending on their level;
 ~ members of the senior management team can be considered 
for awards under the long-term incentive plan. This is 
intended to encourage share ownership in the Company 
and align the management team with the strategic business 
plan; and
 ~ eligibility for and provision of beneﬁ ts and allowances varies 
by level and local market practice. It is standard for senior 
executives to receive a company car allowance. Pension 
provision below board level is overall at lower contribution 
rates, with the majority of Rank’s eligible employees now 
being automatically enrolled into the NEST Workplace 
Pension Scheme. However, a signiﬁ cant proportion of 
employees remain in Rank’s Stakeholder Pension Plan, 
where the standard contribution rates are the same as 
those offered to board-level members.
Potential reward opportunities at different 
levels of performance
The graphs below exhibit remuneration Policy for existing 
executive directors and show indicative total remuneration 
levels under different performance scenarios. The 
remuneration policy results in a high proportion of total 
remuneration being dependent on performance, with a 
majority tied to the long-term performance of the Group. 
The annual bonus and long-term incentive schemes do not 
operate an “on-target” award level. Under the bonus scheme 
awards will depend on bonus pool funding and as such are 
variable year-on-year. A maximum cap is in place under the 
scheme. Under the long-term incentive plan performance is 
considered against each selected metric independently with 
committee discretion applied as to the level of overall vesting. 
Given the structure of incentive arrangements we have not 
provided an “on-target” scenario in the following charts, rather 
a minimum and maximum only, which better reﬂ ects the 
operation of the incentive schemes at Rank. The two 
performance scenarios are calculated as follows:
 ~ Minimum – performance below target which results 
in no variable remuneration being payable. 
 ~ Maximum – 100% of the maximum annual cash bonus 
and full vesting of the long-term incentive award achieved. 
Normal maximum awards as described under the policy 
are presented.

 ~ The long-term incentive award values depicted in the charts above represent the 
annualised opportunity to directors under the currently-operated remuneration 
policy. Normal maximum awards as described under the Policy are presented.
 ~ No account is made for share price growth or the payment of dividends.
 ~ No element of pay for the chairman or non-executive directors varies with 
performance and so no separate graphs are included. 
Directors’ remuneration report – continued  THE RANK GROUP PLC: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015  67
Approach to recruitment remuneration
The committee will apply the existing remuneration policy 
to new executive directors in respect of all components 
of remuneration. As such, the maximum level of variable 
remuneration which may be granted is 300% of salary on 
an annualised basis for the CEO and 213% of salary on 
an annualised basis for other executive directors.
The committee may also make an additional award of cash 
or shares on the appointment of a new director in order to 
compensate for the forfeiture of an award from a previous 
employer. Such awards would be made on a comparable 
basis, taking account of performance, the proportion of 
the performance period remaining and the type of award. 
The committee will set appropriate performance conditions 
and vesting would be on the same time horizon as the 
forfeited award.
For both internal and external appointments, the committee 
may agree that the Company will meet certain relocation 
expenses, as set out in the Policy table.
New non-executive directors will be appointed on the same 
remuneration elements as the existing non-executive directors. 
It is not intended that variable pay, day rates or beneﬁ ts in 
kind be offered.
Approach to termination payments
The Company does not believe in reward for failure. 
The circumstances of a director’s termination (including the 
director’s performance) and an individual’s duty to mitigate 
losses are taken into account in every case. Rank’s policy is 
to stop or reduce compensatory payments to former executive 
directors to the extent that they receive remuneration from 
other employment during the compensation period. 
Compensatory payments are limited to 12 months’ base 
salary, cash car allowance and deﬁ ned pension contributions 
(or salary supplements).
Annual bonus awards will lapse in their entirety in the event 
an individual is no longer employed or serving their notice 
period at the time of pay-out.
If the holder of a long-term incentive award ceases, for any 
reason, to be an executive director or employee of a Rank 
Group company, that holder’s long-term incentive award shall 
lapse immediately upon them ceasing to be an executive 
director or employee. However, the committee may in its 
absolute discretion allow awards to continue until the normal 
vesting date and be satisﬁ ed, subject to the achievement of the 
relevant performance conditions. In such circumstances, 
awards vesting will be prorated on a time apportioned basis, 
unless the committee determines otherwise. Any such 
discretion in respect of leavers would only be applied by the 
committee to ‘good leavers’ where it considers that continued 
participation is justiﬁ ed, for example, by reference to past 
performance to the date of leaving. 
Change of control
In the event of a change of control, the committee 
has absolute discretion as to whether and on what basis 
awards should vest under the long-term incentive plan. 
The committee would normally allow awards to vest upon 
a change of control subject to satisfaction of performance 
conditions and reduction on a time apportioned basis.

Executive directors’ service agreements
It is the Company’s policy that executive directors have rolling service agreements.
The current executive directors’ service contracts contain the key terms shown in the table below: Governance
68  THE RANK GROUP PLC: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015
Service agreements outline the components of remuneration 
paid to the individual director but do not prescribe how 
remuneration levels may be adjusted from year to year.
The executive directors have served on the board for the 
periods shown below and have service agreements dated 
as follows:
Position Name Date of contract
Length of board

Chairman
The Company separated the role of chairman and chief 
executive with effect from 6 May 2014. 
The chairman, Ian Burke, has a letter of engagement dated 
22 April 2014 which is effective from 6 May 2014 and which 
replaced his service agreement dated 6 March 2006 in respect 
of his former role as chief executive. He has initially been 
engaged as non-executive chairman for a period of three years. 
His appointment is terminable without compensation on three 
months’ notice from either side. The chairman receives a fee of 
£150,000 per annum which includes his chairmanship of the 
nominations and ﬁ nance committees. This fee will be reviewed 
annually by the committee, with reference to the size and 
complexity of the role and external market comparisons, in the 
ﬁ nal quarter of each calendar year with any increase taking 
effect on 1 January. The chairman is not entitled to any 
beneﬁ ts in kind and is not eligible for pension scheme 
membership, bonus or incentive arrangements.
Non-executive directors’ remuneration
The fees for the non-executive directors are generally reviewed 
and determined by the ﬁ nance committee in the ﬁ nal quarter 
of each calendar year to reﬂ ect appropriate market conditions. 
Non-executive director annual base and additional fees 
effective 1 January 2015 comprise:
Base non-executive annual fee £46,000
Audit committee chair £8,500
Remuneration committee chair £7,500
Senior independent director £2,500
The base fee includes membership of the audit, 
remuneration, nominations and ﬁ nance committees. 
Non-executive directors are not entitled to any beneﬁ ts in 
kind and are not eligible for pension scheme membership, 
bonus or incentive arrangements.
The Company reserves the right to review fee levels annually 
with reference to the size and complexity of the role and 
external market comparisons. Any increases to fee levels will be 
effective from 1 January the following year. The aggregate fees 
will not exceed the maximum permitted by the Company’s 
articles of association, which is currently £500,000. 
Non-executive directors have letters of engagement setting 
out their duties and the time commitment expected. They are 
appointed for an initial period of three years, after which the 
appointment is renewable by mutual consent at intervals of 
not more than three years. In accordance with the Code, all 
directors offer themselves for annual re-election by shareholders. 
Details of non-executive directors’ appointments, which 
are terminable without compensation, are set out in the

Shareholder engagement 
The voting results for the 2013/14 Remuneration Report were 
a marked improvement on the previous year and we thank 
shareholders for their support. The committee is encouraged 
by the shift in voting outcomes and is committed to further 
increasing the support received from all of our shareholders. 
Feedback received from shareholders at the last annual general 
meeting centred around the governance of our executive pay 
programmes and structure of the long-term incentive. In 
response to these concerns we have taken several steps to 
optimise the arrangements in place. Speciﬁ cally, the 
introduction of a new long-term incentive plan at the general 
meeting on 22 April 2015. This replaced our previous plan 
which has been cancelled and has lapsed in full. The new plan 
includes the following features:
 ~ clawback and malus provisions;
 ~ longer-term vesting periods of three, four and ﬁ ve years; and
 ~ re-alignment of performance metrics and weightings 
to our strategic plan.
Directors’ remuneration report – continued  THE RANK GROUP PLC: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015  69
Following consultation with our major shareholders we 
received largely positive feedback. However, some concerns 
remain, particularly regarding the use of a three-year block 
award. The committee feels strongly that this feature remains 
ﬁ t-for-purpose and will motivate the executive team to deliver 
value for shareholders over the longer term. In particular, 
we have received strong support for the plan from our 
majority shareholder. 
We are committed to ongoing engagement with our 
shareholders and will continually review the remuneration 
policy to ensure that it remains ﬁ t-for-purpose and aligned 
with shareholder interests.
Statement of consideration of employment conditions 
elsewhere in the Company
As described in the notes to the Policy table on page 66 
the overarching themes of the Policy in place for executive 
directors are broadly consistent with those applied to the 
wider employee population. The committee does not use 
any comparison metrics when reviewing pay in relation to 
the wider employee population, other than the consideration 
of the general rates of increase across the Group, nor does it 
deem it to be appropriate to consult with employees on the 
remuneration policy for executive directors.
Annual Remuneration Report
The directors’ remuneration report has been prepared on 
behalf of the board by the remuneration committee (the 
“committee”), under the chairmanship of Tim Scoble.
The committee has applied the principles of good governance 
set out in the Corporate Governance Code and, in preparing 
this report, has complied with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006 and the Large and Medium-sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) 
Regulations 2013 (the “Regulations”). 
Rank’s external auditor is required to report to shareholders on 
the audited information contained in this report and to state 
whether, in its opinion, it has been prepared in accordance 
with the Regulations. 
For this purpose the audited information is:
 ~ Directors’ single remuneration ﬁ gure (page 70);
 ~ Pensions (page 73);
 ~ Long-term incentive awards made during the year (page 72);
 ~ Other payments and obligations (page 74); and
 ~ Directors’ shareholdings (page 74).
Total shareholder return
The following graph illustrates the Company’s total 
shareholder return (“TSR”) performance compared with the 
FTSE 350 index (excluding investment companies) for the six 
years to 30 June 2015. The committee has selected this index 
as the Company was a constituent of the FTSE 350 for the 
entirety of this period.
On page 71 is a table showing the single ﬁ gure of total 
remuneration for the role of chief executive over the last 
six years. It should be noted that Henry Birch became 
chief executive in May 2014.

sustainable long-term shareholder value via the transformation of the Company’s balance sheet that was paid by three equal instalments in September 2012, April 2013 
and December 2013.
Base salary
There were no increases to base salary for the executive directors during the year ended 30 June 2015. Base salaries for executive 
directors as at 1 July 2015 are:
 ~ Chief executive – £450,000
 ~ Finance director – £300,000
Annual bonus plan
The annual bonus plan is structured as a pool funded each year as a percentage of adjusted proﬁ t after tax with the sharing rate 
dependent on performance. Performance is based on the rate of return achieved on opening shareholder funds. Opening 
shareholder funds is determined by the market value of the Group when the scheme was introduced in July 2012, inﬂ ated 
annually by the difference between continuing proﬁ t after tax, and exceptionals for the year and dividends paid to shareholders. 
The target rate of return is set at the beginning of each year by the committee. For 2014/15 the target rate of return was set at 8% 
and for 2015/16 has been set at 9%, at which point a bonus pool of 2.25% of shareholder funds is created for the executive 
directors and other executive committee members. The remuneration committee has the discretion to exclude items reported as 
discontinued or exceptional. The bonus pool is allocated at the discretion of the committee with regard to individual, corporate 
and relative performance to peers. 
2014/15 annual cash bonus
The target Group proﬁ t after tax in order to trigger creation of a bonus pool for the year was £37.8m, with the target required for 
maximum bonus entitlement being £94.1m. The Group actually achieved £65.8m which resulted in the creation of a bonus pool 
of £1.3m for executive directors and other members of the executive committee listed on page 48. Governance

Subject to satisfactory average return on capital employed (‘ROCE’)
At the end of the performance period, the committee will consider performance delivered in light of the Group’s average ROCE within the 
performance period, with absolute discretion to determine the extent to which the Awards will vest, if at all, on account of ROCE performance. In 
considering ROCE performance, the committee will expect at least a 15% return to have been achieved.

Other payments and obligations
No executive directors left the Company during the year ended 30 June 2015 and therefore no payments for compensation for 
loss of ofﬁ ce were paid to, or receivable by, any director (30 June 2014: £nil). With the exception of a payment to the widow of 
John Garrett, a former executive director who resigned on 2 February 1998, who received £45,343 (2013/14: £44,603) in respect 
of an unfunded pension obligation, no payments were made during the year ended 30 June 2015 to any past director of the 
Company.

Dilution limits
The LTIP, being the Company’s only equity-based incentive plan, incorporates the current ABI guidelines on headroom which 
provide that overall dilution under all plans should not exceed 10% over a 10-year period in relation to the Company’s issued 
share capital with a further limitation of 5% in any 10-year period for executive plans.
The committee regularly monitors the position and prior to the making of any award considers the effect of potential vesting of 
awards to ensure that the Company remains within these limits. Any awards which are required to be satisﬁ ed by market 
purchased shares are excluded from the calculations. No treasury shares were held or utilised in the year ended 30 June 2015.

Role and remit of the committee
The committee assists the board in setting the remuneration packages for the Company’s executive directors and other executive 
committee members.
The committee has three scheduled meetings a year to discuss a rolling agenda of items and additional meetings are convened as 
necessary. By invitation, the chairman, chief executive, company secretary, ﬁ nance director and human resources director attend 
and contribute to meetings, but are not present at discussions regarding their own remuneration.
The committee’s formal terms of reference are available on Rank’s website at: www.rank.com/en/investors/corporate-governance/
terms-of-reference.html.
Committee membership and meeting attendance
Biographical details of the current members of the committee are set out on page 47. The Group company secretary acts as 
secretary to the committee. The committee met on eight occasions during the year.

Committee activity during the year
Matters discussed by the committee during the year included the following:
 ~ long-term incentive plan;
 ~ changes to remuneration policy;
 ~ institutional shareholder feedback on proposed changes to remuneration policy;
 ~ remuneration packages for new members of the executive committee;
 ~ 2015 ﬁ xed pay review;
 ~ 2014/15 annual bonus payments;
 ~ 2015/16 annual bonus plan structure and targets;
 ~ annual review of remuneration policy and practices; and
 ~ review and approval of the Policy Report and the Annual Remuneration Report.
Advisers to the committee
The committee has access to external information and research on market data and trends from independent consultants. After a 
tender process Towers Watson was appointed as external remuneration advisers to the committee. They have been sole advisers 
to the committee since January 2007. Towers Watson is a member of the Remuneration Consultants’ Group, the body which 
oversees the code of conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the United Kingdom.
The chief executive, the company secretary, the ﬁ nance director and the human resources director provided assistance to the 
committee during the year. They attended meetings of the committee, although none of them was involved in any decision 
relating to his or her own remuneration.
Towers Watson attended two out of the committee’s eight meetings during the year. During the year, the committee requested 
Towers Watson to advise on matters including remuneration of the chairman, non-executive directors, executive directors and 
other executive committee members. Towers Watson also provided the TSR performance graph for the directors’ remuneration 
report. Towers Watson was paid fees totalling £67,133 for services provided to the committee during the year (fees are based on 
hours spent). Towers Watson did not provide any other services to the Group during the period under review.  Governance
76  THE RANK GROUP PLC: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015
Committee evaluation
The committee’s performance during the period under review was assessed via conﬁ dential questionnaires with committee 
members and other individuals who support its work. Results were then reviewed by the committee chairman and discussed 
with the board. The board agreed that the committee continued to perform effectively.
Shareholder consultation and voting outcome
During the year the committee, through its chairman, consulted its majority shareholder and others of its larger shareholders 
with regard to their views on proposed changes to Rank’s executive directors’ remuneration arrangements, the main features 
of which were as follows:
 ~ a maximum vesting period of ﬁ ve and a half years made up of a three-year performance period and phased holding periods up 
to two and a half years. This time horizon was more closely aligned with sustainable long-term value creation for shareholders;
 ~ performance to be measured by ﬁ nancial measures (50%); EBITDA, proﬁ t after tax and digital revenue, alongside a balanced 
scorecard of strategic non-ﬁ nancial measures (50%), all of which are aligned to our long-term strategic plan;
 ~ the awards to be structured as contingent block awards intended to ensure executives’ focus on the long-term success 
of the business; and
 ~ clawback and malus provisions to be introduced to strengthen the committee’s governance of the incentive plan.
The above necessitated amendments to the Rules of The Rank Group Plc 2010 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “Plan Rules”) 
and minor changes to the long-term incentive section of our directors’ remuneration policy that was approved by shareholders 
in October 2014 (the “Policy”).
Shareholder feedback from that consultation process that took place in the ﬁ rst quarter of the current calendar year and the 
committee’s response included:
Shareholder comment on proposals Committee response
Threshold vesting level too high One of the main criticisms of Rank’s historic long-term incentive plans by 
Rank’s majority shareholder was that they tended to reward relatively modest 
growth at threshold performance levels. We have subsequently toughened the 
performance expectations at threshold vesting signiﬁ cantly in order to ensure 
that minimum performance requires management to achieve stretching 
results. Whilst the committee understands that UK market practice tends to 
favour a lower vesting percentage at threshold, our majority shareholder 
supports the view that a higher vesting percentage at this level of performance 
is warranted to incentivise management given the stretching targets.
Performance metric The committee considered carefully shareholders’ comments regarding metrics 
and as a result of those comments resolved to underpin the scheme with a 
return on capital employed (‘ROCE’) measure.
Weighting for non-ﬁ nancial metrics The committee has considered this carefully and believes that the weighting is 
appropriate given our strategic direction and long-term goals for the business. 
Performance period start date Henry Birch joined us as our new chief executive on 6 May last year. The 
committee considered it entirely appropriate that Mr Birch and his team had 
an appropriate long-term incentive in place. The base from which the targets 
for the scheme to be put to shareholders was the commencement of the then 
current ﬁ nancial year. Regrettably it had taken longer than the committee had 
hoped to have the mechanics of the scheme debated internally. Nevertheless, 
Mr Birch and his team had been working to the speciﬁ ed ﬁ nancial and 
non-ﬁ nancial metrics since the start of the then current ﬁ nancial year 
on 1 July 2014 and therefore the committee felt it appropriate for the 
commencement of the performance period to be 1 July 2014.

Implementation of policy in 2015/16
For the following ﬁ nancial year it is not anticipated that the remuneration policy outlined on pages 63 to 67 will change and 
therefore the committee will manage pay decisions within the set policy. 
Salaries will be reviewed with any changes effective 1 January 2016. The executive directors will participate in the annual bonus 
plan. As in previous years, a pool will be generated based on growth in proﬁ t. It is the view of the committee that the absolute 
targets, as well as the targets governing individuals’ allocations, are commercially sensitive. The proﬁ t growth targets and actual 
performance will be disclosed in next year’s report as they have been this year. 
We believe that our policy continues to be aligned with our strategic goal of creating long-term sustainable value for 
shareholders. We welcome shareholder feedback on issues related to executive remuneration.

Signiﬁ cant shareholders 
Controlling shareholder
Hong Leong Company (Malaysia) Berhad (“Hong Leong”), the ultimate parent company of Guoco Group Limited (“Guoco”), has 
a controlling interest in Rank consequent upon the general offer made by its Hong Kong listed subsidiary company, Guoco, via 
its wholly-owned subsidiary, Rank Assets Limited (then known as All Global Investments Limited), and which completed on 15 
July 2011. On 3 July 2013 Guoco announced that it had declared a special interim dividend in specie of approximately 88.84 
million Rank shares representing 22.74% of Rank (the “Distribution”). As a consequence of the Distribution, with effect from 9 
September 2013, Hong Leong’s interest in Rank shares reduced to approximately 68.89% held as to 51.76% by Guoco, 16.85% by 
Guoco’s immediate parent company, GuoLine Overseas Limited (“GuoLine”), and 0.28% by Asian Financial Common Wealth 
(PTC) Limited (“AFCW”). On 18 February 2015, GuoLine sold 50 million Rank shares, thereby reducing Hong Leong’s interest in 
Rank shares to approximately 56.09% held as to 51.76% by Guoco, 4.05% by GuoLine and 0.28% by AFCW. On 28 July 2015, 
Hong Leong advised Rank that AFCW had on 29 June 2015 transferred its interest in Rank shares to Guoco.
Hong Leong Group is a leading conglomerate based in Malaysia with diversiﬁ ed businesses in banking and ﬁ nancial services, 
manufacturing and distribution, property development and investments and hospitality and leisure. Further information on the 
Hong Leong group of companies can be found at www.hongleong.com.
Guoco is an investment holding company. The principal activities of its subsidiaries and associated companies include 
investment, property development, ﬁ nancial services and hospitality and leisure. Further information on the Guoco group of 
companies can be found at www.guoco.com.
On 10 November 2014 Rank entered into an agreement with Hong Leong and Guoco (together the “Controlling Shareholder”) 
in accordance with the requirements of LR 9.2.2AR(2)(a) (the “Relationship Agreement”). During the period under review Rank 
has complied with the independence provisions included in the Relationship Agreement and, so far as Rank is aware, the 
independence provisions included in the Relationship Agreement have been complied with during the period under review by 
the Controlling Shareholder and its associates. So far as Rank is aware, the procurement obligations included in the Relationship 
Agreement have been complied with during the period under review by the Controlling Shareholder.
Interests of 3% or more
The following interests of 3% or more of the total voting rights attached to ordinary shares have been notiﬁ ed to the Company 
in accordance with the FCA’s DTRs. Due to the fact that the DTRs only require notiﬁ cation where the percentage voting rights 
reach, exceed or fall below 3% and each 1% threshold above 3%, there is a difference between disclosures made pursuant to the 
DTRs and those disclosed in responses to s.793 Companies Act 2006 (“CA 2006”) notices issued by the Company. We have

Rights and restrictions attaching to shares
Voting rights
Each ordinary share carries the right to one vote at general 
meetings of the Company.
Meeting rights
Registered holders of ordinary shares are entitled to attend and 
speak at general meetings and to appoint proxies.
Information rights
Holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive the 
Company’s annual report and ﬁ nancial statements.
Share transfer restrictions
There are no speciﬁ c restrictions on the transfer of shares 
contained in the Company’s articles of association.
The Company is not aware of any agreements between the 
holders of Rank shares that may result in restrictions on the 
transfer of shares or that may result in restrictions on 
voting rights.
Variation of rights
Subject to applicable legislation, the rights attached to Rank’s 
ordinary shares may be varied with the written consent of the 
holders of at least three quarters in nominal value of those 
shares, or by a special resolution passed at a general meeting of 
the ordinary shareholders.
Directors’ powers in relation to shares
Allotment and issue of shares
Subject to the provisions of the CA 2006, and subject to any 
resolution passed by the Company pursuant to the CA 2006 
and other shareholder rights, shares in Rank may be issued 
with such rights and restrictions as the Company may by 
ordinary resolution decide. If there is no such resolution or so 
far as the Company does not make speciﬁ c provision, they may 
be issued as Rank’s board of directors may decide. Subject to 
the Company’s articles of association, the CA 2006 and other 
shareholder rights, unissued shares are at the disposal 
of the board. 
The Company currently has no shareholder authority to allot 
and grant rights over any proportion of the Company’s 
unissued share capital, nor does it have shareholders’ authority 
to allot and grant rights over ordinary shares without ﬁ rst 
making a pro rata offer to all existing ordinary shareholders. 
Neither of these authorities is required for the purpose of 
allotting shares pursuant to employee share schemes. Since the 
board has no present intention of allotting shares for any other 
reason, these shareholder authorities will not be sought at the 
forthcoming annual general meeting.
Market purchases of own shares
The Company currently has no shareholder authority to make 
market purchases of its own shares. Shareholder approval will 
be sought at the 2015 annual general meeting to obtain the 
standard authority for one year.
Directors’ other powers
Subject to legislation, the directors may exercise all the powers 
permitted by the Company’s memorandum and articles of 
association. A copy of these can be obtained by writing to the 
company secretary, or from Companies House.
The articles contain provisions to empower the directors in 
certain speciﬁ c matters, including: 
 ~ appointment of directors, subject to subsequent shareholder 
approval;
 ~ delegation of powers to a director, secretary or committee of 
one or more persons;
 ~ the Company’s powers to borrow money; and
 ~ the ability of a director to vote on matters in which he has 
an interest.
Changes to the Company’s articles of association can only be 
made by a resolution passed by a majority of no less than 75% 
of shareholders.
Change of control
Our principal term loan and credit facility agreements contain 
provisions that, on a change of control of Rank, immediate 
repayment can be demanded of all advances and any 
accrued interest.
The provisions of the Company’s share schemes and incentive 
plans may cause options and awards granted to employees to 
vest in the event of a takeover.
A change of control may also affect licences to operate, as 
speciﬁ ed in the provisions of the Gambling Act 2005 and the 
Alderney eGambling Regulations 2009 (as amended) and the 
Belgian Games of Chance Act 1999 (as amended).
Political donations
We made no political donations during the period 
under review.
It has been Rank’s long-standing practice not to make cash 
payments to political parties and the board intends that this will 
remain the case. However, the CA 2006 is very broadly drafted 
and could catch activities such as funding seminars and other 
functions to which politicians are invited, supporting certain 
bodies involved in policy review and law reform and matching 
employees’ donations to certain charities. Accordingly, as 
in previous years, the directors will be seeking shareholders’ 
authority for political donations and political expenditure at 
the forthcoming annual general meeting in case any of Rank’s 
activities are inadvertently caught by the legislation.

Annual report and ﬁ nancial statements
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report 
(including the directors’ report, the strategic report, the 
directors’ remuneration report and the corporate governance 
statement) and the ﬁ nancial statements of the Group and the 
Company, in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law 
and regulations. Company law requires the directors to prepare 
Group and Company ﬁ nancial statements for each ﬁ nancial 
year. Under that law, the directors are required to prepare 
Group ﬁ nancial statements under IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union. As permitted by the Companies Act 2006, 
the directors have elected to prepare the Company ﬁ nancial 
statements under IFRSs as adopted by the European Union. 
Under company law the directors must not approve the Group 
and Company ﬁ nancial statements unless they are satisﬁ ed 
that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the 
Group and Company and of the proﬁ t or loss of the Group for 
that period. In preparing the Group and Company ﬁ nancial 
statements, the directors are required to:
 ~ present fairly the ﬁ nancial position, ﬁ nancial performance 
and cash ﬂ ows of the Group and Company;
 ~ select suitable accounting policies in accordance with IAS 8: 
Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and 
Errors and then apply them consistently;
 ~ present information, including accounting policies, in a 
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information;
 ~ make judgements that are reasonable; 
 ~ provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
speciﬁ c requirements in IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union is insufﬁ cient to enable users to understand the 
impact of particular transactions, other events and 
conditions on the Group and Company’s ﬁ nancial 
position and ﬁ nal performance; and
 ~ state whether the ﬁ nancial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained 
in the ﬁ nancial statements.
Statement of directors’ responsibilities
Accounting records 
The directors must keep proper accounting records that 
disclose with reasonable accuracy, at any time, the ﬁ nancial 
position of the Company and the Group and ensure that the 
Group ﬁ nancial statements comply with the Companies Act 
2006 and, for the Group ﬁ nancial statements, Article 4 of the 
International Accounting Standard (IAS) Regulation. 
Safeguarding assets
The directors are also accountable for safeguarding the assets 
of the Company and the Group and, therefore, for taking 
reasonable steps to prevent and detect fraud and other 
irregularities.
Corporate website
The maintenance and integrity of Rank’s corporate website, 
on which this annual report and ﬁ nancial statements are 
published, is the board’s responsibility. We would draw 
attention to the fact that legislation in the UK on the 
preparation and publication of ﬁ nancial statements may 
differ from that in other jurisdictions.
Statement of directors’ responsibilities
The annual report and ﬁ nancial statements are the 
responsibility of, and have been approved by, the directors.
Each of the directors named on pages 46 and 47 conﬁ rms that 
to the best of his / her knowledge:
 ~ the annual report and ﬁ nancial statements, taken as a whole, 
are fair, balanced and understandable and provide the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s performance, business model and strategy;
 ~ the ﬁ nancial statements, prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union, give a true and fair view 
of the assets, liabilities, ﬁ nancial position and proﬁ t of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and
 ~ the strategic report includes a review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of 
the Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description 
of the risks and uncertainties that they face.

Audit report on the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements
To the Shareholders of The Rank Group Plc:
In our opinion:
 ~ the ﬁ nancial statements give a true and fair view of 
the state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s 
affairs as at 30 June 2015 and of the Group’s proﬁ t for 
the year then ended;
 ~ the Group ﬁ nancial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union; 
 ~ the parent company ﬁ nancial statements have been 
properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted 
by the European Union and as applied in accordance 
with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
 ~ the ﬁ nancial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, 
as regards the Group ﬁ nancial statements, Article 4 of 
the IAS Regulation.
What we have audited
We have audited the ﬁ nancial statements of The Rank Group 
Plc for the year ended 30 June 2015 which comprise the Group 
income statement, the Group statement of comprehensive 
income, the Group and Company balance sheets, the Group 
and Company statements of changes in equity, the Group and 
Company statements of cash ﬂ ow, and the related notes 1 to 
34. The ﬁ nancial reporting framework that has been applied in 
their preparation is applicable law and International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union 
and, as regards the parent company ﬁ nancial statements, as 
applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies 
Act 2006.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, 
as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so 
that we might state to the Company’s members those matters 
we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for 
no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we 
do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than 
the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our 
audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement set out on page 82, the directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the ﬁ nancial statements and for being 
satisﬁ ed that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility 
is to audit and express an opinion on the ﬁ nancial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to 
comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards 
for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the ﬁ nancial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts 
and disclosures in the ﬁ nancial statements sufﬁ cient to give 
reasonable assurance that the ﬁ nancial statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or 
error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the parent 
company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of signiﬁ cant 
accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall 
presentation of the ﬁ nancial statements. In addition, we read 
all the ﬁ nancial and non-ﬁ nancial information in the annual 
report and accounts to identify material inconsistencies with 
the audited ﬁ nancial statements and to identify any 
information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, 
or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us 
in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of 
any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we 
consider the implications for our report.
Our assessment of risk of material misstatement
We identiﬁ ed the following risks that have the greatest impact 
on our audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit 
and directing the efforts of the engagement team:
 ~ Revenue recognition – inaccuracy of the measurement 
and completeness of revenue reported from casino and 
bingo venues;
 ~ Revenue recognition – inaccuracy of the measurement, 
completeness and occurrence of revenue reported from 
casino and bingo digital channels;
 ~ Identiﬁ cation and assessment of the valuation of intangible 
and tangible assets, goodwill and investments;
 ~ Incorrect valuation and incomplete provisions made 
in relation to property leases; and
 ~ Inaccurate valuation and incomplete provisions made 
in relation to direct and indirect tax risk exposures 
and claims/reclaims in relation to continuing and 
discontinued businesses.
Independent auditor’s report  THE RANK GROUP PLC: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015  85
Our response to the risks of material misstatement identiﬁ ed above included the following procedures:

collusion within venues. Revenue could be 
inaccurately stated as a result.
 ~ We updated our understanding of the revenue processes 
and tested key management controls for recognition and 
measurement of revenue, both at a site level and head 
ofﬁ ce level;
 ~ We traced a sample of revenue transactions from cash 
banked to revenue booked to the general ledger;
 ~ We veriﬁ ed the recognition and measurement of revenue 
by re-performing cash counts throughout the year at a 
sample of casino and bingo venues;
 ~ We assessed the opportunity or incentive for 
management override of controls and collusion and 
tested certain manual journal entries impacting 
revenue selected using professional judgement;
 ~ We compared management’s assumptions and 
classiﬁ cation of accounting entries in relation to the 
Group’s loyalty scheme against accounting guidance 
and observable historical data; and
 ~ We performed substantive analytical review procedures, 
which included comparing actual results against 
forecasted win rates and substantiating deviations 
from expectations.
Having completed these 
procedures nothing has come 
to our attention to indicate 
that revenue recognition is 
inappropriate. Our testing 
of controls did not identify 
material weaknesses in the 
design and operation of controls.
We found that revenue has 
a strong correlation to cash 
which was in line with our 
expectations of a business 
of this nature. Our testing of 
manual journals to revenue 
did not indicate evidence of 
management override.
Revenue recognition – inaccuracy of the 
measurement, completeness and occurrence of 
revenue reported from casino and bingo digital 
channels – There is a high volume of revenue 
transactions from internet gaming. Rank are 
continuously innovating and developing new 
products and there are a number of balances 
driven by revenue, such as indirect taxes and 
liabilities that arise from afﬁ liate and royalty 
agreements. These factors can increase the 
complexities around revenue recognition 
and completeness of related balances.
 ~ We updated our understanding of the revenue processes 
and controls and tested key management manual and IT 
controls for recognition and measurement of revenue;
 ~ We veriﬁ ed the recognition and measurement of revenue 
by tracing a sample of transactions throughout the year 
to source data to verify the accuracy of reported revenue;
 ~ We assessed the opportunity or incentive for

that revenue recognition is 
inappropriate. Our testing 
of controls did not identify 
material weaknesses in the 
design and operation 
of controls.
From testing performed 
we found that revenue was 
accurate and measured in line 
with that reported from source 
data. Our testing of manual 
journals to revenue did not 
indicate evidence of 
management override.
Identiﬁ cation and assessment of the valuation 
of intangible and tangible assets, goodwill and 
investments – The Group tests annually 
whether assets that have an indeﬁ nite useful 
life, including goodwill and gaming licences, 
have suffered any impairment. The Group also 
reviews assets that are subject to amortisation 
or depreciation for events or changes in 
circumstances that indicate the carrying 
amount of the asset may not be recoverable.
The application of the policy requires the use 
of accounting estimates and judgements in 
determining the recoverable amount of 
cash-generating units to which the intangible 
assets and property, plant and equipment are 
associated. This is a key focus of our audit 
procedures due to the level of management 
judgement required in the assumptions 
impacting the impairment assessment and the 
sensitivity of the model. The main assumptions 
impacting the assessment and sensitivity of the 
model are future cash ﬂ ows, growth rates 
applied to cash ﬂ ows and discount rates. These 
assumptions are subjective and subject to 
management judgement.
 ~ We updated our understanding of management’s 
annual impairment testing process;
 ~ We ensured that the methodology of the impairment 
exercise continues to comply with the requirements 
of IFRS as adopted by the European Union, including 
evaluating management’s assessment of indicators of 
impairment against indicators of impairment speciﬁ ed 
within IAS 36 as well as their assessment of what the 
Group considers a cash generating unit (CGU) to be 
compared to other existing industry practice;
 ~ We assessed the forecasts underlying the impairment 
review and agreed to budgets approved by the Board, 
reviewing these against actual performance and historic 
accuracy of forecasting. We also performed sensitivity 
analysis on key assumptions;
 ~ We agreed other key assumptions such as discount 
rates to supporting evidence and corroborated these 
to industry averages/trends with the assistance of EY 
internal experts; and
 ~ We compared the individual CGU projections to historic 
performance and made inquiries of the appropriate 
ﬁ nance and commercial personnel where this deviated 
from historic performance levels, observable trends or 
our expectations.
For ﬁ nite life assets, we believe 
management have undertaken 
an appropriate exercise to 
identify, at a CGU level, whether 
indicators of impairment or 
impairment reversal are present. 
Where indicators were present, 
management have performed 
additional procedures to 
quantify the recoverable 
amount of the asset.
For indeﬁ nite life assets, we 
believe that the assessment of 
recoverable amount including, 
where relevant, the cash ﬂ ow 
projections estimated by 
management are reasonable and 
the assumptions are supportable.
Based on procedures performed 
we believe the valuation of 
intangible and tangible assets, 
goodwill and investments 
together with the adjustment for 
impairment to be appropriate. Financial statements

Risk Our response to these risks Observations
Incorrect valuation and incomplete provisions 
made in relation to property leases – The 
Group provides for onerous lease provisions 
for both unoccupied properties and properties 
which are trading at a loss. We consider, as 
with impairment, due to the high level of 
management judgement required in the 
multiple assumptions impacting the 
assessment and the sensitivity of the model, 
that there is a higher likelihood that a material 
misstatement could arise. There is a risk that 
these provisions may no longer be required, 
misstated or that provisions that should have 
been recorded have not been.
 ~ We updated our understanding of management’s 
processes and controls for identifying and calculating 
property lease provisions;
 ~ We ensured that the methodology of the onerous lease 
provision calculation continues to comply with the 
requirements of IFRS as adopted by the European Union;
 ~ We checked underlying calculations and agreed key 
inputs to supporting evidence including lease agreements 
and, for trading properties, corroborated management’s 
assumptions to underlying audit work performed; and
 ~ We corroborated management’s assumptions to third 
party evidence where possible and through discussions 
with the ﬁ nance and property teams responsible for the 
management of the Group’s property leases.
We believe adjustments made 
to and balances of property 
lease provisions are appropriate. 
The underlying assumptions 
applied by management are 
supportable and management 
has taken into account sub-let 
income where appropriate.
Inaccurate valuation and incomplete provisions 
made in relation to direct and indirect tax risk 
exposures and claims/reclaims in relation to 
continuing and discontinued businesses – Tax 
risk provisions exist in relation to discontinued 
business. Management also provide for certain 
exposures in relation to continuing business. 
Due to the judgemental nature of estimating the 
correct amount to provide for the above issues 
and the difﬁ culty in assessing the completeness 
of the provisions we have identiﬁ ed the failure 
to provide appropriately for tax risk exposures 
in relation to continuing and discontinued 
businesses as a signiﬁ cant risk.
Indirect tax is a complex area in the gaming 
industry and the Group has a number of 
matters in relation to ongoing claims and 
assessments with HMRC. In addition the 
Group is required to disclose certain 
contingent assets and contingent liabilities in 
respect of these ongoing issues in the annual 
accounts. Due to the highly judgemental 
nature of many of the ongoing claims and 
disclosure requirements, we have identiﬁ ed 
this as a signiﬁ cant risk for the audit.
 ~ We updated our understanding of management’s 
processes and controls for identifying and calculating 
tax related provisions;
 ~ We understood the latest position in all material open 
direct and indirect tax matters including any conclusions 
reached during the year, with the assistance of EY 
internal experts, ensuring that management has provided 
for uncertain tax provisions where appropriate;
 ~ We read all material correspondence with HMRC and 
other tax authorities in the period for entities in scope 
for tax to form our view on the appropriate tax treatment 
of judgemental items;
 ~ We tested the calculations of current and deferred 
tax assets and liabilities to support the valuation, 
presentation and appropriateness of all direct tax 
balances at year end; and
 ~ We concluded on the appropriateness of the indirect 
tax balances, presentation and disclosures.
We believe that the adjustments 
made to and balance of tax 
provisions are appropriate. 
We believe that the disclosures 
included within the ﬁ nancial 
statements in respect of 
contingent assets and 
liabilities are appropriate.
Independent auditor’s report – continued
Our application of materiality
We apply the concept of materiality both in planning 
and performing our audit, and in evaluating the effect of 
misstatements on our audit and on the ﬁ nancial statements. 
For the purposes of determining whether the ﬁ nancial 
statements are free from material misstatement we deﬁ ne 
materiality as the magnitude of misstatement that makes 
it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably 
knowledgeable person, relying on the ﬁ nancial statements, 
would be changed or inﬂ uenced. We also determine a level 
of performance materiality which we use to determine the 
extent of testing needed to reduce, to an appropriately low 
level, the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and 
undetected misstatements exceeds materiality for the 
ﬁ nancial statements as a whole.
When establishing our overall audit strategy, we determined 
a magnitude of uncorrected misstatements that we judged 
would be material for the ﬁ nancial statements as a whole. 
We determined planning materiality for the Group to be 
£3.7m (PY: £3.2m), which is 5% (PY: 5%) of adjusted proﬁ t 
before tax of £74.1m for the year ended 30 June 2015 (PY: 
£62.5m). We have calculated materiality with reference to 
adjusted proﬁ t before tax as we consider this to be one of 
the principal considerations for members of the Company in 
assessing the ﬁ nancial performance of the Group. This is on 
the basis that adjusted proﬁ t before tax excludes exceptional 
items such as impairment charges and reversals to give a full 
understanding of the Group’s ﬁ nancial performance and aid 
comparability of the Group’s result between periods.
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our 
assessment of the Group’s overall control environment, 
our judgement is that overall performance materiality 
(i.e. our tolerance for misstatement in an individual account 
or balance) for the Group should be 50% (PY: 50%) of planning   THE RANK GROUP PLC: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015  87
materiality, namely £1.85m (PY: £1.6m). Our objective in 
adopting this approach is to ensure that total detected and 
undetected audit differences do not exceed our planning 
materiality of £3.7m (PY: £3.2m) for the ﬁ nancial statements 
as a whole. This provided a basis for determining the nature, 
timing and extent of risk assessment procedures, identifying 
and assessing the risk of material misstatement and 
determining the nature, timing and extent of further 
audit procedures.
We agreed with the audit committee that we would report 
to the committee all audit differences in excess of £0.2m 
(PY: £0.1m), as well as differences below that threshold that, 
in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both 
the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above 
and in the light of other relevant qualitative considerations.
An overview of the scope of our audit
We used a risk-based approach for determining our audit 
strategy, ensuring that our audit teams performed consistent 
procedures and focused on addressing the risks that are 
relevant to the business. This approach focused our audit 
effort towards higher risk areas, such as signiﬁ cant 
management judgements, and on locations that were 
considered material based upon size, complexity and risk.
Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and 
our allocation of that materiality determined our audit scope.
The factors that we considered when assessing the scope of 
the Group audit and the level of work to be performed at each 
location included the following: the ﬁ nancial signiﬁ cance and 
speciﬁ c risks of the location, the effectiveness of the control 
environment and monitoring activities, including Group-wide 
controls and recent internal audit ﬁ ndings.
Our Group audit scope focused on the UK and Spain. The UK 
was subject to a full scope audit, whilst Spain was subject to 
speciﬁ c audit testing and therefore represents a speciﬁ c scope 
location based on our judgement of risk and materiality. These 
countries represent the principal business units within the 
Group’s six reportable segments and accounted for 98% 
(PY: 98%) of revenue and 99% (PY: 91%) of the Group’s 
adjusted proﬁ t before tax. The risks identiﬁ ed above that have 
a greater impact on our audit strategy are audited in the UK by 
the audit team that is overseen by the Senior Statutory Auditor.
The Senior Statutory Auditor oversaw all planning at the 
full scope location including discussion of the potential 
for material fraud and error, reviewed key working papers, 
participated in the planning and execution of the responses to 
the risks, and attended the audit closing meetings. The Senior 
Statutory Auditor was also involved in the risk assessment and 
determining which accounts were in scope for the speciﬁ c 
scope location and attended the audit closing meeting by 
conference call, made speciﬁ c enquiries of local management 
and reviewed the summary of results reported by the audit 
team in Spain.
For the remaining locations, we performed an analytical 
review to conﬁ rm there were no signiﬁ cant risks of material 
misstatement in the Group ﬁ nancial statements.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
 ~ the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be 
audited has been properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 2006; and
 ~ the information given in the Strategic Report and the 
Directors’ Report for the ﬁ nancial year for which the 
ﬁ nancial statements are prepared is consistent with 
the ﬁ nancial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the ISAs (UK and Ireland), we are required to report 
to you if, in our opinion, information in the annual report is:
 ~ materially inconsistent with the information in the audited 
ﬁ nancial statements; or
 ~ apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group acquired 
in the course of performing our audit; or
 ~ is otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have 
identiﬁ ed any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired 
during the audit and the directors’ statement that they 
consider the annual report is fair, balanced and understandable 
and whether the annual report appropriately discloses those 
matters that we communicated to the audit committee which 
we consider should have been disclosed.
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report 
to you if, in our opinion:
 ~ adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have 
not been received from branches not visited by us; or
 ~ the parent company ﬁ nancial statements and the part of 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not 
in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
 ~ certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration speciﬁ ed 
by law are not made; or
 ~ we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
 ~ the directors’ statement, set out on page 39, in relation 
to going concern; and
 ~ the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating 
to the Company’s compliance with the ten provisions of 
the UK Corporate Governance Code speciﬁ ed for our review.

Notes to the ﬁ nancial statements
1 General information 
and accounting policies
General information
The Rank Group Plc (‘the Company’) and its subsidiaries 
(together ‘the Group’) operate gaming services in Great Britain 
(including the Channel Islands), Spain and Belgium.
The Company is a public limited company which is listed on 
the London Stock Exchange and is incorporated and domiciled 
in England and Wales under registration number 03140769. 
The address of its registered ofﬁ ce is Statesman House, 
Stafferton Way, Maidenhead, SL6 1AY.
Summary of signiﬁ cant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation 
of these consolidated and Company ﬁ nancial statements are 
set out below. These policies have been consistently applied 
to all periods presented.
1.1 Basis of preparation
The consolidated and Company ﬁ nancial statements have 
been prepared under the historical cost convention. 
1.1.1 Statement of compliance
The consolidated and Company ﬁ nancial statements have 
been prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) and IFRIC Interpretations as 
adopted by the European Union, and the Companies Act 
2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
1.1.2 Going concern
In adopting the going concern basis for preparing the 
consolidated and Company ﬁ nancial statements, the directors 
have considered the issues impacting the Group during the 
period as detailed in the strategic report on pages 1 to 43 and 
have reviewed the Group’s projected compliance with its 
banking covenants detailed in the ﬁ nance review on page 39. 
The Group is in advanced stages of negotiating replacement 
bank facilities and based on the Group’s cash ﬂ ow forecasts 
and operating budgets, the directors believe that the Group 
will generate sufﬁ cient cash to meet its borrowing requirements 
for at least 12 months from the date of approval of the 
ﬁ nancial statements and comply with its banking covenants.
1.1.3 Accounting estimates and judgements
The preparation of ﬁ nancial statements in conformity with 
IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. 
It also requires management to exercise its judgement in 
the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. 
The resulting accounting estimates will, by deﬁ nition, seldom 
equal the actual results. The areas involving a higher degree 
of judgement or complexity, where assumptions and estimates 
are signiﬁ cant to the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements, 
are set out below.
(a) Estimated impairment of goodwill, 
intangible assets and property, plant and equipment
The Group tests annually whether assets that have an 
indeﬁ nite useful life, including goodwill and gaming licences, 
have suffered any impairment. The Group also reviews assets 
that are subject to amortisation or depreciation for events or 
changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount of 
the asset may not be recoverable. The Group also tests annually 
whether such assets, other than goodwill, should be subject to 
a reversal of a prior impairment charge. Further details of the 
Group’s accounting policy in relation to impairments and 
impairment reversals are disclosed in note 1.13.
The application of the policy requires the use of accounting 
estimates and judgements in determining the recoverable 
amount of cash-generating units to which the goodwill, 
intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are 
associated. The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair 
value less costs of disposal and value in use. Estimates of fair 
value less costs of disposal are performed internally by 
experienced senior management supported by knowledge of 
similar transactions and advice from external estate agents or, 
if applicable, offers received. Value in use is calculated using 
estimated cash ﬂ ow projections from ﬁ nancial budgets, 
discounted by selecting an appropriate rate for each cash-
generating unit. Further details of the assumptions and 
estimates are disclosed in note 13.
The Company also tests annually the carrying value of its 
investments in subsidiaries. The application of this policy 
requires the use of estimates and judgements in determining 
the recoverable amount of the subsidiary undertakings. 
The recoverable amount is determined by applying an 
appropriate multiple to the earnings of the subsidiaries 
along with consideration of the underlying net assets.
(b) Classiﬁ cation of casino and other gaming 
licences as intangible assets with an indeﬁ nite life
As disclosed in note 1.12 certain casino and other gaming 
licences have been classiﬁ ed as intangible assets with an 
indeﬁ nite life. This assumption is based on management’s 
belief that there is no foreseeable limit to the period over 
which the licences are expected to generate net cash inﬂ ows 
and that each licence holds a value outside the property in 
which it resides. As a consequence, each licence is reviewed 
annually for impairment. 
(c) Income taxes
The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous 
jurisdictions, including jurisdictions of now discontinued 
operations. There are many transactions and calculations 
for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. 
The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues 
based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. 
Where the ﬁ nal outcome of these matters is different from 
the amount recognised, such differences will impact the 
ﬁ nancial statements in the period such determination is 
made. Further details of income tax are disclosed in note 18.  Financial statements

accounting policies – continued
(d) Provisions
Provisions are recognised in accordance with the policy 
disclosed in note 1.10. In calculating property lease provisions, 
estimates are made of the discounted cash ﬂ ows associated 
with the property and its associated operations including 
sub-let income together with estimates of any dilapidation 
obligations. Estimates have been made in determining the 
amount and timing of disposal provisions, including legacy 
industrial disease and personal injury claims. Estimates have 
also been made in determining the amount and likelihood 
of settlement of indirect tax provisions and restructuring 
provisions. Further details of provisions made are disclosed 
in note 22.
(e) Contingent assets and liabilities
Management is required to apply judgement in assessing the 
probability of the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or 
more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of 
the Company. This judgement is supported by external advice 
and precedent case law where appropriate and is continually 
assessed to ensure that developments are appropriately 
reﬂ ected in the ﬁ nancial statements. Further details of 
contingent assets are disclosed in note 31 and of 
contingent liabilities in note 32.
1.1.4 Changes in accounting policy and disclosures
(a) Standards, amendments to and interpretations of existing 
standards adopted by the Group
The following new standards, amendments to and 
interpretations of existing standards are mandatory for 
the ﬁ rst time for the ﬁ nancial period beginning 1 July 2014:
 ~ IFRS10 Consolidated Financial Statements
 ~ IFRS11 Joint Arrangements
 ~ IFRS12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities
 ~ IAS27 Separate Financial Statements (Revised)
 ~ IAS28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures (Revised)
 ~ IAS32 Financial Instruments: Presentation – Offsetting 
Financial Assets and Liabilities (Amendment)
 ~ IAS36 Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-Financial 
Assets (Amendment)
 ~ IAS39 Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of 
Hedge Accounting (Amendment)
 ~ IFRIC21 Levies
The Group has not been materially impacted by the adoption 
of any of these standards, amendments or interpretations. 
The Group has not early adopted any other standard, 
amendment or interpretation that was issued but is 
not yet effective.
(b) Standards, amendments to and interpretations 
of existing standards that are not yet effective
The following standards, amendments to and interpretations 
of existing standards have been published and are mandatory 
for accounting periods starting after 1 July 2014:
 ~ IAS19 Deﬁ ned Beneﬁ ts Plans: Employee Contributions – 
Effective 1 February 2015
 ~ IFRS9 Financial Instruments – Effective 1 January 2018
 ~ IFRS15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers – 
Effective 1 January 2017
 ~ Annual Improvements to IFRSs – 2011-2013 cycle – 
Effective 1 January 2015
It is not anticipated that the adoption of the above standards, 
amendments and interpretations will have a material impact 
on the Group or Company ﬁ nancial statements in the period 
of initial application.
1.2 Consolidation
The consolidated ﬁ nancial statements comprise the ﬁ nancial 
statements of the Group and its subsidiaries as at 30 June 2015. 
Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, 
to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and 
has the ability to affect those returns through its power over 
the investee. Speciﬁ cally the Group controls an investee if, and 
only if, the Group has a) power over the investee, b) exposure, 
or rights, to variable returns from the investee, and c) ability 
to use its power to affect those returns. The Group re-assesses 
whether or not it controls an investee if facts and 
circumstances indicate that there are changes to one 
or more of the three elements of control. 
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains 
on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. 
Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction 
provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. 
Accounting policies as applied to subsidiaries have been 
changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the 
policies adopted by the Group.
The Group has no material associates or joint ventures.
1.3 Business combinations and goodwill
Business combinations are accounted for using the 
acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured 
as the aggregate of the consideration transferred, measured 
at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any 
non-controlling interest in the acquiree. Acquisition costs 
incurred are expensed and included in administrative 
expenses within exceptional items. 
When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the ﬁ nancial 
assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classiﬁ cation 
and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, 
economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the 
acquisition date.   THE RANK GROUP PLC: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015  95
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the 
aggregate of the acquisition date fair value of the consideration 
transferred over the fair value of the net identiﬁ able amounts 
of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed in exchange 
for the business combination. Identiﬁ able intangible assets 
are recognised separately from goodwill.
If the aggregate of the acquisition date fair value of the 
consideration transferred is lower than the fair value of 
the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities in the business 
acquired, the difference is recognised in proﬁ t and loss. 
1.4 Revenue recognition 
Revenue consists of the fair value of sales of goods 
and services net of VAT, rebates and discounts.
(a) Gaming win
Revenue for casinos includes the gaming win before deduction 
of gaming-related duties. Revenue for bingo is net of prizes 
before deduction of gaming-related duties. Revenue for digital 
products, including interactive games, represents gaming win 
before deduction of gaming-related duties. The fair value of 
free bets, promotions and customer bonuses are also deducted 
from all revenue streams.
Although disclosed as revenue, gaming win (other than 
from poker and bingo) is accounted for and meets the 
deﬁ nition of a gain under IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement’.
(b) Food and beverage
Revenue from food and beverage sales is recognised 
at the point of sale. 
1.5 Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with 
the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision 
maker. The chief operating decision maker, who is responsible 
for allocating resources and assessing performance of the 
operating segments, has been identiﬁ ed as the management 
team (the composition of which is disclosed on page 48) 
that makes strategic and operational decisions.
1.6 Foreign currency translation
The consolidated ﬁ nancial statements are presented in UK 
Sterling, which is also the Company’s functional currency. 
Items included in the ﬁ nancial statements of each of the 
Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the 
primary economic environment in which the entity 
operates (‘the functional currency’). 
(a) Transactions and balances 
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional 
currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the 
transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from 
the settlement of such transactions and from the translation 
at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the 
income statement in ﬁ nance costs or income.
(b) Group companies
The results and ﬁ nancial position of all the Group companies 
(none of which has the currency of a hyper-inﬂ ationary 
economy) that have a functional currency different from 
the presentation currency are translated into the presentation 
currency as follows:
(i) assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are 
translated at the closing rate on the balance sheet date. 
The closing euro rate against UK Sterling was 1.41 (30 June 
2014: 1.25) and the closing US Dollar rate against UK Sterling 
was 1.57 (30 June 2014: 1.70);
(ii) income and expenses for each income statement are 
translated at average exchange rates unless this average is not 
a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the 
rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income 
and expenses are translated at the rates prevailing on the dates 
of the transactions. The average euro rate against UK Sterling 
was 1.32 (year ended 30 June 2014: 1.20) and the average US 
Dollar rate against UK Sterling in the year was 1.57 
(year ended 30 June 2014: 1.64); and
(iii) all resulting exchange differences are recognised 
as a separate component of equity.
When a foreign operation is sold, such exchange differences 
are recognised in the income statement, net of hedging, 
as part of the gain or loss on sale. Goodwill and fair value 
adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity 
are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and 
translated at the closing rate.
1.7 Financial assets
Financial assets within the scope of IAS 39 are classiﬁ ed 
as ﬁ nancial assets at fair value through proﬁ t or loss, loans 
and receivables, held to maturity investments, available 
for sale ﬁ nancial assets or as derivatives designated as 
hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate. 
The Group determines the classiﬁ cation of its ﬁ nancial 
assets at initial recognition.
A ﬁ nancial asset is derecognised when the rights to receive 
the cash ﬂ ows from the asset have expired, been transferred 
or an obligation to pay the cash ﬂ ows received to a third party 
without material delay has been assumed, and either:
 ~ Substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership have 
been transferred; or
 ~ Substantially all the risks and rewards have neither been 
retained nor transferred, but control has been transferred.
The Group’s ﬁ nancial assets include loans and receivables 
and cash and cash equivalents. Financial statements
96  THE RANK GROUP PLC: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015
1 General information and 
accounting policies – continued
(a) Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative ﬁ nancial assets 
with ﬁ xed or determinable payments that are not quoted 
in an active market. They are included in current assets, 
when the asset is expected to be realised in the normal 
operating cycle, otherwise they are classiﬁ ed as non-current 
assets. Loans and receivables are classiﬁ ed as other receivables 
in the balance sheet.
Other receivables are recognised initially at fair value 
and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method, less provision for impairment. 
(b) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and short-term deposits in the balance sheet include 
cash at banks and in hand and short-term deposits with 
an original maturity of three months or less.
For the purpose of the cash ﬂ ow statement, cash and cash 
equivalents consist of cash and short-term deposits as deﬁ ned 
above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts 
are shown within loans and borrowings in current liabilities 
on the balance sheet.
1.8 Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities within the scope of IAS 39 are classiﬁ ed 
as ﬁ nancial liabilities at fair value through proﬁ t or loss, 
loans and borrowings or as derivatives designated as hedging 
instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate. The Group 
determines the classiﬁ cation of its ﬁ nancial liabilities at 
initial recognition.
A ﬁ nancial liability is derecognised when the obligation 
under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires.
The Group’s ﬁ nancial liabilities include trade and other 
payables, loans and borrowings (including bank overdrafts), 
and ﬁ nancial guarantee contracts. 
(a) Trade and other payables
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method.
(b) Loans and borrowings
After initial recognition at fair value, interest bearing loans 
and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost 
using the effective interest rate method. Gains and losses are 
recognised in the income statement when the liabilities are 
derecognised as well as through the effective interest rate 
method amortisation process.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any 
discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that 
are an integral part of the effective interest rate method. 
The effective interest rate method amortisation is included 
in ﬁ nance costs in the income statement.
(c) Financial guarantee contracts (Company only)
Financial guarantee contracts issued by the Company are those 
contracts that require a payment to be made to reimburse the 
holder for a loss it incurs because the speciﬁ ed debtor fails to 
make a payment when due in accordance with the terms of a 
debt instrument. Financial guarantee contracts are initially 
measured at fair value by applying the estimated probability 
of default to the cash outﬂ ow should default occur and 
subsequently amortising over the expected length of the 
guarantee, to the extent that the guarantee is not expected 
to be called.
1.9 Leases
Leases are tested at inception to determine whether the lease is 
a ﬁ nance or operating lease and treated accordingly. Property 
leases comprising a lease of land and a lease of buildings 
within a single contract are split into their two component 
parts before testing.
(a) Finance leases
Leases of property, plant and equipment which transfer 
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the 
Group are classiﬁ ed as ﬁ nance leases. Finance leases are 
capitalised at the inception of the lease at the lower of the 
fair value of the leased property, plant and equipment or the 
present value of minimum lease payments. Each lease payment 
is allocated between the liability and ﬁ nance charges so as to 
achieve a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining 
balance of the liability for each period. The corresponding 
rental obligations, net of ﬁ nance charges, are included in loans 
and borrowings. Finance charges are recognised in the income 
statement. Property, plant and equipment acquired under 
ﬁ nance leases is depreciated over the shorter of the useful 
life of the asset or the lease term.
(b) Operating leases
Leases of property, plant and equipment which do not transfer 
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the 
Group are classiﬁ ed as operating leases. Operating lease 
payments (including any lease incentives or premiums) 
are recognised as an expense in the income statement on 
a straight line basis over the lease term.
1.10 Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present 
legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events if 
it is more likely than not that an outﬂ ow of resources will 
be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be 
reliably estimated. Provisions are measured at the best estimate 
of the expenditures required to settle the obligation. If the 
effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are 
discounted using a pre-tax rate that reﬂ ects, where appropriate, 
the risks speciﬁ c to the liability. Where discounting is used, 
the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is 
recognised as a ﬁ nance cost.
Notes to the ﬁ nancial statements – continued  THE RANK GROUP PLC: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015  97
1.11 Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of 
accumulated depreciation and impairment. Such cost includes 
expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of 
the items. Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying 
amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only 
when it is probable that future economic beneﬁ ts associated 
with the item will ﬂ ow to the Group and the cost of the item 
can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance are 
charged to the income statement during the ﬁ nancial period 
in which they are incurred. 
Depreciation is calculated on assets using the straight line 
method to allocate their cost less residual values over their 
estimated useful lives, as follows: 
 ~ freehold and leasehold  50 years or lease term
property   if less
 ~ refurbishment of property  5 to 20 years
 ~ ﬁ xtures, ﬁ ttings, plant and  3 to 20 years
machinery
Land is not depreciated.
Residual values and useful lives are reviewed at each balance 
sheet date, and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised 
upon disposal or when no future economic beneﬁ ts are 
expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on 
derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between 
the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) 
is included in the income statement. 
Pre-opening costs are expensed to the income statement 
as incurred.
1.12 Intangible assets
(a) Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition 
over the fair value of the Group’s share of the net identiﬁ able 
assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition. 
Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in 
intangible assets. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment 
and carried at amortised cost as at 1 January 2004 plus cost 
for any acquisition completed after 1 January 2004 less 
accumulated impairment losses. Gains and losses on the 
disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill 
relating to the entity sold, except where goodwill has been 
previously written off directly to reserves under previous GAAP.
Goodwill is allocated to the relevant cash-generating unit or 
group of cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment 
testing. A cash-generating unit is the smallest identiﬁ able 
group of assets that generates cash inﬂ ows that are largely 
independent of the cash inﬂ ows from other assets or 
groups of assets. 
(b) Casino and other gaming licences and concessions
The Group capitalises acquired casino and other gaming 
licences and concessions. Management believes that licences, 
with the exception of the two casino concessions in Belgium, 
have indeﬁ nite lives as there is no foreseeable limit to the 
period over which the licences are expected to generate net 
cash inﬂ ows and each licence holds a value outside the 
property in which it resides. Each licence is reviewed 
annually for impairment. 
In respect of the two casino concessions in Belgium, 
their carrying value is amortised over the expected useful 
life of the concessions.
Any costs in renewing licences or concessions are expensed 
as incurred.
(c) Property contracts
Property contracts arise on a fair value adjustment in respect of 
favourable property contracts on acquisitions. Such contracts 
are amortised over the lease term of the associated property.
(d) Other
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the 
basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the 
speciﬁ c software. These costs are amortised on a straight line 
basis over their estimated useful lives (three to ﬁ ve years).
Costs associated with maintaining computer software 
programmes are recognised as an expense as incurred. 
Costs that are directly associated with the production and 
development of identiﬁ able and unique software products 
controlled by the Group, and that will probably generate 
economic beneﬁ ts exceeding costs beyond one year, are 
recognised as intangible assets for both externally purchased 
and internally developed software. Direct costs include 
speciﬁ c employee costs for software development.
Computer software development costs recognised as assets are 
amortised over their estimated useful lives (three to ﬁ ve years). 
1.13 Impairment of intangible assets and property, 
plant and equipment 
Assets that have an indeﬁ nite useful life are not subject to 
amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. Assets 
that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment 
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that 
the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised as the amount by which 
an asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. 
The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value 
less costs of disposal and value in use. For the purposes of 
assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels 
for which there are separately identiﬁ able cash inﬂ ows 
(cash-generating units). The expected cash ﬂ ows generated 
by the assets are discounted using appropriate discount rates 
that reﬂ ect the time value of money and risks associated 
with the groups of assets. Financial statements
98  THE RANK GROUP PLC: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015
1 General information and 
accounting policies – continued
If an impairment loss is recognised, the carrying amount of 
the asset (cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable 
amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense in 
the income statement immediately.
Any impairment is allocated equally across all assets in a 
cash-generating unit unless there is an indication that a class 
of assets should be impaired in the ﬁ rst instance or a fair 
market value exists for one or more assets. Once an asset has 
been written down to its fair value less costs of disposal then 
any remaining impairment is allocated equally amongst all 
other assets. 
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying 
amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is increased to the 
revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but only to the 
extent that the increased carrying amount does not exceed 
the carrying amount that would have been determined 
had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset 
(cash-generating unit) in prior years. 
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in 
the income statement immediately.
1.14 Employee beneﬁ t costs 
(a) Pension obligations
The Group operates a deﬁ ned contribution plan under 
which the Group pays ﬁ xed contributions to a separate 
entity. The Group has no further payment obligations once 
the contributions have been paid. The contributions are 
recognised as employee beneﬁ t expense when they are due.
The Group also has an unfunded pension commitment 
relating to three former executives of the Group. The amount 
recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the commitment 
is the present value of the obligation at the balance sheet 
date, together with adjustment for actuarial gains or losses. 
The Group recognises actuarial gains and losses immediately 
in the statement of comprehensive income. The net cost 
arising on the commitment is recognised in net ﬁ nance costs.
(b) Share-based compensation
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees for 
awards is measured by reference to the fair value at the date 
on which they are granted. The fair value is determined by 
using an appropriate pricing model, further details of which 
are given in note 28.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together 
with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in 
which the performance and/or service conditions are fulﬁ lled 
(the vesting period). The cumulative expense recognised for 
equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the 
vesting date reﬂ ects the extent to which the vesting period has 
expired and the Group’s best estimate of the number of equity 
instruments that will ultimately vest. The income statement 
expense or credit for a period represents the movement in 
cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end 
of that period.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately 
vest, except for equity-settled transactions where vesting is 
conditional upon a market or non-vesting condition, which 
are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market 
or non-vesting condition is satisﬁ ed, provided that all other 
performance and/or service conditions are satisﬁ ed.
Where the terms of an equity-settled transaction award are 
modiﬁ ed, the minimum expense recognised is the expense 
as if the terms had not been modiﬁ ed, if the original terms 
of the award are met. An additional expense is recognised 
for any modiﬁ cation that increases the total fair value of the 
share-based payment transaction, or is otherwise beneﬁ cial 
to the employee as measured at the date of modiﬁ cation.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as 
if it vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not 
yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately. This 
includes any award where non-vesting conditions within 
the control of either the entity or the employee are not met. 
However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, 
and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is 
granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they 
were a modiﬁ cation of the original award, as described in 
the previous paragraph. All cancellations of equity-settled 
transaction awards are treated equally, regardless of 
whether the entity or the employee cancel the award.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reﬂ ected as 
additional share dilution in the computation of diluted 
earnings per share.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable 
transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal 
value) and share premium when the options are exercised.
The cost of cash-settled transactions is measured at fair value 
with the recognition of a corresponding liability. The liability 
is re-measured to fair value at each reporting date up to and 
including the settlement date. 
(c) Share-based compensation – Company
The Company operates share-based payment schemes for 
employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. The fair value 
of shares awarded to employees of the Company is recognised 
as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in 
equity. The Company also makes awards of its own shares to 
employees of its subsidiaries and as such recognises an increase 
in the cost of investment in its subsidiaries equivalent to the 
equity-settled share-based payment charge recognised in its 
subsidiaries’ ﬁ nancial statements with the corresponding 
credit being recognised directly in equity.
(d) Bonus plans
The Group recognises a liability in respect of the best estimate

1.15 Inventories 
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net 
realisable value. Cost of inventory is determined on 
a ‘ﬁ rst-in ﬁ rst-out’ basis.
The cost of ﬁ nished goods comprises goods purchased 
for resale.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the 
ordinary course of business. When necessary, provision 
is made for obsolete and slow-moving inventories.
1.16 Taxation
(a) Current tax
Current tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior 
periods are measured as the amount expected to be paid 
or to be recovered from the taxation authorities. The tax rates 
and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are 
enacted or substantively enacted, by the reporting date.
Current tax relating to items recognised directly in equity 
is recognised in equity and not the income statement.
Management evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with 
respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations are 
subject to interpretation at each reporting date and establishes 
provisions where appropriate.
(b) Deferred tax
Deferred tax is provided using the liability method on 
temporary differences arising between the tax bases of 
assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the 
ﬁ nancial statements. However, if deferred tax arises from 
the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction, 
other than a business combination, that at the time of the 
transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable proﬁ t or 
loss, it is not accounted for. Deferred tax is determined using 
tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply 
when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred 
tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is 
probable that future taxable proﬁ t will be available against 
which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is 
a legally enforceable right to set off current taxation assets 
against current taxation liabilities and it is the intention 
to settle these on a net basis.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on 
investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the 
timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled 
by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference 
will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
(c) Sales tax
Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the 
amount of sales tax except:
 ~ Where the sales tax incurred on a purchase of assets or 
services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, 
in which case the sales tax is recognised as part of the 
cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense 
item as applicable; and
 ~ Receivables and payables that are stated with the 
amount of sales tax included.
The net amount of sales tax recoverable from, or payable 
to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables 
or payables in the balance sheet.
1.17 Share capital
Ordinary shares are classiﬁ ed as equity. 
1.18 Discontinued operations and held for sale assets
Operations of the Group are recognised as discontinued 
operations if the operations have been disposed of or meet 
the criteria to be classiﬁ ed as held for sale and represent a 
separate major line of business or geographic area of 
operations. Operations held for sale are held at the lower of 
their carrying amount on the dates they are classiﬁ ed as held 
for sale and fair value less costs of disposal.
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classiﬁ ed as held for 
sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale 
transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition 
is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and 
the asset (or disposal group) is available for immediate sale in 
its present condition. Management must be committed to the 
sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a 
completed sale within one year from the date of classiﬁ cation.
1.19 Dividends
Dividends proposed by the board of directors and unpaid at 
the period end are not recognised in the ﬁ nancial statements 
until they have been approved by shareholders at the annual 
general meeting. Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
1.20 Exceptional items
The Group separately discloses those items which are 
required to give a full understanding of the Group’s ﬁ nancial 
performance and aid comparability of the Group’s result 
between periods. Exceptional items are typically those 
items which, by their size or nature in relation to the 
Group, or individual segments, are separately disclosed. Financial statements

The Group reports segmental information on a brand-led basis, which is consistent with the means by which the chief operating 
decision maker utilises internal reporting within the business. This brand-led structure better enables management to reﬂ ect 
the needs of our customers throughout the various activities of the business. These activities are both venues-based and digital-
based casino operations in Grosvenor Casinos, plus venues-based and digital-based bingo operations both in Mecca and our 
Spanish bingo brand Enracha. Further information about each brand is disclosed on pages 25 (Grosvenor Casinos), 29 (Mecca) 
and 31 (Enracha).
Assets and liabilities have not been segmented as this information is not provided to the chief operating decision maker 
on a regular basis.
Capital expenditure comprises expenditure on property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets, including 
those acquired under ﬁ nance leases. Financial statements

Impairment charges
The Group recognised impairment charges of £1.2m of which £0.6m relates to a Grosvenor Casinos venue and £0.6m to two 
Mecca venues. Performance at these venues has not been in line with expectations.
Impairment reversals
The Group reversed previous impairment charges of £0.7m in the UK, £0.3m of which related to a Grosvenor Casinos venue and 
£0.4m of which related to a Mecca venue. The reversal was in respect of venues where changes in the commercial environment 
had led to improvements in performance.
A further reversal of £0.8m was made in respect of a casino in Belgium which has shown continued improved performance 
above expectations.
A further reversal of £1.6m was recognised in respect of an Enracha venue which has shown continued improved performance 
following a competitor closure.
Net charge to provisions for property leases
The Group recognised a net charge of £1.5m in relation to provision for property leases in the year. This included a charge 
of £1.1m in two Grosvenor Casinos venues and £1.0m in respect of a Mecca venue for unavoidable dilapidations costs and 
where expected income no longer exceeds the unavoidable costs associated with these sites.
In addition a reversal of £0.6m has been made in respect of a Grosvenor Casinos venue where the provision has been reduced 
due to expected sublet income.
Further movements in the property lease provision are explained under closure of venues below.
Closure of venues
During the year the Group has closed, or committed to close, twelve venues. Nine of these venues are in Mecca, two are in 
Grosvenor Casinos and one is in Enracha. The credit in the period includes a reduction in the property lease provision required 
at two of these venues of £2.3m, an increase in the restructuring provision of £0.5m at three venues which are due to close in 
early 2015/16, an increase in the property lease provision for dilapidations of £0.7m at a single venue, and a proﬁ t on disposal 
of a freehold property of £0.6m.  THE RANK GROUP PLC: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015  105

Impairment charges
The Group recognised an impairment charge of £5.4m in the UK of which £4.3m related to Grosvenor Casinos venues and 
£1.1m to Mecca venues. The only individually signiﬁ cant charges were £4.1m in respect of a single club in Grosvenor Casinos 
venues and £0.7m in respect of a single club in Mecca venues. Performance at these clubs had not been in line with expectations.
A further impairment charge of £7.5m was recognised in respect of three clubs in the Enracha venues business which had 
not performed in line with expectations. This had followed a prolonged period of difﬁ cult economic conditions in Spain.
A further impairment charge of £1.0m was included within integration costs relating to essential post-acquisition capital 
expenditure, including signage, at a small number of casinos that were fully impaired as part of the acquisition accounting.
Impairment reversals
The Group reversed previous impairment charges of £0.7m in the UK, all of which related to Mecca venues. The reversal was 
in respect of two clubs where changes in the competitive and commercial environment led to improvements in performance.
A further reversal of £0.8m was made in respect of a casino in Belgium which had shown continuing improved performance 
above expectations.
Net charge to provisions for property leases
The Group recognised a net charge of £6.6m in relation to provisions for property leases. This included a charge of £6.8m in 
two Grosvenor Casinos venues and three Mecca venues for unavoidable dilapidation costs and where expected income no longer 
exceeded the unavoidable costs associated with these sites. A further charge of £1.6m was made in respect of property lease costs 
directly attributable to the closure of venues outlined below.
A release to the income statement of £1.8m was recognised in respect of two Mecca venues where anticipated performance, 
following the reduction in bingo duty, meant that expected income would exceed the unavoidable costs associated with these sites.
Acquisition and integration costs
In the year ended 30 June 2013 the Group acquired 19 casinos and three non-operating licences from Gala Coral Group Limited. 
The Group expensed the resulting costs of integration of £1.7m.
Closure of venues
The Group recognised an exceptional cost of £0.7m relating to the closure of one Mecca venue and one Enracha venue during 
the year and the provision for the further cost associated with the closure of two further Mecca venues and exit of one Enracha 
venue in early 2014/15. Included within the charge to provisions for property leases was a further charge of £1.6m connected 
with remaining property lease obligations at these venues.
Net charge to provision for indirect taxation
In the year ended 30 June 2013 the Group disclosed a contingent liability in respect of a claim for repayment of output VAT on 
amusement machines. In May 2010, the Group received £30.7m (VAT of £26.4m plus interest of £4.3m) in respect of the claim, 
which has been the subject of on-going litigation. During the year ended 30 June 2014, the Court of Appeal found in favour of 
HMRC and consequently an amount of £26.4m was provided to cover the expected outﬂ ow, together with associated interest 
of £4.3m. In May 2014 a payment was made to HMRC in respect of these claims, with the remaining balance being the directors’ 
best estimate of the outﬂ ow likely to arise.
The Group also released £0.3m following the settlement of indirect tax balances.
5 Discontinued operations
Discontinued operations, other than those disclosed within exceptional items (see note 4), relate to the historic disposal 
of the loss making Blue Square Bet business. Blue Square Bet had no impact on the income statement in the current or 
prior reporting periods. In the prior period the Group continued to discharge legacy liabilities relating to the business.

are in respect of tax balances provided for.
The £1.8m exceptional ﬁ nance income recognised in the prior year was in respect of the release of interest over-accrued 
on direct and indirect taxation balances provided for.
Exceptional ﬁ nance costs recognised in discontinued operations in the year of £0.4m relate to the cost of a letter of credit 
held in respect of taxation balances on disposed entities (see note 31). Exceptional discontinued ﬁ nance costs recognised 
in the prior year of £0.3m related to a decrease in interest receivable in respect of direct tax receivables that were attributable
 to disposed entities.
The exceptional ﬁ nance income recognised in discontinued operations in the prior period of £0.3m related to a reduction 
in interest accrued on indirect tax provisions now settled.

Factors affecting future taxation
UK corporation tax is calculated at 20.75% (year ended 30 June 2014: 22.5%) of the estimated assessable proﬁ t for the period. 
Taxation for overseas operations is calculated at the local prevailing rates.
On 20 March 2013, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced the reduction in the main rate of UK corporation 
tax to 21% with effect from 1 April 2014 and a further 1% reduction to 20% from 1 April 2015. These changes were 
substantively enacted in July 2013.
On 20 June 2014, the Spanish Government announced the reduction in the corporation tax rate in Spain from 30% to 28% 
for ﬁ nancial years beginning in 2015 and to 25% for ﬁ nancial years beginning in 2016. These changes were substantively 
enacted in November 2014.

(b) Diluted earnings per share
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue to assume 
conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. The only category of dilutive potential ordinary shares is share options. 
For share options, a calculation is made to determine the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value 
(determined as the average annual market share price of the Company’s shares) based on the monetary value of the 
subscription rights attached to outstanding share options. The number of shares calculated is compared with the 
number of shares that would have been issued assuming exercise of the share options.
There is no difference in the proﬁ t used to determine diluted earnings per share from that used to determine basic earnings 
per share. There is no dilutive impact of share options on the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue or on 
earnings per share.
(c) Adjusted earnings per share
Adjusted earnings is calculated by adjusting proﬁ t attributable to equity shareholders to exclude discontinued operations, 
exceptional items, other ﬁ nancial gains or losses, unwinding of the discount in disposal provisions and the related tax effects. 
Adjusted earnings is one of the business performance measures used internally by management to manage the operations of 
the business. Management believes that the adjusted earnings measure assists in providing a view of the underlying performance 
of the business.
Adjusted net earnings attributable to equity shareholders is derived as follows:

13 Impairment review
The pre-tax discount rates applied to the different segments of the business are as follows:
Segment Discount rate
Grosvenor Casinos venues 10.0%
Mecca venues 10.0%
Enracha venues 11.0%
Mecca digital 11.0%
In the year ended 30 June 2014 a pre-tax discount rate of 10.0% was applied to all segments.
The discount rate calculation is based on the speciﬁ c circumstances of the Group and its cash generating units (CGUs) and is 
derived from its weighted average cost of capital. 
a) Impairment review of goodwill and intangible assets with indeﬁ nite lives
Assets that have an indeﬁnite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. In accordance 
with IAS 36, goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment. In addition, the Group classiﬁ es casino licences (with the exception 
of its concessions in Belgium) and Spanish bingo licences as intangible assets with an indeﬁ nite life.
i) Goodwill
At 30 June 2015, the Group has goodwill with a carrying value of £134.3m (30 June 2014: £134.3m). 
Digital goodwill
£53.4m of goodwill arose on the acquisition of Rank Digital Limited. All of this goodwill is allocated to the Mecca digital 
CGU for the purposes of impairment testing. 
In respect of the Mecca digital CGU, the recoverable amount has been determined based on a value in use calculation using 
cash ﬂow projections based on the Group’s budget for 2015/16, the Group’s strategic plan for the following two years and a 
growth rate of 2.0% (30 June 2014: 2.0%) thereafter. Both the Group’s budget and strategic plan have been approved by the 
board of directors.
The key assumptions in the calculation of value in use are settled stakes, gaming win margins, gaming duty and the discount 
rate. Settled stakes represent monies placed by customers for interactive games and are estimated taking into account the product 
mix and industry developments. Gaming win margins are based on values achieved in the past and amended for any anticipated 
changes in the budget period. Gaming duty is based upon statutory rates enacted at the balance sheet date.
Notes to the ﬁ nancial statements – continued  THE RANK GROUP PLC: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015  113
As a result of the impairment testing, the directors do not believe that the carrying value of the goodwill was impaired as the 
value in use exceeded the carrying value of goodwill. The key factors which impact the calculation of the carrying value include:
Key factors Key assumption impacted
Increased or improved competition Settled stakes, Gaming win margin
Poor or decreased marketing activity Settled stakes
Failure to respond to technological advances Settled stakes
Deterioration in economic conditions Settled stakes
Changes in regulation Settled stakes, Gaming win margin
Changes in duties Gaming duty
Based on these key assumptions and resulting projections, the recoverable amount of the CGU exceeds its carrying amount by 
in excess of £74m. A decrease of approximately 14% in either settled stakes or win margin would be required for the recoverable 
amount to equal the carrying value of the CGU. A rise in gaming duty from 15% to approximately 23% would be required 
for the recoverable amount to equal the carrying value of the CGU. These calculations assume all other assumptions remain 
constant and therefore do not reﬂ ect any cost saving measures that may be identiﬁ ed should a key assumption be impacted 
to this magnitude. 
Casino goodwill
£80.9m of goodwill arose on the acquisition of 19 casinos from Gala Coral in May 2013. In respect of this goodwill, each casino 
is ﬁ rst treated as a separate CGU and tested for impairment in accordance with the policy set out below at 13(ii). The goodwill 
arising on the acquisition is then tested by treating the combined casinos as a single CGU. 
The recoverable amount has been determined based on a value in use calculation using cash ﬂ ow projections of the combined 
casinos from the Group’s budget for 2015/16, the Group’s strategic plan for the following two years and a growth rate of 2.0% 
(30 June 2014: 2.0%) thereafter. Both the Group’s budget and strategic plan have been approved by the board of directors.
The key assumptions in the calculation of value in use are customer visits, spend per visit, casino duty, machine games duty 
and the discount rate. Customer visits are the number of discrete visits by customers to casinos and have been based on historic 
trends. Spend per visit comprises the average amount of money (net of winnings) spent per visit on gaming tables, machines 
and food and beverages. This has also been determined by historic trends. Casino duty is levied in bands of between 15% and 
50% depending upon the level of gaming win at each casino. The bands and rates have been assumed to remain at current 
levels without indexation. Machine games duty is levied at rates of 5% or 20% depending upon certain criteria.
The table below outlines the possible changes in key assumptions that could cause the carrying value of goodwill to exceed 
its recoverable amount. These are:
Key factors Key assumption impacted
Increased or improved competition Customer visits
Poor or decreased marketing activity Customer visits
Failure to respond to technological advances Customer visits, Spend per visit
Deterioration in economic conditions Customer visits, Spend per visit
Changes in regulation Customer visits, Spend per visit
Changes in duties Casino duty, Machine games duty
Based on these key assumptions and resulting projections, the recoverable amount of the CGU exceeds its carrying amount by 
£76m. A decrease of approximately 5% in either customer visits or spend per visit would be required for the recoverable amount 
to equal the carrying value of the CGU. A rise in gaming-related taxes from the current blended rate of 17.5% to 26.9% across 
the combined casinos would be required for the recoverable amount to equal the carrying value of the CGU. These calculations 
assume all other assumptions remain constant and therefore do not reﬂ ect any cost saving measures that may be identiﬁ ed 
should a key assumption be impacted to this magnitude.
ii) Casino licences
The carrying value of indeﬁ nite life casino licences as at 30 June 2015 was £231.9m (30 June 2014: £231.3m). 
The inherent value of a casino licence is deemed to be an intrinsic part of the value of the operation of a casino as a whole 
and is therefore not split out from each casino in an impairment review. Each casino has been treated as a separate CGU, 
and tested for impairment on that basis. The recoverable amount of each casino, including the licence, has been determined 
based on the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. The value in use has been determined using cash ﬂ ow 
projections, over the length of the associated lease or 50 years for freehold properties, based on the Group’s budget for 2015/16, 
the Group’s strategic plan for the following two years and a growth rate of 2.0% (30 June 2014: 2.0%) thereafter. Both the 
Group’s budget and strategic plan have been approved by the board of directors. Estimates of the fair value less costs of 
disposal are performed internally by experienced senior management supported by knowledge of similar transactions or, 
where applicable, offers received. Financial statements
114  THE RANK GROUP PLC: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015
13 Impairment review – continued
The key assumptions in the calculation of value in use are customer visits, spend per visit, casino duty, machine games duty and 
the discount rate. Customer visits are the number of discrete visits by customers to the casino and have been based on historic 
trends. Spend per visit comprises the average amount of money (net of winnings) spent per visit on gaming tables, machines 
and food and beverages. This has also been determined by historic trends. Casino duty is levied in bands of between 15% and 
50% depending upon the level of gaming win at each casino. The bands and rates have been assumed to remain at current 
levels without indexation. Machine games duty is levied at rates of 5% or 20% depending upon certain criteria. 
The table below outlines the possible changes in key assumptions that could cause the carrying value of individual licences 
to exceed their recoverable amount. These are:
Key factors Key assumption impacted
Increased or improved competition Customer visits
Poor or decreased marketing activity Customer visits
Failure to respond to technological advances Customer visits, Spend per visit
Deterioration in economic conditions Customer visits, Spend per visit
Changes in regulation Customer visits, Spend per visit
Changes in duties Casino duty, Machine games duty
As outlined above, each casino licence has been tested for impairment as part of the club as a whole. The level by which the 
recoverable amount of each CGU exceeds its carrying amount therefore varies at each venue and the impact of changes in key 
assumptions that would be required for the recoverable amount to equal its carrying amount also varies at each casino. For UK 
casino licences at venues, the directors do not believe that, with the exception of a prolonged non-operation of a UK casino 
licence, there are any reasonably foreseeable changes to the key assumptions that would result in a material impairment. 
No impairment charges were made during the year against indeﬁ nite life casino licences (year ended 30 June 2014: £nil).
The two casino concessions in Belgium are being amortised over their expected useful life. At 30 June 2015 these concessions 
had a carrying value of £4.2m (30 June 2014: £4.8m). Each of the casino concessions has also been treated as a separate CGU 
for impairment testing purposes. As a result of this review an impairment reversal of £0.8m has been recognised in respect 
of one concession.
iii) Spanish bingo licences
The carrying value of Spanish bingo licences as at 30 June 2015 was £5.0m (30 June 2014: £3.8m).
The inherent value of each Spanish bingo licence is deemed to be an intrinsic part of the value of a club as a whole and is 
not therefore split out from the assets of each individual bingo club in an impairment review. Each individual bingo club has 
been treated as a separate CGU, and tested for impairment on that basis. The recoverable amount of each Spanish bingo club, 
including the licence, has been determined based on the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. The value 
in use calculation has been determined using cash ﬂ ow projections, over the length of the associated lease or 50 years in the 
case of freehold properties, based on the Group’s budget for 2015/16, the Group’s strategic plan for the following two years 
and a growth rate of 2.0% (30 June 2014: nil growth), thereafter.
The key assumptions in the calculation of value in use are customer visits, spend per visit, bingo duty and the discount rate. 
Customer visits are the number of discrete visits to the bingo club and have been based on recent trends. Spend per visit 
comprises the average amount of money (net of winnings) spent by a member on bingo games, machines and food and 
beverages. This has been determined by recent trends. Bingo duty is based upon statutory rates enacted at the balance sheet date. 
As a result of the impairment review, an impairment reversal of £1.8m (30 June 2014: £nil) has been recognised against the value 
in use of one bingo licence. However, there are possible changes in the key assumptions that could cause further impairments. 
These are:
Key factors Key assumption impacted
Increased or improved competition Customer visits
Poor or decreased marketing activity Customer visits
Failure to respond to technological advances Customer visits, Spend per visit
Deterioration in economic conditions Customer visits, Spend per visit
Changes in regulation Customer visits, Spend per visit
Changes in duties Bingo duty
As outlined above, each Spanish bingo licence has been tested for impairment as part of the club as a whole. Accordingly, the 
sensitivity of each licence to future impairments, arising from changes in the key assumptions, varies at each club. For the clubs 
previously impaired, each one percentage point reduction in expected future cash ﬂ ow projections would generate an 
incremental impairment of £0.1m.
Notes to the ﬁ nancial statements – continued  THE RANK GROUP PLC: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015  115
b) Impairment review of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets
Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are grouped into CGUs which are deﬁ ned as individual venues for Mecca, 
Enracha and Grosvenor Casinos and as the Grosvenor Casino digital and Mecca digital businesses. Each CGU is assessed for 
indicators of impairment, such as a signiﬁ cant deterioration in trade, and if appropriate a full impairment review is performed.
The key assumptions and sensitivities in the impairment reviews are the same as outlined above for intangible assets.
The recoverable amount of each CGU, including the licence if applicable, has been determined based on the higher of fair value 
less costs of disposal and value in use. The value in use has been determined using cash ﬂow projections from the Group’s budget 
for 2015/16, the Group’s strategic plan for the following two years and a growth rate of 2.0% (30 June 2014: 2.0%) thereafter. 
Both the Group’s budget and strategic plan have been approved by the board of directors. Estimates of the fair value less costs 
of disposal are performed internally by an experienced surveyor supported by external estate agent advice or, where applicable, 
offers received.

The Company has recognised an impairment reversal of £259.9m following a period of sustained improvement in earnings, 
combined with an increase in net assets, used as a basis for the annual impairment review of the carrying value of the 
Company’s investments in subsidiary undertakings. Of the total reversal of £259.9m, £159.8m has been released to an 
unrealised proﬁ t reserve where it was originally charged.

The directors consider that the carrying value of other receivables and convertible loan notes approximate to their fair value.
As at 30 June 2015, other receivables of £nil (30 June 2014: £0.1m) were past due but not impaired.
The creation and release of provisions for impaired receivables have been included in other operating costs in the income 
statement. Amounts charged to the provision for impairment are generally written off when there is no expectation of 
recovering additional cash.
The other classes within receivables do not contain impaired assets.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the fair value of each class of receivable mentioned above. 
The Group does not hold any collateral as security.
The Group holds a convertible loan note issued by a third party gaming platform provider during the year. At 30 June 2015, 
£2.4m has been paid out of a total of £3.5m payable under the agreement. The Group has the option to convert the loan 
note into 17.5% of the issued share capital of the platform provider at any time prior to June 2018. If conversion does not 
take place then the loan note is repayable in full in January 2019.
Company
The carrying values of amounts due from subsidiary undertakings are assumed to equate to their fair value as all amounts 
are repayable on demand. The amounts are denominated in UK Sterling and relate to subsidiary undertakings for which 
there is no history of default.  THE RANK GROUP PLC: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015  117

current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. The following methods and assumptions 
were used to estimate the fair values:
 ~ Cash and short-term deposits, other receivables, bank overdrafts and other ﬁ nancial liabilities approximate to their carrying 
amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments;
 ~ The fair value of ﬁ xed rate borrowings is based on price quotations at the reporting date;
 ~ The fair values of ﬂ oating rate borrowings and obligations under ﬁ nance leases approximate their carrying amounts; and
 ~ The fair values of onerous property leases and lease disposal settlements approximate their carrying amounts as they are 
discounted at current rates. Financial statements
120  THE RANK GROUP PLC: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015
20 Financial risk management objectives and policies
Financial risk factors
The Group’s principal ﬁ nancial liabilities comprise loans and borrowings and trade and other payables. The main purpose 
of these ﬁ nancial liabilities is to ﬁ nance the Group’s operations. The Group has other receivables and cash and short-term 
deposits that derive directly from its operations.
The Group is exposed to market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group’s overall ﬁ nancial risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of ﬁ nancial markets and seeks 
to minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’s ﬁ nancial performance.
The Group’s senior management oversees the management of these risks. The ﬁ nance committee is supported by the 
Group’s senior management that advises on ﬁ nancial risks and the appropriate ﬁ nancial risk governance framework for the 
Group. The ﬁ nance committee provides assurance that the Group’s ﬁ nancial risk-taking activities are governed by appropriate 
policies and procedures and the ﬁ nancial risks are identiﬁ ed, measured and managed in accordance with Group policies and 
Group risk appetite.
The board of directors reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below.
(a) Market risk
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash ﬂ ows of a ﬁ nancial instrument will ﬂ uctuate because of changes 
in market prices. Financial instruments affected by market risk include loans and borrowings and deposits.
The sensitivity analyses in the following sections relate to the positions at 30 June 2015 and 30 June 2014.
The sensitivity analyses have been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of ﬁ xed to ﬂ oating rates 
of the debt and the proportion of ﬁ nancial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant.
(i) Foreign currency risk
Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash ﬂ ows of a ﬁ nancial instrument will ﬂ uctuate because of 
changes in foreign exchange rates. The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily 
to the Group’s operating activities (when revenue or expense is denominated in a different currency from the Group’s 
functional currency) and the Group’s net investments in foreign subsidiaries.
Group policy is not to hedge foreign currency risk.
Foreign currency sensitivity
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of a possible change in the US Dollar and euro, with all other variables held 
constant, to the Group’s proﬁ t before tax and the Group’s equity. The effect on equity, other than the effect of proﬁ t before 
tax, includes the impact of translation of overseas subsidiaries. The Group’s exposure to foreign currency changes for all 
other currencies is not material.

(ii) Cash ﬂ ow and fair value interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash ﬂ ows of a ﬁ nancial instrument will ﬂ uctuate because of changes 
in market interest rates. The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Group’s 
obligations with ﬂ oating interest rates.
Historically, the Group had managed its interest rate risk by having a balanced portfolio of ﬁ xed and variable rate loans 
and borrowings. Due to the current economic climate the Group has exercised its right to operate outside the Group policy 
of maintaining between 40% and 60% of its borrowings at ﬁ xed rates of interest. At 30 June 2015, 14% of the Group’s 
borrowings were at a ﬁ xed rate of interest (30 June 2014: 13%).

(iii) Interest rate sensitivity
The table below demonstrates the sensitivity to a possible change in interest rates on income and equity for the year 
when this movement is applied to the carrying value of loans, borrowings, cash and short-term deposits.

Sterling:
100 basis point increase 0.8 1.6
200 basis point increase 1.6 3.2
There was no impact on equity in either year as a consequence of loan arrangements.
Due to current low interest rates, any further decline would not have a material impact on income and equity for the year. 
As such, sensitivity to a decrease in interest rates has not been presented.
The Group did not enter into any ﬁ xed-to-ﬂ oating or ﬂ oating-to-ﬁ xed interest rate swaps in either year.
(b) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a ﬁ nancial instrument or customer contract, 
leading to a ﬁ nancial loss. The Group is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily for other receivables) 
and from its ﬁ nancing activities, including deposits with banks and ﬁ nancial institutions, foreign exchange transactions 
and other ﬁ nancial instruments.
Financial instruments and cash deposits
Credit risk from balances with banks and ﬁ nancial institutions is managed by the Group’s treasury department in accordance 
with the Group’s policy. Investments of surplus funds are made only with approved counterparties and within credit limits 
assigned to each counterparty. Counterparty credit limits are reviewed by the ﬁ nance director, and may be updated throughout 
the year subject to the approval of the Group’s ﬁ nance committee. The limits are set to minimise the concentration of risks 
and therefore mitigate ﬁ nancial loss through potential counterparty failure.
The credit worthiness of each counterparty is checked against independent credit ratings on at least a weekly basis, 
with a minimum rating of ‘BB’ required. The Group predominantly invests with its lending banks when appropriate.
Sales to retail customers are settled in cash or using major credit cards and therefore the exposure to credit risk is 
not considered signiﬁ cant.
No credit limits were exceeded during the reporting period and management does not expect any material losses 
from non-performance of its counterparties.
(c) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not have sufﬁ cient funds to meet its liabilities. Cash forecasts identifying the 
liquidity requirements of the Group are produced three times a year. The cash forecasts are sensitivity tested for different 
scenarios and are reviewed regularly. Forecast ﬁ nancial headroom and debt covenant compliance are reviewed monthly 
during the month-end process to ensure sufﬁ cient ﬁ nancial headroom exists for at least a 12-month period.
Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying businesses, Group treasury aims to maintain ﬂ exibility in funding by keeping 
committed credit lines available. A three-year strategic forecast is prepared annually to facilitate planning for future ﬁ nancing 
needs. Management actively manages the Group’s ﬁ nancing requirements and the range of maturities on its debt.
The Group’s core debt facilities are the £80.0m (30 June 2014: £80.0m) bank facility comprising four £20.0m bi-lateral 
bank facilities, and the £120.0m (30 June 2014: £140.0m) bank facility comprising two £60.0m bi-lateral bank facilities. 
The Group proactively manages its relationships with its lending group.
The funding policy of the Group is to maintain, as far as practicable, a broad portfolio of debt diversiﬁ ed by source 
and maturity, and to maintain committed facilities sufﬁ cient to cover seasonal peak anticipated borrowing requirements. Financial statements

Interest payments on the interest-bearing loans and borrowings have been projected until the instruments mature.
1 The bank facility interest payments were based on current LIBOR rates as at the reporting date.
Capital management
The Group’s objective when managing capital is to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Group 
deﬁ nes shareholders’ equity and net debt as capital. In order to protect the capital structure of the Group the directors ensure 
that there is continuing access to debt facilities and manage the borrowing costs of those facilities.
Consistent with others in the gaming industry, the Group monitors capital on the basis of leverage ratio. The ratio is calculated 
as net debt divided by EBITDA. Net debt is calculated as total borrowings (including ‘loans and borrowings’ as shown in the 
consolidated balance sheet) less cash and short-term deposits, accrued interest and unamortised facility fees. EBITDA is 
calculated as operating proﬁ t before exceptional items, depreciation and amortisation from continuing operations.
The leverage ratios at 30 June 2015 and 30 June 2014 were as follows:

30 June 2015

30 June 2014

Operating proﬁ t before exceptionals 84.0 72.4
Add: Depreciation and amortisation 42.3 43.6
EBITDA 126.3 116.0
Leverage ratio 0.4 1.2
Taking into consideration both the Group’s capital investment requirements and the stability of the wider economic 
environment, the Group considers its progressive dividend policy to be appropriate.
Collateral
The Group did not pledge or hold any collateral at 30 June 2015 (30 June 2014: £nil).
Company
The Company is exposed to credit risk on amounts owed by related undertakings. The performance of all subsidiary 
undertakings of the Group is monitored at Group level, including frequent projections of future performance to ensure funding 
to related undertakings provides a suitable return and remains recoverable. Where losses are forecast, actions are taken to 
mitigate the loss and maximise the recoverability of receivables.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the fair value of its receivables of £45.7m (30 June 2014: £44.2m).
The Company does not have any other signiﬁ cant exposure to ﬁ nancial risks.  THE RANK GROUP PLC: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015  123

Provisions have been based on management’s best estimate of the future cash ﬂ ows, taking into account the risks associated 
with each obligation.
Property lease provisions
The Group is party to a number of leasehold property contracts. Provision has been made against those leases where the property 
or part of the property is now vacant and the unavoidable costs under the lease exceed the economic beneﬁt expected to be 
derived from potential sub-letting arrangements. Provision has also been made against leases where impairment testing has 
indicated that, after recognising an impairment charge, the estimated discounted cash ﬂ ows derived from the property and 
its associated operations are insufﬁ cient to cover the unavoidable lease costs and the lease is therefore deemed onerous. 
These leases have a weighted average unexpired life of 22 years (30 June 2014: 24 years). Of the provision totalling £47.6m, 
£27.6m will be utilised over periods ranging from one to 18 years; and the remaining £20.0m will be utilised over periods 
from one to in excess of 24 years.
Disposal provisions
Provision has been made for legacy industrial disease and personal injury claims, deferred payments arising from the settlement 
of property lease obligations and other directly attributable costs arising as a consequence of the sale or closure of the businesses. 
The timing of any personal injury claims is uncertain and therefore these claims have been included in the maturity analysis 
based on management’s best estimates. The disposal provisions held comprise the following:

Restructuring provisions
The restructuring provision relates to the costs associated with the closure of three Mecca venues early in 2015/16.
Indirect tax provision
The indirect tax provision relates to the Group’s VAT claim on amusement machines. The balance of £1.2m represents 
the directors’ best estimate of the outﬂ ow likely to arise. Financial statements

During the year ended 30 June 2015, the Company operated an equity settled Long-Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’). 
Further details of the LTIP are included in the remuneration report on pages 72 and 73. The LTIP is an equity settled scheme 
and details of the movements in the number of shares are shown below:

As at 30 June 2015 As at 30 June 2014
Weighted average remaining life 3.2 years 2.1 years
Weighted average fair value for shares granted during the year 164.0p 71.3p
The LTIP awards granted during the year vest in three tranches: 45% in December 2017, 30% in December 2018 and 25% 
in December 2019. All LTIP awards have £nil exercise price.
The LTIP awards in issue at the start of the year were surrendered, and replaced by the awards granted during the year. 
The surrendered awards had nil value at the point they were surrendered.
The fair value of the LTIP awards granted during the year is based on the market value of the share award at grant date less 
the expected value of dividends forgone.
In the prior year, when market based performance conditions existed, the fair value of LTIP awards granted was calculated using 
a Monte Carlo simulation which allowed for the incorporation of market performance conditions. The following table lists the 
inputs used in the share awards in the prior year:
30 June 2014
Risk free interest rate (%) 0.34-1.40
Dividend yield (%) 3.20
Expected volatility (%) 31.00
Vesting period (Years) 1-3
Weighted average share price (p) 140.50
The expected volatility reﬂ ects the assumption that the historical volatility over a period similar to the life of the award is 
indicative of future trends, which may not necessarily be the actual outcome.
In both years, to the extent that grants are subject to non-market based performance conditions, the expense recognised is 
based on expectations of these conditions being met, which are reassessed at each balance sheet date.
The Group recognised a £1.1m charge (year ended 30 June 2014: £0.5m credit) in operating proﬁ t from accounting for 
share-based payments and related National Insurance in accordance with IFRS 2.
National Insurance contributions are payable in respect of some share-based payments. These contributions are payable on 
the date of exercise based on the intrinsic value of the share-based payments, and as such are treated as cash-settled awards. 
Of the charge in the year, £0.1m (year ended 30 June 2014: £0.1m credit) is in respect of such cash-settled awards. The Group 
has recorded liabilities at 30 June 2015 of £0.1m (30 June 2014: £nil). Financial statements

Deﬁ ned contribution scheme
The Group operates the Rank Group Stakeholder Pension Plan (‘the Plan’) which is externally funded and the Plan’s assets are 
held separately from Group assets. During the year ended 30 June 2015, the Group contributed a total of £4.1m (year ended 
30 June 2014: £4.3m) to the Plan. There were no signiﬁ cant contributions outstanding at the balance sheet date in either year.
Other pension commitment
The Group has an unfunded pension commitment relating to three former executives of the Group. At 30 June 2015, the 
Group’s commitment was £3.8m (30 June 2014: £3.4m). The Group paid £0.1m (year ended 30 June 2014: £0.1m) in pension 
payments during the year. The net cost arising on the commitment of £nil (year ended 30 June 2014: £nil) has been recognised 
in other ﬁ nancial losses in the income statement. The actuarial loss arising on the commitment, resulting from the changes in 
assumptions outlined below in the year, was £0.5m (year ended 30 June 2014: £0.4m) before taxation and £0.4m after taxation 
(year ended 30 June 2014: £0.3m).

31 Contingent assets
Group
Discontinued taxation
During the year the Group released an amount of £16.9m from income tax payable (see note 7) following the successful 
conclusion of a tax exposure relating to a discontinued operation in an overseas jurisdiction. In addition, the Group has 
been advised that it could receive a refund of between £2.5m to £4.0m in respect of amounts previously paid.
The Group has not recognised any gain in the ﬁ nancial statements at 30 June 2015 in respect of the potential refund.
32 Contingent liabilities
Group
Property leases
Concurrent to the £211m sale and leaseback in 2006, the Group transferred the rights and obligations but not the legal titles of 
44 property leases to a third party. The Group remains potentially liable in the event of default by the third party. Should default 
occur then the Group would have recourse to two guarantors. It is understood that, of the original 44 leases transferred, 11 of 
these have not expired or been surrendered. These 11 leases have durations of between 17 months and 98 years and a current 
annual rental obligation (net of sub-let income) of approximately £1.1m.
During the prior year, the Group became aware of certain information in respect of a change in the ﬁ nancial position of the 
third party and one of the guarantors. However, the Group has not to date been notiﬁ ed of any default, or intention to default, 
in respect of the transferred leases.
Stamp duty
The Group has received from HMRC a determination in respect of the amount of stamp duty payable on certain transactions 
undertaken by Gala Casino 1 Limited (now Grosvenor Casinos (GC) Limited) before its acquisition by the Group on 12 May 
2013. The Group estimates the maximum potential additional stamp duty that could be due if HMRC are successful to be £7.2m 
plus interest. Under the terms of the Sale and Purchase Agreement the vast majority of any liability arising falls upon Gala Coral 
and the Group has further indemniﬁ cation in the event of default by Gala Coral.
Company
At 30 June 2015, the Company has made guarantees to subsidiary undertakings of £129.9m (30 June 2014: £170.3m).

Registrar
All administrative enquiries relating to shares should, in the

reference number 1235) and clearly state the registered 
shareholder’s name and address. Please write to The Rank 
Group Plc Registrar, Equiniti Limited, Aspect House, Spencer 
Road, Lancing, West Sussex BN99 6DA (Tel: from the UK 
0871 384 2098* and from outside the UK +44 121 415 7047).

Shareview
The Shareview portfolio service from the Company’s registrar 
gives shareholders more control of their Rank shares and other 
investments including:
 ~ direct access to data held for them on the share register 
including recent share movements and dividend details;
 ~ a recent valuation of their portfolio; and
 ~ a range of information and practical help for shareholders 
including how they can elect to receive communications 
electronically.
It is easy and free to set up a portfolio – shareholders will just 
need the shareholder reference printed on their proxy form 
or dividend stationery. Please visit the following website for 
more details: www.shareview.co.uk.
Payment of dividends
The Company is no longer operating a dividend re-investment 
plan. Shareholders may ﬁ nd it more convenient to make 
arrangements to have dividends paid directly to their bank 
account. The advantages of this are that the dividend is 
credited to a shareholder’s bank account on the payment 
date, there is no need to present cheques for payment and 
there is no risk of cheques being lost in the post.
To set up a dividend mandate or to change an existing 
mandate please contact Equiniti Limited, our registrar, whose 
contact details are above. Alternatively, shareholders who use 
Equiniti’s Shareview can log on to www.shareview.co.uk and 
follow the online instructions.

Capital gains tax
For the purpose of calculating UK capital gains tax on a 
disposal of ordinary shares in the Company held since 
31 March 1982 (including shares held in the predecessor 
company, The Rank Organisation Plc), the price of the 
Company’s ordinary shares at that date was 190p per share. 
This price should be adjusted for the effects of the rights issue 
in January 1990, the enhanced share alternative in July 1993, 
the sub-division and consolidation of shares in March 1994, 
the enhanced scrip dividend in March 1998, and the 18 for 
25 sub-division and share consolidation (aligned with the 65p 
special dividend payment) which took place in March 2007. 
More information regarding these adjustments is available 
on the www.rank.com website.
Shareholder security
We are aware that some of our shareholders have received 
unsolicited telephone calls concerning their Rank shares.  
These communications tend to be from overseas-based 
‘brokers’ who offer a premium price for your Rank shares but 
ask you to make an upfront payment, typically in the form of 
an insurance bond.  We recommend that before paying any 
money you:
 ~ obtain the name of the person and ﬁ rm contacting you;
 ~ check the FCA register at www.fca.org.uk/register/ to ensure 
they are authorised;
 ~ use the details on the FCA Register to contact the ﬁ rm;
 ~ call the FCA Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768 if there 
are no contact details on the FCA Register or you are told 
they are out of date; and
 ~ search the FCA’s list of unauthorised ﬁ rms and individuals 
to avoid doing business with: www.fca.org.uk/consumers/
protect-yourself/unauthorised-ﬁ rms/unauthorised-ﬁ rms-
to-avoid
If you use an unauthorised ﬁ rm to buy or sell shares or other 
investments, you will not have access to the Financial 
Ombudsman Service or Financial Services Compensation 
Scheme (FSCS) if things go wrong.

We recommend that you report any attempted share frauds to 
the authorities since providing information with regard to how 
the fraudsters have contacted and dealt with you will assist the 
authorities in understanding the fraudsters’ way of operating 
so as to enable them to disrupt and prevent these activities 
and prosecute them.

Syntopix Group plc Annual report and accounts 2006
Introduction
We are pleased to report our maiden preliminary results following 
Syntopix Group plc’s successful listing on AIM on the London Stock Exchange 
in March 2006. These results cover the 12 month period from 1 August 2005 
to 31 July 2006. During the period under review, and post the period end, 
Syntopix has made excellent progress in its drug discovery and development 
activities and in the corporate development of the Group.
Our business
Syntopix’s objective is to develop products to address dermatology diseases, 
in particular acne and superﬁcial staphylococcal infections, including those 
due to MRSA. Our strategy is to identify individual antimicrobial compounds 
and synergistic combinations of compounds that already have a history 
of safe use in man, possibly in other indications. This strategy is likely to 
reduce the high risks and costs of early drug discovery, and reduce the 
time to market when compared with conventional drug development. 
Central to the delivery of the Group’s strategy is a novel screening process 
that combines validated antimicrobial and pharmacological tests, allowing 
early identiﬁcation of active compounds and combinations of compounds 
enabling the most promising compounds to be fast-tracked as lead candidates 
for further studies. Syntopix has already identiﬁed three lead candidates for 
development, and is now progressing these into preliminary clinical studies 
and formulation, with clinical studies expected to commence in 2007. 
The Group has patent applications progressing covering the compounds 
being taken into development.
The Group believes the dermatology market, with estimated global sales 
of more than $10 billion, is particularly attractive, in part because major 
pharmaceutical companies have chosen in general to focus their activities 
on other larger therapeutic areas. As a result there has been a lack of 
innovation in dermatology along with clear evidence of unmet medical 
need, creating signiﬁcant opportunities for the Group. 
Syntopix also carries out some consultancy and contract research 
services for companies in the dermatology area. These services are 
valuable in nurturing relationships with potential commercial/licensing 
partners. They maintain Syntopix’s visibility with such companies but 
the revenues from these services are not planned to be signiﬁcant.
The commercialisation strategy at Syntopix is to out-license its products 
to signiﬁcant players in dermatology for sales and marketing following 
proof of concept clinical studies that will be carried out by the Group 
or phase II clinical studies as appropriate. 
Chairman’s statement
Syntopix has made excellent progress in its drug   discovery and development activities 
“ The last twelve months have been exciting for Syntopix. The Group has proved 
that its screening methodology identiﬁes strong candidate products. It has 
consolidated its laboratory capability and moved its operations to Bradford. 
It has a strong patent portfolio and is now progressing its lead candidates 
into pre-clinical development.”

The Board
In early January 2006 Dr Helen Shaw joined the Board of Syntopix Ltd  
as a Non-Executive Director. Helen has many years of experience as 
Medical Director at Boots Healthcare International, and brings valuable 
clinical and drug development experience to Syntopix. In July 2006, we 
also recruited Dr Stephen Jones to the Group as Chief Operating Ofﬁcer. 
Stephen, who was also appointed to the Board, is a highly experienced 
pharmaceutical executive with a track record in both branded medicine 
and consumer healthcare and a successful history of new product 
development. He was most recently at GlaxoSmithKline where he held the 
position of Vice President and Director of Consumer Healthcare Research 
and Development.
Financials
In March 2006 the Group raised £3.3 million of new capital, net of expenses, 
and was admitted to AIM on the London Stock Exchange. This capital will allow 
the Group to progress its candidate drug products through pre-clinical 
studies and into clinical trials for out-licensing to partners. The spend proﬁle 
of the Group is as expected, with modest growth of in-house research 
expenditure. In October 2005 the Group moved its operations to the 
Institute for Pharmaceutical Innovation at the University of Bradford, which 
offers excellent laboratory facilities sufﬁcient for the foreseeable future 
needs of the Group. This move was very cost-effective, as the Group’s 
rent is lower, and it also qualiﬁes Syntopix for both European and regional 
grant support. 
Outlook
The last twelve months have been exciting for Syntopix. The Group has proved 
that its screening methodology identiﬁes strong candidate products. It has 
consolidated its laboratory capability and moved its operations to Bradford. 
It has a strong patent portfolio and is now progressing its lead candidates into 
preliminary clinical development. Syntopix has a strong capability to develop 
a pipeline of innovative dermatological products. The funding is now in place 
to drive its product candidates through the clinic and into commercial 
relationships with the objective of realising signiﬁcant value for shareholders.

Syntopix Group plc Annual report and accounts 2006
Introduction
Over the last twelve months Syntopix has made signiﬁcant progress 
in the discovery and development of innovative drug candidates for 
the treatment of acne and staphylococcal skin infections, our principal 
areas of focus in the dermatology market. Syntopix, which was founded 
in 2003, has dedicated its resources to the discovery and development 
of therapeutic products against these indications and we believe the 
Group is well positioned to create new and much needed therapies.
The global market for our products is reasonably large with acne 
accounting for some 22% of skin disease, or approximately $3.3 billion 
in value. Acne has been largely regarded as a teenage condition but 
increasingly recognised problems of late-onset and persistent acne 
are expanding the potential market size. Superﬁcial Staphylococcus 
aureus infections account for some 5% of the market, with a value 
of approximately $0.75 billion.
During the period under review we have continued to successfully 
screen combinations of compounds from our library of approximately 
1,000 compounds and now have a pipeline of candidates that have shown 
synergistic actions against Propionibacterium acnes and/or S. aureus. 
To date, management of superﬁcial Staphylococcus aureus infections 
and prophylaxis of nasal carriage continues to rely heavily upon antibiotics 
with associated concerns about rising resistance rates. Our approach, 
which uses synergistic combinations of antimicrobial compounds, has 
the potential to mitigate the problem of drug resistance.
The Group has carried out consultancy and contract work for other 
pharmaceutical companies throughout the year. Although the revenue has 
been modest at £31,914 (2005: £61,156) the relationships formed with the 
companies for which we have carried out this work could be the basis for 
future partnerships or collaborations. Discussions have also taken place 
with several potential partners in other pharmaceutical companies who 
have interests in the dermatological area. 
Discovery and development
During the year we have made signiﬁcant scientiﬁc advances, culminating 
in the selection of three lead candidates from our portfolio to enter 
formulation and pre-clinical trials. It is intended that these will commence 
clinical trials in early 2007.
Our ﬁrst candidate, SYN-24-0017, is an anti-oxidant present in a wide variety 
of foods and cosmetics. It will enter pre-clinical development as a remedy 
for the prevention and treatment of S. aureus infections. 
Our second candidate is a synergistic combination of SYN-24-0017 with 
a metal salt that will be developed as a topical treatment for acne vulgaris. 
The third candidate, which will also be developed as a treatment for acne, 
will be a synergistic combination of SYN-24-0401 and SYN-24-0016 or 
SYN-24-0017 (previously SYN-24-0403) (or its salt). SYN-24-0401 is an 
anti-fungal ingredient in personal healthcare products. SYN-24-0016 is 
an oxidising agent present in a number of pharmaceutical preparations. 
The Board has decided to substitute SYN-24-0016 or SYN-24-0017 
for SYN-24-0403 due to stronger intellectual property protection over 
the combination of SYN-24-0401 and SYN-24-0403.
Chief Executive’s statement
The Group is well positioned to create new and   much needed therapies in dermatology
“ We are extremely pleased to have made signiﬁcant scientiﬁc advancements 
since the ﬂotation of Syntopix in March this year. We have selected three 
lead candidates from our portfolio to enter formulation and clinical studies 
in line with expectations and I am very excited about the quality of our 
development programme.”

Syntopix Group plc Annual report and accounts 2006
Intellectual property
We have continued throughout the year to ﬁle for patents based on the 
growing pipeline of new synergistic combinations of compounds. At the 
year end we had seven submitted patents. 
Financials
The balance sheet was strengthened considerably in March 2006 with the ﬂotation 
on AIM. The placing at the time of the ﬂotation raised £3.3 million net of expenses 
through the issue of 2,259,887 ordinary shares at a placing price of 177p. 
T urnover in the period was £31,914 (2005: £61,156) and the net loss was £910,846 
(2005: net loss £99,660), equating to a loss per share of 21.6p (2005: loss per 
share of 3.7p). Net cash as at 31 July 2006 was £3,247,430 (2005: £645,423).
Staff levels have been increased during the ﬁnancial year, with the addition 
of an administrator, a part-time technician and a Chief Operating Ofﬁcer, 
and subsequent to the year end we appointed an additional Research Scientist. 
Overhead costs however remain as forecast, due in part to the move from 
our previous high cost premises at Leeds University to low cost purpose 
built ofﬁces and laboratories at the Institute of Pharmaceutical Innovation 
at University of Bradford. The Group qualiﬁes for repayable research and 
development tax credits amounting to £86,000 for the year in respect of 
its research activity.
Conclusion
We have continued to invest in the research and development of our drug 
candidates and this will increase as we enter the formulation and clinical 
stages of our product development. The current ﬁnancial year will be a pivotal 
year for Syntopix and we look forward with conﬁdence to the opportunities 
ahead both in terms of the development of our product portfolio and of 
our commercial relationships.

Syntopix Group plc Annual report and accounts 2006
Risk factors
The Group’s operations and earnings are subject to various risks. The principal risks are highlighted below:
a) Early stage of operations
The Group is at an early stage of development. As a result, the commencement of the Group’s material revenues is difﬁcult to predict and there is 
uncertainty that the Group will generate material revenues in the foreseeable future.
b) Research and development risk
The Group is engaged in the discovery and development of drugs in complex scientiﬁc areas. Industry experience indicates a very high incidence of delay 
or failure to produce results. The Group may not be able to initiate new drug discovery and development opportunities beyond its current product 
development plan. A key element supporting the Group’s strategy is the screening of compounds with appropriate activities for further development. 
There can be no assurance that the Group will continue to identify such compounds and this could have an adverse effect on the ability of the Group 
to identify lead candidates for further pre-clinical development and clinical trials. In addition, results in pre-clinical development and clinical trials may 
be different from those obtained in long term testing or inconclusive results may delay or halt the further development of lead candidates. The projected 
timetable for continued development of the technologies and the lead candidates by the Group and/or its partners or licensees may otherwise be subject 
to delay and suspension.
Other operational risks include:
 reliance on the contribution of the founding scientists;
 intellectual property protection; and
 regulatory approval for the Group’s products.
Financial instruments
Details of the Group’s exposure to ﬁnancial risks are set out in Note 14 to the ﬁnancial statements.
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
Company law requires directors to prepare ﬁnancial statements for each ﬁnancial year that give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group 
and the Company and the proﬁt or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing those ﬁnancial statements, the Directors are required to:
 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
 state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the accounts; and
 prepare the ﬁnancial statements on a going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the ﬁnancial position 
of the Company and the Group and to enable them to ensure that the ﬁnancial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are also 
responsible for taking steps to safeguard the assets of the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities.
Provision of information to auditors
All of the current Directors have taken all steps that they ought to have taken to make themselves aware of any information needed by the Company’s 
auditors for the purposes of their audit and to establish that the auditors are aware of that information. The Directors are not aware of any relevant audit

Syntopix Group plc was listed on AIM on 23 March 2006. The Group recognises the importance of, and is committed to, high standards of corporate

The Board and its committees
The Board
There are currently eight Board members, comprising ﬁve Executive Directors and three Non-Executive Directors. The role of the Non-Executive Directors is 
to bring independent judgement to Board deliberations and decisions. The Chairman of the Board is a Non-Executive Director who oversees Board meetings 
and ﬁelds all concerns regarding the executive management of the Group and the performance of the Executive Directors. A biography of each Director 
appears on pages 6 and 7. The Directors each have diverse backgrounds and a wide range of experience is available to the Group. The Board meets on a 
monthly basis to review the Group’s performance and to review and determine strategies for future growth. The Board has delegated speciﬁc 
responsibilities to its committees as set out below.
Each of the Executive Directors is subject to either an executive services agreement with a twelve month notice period or a letter of appointment with 
between three and twelve month notice periods. Each of the Non-Executive Directors is subject to a letter of appointment with a three month notice 
period. Syntopix Group plc’s Articles of Association require directors to retire from ofﬁce and submit themselves for re-election on a one third 
rotation at each Annual General Meeting. Dr Gwyn Humphreys, Dr Jon Cove and Mr Darren Bamforth will be retiring at the Annual General Meeting

The committees
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee is comprised entirely of Non-Executive Directors, being Dr Helen Shaw as Chairman, Mr Alan Aubrey and  
Dr Gwyn Humphreys. The committee oversees the structure and balance of the Board generally and is responsible for screening and proposing 
candidates for appointment to the Board.
Remuneration Committee
The Group’s Remuneration Committee also comprises the Non-Executive Directors, being Dr Helen Shaw as Chairman, Mr Alan Aubrey and  
Dr Gwyn Humphreys. The committee is responsible for reviewing the salary and beneﬁts offered to Executive Directors as well as the Group’s non-Director 
senior management. Speciﬁcally, the committee is responsible for determining contract terms, compensatory share options and pension rights. 
The Board as a whole determines the compensation for all Non-Executive Directors. Further details regarding the Directors’ individual remuneration 
are set out in the Report of the Directors on Remuneration on pages 13 to 14.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee similarly is comprised of Non-Executive Directors, being Dr Helen Shaw as Chairman, Mr Alan Aubrey and Dr Gwyn Humphreys. 
The Audit Committee supervises the Group’s external auditors, including appointment and compensation. The Audit Committee is also responsible for 
ensuring the accuracy of the interim and annual reports, as well as compliance with all applicable standards and regulations.

Syntopix Group plc Annual report and accounts 2006
Internal control and risk management
The Board requires strict internal control procedures for the Group. Upon the advice of the Board, the Executive Directors each assumed responsibility 
for speciﬁc aspects of the Group’s operations. The Executive Directors also regularly liaise with Non-Executive Directors regarding accounting practices 
and legal compliance. The Board and senior management are aware of the importance of adhering to the ﬁnancial and accounting policies of the 
Group. The Board discusses any relevant changes to accounting policies and if necessary, discusses the impact of such changes with external ﬁnancial 
advisers to facilitate compliance.
Internal audit
The Board agrees that there should be no internal audit function of the Group at this time considering the size of the Group and the close involvement 
of senior management over the Group’s accounting systems. However, the Board will keep this matter under review in the event that circumstances 
warrant an internal function for the Group in the future.
Budgetary process
The Board approves the annual budget each year. This process allows the Board to identify key performance targets and risks expected during the 
upcoming year. The Board also considers the agreed budget when reviewing trading updates and considering expenditures throughout the year.
Going concern
Having made appropriate enquiries, the Directors are satisﬁed that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future.

what amount bonuses should be granted to Executive Directors.

It is the Company’s policy to enter into service contracts or letters of appointment with all Directors.
Currently, Dr Gwyn Humphreys, Dr Rod Adams and Dr Anne Eady have entered into service agreements for an initial term of twelve months from 23 March 2006 
and thereafter until terminated by either party on six months’ notice.

Mr Darren Bamforth was appointed for an initial period of three months and thereafter until terminated by either party giving the other three months’ notice. 
Mr Alan Aubrey, Dr Jon Cove and Dr Helen Shaw were appointed for an initial term of twelve months and thereafter until terminated by either party giving 
the other three months’ notice.
None of the service contracts or letters of appointment provide for any termination payments.
Share options

further options as and when deemed appropriate.

Syntopix Group plc Annual report and accounts 2006
We have audited the Group and parent company ﬁnancial statements (the “ﬁnancial statements”) of Syntopix Group plc for the period ended 31 July 2006 
which comprise the Consolidated Proﬁt and Loss Account, the Consolidated and Company Balance Sheets, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement and 
the related notes. These ﬁnancial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards 
(United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view and have been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 1985. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the Directors’ Report is not consistent with the ﬁnancial statements, if the Company has 
not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information speciﬁed by 
law regarding Directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the annual report, and consider whether it is consistent with the audited ﬁnancial statements. This other information 
comprises only the Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive’s Statement, the Directors’ Report, the Corporate Governance Report and the 
Report of the Directors on Remuneration. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatement or material 
inconsistencies with the ﬁnancial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Our report has been prepared pursuant to the requirements of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose. No person is entitled to rely on this 
report unless such a person is a person entitled to rely upon this report by virtue of and for the purpose of the Companies Act 1985 or has been 
expressly authorised to do so by our prior written consent. Save as above, we do not accept responsibility for this report to any other person or for 
any other purpose and we hereby expressly disclaim any and all such liability.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit 
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements. It also includes an assessment 
of the signiﬁcant estimates and judgements made by the Directors in the preparation of the ﬁnancial statements, and of whether the accounting policies 
are appropriate to the Group’s and Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which are considered necessary in order to provide us with 
sufﬁcient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the ﬁnancial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other 
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the ﬁnancial statements.
Opinion:
In our opinion:
  the Group ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, of the 
state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 July 2006 and of the Group’s loss for the year then ended;
  the parent company ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, 
of the state of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 July 2006;
  the ﬁnancial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
  the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the ﬁnancial statements.

Syntopix Group plc Annual report and accounts 2006
Basis of accounting
The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, in accordance with applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom.
Basis of consolidation
The Group’s ﬁnancial statements consolidate the ﬁnancial statements of Syntopix Group plc and all its subsidiaries made up to 31 July 2006. No separate 
proﬁt and loss account is presented for Syntopix Group plc as permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985. The Group loss for the period 
includes a loss after taxation of £120,539 which is dealt with in the ﬁnancial statements of the parent company.
On 15 March 2006, Syntopix Group Limited entered into a share for share exchange agreement with the shareholders of Syntopix Limited, whereby 
Syntopix Group Limited acquired the entire issued share capital of Syntopix Limited and its subsidiaries, the consideration being satisﬁed by the allotment 
of ordinary shares in Syntopix Group Limited to the shareholders of Syntopix Limited. On 16 March 2006 the Company was re-registered as a public 
limited company under the name of Syntopix Group plc.
This acquisition has therefore been accounted for as a merger as permitted by Financial Reporting Standard 6 as if the Group (as currently constituted) 
had been in place throughout the whole of the period covered by these ﬁnancial statements. As such, the results for the year ended 31 July 2006 have 
been presented as though Syntopix Limited and its subsidiaries had always been part of Syntopix Group plc, even though Syntopix Group plc itself was 
only incorporated on 16 December 2005.
Basis of comparative information
The comparative Consolidated Proﬁt and Loss Account has been presented as if the merger took place on the ﬁrst day of each ﬁnancial period presented 
and as though the Group had been in existence throughout these periods. The ﬁgures for the year ended 31 July 2005 have been extracted from the 
audited Syntopix Limited accounts adjusted for the shares issued by the Company as consideration as if they had always been in issue.
Tangible ﬁxed assets
Depreciation is provided on all tangible ﬁxed assets at rates calculated to write each asset down to its estimated residual value over its expected useful 
life, as follows:
Computer equipment – 33% straight line basis 
Plant and machinery –  20% straight line basis 
Fixtures and ﬁttings –  20% straight line basis
Investments
Fixed asset investments are stated at cost less provision for diminution in value where appropriate.
Research and development
Development expenditure is carried forward when its future recoverability can be foreseen with reasonable assurance and is amortised in line with sales 
from the related product. All research and other development costs are written off as incurred.
Turnover
Turnover comprises contract research and consultancy fees and is stated net of VAT . Turnover is recognised in the proﬁt and loss account on completion 
of contract research and consultancy work.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events 
that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date. Timing differences 
are differences between the Group’s taxable proﬁts and its results as stated in the ﬁnancial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses 
in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the ﬁnancial statements. Deferred tax is measured at the average tax 
rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted 
or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
Foreign currencies
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling and recorded at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. 
Balances denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Any exchange 
differences are written off against proﬁts in the period in which they are incurred.
Pensions
The Group operates a stakeholder pension plan for which all employees are eligible.
Share based employee remuneration
When shares and share options are awarded to employees a charge is made to the proﬁt and loss account based on the difference between the market 
value of the Company’s shares at the date of grant and the option exercise price in accordance with UITF Abstract 17 (revised 2003) ‘Employee Share 
Schemes’. The credit entry for this charge is taken to the proﬁt and loss reserve and reported in the reconciliation of movements in shareholders’ funds.

14 Financial instruments (continued)
It is the Group’s policy to limit foreign currency exposure by using ﬁnancial instruments whenever they are appropriate.
No derivative contracts were entered into during the current or preceding year. It is the Group’s policy that no trading in ﬁnancial instruments should 
be undertaken. The Company’s cash balances increased signiﬁcantly following ﬂotation on AIM and this cash has been invested in deposit accounts 
subsequently. The main risks arising from the Group’s ﬁnancial instruments are interest rate risk and liquidity risk. The Board reviews and agrees policies 
for managing each of these risks and they are summarised as follows:
Interest rate risk
The Group’s policy on managing its exposure to interest rate change is agreed at Board level and is reviewed on an ongoing basis. Prior to placing ﬁxed 
term deposits, the Board reviews interest rates available from the major banks. The weighted average interest rate for ﬁxed rate deposits is 4.26%, and 
at 31 July 2006 the unexpired terms for ﬁxed rate deposits were as follows:
£600,000 – 2 month ﬁxed deposit expiring 15 August 2006 
£1,500,000 – 6 month ﬁxed deposit expiring 15 December 2006 
£1,000,000 – 12 month ﬁxed deposit expiring 15 June 2007
Liquidity risk
The Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and ﬂexibility. The Group’s policy is to ensure that there is sufﬁcient funding 
in place to meet foreseeable peak working capital requirements.
Borrowing facilities
The Group has not arranged a borrowing facility as at the balance sheet date.

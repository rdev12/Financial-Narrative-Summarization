Chairman’s Statement 
In our 75th year, we celebrated  
our worldwide reputation for 
excellence in design, engineering  
and project management.

Performance
I am pleased to report that the Group 
delivered another set of good results. 
During the year, we have made significant 
progress on the delivery of our strategy.
Our operational excellence programme 
has been rolled out into our North 
America and Middle East regions. The 
portfolio optimisation pillar of our strategy 
is now almost complete, following the 
sale of our UK highways services business 
to Skanska, the final stage of which was 
completed in early October. The disposal 
of our construction management at risk 
business, Peter Brown, was also 
completed in a similar timeframe. The 
diversity, breadth and depth of our 
geographic and sector spread continue  
to provide the Group with growth 
opportunities, particularly in our sector 
focus area of Energy and our regional 
growth area of Asia Pacific.
We were delighted to welcome 
Confluence Project Management Pte. Ltd., 
the project and programme management 
business headquartered in Singapore, to 
the Group in October. The team is already 
fully integrated with our Faithful+Gould 
business across the regions and has added 
an attractive client base. Furthermore,  
we are now reaching the final stages in 
achieving regulatory approval for the 
acquisition of Nuclear Safety Associates Inc., 
an engineering and technical services firm 
based in North America. Strategic Report 07

Corporate Information
Chairman’s Statement continued
During the year we also invested in our 
employer brand known as the Atkins Way, 
which is a celebration of how our people 
behave and what motivates them. We 
believe that nobody can tell the story of 
an organisation as effectively and as 
genuinely as the people who work for it, 
so we are using the Atkins Way as the 
foundation of all our communications 
with existing and potential colleagues.
Board of directors
We welcomed a number of new  
Board members this year as Admiral the 
Lord Boyce retired from the Board and 
Joanne Curin stepped down as she took 
up a new position in the Middle East.  
I would like to thank both for their service, 
support and commitment to Atkins.  
Lord Boyce has been highly influential  
as our senior independent director  
and I have greatly appreciated his wise 
counsel. We were pleased to appoint 
Fiona Clutterbuck as senior independent 
director in his place and to welcome 
Allister Langlands and Thomas Leppert, 
who joined the Board as independent 
non-executive directors during the year. 
Allister has succeeded Joanne as chairman 
of the Audit Committee. Joanne has  
made a great contribution to the Board 
and to the leadership of the Audit 
Committee over the last five years and  
for this we thank her.
Rodney Slater will be retiring from the 
Board after our annual general meeting 
on 30 July 2014. He has served the Board 
for three years and I would like to thank 
him for his input during that time.
Alun Griffiths, our Group HR director, will 
also be retiring from the Board after our 
annual general meeting on 30 July 2014. 
Alun has been with the Group for 28 years 
and has served on the Board as an 
executive director for the past seven years. 
I would like to thank Alun for his long-
standing dedication to the Group and for 
his contribution to the Board. He will be 
succeeded as Group HR director by James 
Cullens, who joins us from Hays plc and 
who will join the Board on 1 July 2014.
Dividend
The Board is recommending a final 
dividend of 23.25p per ordinary share in 
respect of the year ended 31 March 2014, 
making the total dividend for the year 
33.75p (2013: 32.0p), an increase of 
5.5%. If approved at the Company’s 
annual general meeting, the dividend  
will be paid on 22 August 2014 to 
ordinary shareholders on the register  
on 11 July 2014. Further details regarding 
dividend payments can be found in 
Investor Information (page 182).
Outlook
As we look forward to the new financial 
year, we are confident of making further 
progress towards our strategic goals. 
While our markets and clients’ needs are 
constantly evolving, we will continually 
seek ways to deliver their requirements 
effectively and efficiently. We believe our 
exposure to transportation markets across 
the UK and North America provides us 
with a good backlog of business. Our 
Middle East region is benefiting from our 
more focused approach and in Asia Pacific 
we are investing to diversify beyond our 
historic Hong Kong base. In Energy we  
see an attractive pipeline of opportunities. 
Overall, we see positive momentum in  
the year ahead.
Allan Cook CBE
Chairman
11 June 2014
We welcomed 
Confluence Project 
Management Pte. Ltd.  
to the Group in October. 
People
I would like to thank our people for their 
quiet brilliance in helping us to deliver 
some of the most time-critical, complex 
solutions to our clients this year. We have 
a highly engaged and aligned team of 
people who continue to work together  
to make the world just that little bit  
better as a result of the projects they 
deliver. I would also like to thank families 
and friends for supporting our people  
as they go about their work for Atkins  
in all corners of the world.
Maintaining our focus on bringing more 
young people into the engineering sector, 
we welcomed 500 new graduates across 
the Group and accelerated our apprentice 
programme to attract school leavers by 
recruiting over 90 apprentices in the UK.
This year we worked hard to achieve  
our commitment to build a diverse 
organisation. We created a women’s 
leadership council to enable the 50  
most senior women in the business to 
support, mentor and encourage the next 
generation of Atkins’ female leaders.  
Also, women’s professional networks 
around the world became more active  
in their work to ensure women feel 
well-connected across the Group. In 
addition, the UK business was recognised 
by workingmums.co.uk, winning awards 
for Overall Top Employer and Innovation  
in Flexible Working. I am personally 
leading an industry group for the UK’s 
Royal Academy of Engineering with the 
purpose of increasing the number of 
women engineers in the sector.
Our 75th anniversary celebrations in 2013 
gave us an excellent opportunity to involve 
and unite our people around the world. 
We joined together for celebratory  
events and recognised 89 colleagues  
with the Sir William Atkins medal for  
their outstanding achievements.

We have achieved a year of good  
results with a highly motivated team  
of employees around the world. Based  
on strong customer focus and the 
implementation of our strategy we have 
built a good momentum of profitable 
growth. In all areas of our business, 
commercially as well as technically,  
we have encouraged new thinking and 
delivered innovative solutions to our 
clients. We made significant progress  
in implementing our three-pillar strategy 
of operational excellence, portfolio 
optimisation and focused growth in 
defined segments and regions. This has 
resulted in tangible progress evidenced  
by solid growth in profitability and 
excellent cash performance.
Business position
Our underlying profit before tax was 
£106.4m, an increase of 7.3% over last 
year’s restated profit¹ of £99.2m, on 
revenue that increased by 2.6% to 
£1.75bn. We believe underlying profit  
is a more representative measure of 
performance, removing the items that 
may give a distorted view of performance. 
In the current year we have removed 
profits on disposals and costs associated 
with disposals of £10.5m (2013: £4.5m), 
amortisation of acquired intangible  
assets of £2.7m (2013: £10.0m), together 
with one-off pension gains in the 2013 
comparative figures of £4.3m arising  
as we continue to actively manage our 
pension liabilities. The unadjusted 
reported profit before tax was £114.2m 
(2013 restated
1
: £98.0m).
The Group’s profit after tax for the year  
of £96.3m (2013 restated
1
: £84.3m)  
is shown in the Consolidated Income 
Statement (page 112).
1  The results for the year to 31 March 2013 have 
been restated to reflect changes to accounting 
standards with regards to the treatment of  
pension costs (IAS 19 (revised 2011)). Strategic Report 09

Corporate Information
Chief Executive Officer’s Statement continued
While the markets in which we operate  
in North America were steady, we have 
achieved good progress in our North 
America region, with an increase in 
operating profit and margin. This year  
we established a new leadership team  
and have focused on improving efficiency 
and reducing overheads in the business, 
as part of the roll-out of our operational 
excellence programme. We benefited 
from good new contract wins in the  
wastewater management, energy,  
marine and emergency response areas  
of our business, and were reappointed  
on significant contracts for the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). 
Our transportation business continued 
with its positive performance and was 
awarded a number of new contracts 
including commissions to oversee 
transport solutions for highways 
authorities in Florida, Texas and Georgia. 
In addition, our Faithful+Gould business  
in the region had a good year with an 
improvement in margins and profitability, 
benefiting from continued economic 
recovery in the private sector.
I am pleased to report that our  
Middle East region had an improved  
year, thanks to a particularly good second 
half which included contract wins for  
the Riyadh and Doha Metros. In addition,  
the infrastructure sector remains buoyant 
in Qatar and Abu Dhabi with good 
opportunities in the Kingdom of Saudi 
Arabia. Of particular note was the fact 
that the property sector is showing early 
signs of an upturn where we are working 
on a number of new projects, including 
the Dubai Opera House and the residential 
element of Al Habtoor City, along Dubai’s 
main arterial road. In a market with  
good opportunities, we continue to be 
selective about the projects on which  
we work to ensure we maintain a strong 
financial performance in the region.  
Our Faithful+Gould business in the region 
performed well during the year and was 
boosted by some 71 new colleagues in 
the region as the result of the Confluence 
acquisition. As with the UK region, the 
Middle East region’s use of our GDCs in 
India is improving our performance and 
competitive position.
Our Asia Pacific region had a good year, 
with strong performance in our core 
markets of Hong Kong and China. The 
diversification from our strong historic rail 
base in Hong Kong continued throughout 
the year and we are now working on 
opportunities with local design institutes 
and Chinese contractors. In mainland 
China we continue to benefit from 
projects as a result of rapid urbanisation 
and look to expand our footprint into 
South East Asia, focusing on rail projects 
in Malaysia and architectural opportunities 
in Vietnam. The acquisition of Confluence, 
through our Faithful+Gould business  
in the region, has enabled us to achieve 
particular success in Singapore on several 
high profile projects in more diverse 
sectors.
Good organic growth continues to be 
delivered by our Energy business, where 
we are well-positioned in the buoyant 
markets of oil and gas and nuclear and 
where we are seeing a steady increase in 
our share of the conventional generation 
and renewable markets. We are continuing 
to strengthen our service offering through 
partnerships with companies offering 
complementary skills. This is helping us to 
secure strategic opportunities around the 
world, with a recent example being our 
selection as preferred bidder on a new 
contract with Sellafield Ltd in joint venture 
with Areva and Mace. During the year  
we also agreed to purchase Nuclear Safety 
Associates, a 130-people engineering and 
technical services firm, which will enhance 
our offering in safety and regulation 
experience in US nuclear technology.
Headcount closed the year at 17,489 
(2013: 17,899), reflecting both the sale  
of non-core businesses totalling 1,165  
and underlying headcount growth and 
the acquisition of Confluence Project 
Management Pte. Ltd. (Confluence).
Our United Kingdom and Europe region 
performed well during the year, driven 
primarily by the UK where we experienced 
good momentum in our core markets. 
The use of our global design centres 
(GDCs) in India to deliver work for our UK 
business also enhanced our performance 
and increased our competitiveness. We 
achieved particularly good volumes in the 
retained highways consultancy and rail 
businesses. In addition we benefited from 
a contract gain share as a consequence  
of the M25 design project exceeding its 
delivery targets, in part offset by 
outstanding variation negotiations on 
certain rail signalling contracts. The UK 
water and environment business had a 
busy first half with peak volumes 
associated with AMP5 and feasibility 
studies on phase one of the HS2 high 
speed rail project. We were pleased to  
see opportunities re-emerging for our 
design and engineering business from the 
UK education market and infrastructure 
work associated with nuclear new-build 
projects. We remain well positioned in  
our defence business following the 
change in the UK Government’s approach 
to reforming its defence procurement 
activities. Our Scandinavian businesses 
remain stable and the market well-funded, 
while our Faithful+Gould business 
performed well in a reasonably tough 
environment.
We made significant 
progress on our  
three-pillar strategy. 10 Strategic Report
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2014
Chief Executive Officer’s Statement continued
Priorities
Our drive to become a more responsible 
and sustainable organisation remains of 
paramount importance. Right at the top 
of this commitment is health and safety. 
Our See it, Stop it, Save a life mantra 
empowers our people to stop work 
immediately whenever anything appears 
unsafe. Our leaders actively drive  
a culture of safety and demonstrate their 
commitment through the use of safety 
moments, taking time out at the start  
of meetings to remind everyone about  
its importance.
We are demonstrating strong industry 
leadership in the Middle East through  
the launch of the Atkins minimum 
requirements for construction safety, 
which are enabling us to influence clients 
and contractors to raise health and safety 
standards on their projects. Our efforts 
were recognised at Construction Week 
Qatar’s annual awards where we won 
Health and Safety Initiative of the Year. 
We were also recognised in the UK for  
the third consecutive year with the award 
of a Gold Award for Occupational Safety 
from the Royal Society for the Prevention 
of Accidents. 
This year we launched a set of principles 
to frame our approach to corporate 
sustainability. These principles are based 
on three pillars: a society for our future; 
an environment with a future; and  
a responsible business of the future.
Our strategy remains clear. We will drive 
shareholder value by focusing on growth, 
selectively increasing our geographic 
footprint through targeted international 
expansion while continuing to deliver 
improved financial performance in all  
our markets and geographies. In the 
medium term, our goal remains to 
generate a margin above 8% across all 
our businesses. We will grow organically  
and through acquisitions.
In 2013, we continued work to deliver  
our strategy. Following the successful 
implementation of our operational 
excellence programme to optimise 
financial delivery in the UK, this has now 
been extended to our Middle East and 
North America regions. In the area of 
portfolio optimisation, we completed  
the sale of our UK highways services 
operations and the disposal of the Peter 
Brown construction management at risk 
business. In the domain of sector and 
regional focus, our Energy business has 
benefited from ongoing investment and 
during the year we agreed to acquire 
Nuclear Safety Associates. In addition, 
attractive opportunities for growth exist in 
our Asia Pacific region as we expand our 
activities from our historic base in Hong 
Kong into new countries such as Malaysia, 
Singapore and Vietnam. Our acquisition  
of Confluence during the year was part  
of this strategy.
Conclusion
It is thanks to our people around the 
world that we have achieved these good 
results. Through our 75th anniversary 
celebrations, our people have 
demonstrated that they are proud to  
work for Atkins. In turn, we are proud  
of our people, the Atkins family, for the 
way they work together, with colleagues 
and clients, finding solutions to make  
the world just a little bit better, creating  
a better future for us all.
We have delivered another year of good 
results and proved that our consistent 
strategy is working. Whilst organic growth 
remains our priority, we will also seek 
acquisitions that add new skills or expand 
our regional presence. We were 
particularly pleased with our successes  
in this area in the year.
We start the new financial year with an 
attractive pipeline of opportunities across 
the Group and a strong balance sheet. 
Our operational excellence programme 
will ensure our continued focus on 
improving our overall operating margin, 
towards our 8% goal. Overall we believe 
2014/15 will be another year of growth.

Infrastructure development
Engineering services are key to 
infrastructure development. When clients 
are undertaking capital projects they  
need professional support with planning, 
designing and enabling activities –  
from policy, strategic choices, feasibility, 
concept and detailed design through  
to project and programme management, 
implementation and operation. At each 
stage, services are sought from design 
and engineering consultancies.
Large or particularly complex projects  
may only be able to be undertaken by 
organisations of scale, where skills must 
be applied in combination to deliver  
the project.
Our locations
We have extensive geographic reach 
through a network of offices in a number 
of countries around the world. 
With a presence in the UK, Europe,  
North America, the Middle East and  
Asia Pacific, the strength of the Group  
lies in its breadth and depth of technical 
expertise. 
Many years ago, Atkins had the foresight 
to establish a team of professionals  
in India to help us to respond to the 
challenges of finding skilled resources. 
Through careful development and 
investment, our global design centres 
(GDCs) in Bangalore and Delhi have 
become a competitive advantage for  
us, providing capacity, efficiency and 
professional expertise, helping our  
clients to achieve their strategic goals.
Our capability
Our business may be characterised  
as follows:
•	 we are a people business selling 
specialist output from our talented 
teams
•	 the services we provide demand  
high value added critical thinking  
and expert judgement
•	 we operate in many parts of the  
world and in many market sectors 
•	 we undertake projects of different  
sizes but increasingly those of larger 
scale and complexity.
Our competitive advantage
The nature of our work means that  
at first glance there appears to be a 
number of firms with similar capabilities. 
However, our competitive advantage  
is derived from the quality, depth and 
breadth of those capabilities and the 
way in which they are marshalled and 
applied in our approach to solving  
client problems. 
With a worldwide pool of talent on 
which to draw, key strengths of the 
Group lie in the engineering focus  
and technical brilliance of the specialists  
we employ. Atkins has a deserved 
reputation for integrity with reliable 
experts not only as key assets of the 
Group but defining the culture of  
the organisation. 14 Strategic Report

Trends
Urbanisation
The world population is increasingly 
moving to urban environments. The  
UN estimates that more than half of  
the world’s population now lives in  
cities and that by 2050 this number  
will be almost two thirds of a projected 
nine billion population. 
Not all regions of the world have reached 
the 50% level and the urbanisation trend 
is most marked in growth markets outside 
the developed world. It is anticipated  
that urban growth will be concentrated  
in Africa and Asia over the next few years. 
According to the UN, it is expected that 
half of the population of Asia will live in 
urban areas by 2020, while Africa is likely 
to reach a 50% urbanisation rate in 2035.
This overarching driver will create  
ongoing demand for new and improved 
infrastructure in a number of allied sectors. 
Technology
Technological advances in the design  
and engineering of projects are having  
an impact on the industry. Through 
Building Information Modelling (BIM)  
and other tools, 3D, 4D and 5D (including 
time and cost information) design is 
becoming more prevalent. In addition,  
the application of large data sets and 
cloud-based applications to analysis 
(historic and predictive) is creating new 
ways of looking at projects in the planning 
and design stage, and is simplifying and 
speeding up infrastructure construction 
and maintenance efforts.
Business focus
Work delivery
In more and more situations we are 
moving parts of the work we undertake 
for our local clients to remote locations. 
This may be to one of our GDCs or offices 
in other parts of the world. The driver  
may be complexity, where we undertake 
the work in our centres of excellence  
for a particular discipline, or cost, where  
we utilise our lower cost regions to best 
effect. Seamless delivery and robust 
processes are required.
Market size and share
There are a number of industry surveys 
that capture the top firms in regions and 
sectors by revenue. The calculation of  
true market share remains difficult due  
to the large number of very small firms in 
each region that do not form part of the 
surveys. However, we use the information 
available together with our own industry 
knowledge to infer our own view of 
market share. 
We estimate that the market for our skills 
in selected geographies is in excess of 
£100bn p.a. and, such is the fragmented 
and extensive nature of the competition, 
we command an overall share of less  
than 2% of our addressable market. 
Market shares vary enormously by 
individual sector – from around a third  
in UK rail signalling works/structures 
down to very small market shares in niche 
activities. By region, we estimate our 
market share as around 10% from our 
significant position in the UK and, 
demonstrating the potential for growth, 
around 2% in the Middle East and less 
than 1% in each of the US, Europe and 
Asia Pacific.
Competitive environment
Due to the breadth of activities which 
the Group undertakes, competitors are 
generally sector- and service-specific.
Each region of the world is characterised 
by a small number of large players,  
often with multinational reach,  
together with a large number of smaller 
companies which tend to have very 
specific niche skills. Typically, therefore, 
competitors at the local level are 
divisions of large companies or smaller 
privately owned specialists.
Barriers to entry vary across the sectors 
in which we operate – from very high  
in areas such as nuclear, where specific 
domain knowledge and certification  
is required, to much lower in more 
generalist areas of civil infrastructure 
design and project management. Strategic Report 15

Our strategy
Group strategy
The primary objective of the Group  
is to derive shareholder value through 
profitable growth.
The main strategy for the Group was 
articulated in 2011. Annual reviews test 
progress and the continuing relevance  
of each aspect of the strategy.
In 2011 we outlined our primary objective 
of developing the operating margin, which 
remains a key target and determinant  
of quality of business. Our medium-term 
target is to generate a margin above 8% 
across all our businesses and regions. 
Our strategic 
pillars
Our secondary objective is to adjust  
the geographic balance of the Group’s 
operations over time and progress 
towards our ultimate aim to generate 
more than 75% of our revenue from  
our non-UK and Energy businesses, 
resulting in less than 25% of our  
revenue being derived from the UK. 
We will continue to direct investment into 
areas in which we see value as we look  
to grow organically and supplement that 
growth with appropriate acquisitions. 
Rigorous acquisition criteria are applied  
to potential targets to ascertain the 
appropriateness of the skill-set and 
cultural fit and to assess whether these 
opportunities will usefully accelerate  
our strategy.

Our strategy
Pillars and progress
Operational excellence
The fundamental building block of any 
successful strategy is the performance  
of the underlying business. We continue  
to drive operational performance across 
the Group – with a distinct focus on 
optimising financial delivery – and  
we are successfully implementing our 
operational excellence programme. 
This involves a continued focus on staff 
utilisation and operating margin, together 
with an increased emphasis on billing  
and cash collection. Following successful 
implementation in the UK, this programme 
now extends to our businesses in the 
Middle East and North America. 
With this foundation we will be well 
placed for progress in the future towards 
our medium-term operating margin target 
of 8%.
Portfolio optimisation
A second aspect of ensuring we are well 
positioned for the future is an ongoing 
review of the businesses in our portfolio, 
focusing the Group on higher growth, 
higher margin activities. 
We have made excellent progress in this 
area over the last few years with the sale 
of our UK highways services operations 
and the disposal of the Peter Brown 
construction management at risk business, 
together with the sale of our UK asset 
management business and the disposal  
of our non-controlling interest in the 
RMPA (Colchester Garrison) private 
finance initiative.
Sector and regional focus
We organise the Group along regional 
lines with the addition of Energy as a 
sector addressing global clients. While  
the form follows the management of  
the Group we also undertake pan-Group 
coordination of key sectors in multiple 
jurisdictions. 
As we look across our portfolio it is clear 
that a number of our existing sectors  
have attractive growth prospects. This  
is particularly true of our Energy business, 
which has for some time benefited from 
ongoing investment and is reported 
separately in our results. As an example  
of our investment in this sector, during 
2013 we agreed to acquire Nuclear  
Safety Associates (NSA) in North America.
Other sectors on which we place a 
particular focus will evolve over time.  
Over the last few years we have been 
investing in aerospace and security.  
While security issues remain at the 
forefront of many clients’ priorities,  
and despite good growth in activity,  
the level of client investment has, as yet, 
not resulted in a business of scale in this 
area. We still see good opportunities in 
aerospace particularly in North America, 
where we will focus the Group’s efforts, 
but the aerospace market in Europe is 
likely to be a challenging environment  
in the near future.
The area of particular regional focus  
has been Asia Pacific. We see excellent 
opportunities in South East Asia as we 
expand our activities from our historic 
base into new countries such as 
Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam.  
Our acquisition of Confluence in 2013 
was a further step in this regard.
We will continue to redirect and leverage 
resources and technical capabilities to 
address sectors and regions in which  
we see potential. Acquisitions remain 
possible to supplement organic growth 
as we look to balance our client, sector 
and geographic mix.  18 Strategic Report

Overview of the business and performance in the year
Our business
Our core business is helping our clients  
to plan, design and enable capital 
programmes that resolve complex 
challenges in the built environment.  
We are able to provide our clients with 
professional support to plan, design  
and enable projects from policy,  
strategic choices, feasibility concept  
and detailed design, through to  
project and programme management, 
implementation and operation.
Atkins’ structure of five business segments 
reflects how we manage the business  
in different geographies and markets. 
Details of activities and results by business 
segment are shown in the segmental 
performance section which follows.
Key performance indicators 
The Group uses a range of performance 
measures to monitor and manage the 
business. Those that are particularly 
important in monitoring our progress  
in generating shareholder value are 
considered key performance indicators 
(KPIs).
Our KPIs measure past performance and 
also provide information and context  
to anticipate future events and, in 
conjunction with our detailed knowledge 
and experience of the segments in which 
we operate, allow us to act early and 
manage the business going forward.  
We track safety, volume, staff turnover, 
profitability, efficiency, secured workload 
and capacity.

Business Review continued
Revenue, operating profit and margin, 
earnings per share (EPS) and operating 
cash flow provide indications as to the 
volume and quality of work we have 
done. They measure both profitability  
and the efficiency with which we have 
turned operating profits into cash.
Work in hand measures our secured 
workload as a percentage of the 
budgeted revenue for the next year. Staff 
numbers and staff turnover are measures 
of capacity and show us how effective  
we have been in recruiting and retaining 
our key resource. 
Safety in the workplace and on our 
project sites is paramount and forms  
part of our commitment to quality and 
reliability and, as such, we track the 
accident incident rate (AIR) across the 
Group. The AIR is an industry measure  
of the number of reportable accidents  
per 100,000 staff and is explained in  
more detail in the Corporate Sustainability 
Review on page 54.
As a people business staff turnover is  
an important metric for us and shows  
the rate at which staff choose to leave  
the business.
KPIs for the year ended 31 March 2014 
are shown (page 20), along with prior 
year comparatives.
Review of the year
As outlined in the Chief Executive Officer’s 
Statement and in more detail in the 
Financial Performance Review (page 41), 
this has been another good year in terms  
of Atkins’ financial performance. 
Revenue improved by 2.6% to £1.75bn 
(2013: £1.71bn). Reported profit before 
tax was £114.2m (2013 restated
1
: 
£98.0m). A more representative measure 
is underlying profit before tax, which  
was £106.4m (2013 restated
1
: £99.2m). 
Underlying profit excludes profits on 
disposals and costs associated with 
disposals of £10.5m (2013: £4.5m), 
amortisation of acquired intangible  
assets of £2.7m (2013: £10.0m), together 
with one-off pension gains in the 2013 
comparative figures of £4.3m arising as 
we continue to actively manage our 
pension liabilities.
Reported operating profit was £113.7m 
(2013 restated
1
: £104.0m), at a margin  
of 6.5% (2013: 6.1%). As we state above, 
we believe a more representative measure 
of operating profit adds back amortisation 
of acquired intangible assets of £2.7m 
(2013: £10.0m), together with one-off 
pension gains in the 2013 comparative 
figures of £4.3m. This shows a more 
representative underlying operating profit 
of £116.4m (2013 restated
1
: £109.7m) 
giving an improved underlying margin  
of 6.7% (2013: 6.4%).
The aforementioned profit on disposal  
of £10.5m is explained in more detail  
in note 8 to the Financial Statements 
(page 143) and comprises the net profit  
on sale of our UK highway services 
operations and the disposal of the 
Peter Brown construction management  
at risk business in North America, which 
follow on from the sale of our UK asset 
management business and the disposal  
of our non-controlling interest in the 
RMPA (Colchester Garrison) private 
finance initiative in prior years.
Headcount closed the year at 17,489 
(2013: 17,899), reflecting both the sale  
of non-core businesses totalling 1,165  
and underlying headcount growth and 
the acquisition of Confluence.
Underlying diluted EPS increased by  
3.1p per share to 85.7p (2013 restated
1
: 
82.6p), an increase of 3.8%. 
The Group pension schemes have a net 
liability of £324.2m, an increase year on 
year of £42.2m following the adoption 
and retrospective application of IAS 19 
(revised 2011). The fair value of plan  
assets has increased to £1,236.3m  
(2013: £1,209.2m) and the liabilities have 
increased to £1,560.5m (2013 restated: 
£1,491.2m).
Operating cash flow in the year was 
£95.5m (2013: £82.9m), representing 
82.0% (2013: 75.5%) of underlying 
operating profit. The Group’s liquidity 
remains strong with closing net funds  
of £188.3m (2013: £143.0m).
As at 31 March 2014, the Group had 
secured 51% (2013: 55%) of budgeted 
revenue for the coming financial year.  
This excludes in both periods the future 
workload of the UK highways services 
business, which was sold in the year.
A segmental analysis follows (starting on 
page 21) that explains more fully each of 
our segments. We outline their financial 
performance in the period, their strategy 
and business model and external factors 
driving their business together with 
specific risks relating to the segment.  
We have also provided information on 
their performance in relation to safety, 
sustainability and staff-related matters.

Segmental performance continued
United Kingdom and Europe
Performance
Our United Kingdom and Europe business 
has performed well during the year. 
Headline revenue has increased by 2.2% 
despite the disposal of our UK highways 
services business at the half year. On an 
underlying basis for continuing activities 
revenue increased by 15%, driven 
primarily by the UK where we have seen 
good momentum in our core markets, 
which continue to be well-funded.
Margins at 6.3% (2013: 6.4%) are slightly 
lower but have progressed across most  
of the business. This year’s performance 
was held back by our conservative 
approach to profit recognition with 
regards to outstanding contract variations 
on a number of longer term rail projects  
in the UK and a strong European prior 
year comparative as a consequence of  
a profit release. 
We have made good progress with the 
Group’s strategy of portfolio optimisation 
and were pleased to complete the sale  
of our UK highways services business to 
Skanska on 4 October 2013 for an initial 
cash consideration of £16m, together  
with a further £2m subject to the future 
performance of the business. The profit 
on the disposal of this business was 
£13.0m, which is accounted for in the 
Group’s profit before tax but not reported 
in the tables above.
Staff numbers at the end of March were 
9,544, a reduction of 590 on the same 
time last year. On an underlying basis, 
excluding the 1,128 staff who transferred 
as part of the UK highways services sale  
in the period, headcount was up 6% in 
the year.
Business model
We are primarily focused on the UK and 
European markets where we plan, design 
and enable our clients’ capital 
programmes and projects in and around 
infrastructure, as well as providing 
engineering consultancy services to wider 
markets. We are a technical consultancy, 
providing advice, design and engineering 
together with project management skills 
for public and private sector clients. Our 
multidisciplinary skills allow us to draw on 
expertise across the business to deliver 
complex projects in the UK and Europe, 
and to support our other regional 
businesses with specialist expertise.
Strategy
Our UK and European strategy focuses  
on maintaining our market leadership 
positions and maximising revenue 
opportunities, taking advantage of  
the UK Government’s commitment  
to stimulate the economy through 
infrastructure investment and from 
regulatory spend in rail, utilities and 
airports. Our defence, security and 
aerospace markets provide good diversity 
to our infrastructure exposure. 
Operational excellence continues to 
improve the underlying processes of the 
business, ensuring increased time to focus 
on our clients’ needs, improving project 
delivery and driving business efficiency. 
Our ability to leverage skills and capability 
from a variety of industry sectors and 
professional disciplines provides a strong 
selling proposition to our clients. We see 
multiple opportunities for our broad 
multidisciplinary offering, providing good 
growth potential.
Business drivers
The economic environment significantly 
affects the opportunities available to our 
business and the UK Government’s 
recognition of infrastructure as a core 
enabler of growth provides a positive 
stimulus. Our diversified portfolio provides 
resilience to market fluctuations, as does 
the fact that a number of our markets 
remain well-funded. The Scandinavian 
markets that we face continue to benefit 
from investment in infrastructure from  
the public and private sectors, providing 
stable, well-funded, market conditions. 
Added resilience is brought to our UK 
business by its ongoing support of 
projects in other regions, together with 
the increasing use of our global design 
centres in Bangalore and Delhi, which 
provide flexibility of delivery and access  
to high-quality, lower cost resources.
Our market leadership position in the  
UK is underpinned by the technical 
excellence of our people and the quality 
of their work. This has been recognised  
by a number of awards in the year, 
including being named the New Civil 
Engineer/Association for Consultancy  
and Engineering UK Major Consultant  
of the Year 2014 and the winner of the 
best change management project in  
the Management Consultancy Awards,  
in partnership with Network Rail, for the 
Level Crossing Improvement Programme.
People 
Excluding the staff who transferred from 
Atkins with the sale of the UK highways 
services business, the United Kingdom 
and Europe business experienced positive 
headcount growth. Staff turnover 
increased slightly to 9.5% from 8.8%.
A combination of improving market 
conditions, the need to recruit highly 
specialist skills and a large and diverse 
number of competitors for designers, 
engineers and project managers across 
the region resulted in a number of 
programmes being implemented to assist 
with the attraction, engagement and 
retention of talented people. Strategic Report 23

Reputation also plays a vital role in 
recruitment and retention and over  
the last year Atkins has been recognised 
by a number of independent organisations 
as a great place to work. In the Sunday 
Times 25 Best Big Companies to Work  
For we moved from 23rd to 18th and 
appeared in the top 25 for the eighth time 
in 10 years. We continue to be one of the 
biggest and most popular recruiters of 
newly graduated engineers and were 
again voted the TARGETjobs most popular 
graduate recruiter in the construction,  
civil engineering and surveying sector. 
During 2013 more than 400 young  
people joined the UK business on formal 
education and development programmes. 
This was one of our largest ever intakes 
and included more than 90 apprentices. 
In 2013, Atkins became a founder 
member of the 5% Club. As a member 
we have committed to having a minimum 
of 5% of our overall UK headcount  
on a formalised apprentice, sponsored 
student or graduate programme. As of  
31 March 2014, we had achieved 12.5%.
We continue to work to increase the 
proportion of female staff in Atkins  
and have developed a range of flexible 
working options to help us both recruit 
and retain a broader range of staff. Our 
efforts were recognised by workingmums.
co.uk when it announced Atkins as  
winner of its Overall Top Employer and 
Innovation in Flexible Working awards. 
In line with the rest of the Group, we 
measure employee engagement through 
our Viewpoint employee engagement 
survey. We have established a regional 
target of improving our regional 
engagement score by two points on  
a year on year basis and were encouraged 
that in the UK our results in 2013  
showed an increase of five points over  
the previous year. 
Safety and sustainability
Workplace health, safety and wellbeing 
continue to be a high priority. Although 
the overall accident incident rate remains 
largely static, there were encouraging 
improvements on the engineering and 
contractor indicators. In the UK, we were 
pleased to be awarded a Royal Society for 
the Prevention of Accidents Gold Award 
for Occupational Health and Safety for  
the third consecutive year. 
As a founding member of the 
Consultants’ Health and Safety Forum, 
during the year we have been involved  
in developing an online training package 
that integrates risk assessment early  
in the design process to encourage  
good practice. 
The ongoing promotion of science, 
technology, engineering and mathematics 
(STEM) careers to young people continues 
to be a focus. The UK business created 
eight STEM hubs nationwide to enable  
a more coordinated approach to STEM 
activity with schools, colleges and 
community groups. We currently have 
more than 200 STEM ambassadors 
actively engaged in this programme. 
To encourage our people to contribute 
further to the social, environmental and 
economic health of our communities we 
have formalised a volunteering policy 
commitment in the UK. These volunteer 
days have mainly been used to support 
charity organisations like RedR and 
Engineers without Borders.
Risk
The majority of the Group’s post-
employment benefit liability sits within the 
UK business and is comprised of defined 
benefit pension obligations, the largest  
of which is within the Atkins Pension Plan, 
which is closed to the future accrual of 
benefits (see note 32 on page 161).  
The pension obligations are recognised  
as a risk due to their size and the fact  
that the ongoing liability is a function  
of a number of assumptions, not least  
the life expectancy of members. This risk 
is mitigated by ongoing cash contributions 
to the pension fund, which have been 
agreed with the pension trustees, along 
with measures to actively manage 
ongoing volatility.
To assist in managing our project  
portfolio we continue to cascade  
a project management competency 
framework across the region. The 
implementation of this initiative,  
including the associated training, will 
assist in developing project management 
capabilities within the region. 
We identify, review and assess risks across 
all of our businesses and the process is 
explained in more detail in the Principal 
Risks and Uncertainties section of the 
Group’s Annual Report and Accounts 
(page 44).
Outlook
The outlook for our UK and European 
business as a whole is stable despite  
a slowdown in our aerospace business.  
In the UK the infrastructure markets 
present opportunities for our broad 
multidisciplinary offering as the UK 
Government further stimulates the 
economy with its commitment to 
infrastructure spend. Our secured work  
in hand of 49.9% (2013: 52.3%) of  
next year’s budgeted revenue gives us 
confidence for the year ahead.
The core Scandinavian rail and highways 
markets remain well-funded, with a visible 
pipeline of new projects, supported by 
government commitments. Work in hand 
in Europe improved in the year to 42.3% 
(2013: 38.9%).  24 Strategic Report

Performance
The UK business has grown headline 
revenue by 2.4% despite the sale of  
our highways services business part  
way through the year. On an underlying 
continuing basis, the business delivered  
a strong performance with revenue 
growth of 16.7%, supported by 
underlying headcount growth of 6.8%, 
excluding highways services. 
The full year operating margin of 6.3% 
(2013: 6.3%) held steady, with a contract 
gain share as a consequence of our M25 
design project exceeding its delivery 
targets on the initial upgraded sections,  
in part offset by outstanding variation 
negotiations on certain longer term rail 
signalling contracts. Encouragingly, second 
half margins moved ahead to 7.4%  
(2013: 6.6%), partly due to the disposal  
of the lower margin highways services 
business and through the ongoing focus 
on margin across the business. Excluding 
the highways services contribution for the 
period of ownership, the margin for the 
year was 7.0%.
Operations
Rail 
Our rail business has had a busy year  
with high levels of utilisation, reflecting 
the strong pipeline of projects. Over  
the course of the year, headcount has 
grown significantly as a number of major 
signalling, station design and electrification 
projects have started. However, the 
performance of this business has been 
adversely impacted by negotiations 
around contract variations on some  
of our longer term signalling contracts.
A focus of this financial year has been  
on delivering work across a number of 
signalling projects awarded under the  
two major frameworks for the Sussex/
Wessex and Kent/Anglia areas, including 
Farnham and East Sussex. During the  
year, we secured further work through 
these frameworks, including a major 
re-signalling project in East Kent. This  
is in addition to ongoing work on our 
other non-framework signalling contracts 
at Cardiff and Wolverhampton.
The UK’s electrification programme 
presents a substantial opportunity for  
our rail business. In partnership with 
Parsons Brinckerhoff, we are the lead 
design organisation for the electrification 
of the Great Western main line between 
London and South Wales.
In partnership with Network Rail, Laing 
O’Rourke and VolkerRail, we are jointly 
delivering the Stafford Area Improvement 
Programme. During the year we have also 
continued to support the delivery of  
a number of other technically challenging 
projects for Network Rail, including the 
transformation of Birmingham New Street 
station and design work for the East West 
Rail project, which aims to connect  
East Anglia with central, southern and 
western England.
The rail business has been involved  
in early stage design for phase one of 
High Speed 2 (HS2), between London  
and the West Midlands, including civils 
design and environmental work, and  
we believe we are well placed to win 
further opportunities on phase two. 
Our rail business won six industry awards 
during 2013, including: Best Practice 
Award for the Thameslink Borough 
Viaduct at the British Construction 
Industry Awards; Project of the Year for 
Nuneaton North Chord at the Rail Freight 
Group Awards; and the Innovation Award 
for East Kent Access Phase Two at the 
Institute of Civil Engineers (ICE) 
Engineering Excellence Awards. Strategic Report 25

United Kingdom and Europe
Our rail business had a strong work in 
hand position as we entered the new 
financial year, reflecting the continued 
strong pipeline.
Highways and transportation
Following the disposal of our highways 
services business, we have refocused the 
highways and transportation business on 
three core areas: strategic advice, design 
consultancy and asset management.  
In addition, we continue to provide 
operational maintenance and design for 
the M25, London’s orbital motorway, as 
part of our role within the M25 Connect 
Plus consortium. During the year, we 
received a contract gain share payment as 
a consequence of our M25 design project 
exceeding its delivery targets on the initial 
upgraded sections.
We have healthy workloads, supported  
by the UK Government’s 2013 Spending 
Review and Autumn Statement, which 
indicate a significant increase in 
infrastructure spend through to 2020/21, 
including major new roads schemes in 
England, Scotland and Wales. We have 
secured a number of projects for which 
funding was committed through this 
process, including work on the M54/M6 
junction, the A27 Chichester bypass and 
schemes as part of the Highways Agency’s 
Smart Motorways programme.
The year has seen significant activity in  
the Smart Motorways sector, with the 
completion of major schemes on the  
M62 in Manchester and at the M4/M5 
interchange near Bristol, as well as the 
recent opening of the Atkins-designed 
first section of all-lane running on the 
M25. We have recently secured the M1 
junction 19 to 16 contract and there is  
a robust pipeline of further schemes that 
will come to the market in the year ahead.
Our multidisciplinary consultancy services 
teams have continued to deliver well with 
strong revenue growth in Wiltshire, 
supported by further wins in the West 
Midlands and more recently in Hampshire. 
These long-term contracts, covering  
a wide range of services from transport 
planning and asset management to 
engineering design, are also set to benefit 
from additional capital funding over the 
next five years.
Looking ahead, the Highways Agency  
will undergo a major change as it looks 
set to become a government-owned 
company by April 2015. We expect to  
see a three-fold increase in its annual 
expenditure to more than £3.0bn per 
annum by 2020 procured through a new 
collaborative delivery framework. We  
have prequalified for this key opportunity, 
with final awards onto the framework 
expected to be made in autumn 2014.
Water and environment
Our water and environment business  
has undertaken significant work on  
key projects during the year, including 
Crossrail and High Speed 2 and the peak 
of delivery for the water industry in the 
Asset Management Plan 5 (AMP5) 
investment cycle.
Our five-year regulatory AMP5 framework 
contracts with a number of the UK’s  
water companies have continued to 
provide good workload volumes as  
capital investment programmes progress. 
It has been encouraging to see the water 
industry developing its delivery models 
well in advance of the start of AMP6 in 
April 2015 and we have been successful  
in securing key places on the AMP6 
frameworks with Thames Water and 
Severn Trent Water. We are bidding for 
similar collaborative opportunities with 
other water companies which should 
provide further continuity of workload 
between future AMP cycles.
Atkins, alongside partners Boskalis 
Westminster Ltd and VolkerStevin Group 
(the VBA consortium), is one of six asset 
delivery partners to secure a place on the 
Environment Agency’s £1bn Water and 
Environment Management (WEM) 
framework, which will run until late 2017. 
This will focus on reducing the risk of river 
and coastal flooding, as well as securing 
social and environmental improvements.
As a result of our focus on working with 
international funding and development 
organisations, Atkins has won a contract 
to lead a pan-European consortium to 
develop sustainable energy solutions  
for 24 countries in eastern and southern 
Africa, and is a consortium partner in 
another contract covering a further  
26 countries in western and central  
Africa. These two contracts are part of  
the Sustainable Energy for All (SE4ALL) 
framework which is a multi-stakeholder 
partnership between governments, the 
private sector and civil society.
Faithful+Gould
Our UK Faithful+Gould business saw 
good growth in the year, with steady 
workloads through the Scape public 
sector procurement framework and 
continued growth in the energy sector. 
We are also seeing signs of improvement 
in the property sector with London and 
the south east leading the way, evidenced 
by recent wins for Development Securities 
and Argent. The market for project 
management and commercial services 
remains competitive, although we are 
optimistic about improvement as the 
sector emerges from recession.  26 Strategic Report

Design and engineering
Our design and engineering business 
serves customers across five key segments: 
education, airports, defence, transportation 
and mixed use development. All sectors 
have strong pipelines of secured 
workloads and opportunities.
In the education sector, the Priority 
Schools and Academies programmes 
continue to gain momentum, and 
we are well placed to participate in  
these significant opportunities, with  
a particular focus on buildings and  
related infrastructure.
Our airports team continues to win and 
deliver significant programmes of work  
at both London Gatwick and Heathrow. 
We have been appointed by Gatwick 
Airport Limited to provide multidisciplinary 
design services as part of a continued 
investment programme to transform  
the airport. At Heathrow, we have been 
appointed as programme designer for  
the asset management and replacement 
programme for the Q6 investment period.
In energy, we have secured a number of 
key projects to support initial infrastructure 
work around nuclear new build in the UK, 
in addition to significant work to support 
nuclear decommissioning projects.
Defence, aerospace and 
communications
Our defence, aerospace and 
communications business continues to 
provide good diversity to our infrastructure 
exposure, with access to a number of 
exciting growth opportunities.
In defence we continue to be actively 
engaged in opportunities to assist in the 
transformation of Defence Equipment  
and Support, which is part of the  
UK Ministry of Defence. 
We have experienced a recent slowdown 
in our aerospace business as our major 
client, Airbus Group, has moved from 
design to production on a number  
of programmes.
Our communications business continues 
to provide expertise to a number of  
key clients where our broad-based  
design and implementation capability  
sits neatly alongside our infrastructure 
business streams.
Management consulting
Our management consulting business 
provides the UK Government and  
industry with practical capability to  
run the full lifecycle of information 
technology enabled change programmes. 
We continue to deliver security work for 
central government, as well as supporting 
Heathrow Airport’s IT outsourcing 
contract in partnership with Capgemini, 
leveraging our position in aviation.
Our capability in holistic security continued 
to grow. This team has secured a range  
of new projects including a significant 
assignment in cyber security for a high 
profile multinational client in the  
energy sector. Strategic Report 27

Performance
Our European business is primarily focused 
on the rail and highways infrastructure 
markets in Scandinavia, with smaller 
operations in Poland, Ireland and Portugal. 
Our performance was in line with our 
expectations with revenue at £76.3m, 
which was broadly flat compared with the 
prior year and with margins down against 
strong prior year comparatives, which 
were buoyed by provision releases.  
This margin reduction is also reflective  
of an increasingly competitive market in 
Scandinavia. Headcount was down slightly 
to 734 (2013: 760).
Operations
In Denmark, we continue to work across  
a number of key rail and road infrastructure 
projects, including the new railway line 
between Copenhagen and Ringsted and 
the European Rail Traffic Management 
System signalling programme. We have 
maintained a strong order book through 
the year, securing new projects such as 
the Hundige-Køge rail renewal project 
and bridge design on the Copenhagen  
to Ringsted line. The Danish Government 
has recently announced a major 
programme of investment in rail 
infrastructure and rolling stock, and we 
believe we are well-positioned to benefit.
In Sweden, we are working on a number 
of significant infrastructure projects, such 
as the Lidingö Tram Line for Stockholm 
County Council and the Mälarbanan rail 
systems project for the state transport 
authority, Trafikverket. We have secured 
further projects in the period, including a 
Kil to Laxa rail project. The market outlook 
and medium-term pipeline remain good.
We continue to work to expand our 
position in the Norwegian infrastructure 
market, which is expected to return to 
growth over the next few years, and we 
are developing a number of opportunities 
within rail, metro and light rail.
In Poland, we remain focused on  
the transportation (road and rail), 
environmental and energy sectors where 
our largest project continues to be our 
role as the owner’s engineer for the  
Polish liquefied natural gas plant. 
Increased market activity is expected  
in the future, as EU funding is unlocked 
for new capital schemes.
Our operations have stabilised in Ireland 
and showed some modest growth 
through the year with headcount 
increasing for the first time since 2008  
on the back of some good wins in the 
water and highways sectors. In Portugal, 
the continuing difficult economic 
conditions will curtail any meaningful 
growth in the medium term. 28 Strategic Report

North America
Performance
Our North American business has seen  
a 24.8% increase in operating profit over 
last year, increasing profit to £19.1m 
(2013: £15.3m) at an improved margin  
of 5.0%, up from 3.9% in the prior year. 
We have made good progress with the 
portfolio optimisation part of our strategy, 
with the divestment of the Peter Brown 
construction management at risk business 
on 30 August 2013. Excluding the results 
of the Peter Brown business, which 
reported a trading loss for the year of 
£3.2m, gives a combined consultancy  
and Faithful+Gould operating profit  
of £22.3m (2013: £21.8m), at a margin  
of 6.0% (2013: 6.0%).
The disposal of Peter Brown resulted in  
a loss on sale of £3.1m, which is adjusted 
for in calculating the Group underlying 
profit before tax and is not reported in  
the preceding table (page 28).
Average staff numbers have fallen by  
121 since last year, partly as a consequence 
of the disposal of the Peter Brown 
business, which accounted for 37 staff, 
and partly due to restructuring.
Our operational excellence programme 
has been rolled out during this financial 
year, with an initial focus on increasing 
margins through both reductions in  
our overhead cost base and improving 
staff utilisation.
Business model 
Our transportation, infrastructure and 
environmental businesses have been 
reorganised to focus on multidisciplinary 
design and engineering consultancy 
services in five client-facing areas: 
transportation, public and private, federal, 
aviation and strategic ventures, which 
includes areas such as rail, energy, 
technology and future-proofing cities.  
In order to compete effectively in these 
markets we have adopted a new 
operating model comprising a technical 
professional organisation creating 
discipline-focused technical resources. 
These technical resources will service the 
new client-facing business units, which  
are supported by dedicated client-focused 
business development and sales teams. 
This simplified operating structure will 
enable us to focus business development 
and sales on our chosen clients as we 
progress to larger, more complex projects.
Strategy
Our strategy is to focus on major 
infrastructure programmes in the 
transportation, energy, federal, state  
and cities markets in North America.
As part of the overall Group strategy  
pillar of portfolio optimisation we 
disposed of the Peter Brown business 
during the year, allowing us to focus  
on our key consultancy and programme 
management markets.
We are strengthening our capability  
to compete for, win and deliver major 
projects and programmes, leveraging  
our technology capabilities to create  
a competitive advantage.
We are shifting our focus to capturing  
and winning work, and have created  
a flexible and scalable technical 
professional organisation to deliver  
work more efficiently.
We aim to improve margins by 
streamlining our organisation and 
removing overhead costs as part of  
our operational excellence programme.
Business drivers
The majority of North America’s projects 
are funded in part or in whole by federal 
funds, either through a state or local 
government agency or directly by federal 
agencies. Publicly funded projects provide 
greater stability than privately funded 
projects, which tend to have funding 
fluctuations. However, publicly funded 
projects tend to be awarded more  
slowly or are delayed due to protracted 
negotiations within the agencies and/or 
due to political scrutiny.
Operations 
Our transportation business has continued 
its positive performance. During the year 
we were appointed to three new contracts 
to oversee transport solutions for 
highways authorities in Florida, Georgia 
and Texas. Additionally, we were awarded 
work by the Colorado Department of 
Transportation to provide general tolling 
advisory services.
Our public and private portfolio has 
benefited from awards in the wastewater 
management, energy, marine, and 
emergency response areas of our business. 
This includes our appointment to a  
five-year Texas Multiple Award Schedule 
contract which gives us access to more 
than 2,000 potential government-related 
clients throughout Texas and builds on 
more than 40 years of delivering quality 
services throughout the state.
In aviation, we were awarded a general 
services contract at Hartsfield-Jackson 
Atlanta International Airport, through  
our Absolute joint venture, comprising 
Atkins, Southeastern Engineering, Inc.  
and Brindley Pieters and Associates.
Despite generally slow Federal 
Government business and a government 
shutdown in October, we were still 
awarded some notable contracts, the 
largest of these being the reappointment 
to the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency (FEMA) flood risk MAP framework 
contract and the FEMA Nationwide 
Housing Inspection Services contract  
(in joint venture with The Louis Berger 
Group, Inc. and Tidal Basin Government 
Consulting, LLC). We also extended  
our rapid response contract with the  
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
We continue to provide key planning, 
design and engineering services for  
the United States Military Academy at 
West Point.  30 Strategic Report

North America
Our Faithful+Gould business had a good 
year with an improvement in margins  
and profitability. We benefited from  
the continued economic recovery in  
the private sector, most notably 
manufacturing. Additionally, in the 
hospitality and leisure sector we have 
made good progress and were successfully 
appointed to provide project management 
services on a series of upgrades to the 
iconic Billie Jean King National Tennis 
Center in Queens, New York. We continue 
to see growth in the energy sector,  
as evidenced by the renewal of our 
commission with Ontario Power 
Generation Inc. for a further three years.
People
To support our operational excellence 
strategy we restructured our business, 
delivering efficiencies and an associated 
headcount reduction of around 6.7%. 
Staff turnover increased slightly in the 
year, although it still remains in line with 
the North America industry average.
We remain focused on the engagement 
and retention of key staff and measure 
employee engagement through our 
Group wide Viewpoint employee 
engagement survey. The overall score 
remains in line with the benchmarks  
for our industry sector. 
We continue to balance the need to offer 
market-competitive reward structures 
against our financial performance and 
affordability. The implementation of  
My Career, our new Group wide online 
performance management system, is 
expected to improve the quality of our 
performance management activities  
and create greater alignment between 
performance and rewards. 
Safety and sustainability
We have a strong safety ethos and culture 
led from the top of our organisation.  
Our Faithful+Gould business has promoted 
physical health in offices, introducing 
some agile workspaces which provide  
an option for employees to work standing 
up. Spending more time standing has well 
documented ergonomic and cardiovascular 
benefits and promotes increased physical 
movement at work. In addition we have 
introduced a comprehensive heat stress 
index, supported by controls, which uses 
temperature and humidity to estimate 
risks to workers from environmental  
heat sources. 
As part of ongoing driver fitness 
assessment the driving history of our 
people has been reviewed and 
supplementary driver safety training 
provided where required.
This year’s recipients of support from  
our Atkins Foundation included a high 
school robotics design team, an initiative 
challenging middle school students to 
design and build table top scale models  
of future cities using recycled materials, 
and the American Red Cross in its 
Oklahoma tornado disaster relief efforts. 
The current year accident incident rate 
figure, although higher than the prior 
year, represents three accidents, two 
minor slips and trips and one road traffic 
accident, an increase of one accident  
year on year. 
Risk
The assessment of risks across all our 
businesses is explained in more detail  
in the Principal Risks and Uncertainties 
section of the Annual Report and 
Accounts (page 44). There have been no 
significant developments with regard to 
the longstanding and previously reported 
Department of Justice and Securities and 
Exchange Commission enquiries relating 
to potential Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
violations by The PBSJ Corporation prior  
to its acquisition by the Group.
Outlook
We continue to see stable market 
conditions in the key states within which 
we operate. Economic conditions in 
certain states, such as Texas and Colorado, 
remain positive, and coupled with 
increased interest in private investments  
in public infrastructure at state level there 
are positive investment signals in the 
market. Work in hand at 31 March 2014 
stands at 58.8% of next year’s budgeted 
revenue (2013: 61.0%).
Moving into the new financial year our 
revised structure and continued focus on 
our cost base provide a strong platform 
for progress. Strategic Report 31

Segmental performance continued
Middle East
Performance
The Middle East region had an improved 
year with revenue up 3.8% to £168.4m 
(2013: £162.2m) and operating profit 
22% ahead of last year, reflecting a 
strong second half performance, with 
significant wins in the rail sector and 
encouraging signs of a re-emergence of 
growth in the United Arab Emirates’ (UAE) 
property sector offsetting restructuring 
costs and delays to project mobilisation 
during the first half of the financial 
 year. Notwithstanding this improved 
performance, we continue to experience 
protracted negotiations on variations on 
some of our major contracts in the region.
Business model
Our business model is to maintain strong 
local resources in our chosen markets, 
complemented by multi-skilled design 
centres both within the region and in 
India. This provides agility and efficiency 
by maximising our ability to mobilise for 
major projects, while minimising exposure 
to individual market resource demands 
and constraints.
Strategy
Our strategy in the Middle East is to focus 
on the region’s most dynamic markets 
and sectors; namely infrastructure, rail  
and property in the UAE, Qatar and the 
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). The 
region offers multiple opportunities  
and our strategy is aimed at carefully 
selecting and securing major projects and 
programmes with established key clients. 
In addition, local resources support our 
energy business in the region, which is 
reported within our Energy segment.
Business drivers
The economic climate in the Middle East  
is primarily driven by the global oil price, 
which affects demand for our services 
since regional spending ultimately flows 
through to capital investment in 
infrastructure, transportation and 
property. The longer term need to 
develop in these areas to support growing 
economies and populations will continue 
to drive strong demand for our services. 
We have a clear view of well-funded 
programmes.
Operations 
Notwithstanding some delays experienced 
on projects coming to the market in the 
first half of this financial year, the business 
has built upon its well-balanced workload 
and further cemented its position among 
the region’s foremost design and 
engineering consultancies. 
One of our most significant projects  
in the region is as lead designer for three 
of the six lines of Riyadh Metro, where  
we are partnering with the Spanish 
consultancy TYPSA. Our client is the  
FAST consortium (comprising FCC, 
Samsung, Alstom, Strukton and 
Freyssinet), which is responsible for lines 
four, five and six, representing just over  
a third of the total track. This project  
has further developed our profile in the  
KSA, building on our ongoing role as  
lead designer and programme manager 
for the new 30m passenger per year 
terminal and associated buildings and 
infrastructure at King Abdulaziz 
International Airport in Jeddah.
Our current rail projects include Etihad Rail 
in the UAE, Dubai Tram, UAE, and Doha 
Metro Red Line South and Lusail Light Rail 
in Qatar. There remains strong demand 
for metro projects across the region, with 
further opportunities to work selectively 
for design and build contractors within 
our core markets.
Infrastructure sector activity, which covers 
roads, bridges and utilities networks, 
remains buoyant in Qatar, where our 
headcount has grown to approximately 
500 locally based staff. We continue  
to work with the Qatari Government, 
advising on infrastructure planning and 
design projects to meet its National Vision 
2030. Our key projects include the  
Central Planning Office, which is making 
an important contribution to the 
coordination of Qatar’s major transport 
programmes, and a significant framework 
contract to upgrade Doha’s roads and 
drainage systems. 
In Abu Dhabi we have a broad portfolio  
of infrastructure projects with key  
clients including Abu Dhabi and Al Ain 
Municipality, the Department of Municipal 
Affairs, the Urban Planning Council  
and Musanada. Notable projects include  
the design of infrastructure for a £1.3bn,  
42 km
2
 Emirati community in North 
Wathba. We are also seeing opportunities 
in the KSA, where we recently won  
a strategic programme partnering with 
Bechtel to advise the Economic Cities 
Authority on the development of four 
new cities. In addition, we are supporting 
the Royal Commission of Jubail and Yanbu 
with its major industrial development 
activity in the Eastern Province.
Our property sector activity is showing  
early signs of an upturn, particularly in 
Dubai following the city’s successful bid  
to host Expo 2020, where developers have 
been restarting suspended projects and 
initiating new opportunities. Our current 
key projects include Dubai Opera House 
and the residential element of Al Habtoor 
City, a major new development along 
Sheikh Zayed Road, the city’s main  
arterial highway. Strategic Report 33

Middle East
Our established presence in Oman is also 
presenting good opportunities within  
the property and infrastructure sectors 
through longstanding clients such as  
The Wave, Muscat and Omran, as well  
as Saraya Bandar Jissah, for whom we are 
providing construction supervision services 
for the infrastructure works for a £350m 
residential and leisure development.
During the first half of the year we 
undertook restructuring activity in Kuwait 
and Bahrain, enabling us to concentrate 
resources within our priority growth 
markets.
Our Faithful+Gould Middle East business 
has performed well, supplemented by  
the addition of the Confluence project 
management business of 71 staff.  
We continue to provide project and 
programme management support across 
the region. During the year we have seen 
good growth in both Qatar and the KSA. 
The acquisition of Confluence brought 
additional projects with new clients, most 
notably the University of Dubai and two 
Kempinski hotels in Oman and Dubai. 
Our achievements are evidenced by 
industry awards and recognition, such  
as our success in being named Consultant 
of the Year 2013 by both Construction 
Week and Middle East MEP magazines,  
as well as winning Construction Week 
Qatar’s Health and Safety Initiative of the 
Year award.
People
Headcount has grown modestly, up  
92 year on year, with 71 staff joining the 
region as a consequence of the acquisition 
of Confluence. We also saw the impact  
of mobilising new contracts offset by 
reductions in Bahrain and Kuwait where 
we are reducing our presence. Improved 
market conditions have also led to greater 
competition for staff, particularly in key 
markets such as Qatar and the UAE, with 
staff turnover increasing to 16% across 
the region.
We measure staff engagement through 
our Group wide Viewpoint survey.  
Our overall engagement score for the 
Middle East region remains significantly 
better than the benchmark for our 
industry sector. This is reinforced by the 
large proportion of staff who indicated  
in the survey that they are proud to work 
for Atkins and that they care about 
the success of the organisation. This is 
particularly pleasing given the retention 
challenges that we face in the region. 
However, we experienced a slight drop  
in the overall engagement score in 
the current year and have focused on  
specific staff engagement activities to 
address this.
Our ability to mobilise existing staff from 
across the Group and to hire new staff 
from within and outside the region to 
resource the delivery of major projects  
is critical to our business success in the 
Middle East. 
Safety and sustainability
We are demonstrating strong leadership 
through the launch of the Atkins 
minimum requirements for construction 
safety which establishes a new level of  
control over our engagement with and 
influence over clients and contractors  
on construction supervision projects.  
It includes health, safety and welfare 
statutory regulations.
The accident incident rate for both the 
current and prior year relates to single 
office-related incidents.
We have extended our influence around 
sustainability through the continued 
funding of the chair and senior lecturer  
of sustainable design of the built 
environment at the British University  
in Dubai.
Risk
Certain countries within the Middle East 
have greater potential for political change. 
In addition, it is a region where there is  
an increased risk of payment delays. Our 
extensive experience of operating in the 
Middle East over the last 40 years gives  
us a level of insight into the political 
environment which, combined with our 
focused strategy of carefully selecting 
both the countries and clients, enables  
us to mitigate political and commercial 
risks as much as possible. 
Construction safety remains an elevated 
risk in the Middle East. As explained  
in our Corporate Sustainability Review 
(page 54), we are mitigating this risk 
wherever possible and have been 
instrumental in creating improved 
standards for the industry.
We track risks across all of our businesses. 
This process is explained in more detail  
in the Principal Risks and Uncertainties 
section of the Group’s Annual Report and 
Accounts (page 44).
Outlook
We have a good order book which stands 
at 62.7% of next year’s budgeted revenue 
(2013: 80.2%). In the next financial year 
we see good opportunities for growth  
in our key property, infrastructure and  
rail sectors in the well-funded markets  
of Qatar, the UAE and the KSA. 34 Strategic Report

Performance
Our Asia Pacific region saw good growth 
this financial year in revenue, which was 
up by 14.2%, and headcount, up 15.7% 
and closing at 1,498 (2013: 1,295). This  
is a consequence of both organic growth,  
as the business diversifies its technical  
and geographic base, and the acquisition 
in October 2013 of the Confluence  
project management business, which has 
operations in Asia Pacific, the Middle East 
and India, for a debt-free cash consideration 
of £8.4m.
Our operating margin of 8.0%  
(2013: 9.2%) reflects both our continued 
investment in strategic growth and  
the integration and transaction costs 
associated with the Confluence acquisition 
incurred during the year.
Business model
In Asia Pacific, we operate through  
a network of offices in Greater China, 
Malaysia, Vietnam, Singapore, India  
and Australia, providing our clients with  
a range of services throughout the  
entire cycle of urban development.  
The acquisition of Confluence has further 
strengthened our regional capability in 
project management. We also draw upon 
our Group wide capability to deliver the 
most suitable solution to our clients.
Strategy
We are working to expand our footprint  
in Asia Pacific to take advantage of the 
rapid urbanisation opportunities that are 
emerging. In Hong Kong we have 
developed a dedicated team to pursue  
the pipeline of large scale government 
infrastructure programmes. We continue 
to focus on broadening our client base, 
adding prestigious names such as the 
Airport Authority and West Kowloon 
Cultural District Authority alongside the 
Mass Transit Railway Corporation. We also 
continue to strengthen our relationships 
with internationally renowned contractors 
through our design and build projects.
In mainland China, we have adopted  
a multidisciplinary approach to engage  
the rise of rapid urbanisation and the 
increasing emphasis on quality. This  
has provided good opportunities for  
our planning, architecture and landscape 
business, while our expertise in economic 
studies, transport planning and eco-low 
carbon consultancy positions us well in 
the market. We are now introducing  
our engineering services to the market 
through strategic partnerships with 
leading local companies to leverage 
further growth in China. In addition,  
we see a number of major Chinese 
companies investing in large scale 
infrastructure projects internationally  
and our partnerships with them provide 
us with significant growth opportunities  
in other regions.
We continue to expand in South East Asia 
in Malaysia, Vietnam and Singapore  
as well as India, with a primary focus in 
urban planning, transport infrastructure 
and property. We are endeavouring to 
leverage the strengths and contacts of  
our existing Atkins and Faithful+Gould 
businesses with the recently acquired 
Confluence business in the markets  
we share.
Business drivers
Our growth potential in the Asia Pacific 
region is underpinned by the speed  
and scale of urbanisation driving both 
government spending and, to a large 
extent, the rate of private sector 
investment.
Outside Asia Pacific, we see good 
business opportunities for the Group  
as major Chinese companies invest in 
large scale infrastructure development 
projects overseas.
Operations
In Hong Kong, we continue to diversify 
our key client portfolio and deliver high 
end engineering services to achieve  
steady growth.
We were recently appointed to undertake 
project management consultancy services 
for the West Kowloon Cultural District 
development in Hong Kong. Securing  
this major project demonstrates our 
commitment to growth and diversification 
in Hong Kong and the Asia Pacific region.
We have been commissioned by Dragages 
Hong Kong Limited (Dragages) as the 
design consultant for the Liantang/Heung 
Yuen Wai Boundary Control Point project 
and associated works. This is our largest 
design and build contract with Dragages 
in Hong Kong to date. The commission 
further enhances our relationship with 
Dragages and underpins our strategy  
of working with contractors.
We recently celebrated the breaking of 
ground for our design for the ‘Pearl of the 
North’, the 565 metre super-tall building 
in Shenyang, which showcases our 
architecture capability for designing 
super-tall iconic buildings in the region. 
We have also completed a plan for the 
Dongliang River restoration and landscape 
design, which creates a new ecological 
leisure destination in Chongqing, China 
and mitigates existing environmental risks  
such as flooding and poor water quality.
We successfully delivered a masterplan  
for a new town in Fuzhou, the capital 
of Fujian Province, which included a large 
scale industrial park for aviation-related 
activity, a 10km tunnel and expressway. 
As a consequence we signed a strategic 
framework cooperation agreement  
with AVIC Joy Air Holdings Limited to  
be involved in the planning of a number  
of major new developments across China. 36 Strategic Report
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2014
Segmental performance continued
Asia Pacific
Elsewhere we continue to expand our 
footprint in South East Asia. Recently  
we were commissioned by the Ministry  
of Rural and Regional Development  
in Malaysia, which is responsible for 
developing, encouraging, facilitating  
and fostering economic and social 
development in the federation, to deliver 
the concept design for buildings and  
the masterplan for core and potential 
extension areas of the Asia Aerospace  
City Subang in Malaysia.
In India, we continue to pursue 
opportunities in the property, 
masterplanning and transportation 
sectors. We work closely with our team  
in Hong Kong to target selected clients 
and niche opportunities in the Indian 
property market and we have been 
successful in securing two commissions 
from Wave Group, one of the largest 
property developers in the Delhi region.  
In the transportation sector, we have  
won highway design work for two new 
townships on the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial 
Corridor project.
Faithful+Gould’s integration of the  
166 Confluence staff in the region,  
out of a total of 237, is progressing well.  
We have had recent success in Singapore 
on several high-profile projects. A key 
initiative is to build our profile in our  
core markets and to expand into new 
sectors, most notably the industrial and 
pharmaceutical sectors in India as well  
as the hotel sector in China.
The Confluence acquisition provides  
a more diverse service and sector portfolio 
from which to build the next stage of  
our growth. This is clearly evident in India, 
where we are involved with Asia’s most 
complex residential project, the showpiece 
Atmosphere development in Kolkata.  
The Confluence business also brings with 
it some distinguished projects, notably  
the project management of the logistics 
surrounding the Singapore Formula One 
Grand Prix circuit.
People
Our Asia Pacific region experienced good 
headcount growth in the last year, with  
an increase of 203, boosted by the 
Confluence acquisition, as we expand  
our regional footprint. Staff turnover has 
increased to 16.4%, reflecting market 
conditions. Our ability to attract and retain 
staff is a key area of focus for us this year.
Our growth targets in the region have 
necessitated a focus on recruitment 
activities. We have invested in this area by 
implementing the Group wide recruitment 
tool and a global careers website with 
specific regional content, to attract more 
applications and increase the efficiency  
of the process.
We are investing in and developing our 
human resources infrastructure to support 
our regional growth plans, and have also 
invested in technology and personnel to 
ensure that we are able to support and 
sustain our next phase of growth.
Safety and sustainability 
The year on year increase in the accident 
incident rate relates to a single office-
related incident.
For the sixth consecutive year, our Hong 
Kong operation has received Hong Kong’s 
Council of Social Service’s Caring 
Company Award for good corporate 
citizenship. We mobilised offices across 
our international operations in response  
to Typhoon Haiyan, to raise money and 
support charities coordinating relief 
efforts, such as RedR.
Our Singapore office has achieved Green 
Services accreditation from the Green 
Building Council for Environment and 
Design in recognition of its development 
of in-house capabilities and corporate 
green practices, along with the delivery  
of sustainable designs and services.
Risk
As we expand our footprint into new 
territories within the region there is an 
increased risk associated with operating  
in these countries. These risks have  
been identified as lack of commercial 
transparency, political instability and  
risks associated with operating within 
unfamiliar regulatory, tax and employment 
regimes. We mitigate these risks by 
undertaking research into both the market 
and specific clients, as well as using 
professional advisors to assist with legal 
and regulatory compliance.
Outlook
Asia Pacific is well placed to deliver on its 
strategic growth plan and the acquisition 
of Confluence strengthens our service 
offering and geographic reach in the 
region. Work in hand is consistent with 
last year at 49.3% (2013: 49.6%) of next 
year’s budgeted revenue, and the 
potential in the region is underpinned by 
the speed and scale of urbanisation in the 
foreseeable future. Strategic Report 37

arrangements. The margin of 8.9% 
reflects ongoing investment in large, 
strategic bids. 
Business model
The Energy business operates worldwide 
in several home markets, competing 
against a wide range of service offerings 
from large multinational engineering 
consultancies to specialist niche players. 
Strategy
We remain focused on nuclear, oil and 
gas, conventional power generation and 
renewables. In these industries we are 
applying our high end multidisciplinary 
engineering skills during both design and 
operational phases to assure the integrity 
and economic performance of our  
clients’ facilities.
We continue to look at investment 
opportunities, selectively expanding our 
geographic footprint and service offering 
through organic growth, as well as 
extending and creating new partnering 
arrangements and targeting acquisitions. 
Business drivers
Our business is underpinned by the global 
growth in energy requirements as many 
countries struggle with increasing demand 
and an imperative to decarbonise to 
mitigate the effects of climate change.
High oil prices drive the demand to  
keep existing energy production and 
distribution facilities operating for longer, 
drawing on our safety and integrity 
services. At the same time, with the 
industry seeking to maximise more 
challenging oil reserves, such as marginal 
and deepwater fields, there is a continued 
increase in demand for our advanced 
engineering skills.
In nuclear we continue to see a similar 
focus on keeping existing facilities 
operating safely for longer. There is also 
continuing demand for technical support 
around nuclear decommissioning. In 
addition, we are seeing momentum 
gather on nuclear new-build programmes 
around the world as many countries look 
to develop nuclear power as part of their 
long-term strategy for energy security  
and decarbonisation. Our skills are in high 
demand across the entire nuclear lifecycle. 
The imperative to decarbonise also 
increases demand for our skills in the 
renewables sector. We are helping 
operators and governments to increase 
capacity from new forms of low carbon 
generation such as offshore wind, 
biomass and energy from waste.
Operations
Nuclear
Our position in the UK nuclear new-build 
market has strengthened following our 
appointment to a major new framework 
with Horizon Nuclear Power to provide 
engineering and related technical services 
for a new generation of nuclear power 
stations in the UK.
We remain busy on existing nuclear 
generation work through our role as  
an EDF Energy UK strategic supply chain 
partner. Our recent appointment to 
provide design, engineering, infrastructure 
and project management services  
to URENCO’s �540m capital expenditure 
programme further builds our relationship 
with this key player within the nuclear  
fuel supply chain.
Our position in the UK’s nuclear 
decommissioning market has been 
cemented further by our recent 
appointment as the preferred bidder  
on a new contract with Sellafield Ltd  
for its £1.4bn Silos Direct encapsulation 
Plant (SDP) project, as part of an equal 
three-way joint venture with Areva and 
Mace (a.m.a.). The SDP will process 
nuclear waste recovered from one of  
the largest high hazard nuclear waste  
silos on the Sellafield site and is the only 
project of its kind in the world. This award 
is testament to the success of our strategic 
partnerships, which continue to deliver 
excellent opportunities for the Group.
We continue to develop an international 
nuclear portfolio providing a broad range 
of services to Emirates Nuclear Energy 
Corporation in the Middle East on the 
£20bn Barakah Nuclear Programme, 
through n.triple.a, our joint venture with 
French engineering consultancy Assystem. 
We are also acting as architect engineer, 
as part of the Engage consortium, on  
the �15bn International Thermonuclear 
Experimental Reactor (ITER) programme  
in the South of France. Strategic Report 39

Energy
Establishing a nuclear footprint in the  
US has also been a priority as we await 
final approvals from the US Government 
for our acquisition of Nuclear Safety 
Associates Inc. (NSA), a 130-person 
engineering and technical services firm 
with a focus on nuclear safety, design 
engineering and professional security 
services. NSA will both enhance the 
capability of the Group’s Energy business 
and provide it with the opportunity to 
expand its well-established project and 
client base in the US.
Oil and gas
Our oil and gas business continues to 
focus on securing long-term framework 
agreements for both consultancy and 
design services for major oil and gas 
operators. We continue to expand our 
ability to provide services on a worldwide 
scale through our operational hubs and 
centres of technical excellence in the UK, 
Middle East, North America and Asia 
Pacific regions. 
The most significant win in line with this 
strategy is our recent five-year global 
agreement with BP for the provision  
of engineering design, engineering 
consultancy and project management 
services to BP’s upstream oil and gas 
production facilities and assets worldwide.
 
In the year we also secured a two-year 
framework with major integrated energy 
company ENI, supporting its portfolio  
of operating assets in Australia as well  
as non-operating assets and any future 
developments. This builds on contracts 
already established providing a wide  
range of consultancy services to Maersk, 
Chevron, Talisman, Apache, Nexen and 
Statoil in the North Sea and the Gulf of 
Mexico, as well as our global enterprise 
framework agreement with Shell. 
Strengthening of our international oil and 
gas operations comes with the ENI award 
above as well as an additional AUD $19m 
four-year flow assurance contract for the 
INPEX-operated Ichthys Project, offshore 
of Western Australia. This builds on our 
portfolio of projects in the buoyant 
liquefied natural gas (LNG) market. 
We have also expanded our technical 
advisor role on Singapore’s LNG terminal 
supporting its Phase 3 Expansion Project 
under an engineering services agreement 
for our full range of capabilities.
Our Houston and Calgary operations 
continue to develop, underpinned by 
strong client relationships, particularly  
with BP and Shell. The Middle East market 
continues to provide a strong pipeline of 
work, including the recent award of two 
contracts by Abu Dhabi Marine Operating 
Company worth over US $3m to support 
the safe life extension of existing critical 
infrastructure. 
Power
In the UK our power business continues  
to maintain a significant portfolio in 
providing high end technical support  
to large scale power generation and 
transmission projects with clients such  
as National Grid, Drax, Eggborough  
and Energos.
This business has begun to access 
international markets with the award  
of a contract providing engineering design 
services to Tennessee Valley Authority’s 
coal and gas plants as part of our teaming 
arrangement with Merrick & Co. The 
contract has been signed for an initial 
three years with an option to extend for 
an additional two years.
We have delivered technical advisory 
services on energy storage, geothermal 
energy and Carbon Capture and  
Storage (CCS) to the UK Government’s 
Department of Energy and Climate 
Change, strengthening our position  
at the heart of emerging clean energy 
technologies. We continue to act as 
technical advisor to the CCS 
commercialisation programme.
Marine renewables
We have expanded our portfolio of work 
in the offshore renewables sector with the 
addition of engineering design contracts 
to support DONG Energy’s extension of 
the Walney and Burbo Bank offshore wind 
farms (OWFs) and for the new Race Bank 
project. Additional contracts with RWE  
for the Galloper OWF and with Statoil for 
the Dudgeon OWF further increase our 
market share of design consultancy work 
in the offshore renewables sector.
People
Underlying headcount increased by 
approximately 6%, underpinning good 
business performance. During the year  
we also saw significant investment of time 
and resource in support of large scale new 
business opportunities and have focused 
our recruitment activities to support this 
work and to achieve our financial targets. 
Staff turnover has fallen in line with our 
expectations and reached a three-year 
low of 11.7%.
Retention has been one of the key areas 
of focus for the Energy business this year. 
We have continued to focus on ensuring 
that our reward structure remains 
competitive and have also invested in  
a number of development programmes  
to assist with staff development and 
retention.  40 Strategic Report

Energy
We have extended the delivery of our 
People Manager Programme, which is 
aimed at improving the quality of the 
conversations managers have with their 
people, and have also introduced a new 
Energising your Career programme.  
The programme is designed to help staff 
at our middle career levels understand 
their strengths and how to achieve 
development progression. We have also 
supported the Group wide implementation 
of My Career, our new performance and 
development programme. 
Safety and sustainability
Our nuclear business has achieved good 
safety performance working as part of the 
ACKtiv Nuclear joint venture with Carillion 
and Jacobs. ACKtiv Nuclear’s Sellafield 
project recently exceeded two million  
man hours without a lost time accident, 
extending the joint venture’s existing 
record to over three million man hours 
without a lost time accident. Our AIR  
was zero for the second year running.
We are using our safety expertise to 
support one of our key clients, providing 
technical and safety engineering services 
to Shell’s onshore and offshore assets 
worldwide. 
Our people have used a variety of 
platforms to encourage students to 
consider a career in engineering, including 
visits by our graduates to school and 
university events. 
Through our work in the renewables 
sector we are helping society to make  
the transition to a low carbon economy. 
For example, we are working with DONG 
Energy Wind Power to extend one of its 
existing wind farms. 
Risk
We assess risks across all of our 
businesses. This is explained in more detail 
in the Principal Risks and Uncertainties 
section of the Annual Report and 
Accounts (page 44). The risks identified  
as being most pertinent to the Energy 
business are those associated with the 
safety and environmental and reputational 
consequences of an error in our work. 
We have also identified that our plans  
for growth are potentially affected by the 
availability of skills. To mitigate this risk we 
continue to invest in our in-house training 
academy that now provides a range of 
externally recognised courses. This year 
we welcomed just under 500 people on 
these courses. 
Outlook
The outlook for our Energy business 
remains very good. We are well positioned 
in attractive markets and have work in 
hand broadly consistent with that of last 
year at 31.8% of budgeted revenue 
(2013: 33.4%), which will underpin 
further growth in the year ahead. Strategic Report 41

Financial Performance Review
Performance summary
Our underlying profit before tax was 
£106.4m, an increase of 7.3% over last 
year’s restated profit¹ of £99.2m, on 
revenue that increased by 2.6% to 
£1.75bn (2013: £1.71bn). We believe 
underlying profit is a more representative 
measure of performance, removing the 
items that may give a distorted view of 
performance. In the current year we have 
removed profits on disposals and costs 
associated with disposals of £10.5m 
(2013: £4.5m), amortisation of acquired 
intangible assets of £2.7m (2013: 
£10.0m), together with one-off pension 
gains in the 2013 comparative figures of 
£4.3m arising as we continue to actively 
manage our pension liabilities. The 
unadjusted reported profit before tax  
was £114.2m (2013 restated¹: £98.0m).
Reported operating profit was £113.7m 
(2013 restated¹: £104.0m), at a margin  
of 6.5% (2013: 6.1%). As we state above, 
we believe a more representative measure 
of operating profit adds back amortisation 
of acquired intangible assets of £2.7m 
(2013: £10.0m), together with one-off 
pension gains in the 2013 comparative 
figures of £4.3m. This shows a more 
representative underlying operating profit 
of £116.4m (2013 restated¹: £109.7m) 
giving an improved underlying margin  
of 6.7% (2013: 6.4%).
The aforementioned profit on disposal  
of £10.5m is explained in more detail  
in note 8 to the Financial Statements 
(page 143) and comprises the net profit 
on sale of our UK highways services 
operations and the disposal of the  
Peter Brown construction management  
at risk business in North America, which 
follow on from the sale of our UK asset 
management business and the disposal  
of our non-controlling interest in the 
RMPA (Colchester Garrison) private 
finance initiative in prior years.
Headcount closed the year at 17,489 
(2013: 17,899), reflecting both the sale  
of non-core businesses totalling 1,165  
and underlying headcount growth and 
the acquisition of Confluence.
Net finance cost
Net finance cost was £13.6m (2013 
restated¹: £14.3m). The year on year 
reduction was primarily the result of  
an increase in finance income receivable  
on loan notes.
Taxation
The Group’s income tax expense for the 
year was £17.9m (2013 restated¹: £13.7m), 
giving an effective tax rate of 15.7% 
(2013 restated¹: 14.0%). The Group’s 
underlying effective tax rate was 19.0% 
(2013 restated¹: 17.1%). This rate is lower 
than the UK statutory rate of 23% due  
to continued benefits from research and 
development (R&D) tax credits, utilisation 
of tax losses not previously recognised 
and the impact of prior year adjustments.
The Group’s tax position will continue to 
be driven by our regional profile of profits 
and the benefit of R&D tax credits.
Earnings per share (EPS)
Basic EPS from continuing operations was 
98.4p (2013 restated¹: 86.8p). Underlying 
diluted EPS on continuing operations was 
85.7p (2013 restated¹: 82.6p), an increase 
of 3.8%.
Pensions 
IAS 19 (revised 2011) – valuation  
and accounting treatment
The Group determines pension scheme 
funding with reference to actuarial 
valuations. During the year the Group 
adopted and retrospectively applied  
IAS 19 (revised 2011). IAS 19 (revised 
2011) and the related consequential 
amendments have had an impact on the 
reporting of the Group’s defined benefit 
scheme by replacing the interest cost 
and expected return on plan assets with  
a net interest charge on the net defined 
benefit liability. In addition, the standard 
requires that unvested past service costs 
and administration costs be recognised 
immediately in the income statement, 
which has also had a small impact on  
the Group’s defined benefit liability. The 
effect of this resulted in the net defined 
benefit obligation at 31 March 2013  
being restated as £295.6m (previously 
£298.8m). As at 31 March 2014 the 
Group’s retirement benefit liability was 
£324.2m (2013 restated¹: £282.0m).
The assumptions used in the IAS 19 
(revised 2011) valuation are detailed in 
note 32 to the Financial Statements  
(page 161).
Funding
Cash contributions of £32.0m (2013: 
£21.0m) were made to the Atkins Pension 
Plan (the Plan) during the year. Under the 
latest agreed recovery plan the Group will 
contribute £32m to the Plan for each of 
the two years ending 31 March 2015, 
with annual contributions then escalating 
by 2.5% each year until 31 March 2025.
There were no pension settlement or 
curtailment gains in 2014 but in the 
comparative period the Plan recognised  
a net settlement gain of £0.1m in respect 
of an enhanced transfer value (ETV) 
exercise for the year ended 31 March 
2013. The Railways Pension Scheme 
recognised a curtailment gain during the 
2013 financial year in respect of the two 
new benefit bases that came into effect 
for certain members from 1 January 2013. 
The curtailment gain arose for members 
moving from the existing uncapped salary 
category or RPI capped salary category  
to the new CPI capped category. The 
reduction in the past service liability for 
this curtailment was £4.3m and this was 
recognised as a curtailment gain in the 
year ended 31 March 2013.
1.  The results for the year to 31 March 2013 have 
been restated to reflect changes to accounting 
standards with regards to the treatment of  
pension costs (IAS 19 (revised 2011)). 42 Strategic Report

Charges
The total charge to the income statement 
in respect of defined benefit schemes  
was £14.3m (2013 restated¹: £10.5m), 
comprising service cost of £2.1m (2013 
restated¹: £2.1m), administrative expenses 
of £0.2m (2013 restated¹: £0.2m), 
curtailment and settlement gains of £nil 
(2013: £4.4m) and a net interest expense 
of £12.0m (2013 restated¹: £12.6m).

Net capital expenditure in the year, 
including the purchase of computer 
software licences, amounted to £16.9m 
(2013: £23.9m). 
Capital structure
As at 31 March 2014, the Group had 
shareholders’ funds of £130.2m  
(2013 restated¹: £146.3m) and the 
Company had shareholders’ funds of 
£186.4m (2013: £167.7m).
The Company had 104.5m fully paid 
ordinary shares in issue at 31 March 2014 
(2013: 104.5m). For further details, refer 
to note 34 to the Financial Statements 
(page 171).
Treasury policy and objectives
The Group’s treasury function manages 
and monitors external funding and 
investment requirements and financial 
risks in support of the Group’s corporate 
objectives. The Board reviews and agrees 
procedures, requirements and authority 
levels for treasury activities. The Board 
delegates responsibility of the detailed 
review of the policies to the Audit 
Committee. 
The Group’s financial instruments, other 
than derivatives, comprise borrowings, 
cash and liquid resources and various 
items, such as trade receivables and trade 
payables, which arise directly from its 
operations. The main purpose of these 
financial instruments is to finance the 
Group’s activities. The Group also enters 
into derivative transactions, principally 
forward foreign currency contracts  
to manage foreign exchange risk on 
material commercial transactions 
undertaken in currencies other than  
the local functional currency. 
The main risks arising from the Group’s 
financial instruments are market risk 
(including foreign exchange risk, interest 
rate risk and price risk), credit risk and 
liquidity risk. The Group’s exposures to 
and management of each of the main 
risks, together with sensitivities and risk 
concentrations, are described in more 
detail in note 2 to the Financial Statements.
The Group funds its ongoing activities 
through cash generated from its 
operations and, where necessary,  
external borrowings and finance leases. 
The Group’s debt facilities are described  
in note 29 to the Financial Statements 
(page 159). Utilisation of the Group’s 
facilities is a consequence of prior year 
acquisitions and ongoing organic growth. 
As at 31 March 2014 the Group had 
£141.5m of undrawn committed borrowing 
facilities available (2013: £113.3m). Strategic Report 43 
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2014
Corporate Information
Financial Performance Review continued
There have been no significant changes  
to the Group’s treasury procedures, 
requirements and authority levels during 
the year.
Critical accounting policies
The Group’s principal accounting policies 
are described in note 1 to the Financial 
Statements (page 119). The Financial 
Statements for the year ended  
31 March 2014 have been prepared  
under International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the EU.
The preparation of Financial Statements  
in conformity with generally accepted 
accounting principles requires the use of 
estimates and assumptions that affect the 
reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
at the date of the Financial Statements 
and the reported amounts of revenues 
and expenses during the reporting period. 
Although these estimates are based on 
management’s best knowledge of the 
amount, event or actions, actual results 
may ultimately differ from those estimates. 
Material estimates applied across the 
Group’s businesses and joint ventures  
are reviewed to a common standard and 
adjusted where appropriate to ensure that 
consistent treatment of similar and related 
issues that require judgement is achieved 
upon consolidation. Any revisions to 
estimates are recognised prospectively.
The accounting policies and areas that 
require the most significant estimates  
and judgements to be used in the 
preparation of the Financial Statements 
are in relation to contract accounting, 
including recoverability of receivables, 
goodwill impairment and defined benefit 
pension schemes.
Contract accounting
The Group’s contract accounting policy is 
central to how the Group values the work 
it has carried out in each financial year.
This policy requires forecasts to be made 
on the projected outcomes of projects. 
These forecasts require assessments and 
judgements to be made on changes in,  
for example, work scope, changes in  
costs and costs to completion. While  
the assumptions made are based on 
professional judgements, subsequent 
events may mean that estimates 
calculated prove to be inaccurate, with a 
consequent effect on the reported results.
Goodwill impairment
As set out in note 1 the Financial 
Statements (page 119), goodwill is subject  
to impairment review both annually and 
when there are indications that the 
carrying value may not be recoverable. 
The carrying value of goodwill is 
compared to the recoverable amount, 
which is the higher of value in use and  
fair value less costs to sell.
For the purpose of impairment testing, 
goodwill acquired in a business 
combination is allocated to each of the 
cash-generating units (CGUs), or groups 
of CGUs, that are expected to benefit 
from the synergies of the combination. 
Each CGU or group of CGUs to which  
the goodwill is allocated represents the 
lowest level within the entity at which 
goodwill is monitored for internal 
management purposes. 
Determining whether goodwill is impaired 
requires an estimation of the value in use 
of CGUs to which the goodwill has been 
allocated. The value in use calculation 
requires an estimate to be made of the 
timing and amount of future cash flows 
expected to arise from the CGU and the 
application of a suitable discount rate to 
calculate the present value. The discount 
rates used are based on the Group’s 
weighted average cost of capital adjusted 
to reflect the specific economic 
environment of the relevant CGU.
Defined benefit pension schemes
Accounting for pensions involves 
judgement about uncertain events in  
the future such as inflation, salary levels  
at retirement, longevity rates, rates of 
return on plan assets and discount rates. 
Assumptions in respect of pensions and 
post-employment benefits are set after 
consultation with independent qualified 
actuaries. Management believes the 
assumptions are appropriate. However,  
a change in the assumptions used would 
have an impact on the Group’s results and 
net assets. Any differences between the 
assumptions and the actual outcome will 
affect results in future years. An estimate 
of the sensitivity to changes in key 
assumptions is disclosed in note 32 to  
the Financial Statements (page 161).
Tax
The Group is subject to tax in a number  
of jurisdictions and judgement is required 
in determining the Group wide provision 
for income taxes. The Group provides for 
potential liabilities in respect of uncertain 
tax positions where additional tax may 
become payable in future periods and 
such provisions are based on 
management’s assessment of exposures.
As set out in note 1 to the Financial 
Statements (pages 119 to 128), deferred 
tax is accounted for on temporary 
differences using the liability method,  
with deferred tax liabilities being provided 
for in full and deferred tax assets being 
recognised only to the extent that it is 
judged probable that future taxable 
profits will arise against which the 
temporary differences can be utilised. 44 Strategic Report

Corporate Information
Principal risks and uncertainties continued
The Group Risk Committee, chaired  
by the Group chief executive officer,  
oversees the operation of the Group’s  
risk management framework and provides 
support to the Board and the Audit 
Committee. Effective risk management 
continues to be embedded in our 
governance framework, which is 
summarised in the Corporate Governance 
Report (pages 66 to 73).
This risk management framework 
continues to support the Board’s risk 
appetite when assessing and determining 
the nature and extent of the significant 
risks it is willing to accept in achieving its 
strategic and operational objectives.
This framework and the associated risk 
management structure support the 
systematic identification, assessment, 
communication, reporting and 
management of risk at both strategic  
and operational levels, and seek to  
ensure that:
•	 the public, employees and the 
environment are safe from potential 
hazards inherent in our operations
•	 the potential for damage to our 
corporate reputation, or financial loss  
to shareholders and other stakeholders, 
is minimised.
The Board believes that, for risk 
management to be successful, it must 
integrate the framework into all activities 
and develop a culture and behaviour 
within the organisation that ensure:
•	 the management of risk is clearly driven 
from business strategy and objectives
•	 Group functions assist and support 
management in setting minimum 
standards across the Group
•	 the ownership and management of  
risk is not the exclusive responsibility  
of senior management but is passed 
down to appropriate staff members
•	 all significant risks have owners, 
mitigation strategies and, where actions 
have been identified, action owners 
who have been assigned a target date 
by which the action is to be completed 
•	 operational risks are fully articulated and 
subject to regular review, communication 
and reporting across the organisation as 
part of our normal management process
•	 we operate in a culture that encourages 
early disclosure of issues or concerns,  
so that timely and appropriate action 
can be discussed, agreed, assigned and 
implemented as necessary.
It is intended that these principles and  
the risk management framework continue 
to be used throughout the Group, 
without exception, to achieve progressive 
improvement in the effectiveness of  
risk management processes. The risk 
management framework interfaces with 
the commercial framework, providing  
an integrated, consistent process for 
assessing the level of risk for operational 
projects and services, depending on scale 
and complexity. This enables appropriate 
projects and services to be peer reviewed 
and evaluated, and the risks categorised.
Having an integrated process supports 
management in determining the 
appropriate level of risk for our operations. 
It also enables the organisation to identify, 
evaluate, control, monitor and own risks 
at the appropriate level, ensuring that:
•	 a common approach to risk 
management is adopted, reducing 
inefficiency
•	 we operate in an environment and 
culture where both technical and 
commercial risk remain a key focus.
We continue to manage a number of 
potential risks and uncertainties which 
could have a material impact on our 
long-term performance. Many of these 
risks are common to other companies and  
we assess them to establish the principal 
risks for the Group. The table overleaf 
outlines the principal risks and the 
mitigating activities we undertake in 
respect of each of them, and indicates  
the change of each in the year. We 
continue to assess these risks under  
two main categories of strategic risk  
and operational risk.
Where applicable, the table cross- 
references principal risks with segment-
specific risks. 46 Strategic Report

Economic outlook
Imposition of government austerity 
measures has an impact on our trading 
performance as spending on public sector 
infrastructure is reduced.
Worsening economic conditions lead  
to reduced levels of private sector 
infrastructure spend and have an adverse 
impact on our clients’ ability to pay for 
our services.
We have increased our sector and 
geographic diversification to provide 
resilience at a time when many of our 
markets still experience uncertainty. We 
have a clear strategic priority to focus on 
sectors which have attractive growth 
prospects with good levels of funding.
We actively seek to redeploy staff around 
the Group to meet demand in growth 
markets and sectors, frequently moving 
work to people and people to work.
We perform client credit checks and maintain 
regular management reviews of credit 
terms, trade debtors and work in progress.
We have already reshaped our business  
to target more than 50% of our revenue 
outside the UK. Our medium-term goal is 
to generate more than 75% of revenue 
from our non-UK and Energy businesses.
We continue to focus on funded markets 
in targeting growth and evaluating 
investment opportunities. 
We have added resilience to our UK 
business through its ongoing support to 
non-UK projects.
Financial
The deterioration of the Group’s financial 
position limits our ability to invest in 
growth.
Adverse movements in liability 
assumptions or asset values result in a 
significant increase in the Group’s defined 
benefit pension obligations, increasing 
the cash funding required to repay the 
deficit and reducing our ability to invest  
in further growth opportunities.
We review the Group’s trading and 
funding position on an ongoing basis.
We have made good progress in 
implementing our strategy to continue  
to de-risk our defined benefit pension 
schemes. We will continue to manage  
the assets and liabilities of our pension 
schemes.
The Group’s treasury function manages 
and monitors external funding and 
investment requirements and risks arising 
from the Group’s financial instruments 
risks, i.e. market risk (including foreign 
exchange risk, interest rate risk and price 
risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.
During the year we entered into a new 
five-year revolving credit facility (RCF) of 
£200m, replacing the Group’s previous 
£150m RCF and £30m bilateral facility. 
This is in addition to our 2012 debut  
issue in the US private placement market, 
which together broaden the sources  
of funding available to the Group.
We continue to monitor and actively 
manage our strategy to de-risk our 
defined benefit pension schemes.  
We also concluded successfully our 
negotiations on the triennial actuarial 
funding valuation with the trustee of the 
Atkins Pension Plan during the year. This 
resulted in an extension of the associated 
deficit repayment plan to 31 March 2025.
Further information is contained in the 
United Kingdom and Europe review  
(page 23).
Geo-political
Political instability in the regions within 
which we operate has a negative impact 
on our ability to deliver contractual 
services and/or receive payment and/or 
endangers the safety of our staff.
We have focused on geographies that 
have more stable trading environments.
We obtain the latest professional risk  
and security information before engaging 
in contracts in new geographies and 
continue to monitor the stability of the 
markets in which we trade.
Further information is contained in  
the Middle East review (page 33) and  
Asia Pacific review (page 36).
Market
Worsening economic conditions lead  
to changes in contracts resulting in 
increased risk transfer from clients as 
competitors accept more onerous 
contract terms to win work.
Reductions in the amount of available 
work increase pricing pressure and  
reduce our operating margins.
We have robust, integrated review 
procedures, which include peer reviews, 
during the bidding and contracting stage  
of our projects.
We have focused our strategy on sectors 
with strong growth prospects, good levels 
of funding and high technical barriers  
to entry.
We have a strategic focus on operational 
excellence and on winning and delivering 
work.
We are continuing to drive operational 
performance across the Group to improve 
our margins.
We continue to embed our integrated 
review procedures across our 
management and markets.
Initiatives such as our operational 
excellence programme, together with the 
increasing use of our global design 
centres in India, aim to deliver a 
competitive cost base while also 
supporting and enabling growth across 
the Group.
Regulatory/legal
Legislation and regulations restrict our 
ability to operate in certain locations  
or perform certain activities, leading  
to the need to exit these markets.
Breaches of regulation or legislation  
result in fines, imprisonment and/or 
reputational damage.
We seek external advice about new  
and/or changing trading restrictions, 
communicating these changes across  
our business as necessary.
We continue to invest in staff training  
and communication.
Work to develop our Group code of 
conduct continued during the year and 
this is expected to be launched to all 
employees in the current financial year.
We refreshed the communication of 
details of our whistleblower hotline 
Group wide during the year.

Crisis event
A significant one-off event affecting a key 
business location, project or employees 
could interrupt service delivery, threaten

our business.
We have a Group crisis management plan 
in place to respond quickly to such events.
The robustness of our plan continues to 
be reviewed and tested and the plan is

Health, safety and environmental
Shortcomings in our design or works 
supervision result in a health, safety or 
environmental incident involving staff, 
clients or other third parties leading to 
injury, loss of life and/or significant 
damage to our reputation with all 
stakeholders.
Safety is part of our commitment to 
quality and reliability. Clear and explicit 
senior management leadership on health, 
safety and environmental matters is 
regularly reinforced via targeted campaigns.
We have implemented our safety 
standards worldwide.
We mandate accident and near-miss 
reporting and provide a whistleblower 
hotline to enable staff to raise concerns 
confidentially.
We continue to invest in staff training  
and communication about the importance 
of safety and security in the workplace.
Our Group wide behavioural awareness 
programme, ‘Safe and Secure by Choice’, 
continues to support the standard of our 
commitment to creating a leading health

Physical and data security
Confidential client business and/or 
personal data is mishandled, resulting  
in breach of contract, the inappropriate 
release of commercially sensitive 
information or the loss of the personal 
information of our clients and/or employees.
Our business systems suffer an attack 
from hackers or viruses.
The safety and security of our people  
is threatened.
We use appropriate physical security, 
secure networks and encryption in order 
to protect data.
We train staff on best practice in 
information assurance.
The Group security officer seeks to ensure 
best practice and raise the profile of 
security across the business.
We continue to provide information 
assurance training modules for our 
people.
As part of a more holistic information 
assurance programme, we have started 
to develop plans for a behaviours-based 
programme of engagement with our 
people on information assurance.
Projects
Poor management of projects leads to 
client dissatisfaction, damage to our 
reputation for technical excellence and  
a deterioration in the Group’s financial 
performance.
We continue to implement our online 
project management system to drive 
consistently high standards across the Group.
We continue to invest in ongoing project 
management excellence training 
programmes for our staff.
We continue to improve project controls, 
which include regular financial reviews  
of project performance.
We continue to target our investment  
in increasing project management 
capabilities across the Group (people, 
processes and systems).
Further information is contained in the 
United Kingdom and Europe review  
(page 23).
Staff recruitment and retention
Failure to attract and retain the most 
talented, motivated professionals in their 
respective fields makes us unable to 
deliver on clients’ expectations and 
respond to the most technically 
challenging and time-critical projects, 
thereby eroding our market share and 
damaging our financial performance.
Regular business reviews evaluate a  
number of metrics including headcount, 
retention, vacancy levels and employee 
engagement.
A new online platform, ‘My Career’,  
was rolled out to all regions during the 
year. This supports a consistent approach  
to staff performance reviews, training, 
career planning and development.
Engagement is essential in a people-
based business. We continue to use a 
variety of channels, including our annual 
Viewpoint survey, to communicate and 
engage with our employees.
Technical delivery
Design errors or omissions lead to client 
dissatisfaction, financial losses and 
damage to our reputation for technical 
excellence.
Robust review procedures during the

set up a working group of representatives 
from all our operating businesses and 
relevant corporate functions, which  
has been tasked with developing and 
disseminating best practice regarding 
technical governance. Key areas of  
focus currently are project manager

We trust our people to go 
above and beyond.
Overview
At Atkins we trust our people to go  
above and beyond for our Company  
and our clients. Individual talent and  
our collective expertise help us to  
exceed client expectations and meet  
our strategic objectives. Our people  
are our competitive edge.
We assess the impact of our human 
resource activities on the delivery of  
our strategy via a structured process  
of business reviews that evaluate human 
capital metrics such as headcount, 
retention and employee engagement.  
We also forecast future skills and 
resourcing needs and use this information 
to manage staff utilisation and to  
resource our future growth plans.
Headcount
Underlying headcount increased by 
approximately 800 people in the year 
ending 31 March 2014 to 17,489, with 
particularly impressive growth during the 
first half of the year. There was a rise in 
the United Kingdom and Europe, Asia 
Pacific and the Middle East, reflecting our 
strategy of organic growth and targeted 
acquisitions. These increases in headcount 
were partly offset by a reduction in North 
America as the region continues to focus 
on operational efficiency and productivity.
We remain focused on bringing young 
people into engineering from school or 
university. We hired 500 new graduates  
in 2013 across all of our regions and will 
be targeting a similar number in 2014. 
There has also been an increase in the 
percentage of female graduates in this 
year’s intake, which supports our diversity 
agenda. Our apprentice programme 
continues to attract school leavers 
choosing a career in engineering.  
Further details are provided in the United 
Kingdom and Europe business review 
(page 23). To assist with our recruitment 
activities, we launched an innovative new 
global careers website to engage potential 
new recruits which gives access to all our 
vacancies throughout the world.
In conjunction with developing our talent 
pool in local markets, we have a growing 
number of international assignments 
across the Group, to supplement skills  
not available locally with specific technical 
knowledge or to resource the delivery  
of large projects. In order to respond to 
the growth in international assignment 
activity, we have completed a strategic 
review of our requirements, policies and 
processes and will be implementing the 
recommendations from the review over 
the course of the next financial year. 50 Strategic Report
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2014

Engagement
Ensuring our employees feel valued and 
positive at work underpins our ethos  
and supports our strategy for growth.  
We know there is always room for 
improvement, therefore, we ask our 
people what they think and then involve 
them in our plans for change.
Every year we ask our employees around 
the world to participate in our Viewpoint 
employee engagement survey. The survey 
comprises a series of themed questions  
of strategic importance to Atkins, aligned 
to a pre-defined engagement model.  
This model measures our people’s 
relationship with management, their  
jobs and the Group.
Group results were communicated via  
the world news centre of our Group wide 
intranet, with presentations of results  
by region/business unit arranged locally.
 
The results of the 2013 survey showed 
positive improvements in most areas,  
with the overall engagement score 
increasing to 69 (from 67 in 2012 and  
64 in 2011). It is evident that people 
across Atkins really care about the success 
of our organisation (95%) and about  
our goals (86%). There has also been  
a significant increase in the level of 
satisfaction with job security, particularly 
in the UK. We will continue to use the 
feedback from this survey to sustain  
an ongoing dialogue with our people 
through which we can continuously 
improve our employee engagement.
Day to day, we maintain regular 
communication with our employees 
through chief executive officer (CEO) 
letters, Group updates and information, 
project successes and stories about our 
people, which we make available via  
our Group wide intranet. Following the 
announcement of our financial results,  
we provide updates on our Group 
performance through an online 
presentation from our Group finance 
director and video interview with our 
Group CEO. We also make these available 
as a recorded telephone message and  
a written transcript.
Our senior leadership teams hold 
meetings and open discussions to give 
employees the opportunity to ask 
questions about our strategy and future 
plans. Where geography presents a 
challenge for face to face communication, 
such as in the Middle East and North 
America, our CEOs have engaged with 
employees through webinars and ‘all 
hands calls’, giving employees the chance 
to participate and ask questions directly. 
Another popular communication channel 
is our CEO blogs, through which our 
regional CEOs share informal thoughts, 
images and updates, and invite comments 
from employees.
We hired 500 new graduates 
in 2013 across all of our 
regions and will be targeting 
a similar number in 2014.

What is engagement and why do we measure it?
Ipsos MORI has identified three components – alignment, involvement and loyalty – that can help us to understand and improve the experience  
of our employees.
Alignment Involvement Loyalty Overall score
Our employee engagement score for 2013 can also be measured against the Ipsos Global Sector Norm – in other words, how we compare  
against the responses given by employees in other organisations in the professional services sector, both globally and regionally.
Alignment is about how closely 
an individual’s objectives, values 
and aspirations match those of 
the Group.

Involvement is about how 
involved people feel with their 
job. We measure this through 
key questions around job 
satisfaction, motivation and 
personal fulfilment.
Loyalty measures the emotional 
tie people have to the Group  
as a whole, i.e. how proud they 
feel, what their outlook is and 
how they would speak about 
the Group to others.
The employee engagement 
score is an average score against 
which employee engagement 
can be measured across all  
three components. Strategic Report 51

Corporate Information
Human Resources Review continued
In 2013 we celebrated Atkins’ 75th 
anniversary which provided an excellent 
opportunity to involve and unite all our 
employees around one inspiring common 
theme. As well as regular articles on our 
intranet about our technical heritage, we 
invited employees to participate in photo 
competitions via social media, email and 
our intranet and asked our employees  
to nominate colleagues for a Sir William 
Atkins medal. The medals were awarded 
to 89 employees at all levels Group wide  
in recognition of their outstanding 
achievements. Everyone was given the 
opportunity to join a 75th anniversary 
celebration in their regional business, 
which ranged from vintage fancy dress 
and tea parties to music festivals and 
beach parties.
During the year, we also sought the 
opinions of our employees and our leaders 
to develop a new employer brand identity, 
known as the Atkins Way, which is  
a celebration of the quiet brilliance of 
Atkins’ people. It defines our external 
recruitment activity and underpins the 
range of Group wide and localised 
communications we share with our 
employees. The Atkins Way works on  
the basis that the Group is the sum of our 
people and that nobody can tell the story 
of an organisation as effectively and as 
genuinely as the people who work for it.
Investment in people
To achieve our vision to be the world’s 
best infrastructure consultancy we need 
to develop and enhance the capabilities 
and performance of our people. The 
Group’s annual training spend of over 
£18.5m was an increase on the previous 
year, reflecting an increased investment  
in performance management, personal 
development and sales excellence. This 
performance-related approach provides 
our employees with the skills and focus  
to support our Group to deliver on higher 
growth and higher margin activities.
During the year we have implemented  
the My Career programme across all  
our regions. My Career focuses on the 
performance and development of  
all our people and includes an online 
performance and development review 
system and also a learning management 
portal providing online access to key 
learning resources. My Career aims to  
help individuals take responsibility for  
their performance and development  
and create a better dialogue between 
individuals and their line managers in 
support of their careers. Our aim is to 
sustain a high-performance culture across 
Atkins and to help our people make the 
most of their talent.
One of the key challenges for our industry 
is to develop the next generation of 
engineers to solve the challenges of 
urbanisation, climate change and energy 
generation. For this reason our graduate 
and apprenticeship programmes are at  
the heart of developing our talent for the 
future. We continue to work in partnership 
with local schools and colleges through 
our Science Technology Engineering & 
Maths (STEM) ambassadors to engage 
with young people and encourage them 
towards careers in our industry.
One of the key requirements of our 
growth ambition is the capability of our 
people to get close to our clients and to 
understand their drivers and requirements. 
Our global sales excellence programme 
was introduced during the year and over 
800 staff attended training workshops to 
develop their skills in client engagement.
Reward
Pay movement across the Group varies  
by business and geography. This reflects 
both the diversity of our business and the 
variability in market conditions between 
businesses and regions. With effect from 
1 April 2014 the average salary increase 
was 4% across the Group, with significant 
variation by region.
To inform the salary review and other 
reward decisions, we conduct 
comprehensive annual benchmarking 
studies across our regions (UK, North 
America, Middle East, Asia Pacific and 
Europe). We use the data to improve  
the competitiveness of our remuneration 
packages and to help line managers  
with pay decisions.
Approximately 1,000 senior leaders 
worldwide participate in our executive 
bonus scheme (EBS). This incentivises the 
delivery of above-average financial results 
and exceptional individual performance by 
rewarding the achievement of stretching 
targets and personal objectives.
A new cash performance measure was 
introduced to the EBS in 2013 for our 
most senior participants to incentivise 
good cash performance throughout the 
whole year and reflect how effective each 
business is at converting profits into cash. 
This has in turn helped to encourage 
better long-term behaviour in this area. 
The success in driving strategic focus on 
the cash flow cycle has resulted in the 
Group’s decision to extend the population 
subject to the cash measure to the next 
level of the organisation. Further details  
of this measure are provided in the 
Remuneration Report (page 98).  
A discretionary bonus scheme covers  
the wider Atkins population. We expect  
to pay a bonus to around one third of 
staff members, recognising individual 
contribution and performance.
People across our business 
really care about the success 
of the organisation (95%)  
and about its goals (86%). 52 Strategic Report
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2014
Human Resources Review continued
Employee share ownership is encouraged 
across the Group to align the interests of 
our employees and our shareholders and 
to enable our employees to share in the 
success of the Company. In the UK, we 
operate a share incentive plan (SIP) that 
provides a tax-efficient mechanism for 
employees to become shareholders. 
Approximately 12% of eligible employees 
participate in the SIP.
We have maintained our focus on the 
management of our historic defined 
benefit pension liabilities. The triennial 
valuation of the Atkins Pension Plan was 
agreed in February 2014 providing  
a stable repayment plan mechanism to 
manage our deficit contributions over  
the next 12 years.
Diversity
We are committed to building a diverse 
organisation to maximise the skills 
available to us in the geographies in  
which we operate. Our policies have  
been adopted to ensure this commitment  
is implemented from the point of 
recruitment and continues throughout an 
individual’s employment. Our people are 
supported to develop to their full potential 
regardless of sex, race, age, religion or 
belief, disability, sexual orientation, gender 
identity, marriage and civil partner status, 
pregnancy, parental obligations or 
background, subject to the laws of the 
jurisdictions in which we work.
The Group encourages recruitment, 
training, career development and 
promotion on the basis of aptitude  
and ability, without regard to disability.  
We are also committed to retaining and 
retraining as necessary employees who 
become disabled during the course  
of their employment.
Gender diversity continues to be a key 
focus for the Group and our goal is to 
continue to develop an organisational 
culture that fully embraces male and 
female contributions in a male-dominated 
industry. We are working towards 
achieving a better gender balance to 
provide an environment where women 
want to stay and develop their careers. 
We have a range of objectives which  
have been devised to align to these goals.
The women’s leadership council links 
senior women across all regions and is 
committed to supporting women 
throughout the organisation to develop 
and fulfil their potential. A women’s 
professional network is also now well 
established in most regions, which has 
helped women to feel well-connected 
across Atkins.
We continue to work to increase the 
proportion of female staff in Atkins  
and have developed a range of flexible 
working options to help us both recruit 
and retain a broader range of staff.
Viewpoint results showed an 
improvement in the scores provided  
by women in many areas, so a culture  
is developing which embraces women  
and means they want to stay.
We have maintained the level of senior 
females in the Group (12.7%) but 
recognise that we have more work to  
do to achieve our target of 15% by 2015.
We are committed to building 
a diverse organisation.

Our principles have been woven into  
our office sustainability programme, 
RACE2. Over a three-year period, our 
initial programme, RACE, helped to 
reduce our electricity usage by 12%. 
RACE2 has broader aims, encompassing 
environmental and social issues, and 
challenging us to live and breathe our 
principles in our offices.
Leadership
We are steadfast in our drive towards 
becoming a more responsible and 
sustainable organisation. 
Our Group chief executive officer,  
Prof Dr Uwe Krueger, has been unceasing 
in his pursuit of safety in the workplace, 
spearheading our See it, Stop it, Save  
a life campaign which empowers our 
people to stop work immediately 
whenever anything appears unsafe.  
Senior leaders across Atkins demonstrate 
their commitment to safety by engaging 
our people during safety tours and using 
safety moments during meetings to focus 
on key safety issues. They also engage 
Atkins staff in sustainability, encouraging 
its integration into our day to day practices.
Raising safety and welfare standards
The launch of the Atkins minimum 
requirements (AMRs) for construction 
safety in the Middle East provides a 
framework which enables us to influence 
clients and contractors to raise health, 
safety and welfare standards, and to 
demonstrate our strong industry 
leadership. Industry experts rewarded  
us for our behavioural safety model with  
a Health and Safety Initiative of the  
Year award at Qatar’s annual industry 
event. The model embeds safety into 
organisational culture and empowers  
our people to put safety at the heart  
of everything they do. 
A society for our future
Inspiring the next generation
Inspiring the next generation of engineers 
to build a sustainable future will be critical 
to our success and to that of society. 
This year we have used innovative 
approaches, such as cycling and model 
city building workshops, to engage the 
next generation.
Supporting our people on  
a development pathway
Our sustainability knowledge and skills 
principle commits us to supporting our 
people on a development pathway, 
equipping them to deliver innovative and 
sustainable solutions. We have held an 
Atkins Urban Environment Conference, 
enabling specialists from our planning 
teams around the world to share 
knowledge, promote technical excellence 
and champion best practice, and have 
promoted knowledge-sharing activities  
by sponsoring a UK Construction Industry 
Council and Royal Institute of British 
Architects event, integrating health  
and safety learning into undergraduate 
architect training. We also hosted a 
webinar to showcase a project that 
evaluated the energy performance,  
water usage and biodiversity of a client’s 
most sustainable building and made 
recommendations to generate a 30% 
energy reduction and improved end  
user experience.
Social and community investment
To enable our people to utilise their  
skills and expertise to support the social, 
environmental and economic health of 
our communities, we have formalised  
a volunteer programme in the UK.  
In America, the Atkins Foundation, 
established in 2006, serves the 
communities in which our people live  
and work, supporting programmes that 
improve quality of life and educate 
children in the areas of engineering, 
mathematics, science and technology.

Corporate Sustainability Review continued
A healthy, safe and secure workplace
We aim to promote and achieve the 
highest degree of physical, mental and 
social wellbeing in our workplace.
Journey to ‘natural safety’ 
Three years ago, we introduced a safety 
maturity model, plotting a journey from 
‘unaware’ through ‘compliance’ to 
‘proactive’, and ultimately to the 
integration of safety as a natural aspect  
of our culture. This year, all our regions 
and businesses reached the ‘compliance’ 
level, with a significant number moving 
towards ‘proactive’.
Safety performance
The accident incident rate (AIR) measures 
accident performance. Our overall AIR 
figure for staff summarises AIRs for our 
people and contractors working in offices, 
engineering and construction. We set  
a more stretching AIR benchmark than 
suggested by the UK’s Health and Safety 
Executive (HSE) Labour Force Survey data. 
The figures for our people in office and 
engineering roles have outperformed  
the benchmark, with the figures for 
construction roles being slightly over  
our benchmark but still below the 
HSE Labour Force Survey indicator. 
Contractor performance for engineering 
and construction has not met our internal 
benchmark due to its over-sensitivity  
to low contractor numbers.
Viewpoint survey
In 2013 we incorporated safety questions 
into our employee satisfaction survey, 
Viewpoint. 84% of respondents believe 
that Atkins is committed to the health and 
safety of its staff and 96% understand 
how to work safely. We have developed 
a manager safety leadership programme 
to ensure the continued improvement  
of communication, feedback and safety 
practices, which will be embedded  
during 2014.
Safe and Secure by Choice
We have heightened our focus on 
security, developing a service that provides 
tailored medical, security and travel 
assistance to address risks associated with 
international travel. We have expanded 
our behavioural safety programme to 
include security. This Safe and Secure  
by Choice programme will soon include  
a set of security principles relating to 
people, property and information. 
Industry leadership
As part of our Group wide approach to 
industry safety leadership, we have been 
involved in restructuring the Consultants’ 
Health and Safety Forum, ensuring that  
it remains fit for the future. A strategic 
leadership team will oversee United 
Kingdom and Europe and Asia Pacific 
safety forums, with new teams focused on 
environment and quality. We will continue 
to support the Middle East and North 
Africa safety executive and strive towards 
the establishment of a consultants’ forum 
in North America.

A low carbon economy
We have continued our efforts to become 
a low carbon organisation. 
Measuring and reporting emissions  
to stakeholders and investors
We continue to report and verify our 
emissions data.
Atkins has disclosed carbon data to the 
Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), the 
global platform for organisational 
disclosure of investor-relevant climate 
change data, for the last five years. Our 
highest CDP score to date, 84 out of 100, 
was achieved this year.
For the fourth consecutive year, the Group 
achieved certification to the ISO 14064 
international standard for quantification 
and reporting of greenhouse gas 
emissions. This year, we have expanded 
the scope of the verification programme 
to include North America. We report on 
gas, electricity, liquid fuel consumption 
and travel emissions. Table 1 shows total 
emissions by region split between scopes 
one, two and three, as defined by the 
Greenhouse Gas Protocol.

Reducing our emissions
Our first office sustainability programme, 
RACE, helped reduce our worldwide 
energy consumption. Its successor,  
RACE2, retains this focus on energy 
efficiency, aiming to facilitate cost and 
carbon pollution reductions.
Transition to a low carbon economy
Atkins has joined an industry and UK 
Government initiative, The Infrastructure 
Carbon Review, which aims to utilise new 
technologies, construction techniques and 
low-carbon materials to reduce carbon 
emissions from infrastructure projects by 
24m tonnes by 2050.  58 Strategic Report
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2014
Corporate Sustainability Review continued
The UK Foreign and Commonwealth 
Office commissioned us to work with 
national government agencies and city 
governments to develop guidance for 
eco-low carbon urban planning in China.
Affordable, reliable and clean energy 
Our efforts to help society’s transition  
to a low carbon economy have taken  
a number of forms. These include 
supporting projects for our clients which 
aim to harness low carbon energy sources, 
some examples of which are given below.
We are helping to design, build and 
deliver the world’s first tidal lagoon in 
Swansea Bay, generating electricity 
equivalent to Swansea’s entire domestic 
consumption and saving over 200,000 
tonnes of CO
2
 annually for its design life 
of over 100 years.
We have won a contract to lead a 
pan-European consortium bringing 
sustainable energy to 23 countries in 
eastern and southern Africa, and another, 
with a consortium partner, covering  
a further 26 countries in western and 
central Africa. 
ITER is a first-of-a-kind nuclear reactor, 
capable of producing unlimited supplies  
of cheap, clean, safe and sustainable 
electricity from atomic fusion. Atkins is  
the architect-engineer responsible for the 
design, procurement management and 
construction management of buildings, 
site infrastructure and services.
Respect for the environment
Managing resources 
Our office sustainability programme, 
RACE2, encompasses such environmental 
issues as efficient use of materials, control 
of water, waste and recycling. Our 
operations in Hong Kong received the 
Class of Excellence from the Hong Kong 
Awards for Environmental Excellence, its 
highest recognition for waste reduction. 
Building the resource resilience of our 
clients
Our thought leadership report, Future 
Proofing the UK Water Sector, focuses  
on the asset-heavy water and wastewater 
sectors in which today’s decisions have  
far reaching consequences. Working with 
Decision Strategies International, we 
explored a number of scenarios for the 
development of the UK’s water industry 
up until 2050.
Protecting and improving ecosystems
Construction projects provide 
opportunities for sustainable delivery, 
enhancing societal value and impact.  
We have advised clients on biodiversity  
on a number of key projects.
In designing Dubai Creek Harbour,  
we persuaded the client of the benefits  
of incorporating a bird sanctuary adjacent 
to the development, influencing the 
building of an education centre and 
interconnecting walkways.
In Ireland’s Tolka Valley Greenway project 
we restored nearly 20 hectares of 
parklands, preserving a variety of native 
habitats, and provided advice on 
sustainable river management, allowing 
flooding whilst controlling water quality.

A responsible business  
of the future
Technical excellence
We continue to plan, design and enable 
sustainable value and technical excellence 
for our clients, utilising management 
standards to develop more collaborative 
client relationships. By way of example, 
our UK rail business obtained formal 
BS1100 business standard accreditation. 
To underpin our delivery of high-quality 
projects, we are improving management 
and coordination of Building Information 
Modelling (BIM) activities and 
accompanying computer-aided design 
standards. New Civil Engineer magazine’s 
prestigious Consultant of the Year Award 
confirmed our outstanding performance. 
Economic and environmental 
resilience
We support governments, investors and 
other authorities in achieving economic 
and environmental resilience through 
infrastructure and technological 
investment. Atkins is participating in  
the Qatar Government’s transport 
infrastructure programme, part of Qatar’s 
National Vision 2030, which aims to 
transform Qatar’s society by 2030, so  
that it is capable of sustaining its own 
development and providing a high 
standard of living for its people. 
Strong governance and accountability
Respect for human rights is critical to us 
and we seek to have a positive influence 
wherever we operate. In the Middle East 
the AMRs enable us to influence clients 
and contractors to raise standards of 
health, safety and welfare during 
construction projects. Clients also request 
our support in this area. For instance, 
Qatar’s Public Works Authority requested 
our review of labour camp welfare 
conditions, which resulted in operational 
improvements and a standard design for 
labour camps.
Our Group policies, along with our 
sustainability principles, determine our 
approach to demonstrating responsibility, 
transparency and fairness and outline  
our commitment to the provision of  
equal opportunities and a safe and  
secure workplace.
We communicate our support for human 
rights to stakeholders, including 
employees, clients and shareholders, 
through a variety of channels, including 
this report and the living embodiment  
of our values in our culture. 
International business, local service
We recognise the importance of 
sustaining local economies by employing 
local expertise and selecting and 
developing local suppliers. 
By way of example, multidisciplinary 
design work for the Doha Metro system 
included the use of local building 
materials. This supported the regional 
economy and reduced the environmental 
impact of the project in compliance with 
the Global Sustainability Assessment 
System adapted for Qatar.
In addition, our Energy business in 
Australia has employed local people to 
deliver a project in China, sharing good 
practice and equipping workers with skills 
to help them earn their living long after 
the project’s completion. 
Strategic engagement for innovation
One of our sustainability principles 
advocates collaboration with key 
organisations to develop innovative 
solutions that meet the complex 
sustainability challenges faced by society. 
In China we put this into practice at the 
Beijing UK-China business summit 
attended by UK Prime Minister David 
Cameron and Minister for UK Trade  
and Investment Lord Livingston. Another 
example of this principle in action is where 
our UK water and environment business 
has introduced innovation hubs, to find 
new ways of solving complex challenges 
and showcasing new approaches.

The directors of a company are required 
to prepare a strategic report about that 
company for each financial year, designed 
to inform shareholders and help them 
assess how the directors have performed 
their duty to promote the success of the 
company. Additionally the directors are 
required to prepare a directors’ report

College of Physicians, 11 St Andrews 
Place, Regent’s Park, London NW1 4LE  
at 1100 on Wednesday 30 July 2014. 
Details of the business to be considered  
at the AGM, together with an explanation 
of each of the resolutions, are set out  
in the separate notice of meeting.
Directors
The names and biographies of those 
persons serving as directors of the 
Company as at the date of this report are 
incorporated into this report by reference 
and can be found in the Board of 
Directors section (pages 60 to 61).
Under the Company’s articles of 
association all directors must retire at the 
first AGM following their appointment  
by the Board and may offer themselves  
for election by shareholders. In line with 
the requirements of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code all directors will retire  
at each AGM and, if eligible, may offer 
themselves for re-election. This year  
all the directors except Alun Griffiths and 
Rodney Slater, being eligible, will offer 
themselves for re-election. The Board 
considers that the performance of each  
of the directors standing for re-election 
continues to be effective and that each of 
them demonstrates a strong commitment  
to their role.
Indemnification of and insurance 
cover for directors and officers
Directors and officers of the Company and 
its subsidiaries benefit from directors’ and 
officers’ liability insurance cover in respect 
of legal actions brought against them.  
In addition, directors of the Company are 
indemnified in accordance with article 138 
of the Company’s articles of association  
to the maximum extent permitted by law, 
such indemnities being qualifying third 
party indemnities. Prior to the adoption of 
new articles of association by shareholders 
on 3 September 2008, all directors in 
appointment on that date had separate 
deeds of indemnity. These indemnities, 
which still remain in force, are available  
for inspection by shareholders at the 
Company’s registered office during 
normal business hours and will be 
available for inspection at the AGM.
Neither the insurance nor the indemnities 
provide cover where the relevant  
director or officer has acted fraudulently 
or dishonestly.
Articles of association
The Company’s articles of association  
set out the Company’s internal regulation 
and cover such matters as the rights of 
shareholders, the appointment and 
removal of directors, the power to issue 
and buy back shares and the conduct of 
Board and general meetings. A copy of 
the Company’s articles of association is 
available on the Group’s website or on 
request from the company secretary. 
Amendments to the articles of association 
must be approved by at least 75% of 
those voting in person or by proxy at  
a general meeting of the Company.
In accordance with the Company’s  
articles of association, directors can be 
appointed or removed by the Board or by 
shareholders in general meeting. Subject 
to the provisions of relevant legislation, 
the Company’s articles of association and 
any directions given by a special resolution 
of shareholders, the Board of directors 
may exercise all the powers of the 
Company and may delegate authorities  
to committees and management as it sees 
fit. Details of the main committees of  
the Board are contained in the Corporate 
Governance Report (pages 66 to 73),  
the Nomination Committee Report  
(pages 74 to 75), the Audit Committee 
Report (pages 76 to 80), the Remuneration 
Report (pages 81 to 105) and on the 
Group’s website.
Research and development
The Group develops and delivers 
innovative technical solutions to its clients, 
the costs of which are expensed to the 
income statement. The Group obtains 
enhanced tax relief for these costs in 
certain territories. Governance 63

Political donations and 
expenditure
The Group made no political donations 
and incurred no political expenditure  
in the UK or European Union during  
the year ended 31 March 2014  
(31 March 2013: nil).
On 1 October 2010 the Group completed 
the acquisition of The PBSJ Corporation 
and its subsidiaries (the acquired 
companies). On acquisition, the acquired 
companies had, in accordance with 
relevant US federal and state election 
laws, historically made political donations 
in the US both directly and to affiliated  
US state and federal political action 
committees (PACs).
From 1 April 2011 until 25 June 2011,  
the PACs were funded partly by 
contributions from the acquired 
companies and partly by employee 
contributions. Since 25 June 2011,  
the PACs have been funded solely  
by employee contributions.
Since 1 April 2012, our policy has been  
to make corporate political donations  
in the US only on the following basis:
•	 directly to non-partisan ballot initiatives 
supporting infrastructure development 
and maintenance; or
•	 to individual candidates and political 
parties only via the PACs, funded 
entirely by employee contributions.
Pursuant to a change in Florida law, the 
Group’s Florida PAC was wound up in 
October 2013. Only one PAC remains, 
operating in all 50 states.
Under this policy there were no corporate 
political donations during the year  
ended 31 March 2014 (2013: $18,800 
(£11,894)). In addition, the sole remaining 
PAC continues to make donations funded 
entirely by employee contributions.
Shares
Share capital
As at the date of this report, the 
Company’s share capital consists of 
104,451,799 issued and fully paid ordinary 
shares each with a nominal value of 0.5p, 
listed on the London Stock Exchange. 
Shares may be held in certificated or 
uncertificated form. Further details of the 
Company’s issued share capital, including 
changes during the year, can be found  
in note 34 to the Financial Statements 
(page 171).
The rights and obligations attaching to the 
Company’s ordinary shares are contained 
in the Company’s articles of association 
and the Companies Act 2006 (the Act).  
In summary, the ordinary shares allow 
holders to receive dividends and to 
exercise one vote on a poll per ordinary 
share for every holder present in person  
or by proxy at general meetings of the 
Company. Shares held in treasury are not 
entitled to vote or receive dividends. There 
are no restrictions on the transfer or sale 
of ordinary shares and no requirements 
for prior approval of any transfers, except 
as described below. Under the Company’s 
articles of association, the directors have 
the power to suspend voting rights and 
the right to receive dividends in respect  
of ordinary shares and to refuse to  
register a transfer of ordinary shares in 
circumstances where the holder of those 
shares fails to comply with a notice issued 
under section 793 of the Act. The 
directors also have the power to refuse  
to register any transfer of certificated 
shares that does not satisfy the conditions 
set out in the articles of association.
The Company has a Level 1 American 
Depositary Receipt (ADR) programme, 
which enables US investors to purchase 
the Company’s American Depositary 
Shares (ADSs). Each ADS represents one 
ordinary share and allows each holder, 
subject to the terms and conditions of  
the ADR, to receive dividend payments 
and vote by proxy on resolutions at  
a general meeting.
Shares acquired through Atkins’ employee 
share schemes rank equally with all  
other ordinary shares in issue and have  
no special rights. The trustees of the 
Company’s employee benefit trusts  
(EBTs) have waived the rights of the EBTs 
to receive dividends on shares they hold, 
with one EBT fully waiving this right and 
another waiving the right to dividends  
in excess of 0.01p per share. In addition 
neither of the trustees of the EBTs 
exercises its right to vote in respect of 
such shares. Shares held in trust on  
behalf of participants in the Atkins Share 
Incentive Plan are voted by the trustee, 
Capita IRG Trustees Limited, as directed by 
plan participants. Details of share-based 
payments, including information regarding 
the shares held by the EBTs, can be found 
in note 35 to the Financial Statements 
(page 173).
At the AGM held in 2013 shareholders 
granted authority for the directors to allot 
relevant securities up to approximately 
one third of the issued share capital  
and a further one third in connection  
with an offer by way of a rights issue.  
The directors intend to seek shareholder 
approval for an equivalent authority at  
this year’s AGM, details of which are 
contained in the notice of meeting.
The Company is not aware of any 
agreements between shareholders that 
might result in the restriction of transfer  
or voting rights in relation to the shares 
held by such shareholders. 64 Governance
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2014
Directors’ Report continued
Share purchases
At the AGM held in 2013, the Company 
was granted authority by shareholders  
to purchase up to 10,011,000 ordinary 
shares, representing approximately 10% 
of the Company’s ordinary share capital  
as at 12 June 2013. No ordinary shares 
were purchased pursuant to this authority 
during the year ended 31 March 2014  
or to the date of this Annual Report and 
Accounts. This authority will expire at  
the forthcoming AGM and the Company  
will seek shareholder approval for an 
equivalent authority (such authority being 
in accordance with current best practice)  
at this year’s AGM.
4,341,000 ordinary shares of 0.5p each, 
representing approximately 4.2% of  
the Company’s issued share capital,  
were held in treasury (the treasury  
shares) throughout the year and to  
the date of this Annual Report and 
Accounts following a historic share 
buyback programme.
Significant shareholders
As at the year end and the date of this 
Annual Report and Accounts, the 
Company had been notified of holdings  
of 3% or more of the total voting rights 
attaching to its issued share capital as 
detailed in table 1.
Change of control
No agreement with a director or 
employee of the Company provides  
for compensation for loss of office  
or employment (whether through 
resignation, purported redundancy  
or otherwise) that occurs as a result  
of a change of control.
All of the Company’s employee share 
schemes contain provisions relating to  
a change of control of the Company. 
Under these provisions, a change of 
control would normally be a vesting  
event, facilitating the exercise of options 
or transfer of allocations subject to  
any relevant performance conditions 
being satisfied.
The Company is not a party to any other 
significant agreements that take effect, 
alter or terminate upon a change of 
control other than its funding facilities, 
which provide that in such a situation the 
Company may be unable to draw down 
any further amounts under the facilities 
and/or that they may be cancelled.
Directors’ statement of 
responsibility
The directors are responsible for preparing 
the Annual Report and Accounts, the 
Remuneration Report and the Financial 
Statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to 
prepare financial statements for each 
financial year. The directors have prepared 
the Group and Company Financial 
Statements in accordance with applicable 
law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union. In preparing these 
Financial Statements, the directors have 
also elected to comply with IFRSs, issued 
by the International Accounting Standards 
Board (IASB). Under company law the 
directors must not approve the Financial 
Statements unless they are satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view of the state 
of affairs of the Company and the Group 
and of the profit or loss of the Company 
and the Group for that period.
In preparing the Financial Statements,  
the directors are required to:
•	 select suitable accounting policies  
and then apply them consistently
•	 make judgements and accounting 
estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent
•	 state whether applicable IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union have 
been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in 
the Financial Statements
•	 prepare the Financial Statements on  
the going concern basis, unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
Group and the Company will continue  
in business.

Directors’ Report continued
The directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the 
Company’s transactions and disclose  
with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company and  
the Group and that enable them to ensure 
that the Financial Statements and the 
Remuneration Report comply with the  
Act and, as regards the Group Financial 
Statements, Article 4 of the International 
Accounting Standard Regulation. They  
are also responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the Company and the Group  
and hence for taking reasonable steps  
for the prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the 
corporate and financial information 
included on the Company’s website. 
Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation  
in other jurisdictions.
Each of the directors, whose names and 
functions are listed in this Annual Report 
and Accounts (pages 60 and 61), confirms 
that, to the best of his/her knowledge:
•	 the Directors’ Report contained in the 
Annual Report and Accounts includes  
a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the 
position of the Group, together with  
a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that it faces 
•	 the Group Financial Statements, which 
have been prepared in accordance with 
IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union, give a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities, financial position and 
profit or loss of the Group.
The Board considers that the Annual 
Report and Accounts, taken as a whole,  
is fair, balanced and understandable,  
and that it provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Group’s performance, business model  
and strategy.
As required by the LRs, the auditors have 
considered the directors’ statement of 
compliance in relation to those points  
of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
which are specified for their review.
Going concern
The directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company and  
the Group have adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for  
the foreseeable future and therefore 
continue to adopt the going concern basis 
in preparing the Financial Statements.
Disclosure of audit information
The directors confirm that, as at the date 
this Annual Report and Accounts was 
approved, so far as each director is aware 
there is no relevant audit information  
of which the Company’s auditor is 
unaware and that he or she has taken  
all the steps that he or she ought to  
have taken as a director in order to make 
himself or herself aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish that  
the Company’s auditor is aware of that 
information.
Independent auditor
The Company’s independent auditor, 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, has 
expressed its willingness to continue  
in office and resolutions for its 
reappointment and to authorise  
the directors to determine its 
remuneration will be proposed  
at the forthcoming AGM.

Corporate Governance Report
Letter from the chairman
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present the Board’s annual report on corporate 
governance. This review, and the reports of the Nomination, 
Audit and Remuneration Committees which follow, summarise 
our activities in this area during the year.
Shareholders look to the Board to promote the long-term 
success of the Company. We remain committed to excellent 
standards of corporate governance, based on our conviction 
that a strong governance framework is an essential foundation 
for this success.
Strong governance starts with the Board. At Atkins we place 
great importance on having an effective team of directors 
comprising high-calibre individuals who bring diverse 
perspectives from careers spent in a wide range of industries 
around the world.
Succession planning/Board membership
There have been a number of changes to the Board during  
the year. Admiral the Lord Boyce retired in July 2013. He was 
replaced as senior independent director by Fiona Clutterbuck. 
Joanne Curin, non-executive director and chairman of  
the Audit Committee, stepped down from the Board on  
31 January 2014 following her appointment as chief financial 
officer of Lamprell plc. Rodney Slater will be retiring from the 
Board after our annual general meeting (AGM) on 30 July 2014. 
On behalf of the Board I would once again like to thank  
Lord Boyce for his commitment to the Company during his 
time as a director, extend our thanks to Joanne for her  
valued contribution to the Board and leadership of the Audit 
Committee over the last five years and also thank Rodney  
for his input during his three-year tenure.
I am pleased to take this opportunity to welcome both  
Allister Langlands and Thomas Leppert, who joined the Board 
as independent non-executive directors on 4 September 2013 
and 1 October 2013 respectively. These appointments 
complement and further enhance the wide-ranging skills  
we are privileged to have on our Board. Allister brings a  
wealth of knowledge of the energy industry, while Thomas 
has extensive experience in both the public and private sectors 
including construction and consultancy in the North American 
market. Allister has succeeded Joanne as chairman of the  
Audit Committee.
Alun Griffiths, our Group HR director, will retire from the 
Board at the conclusion of our AGM on 30 July 2014. Alun  
has been with the Group for 28 years and has served on the 
Board as an executive director for the past seven years. Alun 
has made an outstanding contribution to the Group, and  
the Board and I would like to thank him for his long-standing 
counsel and commitment during this period. Alun will be 
succeeded as Group HR director by James Cullens, who joins 
us from Hays plc. It is my pleasure to welcome James, who 
joins the Board on 1 July 2014.
Diversity
The Board recognises that gender imbalance among the 
Group’s employees is an issue, as it is for many other 
organisations in the science, engineering, maths and 
technology sectors.
Atkins continues to drive initiatives both within the Company 
and the wider industry to promote diversity, more details  
of which can be found in the Human Resources Review  
(page 52).
The Board believes in the benefits of greater gender diversity 
at Board level and is actively supportive of measures to achieve 
this without putting quotas in place. Our focus remains on 
attracting the right talent and skills irrespective of gender or 
ethnicity, resulting in the appointment of two male directors 
during the year.
The Board has previously set out its aspiration to have one 
third of its Board members as women by 2015. The retirement 
of Joanne Curin has reduced the number of women on our 
Board to one. Today, the Board’s make-up reflects the 
increasing internationalisation of the Group with directors 
demonstrating diversity of perspective, experience, thought, 
gender, ethnicity and nationality. Nevertheless, we remain 
committed to achieving a membership of at least one third 
women on the Board by 2015. 
Yours faithfully
Allan Cook

Corporate Governance Report continued
Statement of compliance with the Code
Throughout the year ended 31 March 2014 the Company complied with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the 
Code), published by the Financial Reporting Council (the FRC) in 2012, a copy of which is available on the FRC’s website: www.frc.org.uk. 
Compliance with the Code was required commencing 1 April 2013.
The disclosures that follow mirror the five sections of the Code: Leadership, Effectiveness, Accountability, Remuneration and Relations 
with Shareholders.
Full details of the Group’s governance framework are available on the Group’s website: www.atkinsglobal.com/investors_governance.
Leadership
The Board is responsible for ensuring the long-term success of the Company. It does so by determining the Company’s long-term 
direction and strategic aims within a framework of appropriate and robust controls. A key principle of the framework is the 
delegation of operational management to the chief executive officer, with a matrix of authorities setting out how this is further 
delegated through the organisation. This enables the efficient and effective day to day operation of the Group’s different businesses.
Further details on the roles of the chairman, chief executive officer and senior independent director can be found on the Group’s 
website: www.atkinsglobal.com/investors_leadership. The chief executive officer has established two teams to enable him to 
discharge his responsibilities effectively: the senior leadership team (SLT) and the recently established operational leadership team 
(OLT). The SLT has a strategic focus while the OLT concentrates on operational matters by providing a forum for the regional chief 
executive officers to focus on performance, sharing best practice and knowledge.
The Board has reserved a number of matters for its sole consideration. These include:
•	 consideration and approval of strategy
•	 general oversight of the Group’s operations
•	 approval of significant bids and contracts
•	 the Group’s capital, corporate, management and control structures
•	 approval of financial statements and shareholder communications
•	 approval of dividend policy and interim dividends
•	 approval of Group policies
•	 implementation and monitoring of internal control and risk management systems
•	 approval of significant acquisitions and disposals
•	 material changes to the Group’s pension schemes.
While the Board has specific responsibility for the matters reserved for its consideration, in certain areas specific responsibility is 
delegated to committees of the Board within defined terms of reference. The activities of these committees are discussed in more 
detail in the Nomination Committee Report (pages 74 to 75), the Audit Committee Report (pages 76 to 80) and the Remuneration 
Report (pages 81 to 105). The committee terms of reference are available on the Group’s website or on request from the  
company secretary.
In addition the Board may delegate authority to a standing committee, consisting of any two directors, to provide final sign-off  
for an agreed course of action within predefined parameters. 68 Governance

The senior independent director led the appraisal of the chairman’s performance. She sought input from all directors before 
discussing her findings with the independent non-executive directors. She then provided feedback to the chairman. During the  
year, the independent non-executive directors also met regularly with the chairman.
Allan Cook’s external commitments changed during the year following his appointment as the lead non-executive director of the  
UK’s Department for Business, Innovation & Skills. To enable him to carry out his responsibilities as chairman, he continues to spend  
at least three days per week with the Company.
Directors’ conflicts of interest
Each director is required, in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 (the Act), to declare any interests that may give rise to  
a conflict of interest with the Company on appointment and subsequently as they arise. Where such a conflict, or potential conflict, 
arises the Board is empowered under the Company’s articles of association to consider and authorise such conflicts as appropriate.  
In addition, the Company undertakes an annual review of all authorised conflicts to ensure such authorisation remains appropriate, 
the last such review having taken place in November 2013.

Performance evaluation
The Board recognises the need to maintain its development and the development of individual directors to ensure its continued 
effectiveness and to respond to evolving best practice. This involves an ongoing process of:
•	reflecting on past performance and the implementation of past actions
•	consideration of future training, skill and diversity requirements
•	identification and implementation of new actions to improve performance.
The Board recognises that the process of improving its effectiveness requires continuous attention, particularly in respect of actions 
such as ensuring the correct Board balance and diversity (2011/12 and 2012/13), succession planning (2010/11 and 2011/12) and 
Board focus (2010/11 and 2012/13).
The Board undertakes a rigorous and formal evaluation of its own performance and that of its committees and directors annually.  
The Board believes that an external evaluation every three years brings new insight into its processes and performance. An external 
evaluation took place in 2012/13. The 2013/14 evaluation was conducted internally.
The chairman conducted one-to-one sessions with each member of the Board and the company secretary. The following areas of its 
role and performance were explored in depth during the evaluation process:
•	Board role and remit
•	induction and continuing education
•	information flows to the Board
•	 diversity of skills, experience, independence and knowledge on the Board, including consideration of gender diversity
•	any other factors relevant to the Board’s effectiveness, such as management of meetings.
The Board received a written report from the chairman, which identified progress made and areas for improvement. This was  
debated and discussed in detail and a clear action plan for the year ahead was then developed and approved.
The actions identified in the 2013/14 review build upon the actions identified in previous years and focus on the diversity of the 
Board, succession planning, Board focus and interaction between Board members. While many of these themes have arisen in prior 
years, the significant changes to the membership of the Board during the year have inevitably contributed to a focus on those areas 
particularly affected by its composition. In addition, the increasingly diverse locations of Board members, coupled with the work 
undertaken in prior years to provide more timely and detailed management data (2011/12) and enhance the rolling 12-month agenda 
(2010/11), have led to adjustments to the frequency of meetings and increased use of technology.
The key findings of the 2013/14 performance review will be implemented in the current financial year and progress will be considered 
as part of the next performance evaluation.
Commitment
During the year all directors, including the independent non-executive directors, committed significant time to the Company, in line 
with the requirements stated in their letters of appointment and service contracts. Governance 71

Development, business awareness and induction
The chairman regularly reviews training requirements with each director in order to maximise the contribution of the directors.  
The company secretary ensures suitable opportunities are identified and communicated to directors. During the year the directors 
have undertaken training via an audit committee workshop and remuneration committee debate.
The Board also receives regular updates from the company secretary on legal, regulatory and governance developments, which 
highlight any impact they may have on the Board and/or the Group.
On joining the Board, directors take part in a formal induction process. This includes the provision of past Board materials to  
provide background information on the Group, information on Board processes and governance, site visits and meetings with key  
employees. The induction is tailored to each new director’s specific needs. Allister Langlands and Thomas Leppert are participating  
in comprehensive induction programmes, which commenced immediately following the announcement of their appointments.  
James Cullens will receive a similar introduction to the Group on commencement of his appointment.
Accountability
Financial reporting
Statements regarding directors’ responsibilities and the status of the business as a going concern are given in the Directors’ Report 
(pages 64 and 65).
Internal controls
The Board is responsible for reviewing and approving the Group’s governance framework and ensuring its adequacy and 
effectiveness, as set out in the FRC’s 2005 Internal Control: Revised Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code. Changes  
in this area following consultations by the FRC are being monitored by the Board and its committees as applicable.
Work to develop our Group code of conduct continued during the year and this is expected to be launched to all employees in  
the current financial year. It sets out what it means to think and behave in the Atkins Way and provides employees with a clear 
framework within which to operate.
The Group’s governance framework is illustrated in figure 1.

WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2014
Corporate Governance Report continued
The governance framework reflects the devolved and decentralised structure of the Group, which is considered a key part of the 
Group’s ability to deliver services to its clients. Under this structure the Board has delegated operational responsibility to the chief 
executive officer, who then delegates authority and control to the regional chief executive officers (who are all members of the  
SLT and OLT). Authority is further delegated from them to the managing directors of the principal businesses and then downward  
to business and project managers as appropriate. This approach is reflected in the governance framework as follows:
•	 the policy statements approved by the Board, available on our website: www.atkinsglobal.com/corporate-responsibility/ 
policy-and-governance, set out clearly and succinctly Atkins’ vision, commitment and arrangements, including: business conduct, 
risk management, employment, excellence in delivery, health, safety and security, sustainability and stakeholder communication
•	 Group controls set out mandatory activities and standards that are part of the overall Group processes and apply across the Group
•	 the code of conduct will set out behavioural expectations for everyone who works for and represents Atkins, the purpose being  
to reinforce the controls and underpin the ethics and values that apply across the Group, thereby protecting the reputation of our 
business and maintaining our professional standing and brand
•	 each BMS (as adopted by each region/business) has been reviewed and updated to ensure it incorporates all Group controls and 
any regional and industry-specific controls required to deliver our four key business processes – win work, deliver work, people  
and business operations – with each BMS providing a single source of information for employees, enabling them to understand 
their responsibilities and comply with all Atkins’ requirements.
The following principles are key to the successful operation of the framework:
•	authority is delegated within clearly prescribed limits (under the Group’s authority matrix)
•	decisions are escalated where either project size or risk profile require a higher level of authority
•	activity and performance are tracked through monthly and quarterly reports
•	effectiveness is audited via internal audit and self-assessment reviews.
The governance framework is designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve stated business objectives.  
It can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Joint ventures in which the Company does not have overall control are not covered by the Group’s governance framework. For these 
joint ventures, systems of internal control are applied as agreed between the joint venture parties but as far as possible we insist on 
compliance with our governance requirements as a minimum.
The Board monitored and reviewed the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group’s governance framework, including internal controls 
and risk management, on a continuous basis throughout the year ended 31 March 2014 and up to the date of approval of the Annual 
Report. Support was provided by the Group Risk Committee, the internal audit function and the Company’s independent auditor.

Relations with shareholders
Engagement with our shareholders is a fundamental part of the Group’s corporate governance model. To this end we seek to 
establish an early and effective dialogue with shareholders regarding significant changes that affect corporate governance, in addition 
to ongoing engagement on more routine matters. Communication regarding the delivery of the Group’s strategy is integral to this 
ongoing dialogue.
The primary means used by the Board for communicating with all Company shareholders are the Annual Report and Accounts, 
preliminary statement of annual results, half year results and the AGM. It also recognises the importance of the internet as  
a means of communicating widely, quickly and cost-effectively. An investor relations section is provided on the Group’s website:  
www.atkinsglobal.com/investors to facilitate communications with institutional and private investors. This includes material  
shared with fund managers and analysts at Company meetings. Governance 73 
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2014
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Corporate Information
Corporate Governance Report continued
Our shareholders play a vital role in the Group’s governance and their increasingly active engagement is welcomed. The investor 
relations director, alongside the chief executive officer, Group finance director and chairman, provides a focal point for 
communication with investors and is always keen to engage with, educate and inform potential new investors. The Group’s  
approach to investor relations enables it to be proactive in its engagement with both shareholders and non-shareholders.
The chief executive officer and Group finance director present the preliminary statement of annual results and half year results to 
institutional investors and analysts. These presentations are also available via webcast and teleconference. Analyst breakfast events 
are hosted regularly which include presentations by our regional chief executives and business managing directors. In the last financial 
year they have focused on our Asia Pacific business and opportunities in the global rail market. The chief executive officer, Group 
finance director and investor relations director also regularly attend conferences and roadshows to give shareholders, and other 
potential investors, access to management.
The non-executive directors receive updates on the views of shareholders from the executive directors following investor meetings. 
The Group’s broker also provides updates to the Board on shareholder opinions and compiles independent feedback from investor 
meetings twice a year. The company secretary brings to the attention of the Board any material matters of concern raised by the 
Company’s shareholders, including private investors.
Retail shareholders have the opportunity to attend our AGM, where all directors are expected to be available to answer questions. 
They are also able to submit questions in writing at any time. All of the directors in appointment at the time attended our AGM  
in July 2013 and were available to speak to shareholders.
We intend to call a poll for all resolutions to be considered at the 2014 AGM. This ensures the Company continues to follow best 
practice and allows all shareholders, present in person or by proxy, to vote on all resolutions in proportion to their shareholding. 
Details of the 2014 AGM are set out in the separate Notice of Meeting.

Board and committee 
appointments
•	Board and committee memberships
•	 Recommendation to the Board regarding appointment of two new non-executive directors  
and an executive director
•	Re-election of directors in accordance with the Company’s articles of association
Board composition
The Board’s composition is regularly reviewed and, where necessary, updated to ensure that it is able to respond to the Group’s  
needs. As the Group continues to grow, and as we move into the new financial year, our refreshed Board is well placed to provide 
effective leadership.
Appointment process
Allister Langlands and Thomas Leppert were appointed to the Board as independent non-executive directors during the last financial 
year. James Cullens will be joining as an executive director on 1 July 2014 and, after one month’s handover, will take over as 
Group HR director.
At the beginning of each appointment process, the Nomination Committee considered in detail which areas of expertise the Board, 
and in turn the Group, would most benefit from and drew up detailed role specifications accordingly. Diversity of thought and 
background played a considerable part in the process. Each candidate was assessed against the role specification as well as 
undergoing a comprehensive interview process. Gender diversity was an important part of the appointment process. We mandated 
that balanced shortlists be presented for these appointments and will do so for future searches for independent non-executive 
directors.
The executive search firm Korn/Ferry Whitehead Mann supported the Board on all the appointments during the year. We are pleased 
that it has signed up to the Voluntary Code of Conduct for Executive Search Firms, which promotes gender diversity and best practice 
for corporate board search processes. 
Succession planning
Considerable effort has been put into developing talent below Board level, notably through the introduction of a Group leadership 
development programme (GLDP) in the year ended 31 March 2013. Several members of the Board joined attendees during the  
GLDP in the summer of 2013. Members of the Committee participated in a comprehensive review of the Group’s succession plan  
at a meeting of the Board held during the year.
Gender imbalance below Board level is widely recognised as a potential factor in gender imbalance at Board level. The Company  
has sought to address this through various initiatives, as set out in the Human Resources Review (page 52). As part of the succession 
planning exercise, a number of female employees have been identified as potential future leaders of the Group. It is hoped this  
will create a pipeline of senior female talent in both management and technical roles. Furthermore, we have engaged actively with  
an initiative promoted by the Department for Business, Innovation & Skills (BIS), to identify female senior employees to become 
potential candidates for non-executive director roles in other listed companies.  Governance 75 
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2014

Nomination Committee Report continued
Board and employee diversity
The Board attaches significant importance to diversity both within its own membership and within the Group. Atkins benefits  
from diversity at Board level in terms of both perspective and experience.
In particular, the Board remains committed to gender diversity. The topic of women’s representation on boards remains high  
on the agenda for governments and the public. In March 2014 Lord Davies of Abersoch published his third annual progress report  
on this matter. In it he renews his calls for chairmen to set out their aspirational targets for the number of women on their boards  
in 2015 or beyond and for companies to invest in the female talent pipeline.
The Board continues to aspire to a membership of at least one third women by 2015, without compromising its focus on diversity  
of thought and experience. In the wider Group, we are continuing to work towards our short-term target of increasing female 
representation in both the senior management population (the top 1,000 employees in the Group) and the SLT to 15% by  
31 March 2015. Details of female representation in the wider Group are provided in the Human Resources Review (page 53).
The Board’s current diversity as at 31 March 2014 is shown in table 2 below.

Audit Committee Report
Letter from the Audit Committee chairman
Dear Shareholder
Following my appointment as chairman of the Audit 
Committee from 1 February 2014, I am delighted to present 
the Audit Committee Report for the financial year ended  
31 March 2014. My fellow Committee members and I would 
like to thank Joanne Curin, who retired from the Board in 
January this year, for her stewardship of the Committee since  
1 July 2009. Her guidance and insights have proved invaluable 
as we carry the Committee’s work forward in a changing 
regulatory environment.
The role of the Committee continues to evolve. We have clear 
terms of reference and specific duties to perform but our main 
purpose is to give assurance that shareholders’ interests are 
being properly protected by appropriate financial management 
and reporting and internal control frameworks. We aim at all 
times to provide oversight and guidance which will contribute 
to the ongoing good governance of the business.
The UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code) has  
been revised to incorporate a number of new disclosures  
in relation to the work of audit committees. We welcome 
these developments, which are designed to provide 
shareholders with more information of relevance to the 
Company and to enhance transparency. We have therefore 
prepared this report in compliance with the Code’s new 
requirements and the report addresses the Committee’s 
consideration of significant issues during the financial year,  
our assessment of external audit effectiveness and our 
approach to appointing the auditor.
Internal auditor
Last year we reported the Committee’s satisfaction with  
the development of the internal audit function since the 
appointment in 2010 of Ernst & Young (EY) to provide these 
services to the Group. We have continued to benefit from EY’s 
ability to scale resource and deploy specialists where necessary.
Independent auditor
Regulatory and best practice developments regarding the 
appointment, role and responsibilities of the independent 
auditor remain subject to further discussion and potential 
change. We have considered the Code provision that the 
independent audit contract be put out to tender every 10 
years. However, comprehensive regulatory changes have also 
now been proposed by the European Union (EU) and the  
UK’s Competition Commission, which has since been abolished 
and had its powers transferred to the Competition and 
Markets Authority (CMA). We therefore believe that our 
long-term tender policy should be based on the final outcome 
of these developments taken as a whole. These issues are 
discussed further later in this report (page 78). In the 
meantime the reappointment of the independent auditor 
continues to be the subject of rigorous review each year.
Having considered the effectiveness and performance of the 
independent auditor, the Committee has recommended the 
reappointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) as 
independent auditor.
Yours faithfully

Annual financial reporting
Significant issues
The Audit Committee has reviewed the key judgements applied to a number of significant issues in the preparation of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements. This review included consideration of the following:
Significant issue How the Committee addressed this
Contract accounting/
revenue recognition
•	 The Group enters into a number of large and complex long-term contracts. Significant judgements 
are required to forecast how each contract will perform and potential adjustments that may prove 
necessary over the lifetime of a project. These judgements may include, for example, revenue and 
profit recognition being determined based on management’s estimates of the percentage that has 
been completed and the costs that will need to be incurred to complete it, as well as contractual 
variations. The Committee has received regular reports from management on a number of higher 
risk contracts and has challenged estimates of completion costs, with consequential impacts on 
revenue recognition. It has concluded that the approach to revenue recognition is appropriate in 
the context of the Group’s business model and contract structures.
Goodwill impairment •	 The Group has significant goodwill relating to Atkins North America (ANA) following the 
acquisition of The PBSJ Corporation in 2010. The Committee considered the need to undertake  
a goodwill impairment calculation as at 30 September 2013 by reviewing the assumptions used  
at 31 March 2013 and the discount rate used in relation to future cash flows and determined that 
there were no triggering events. At 31 March 2014 it examined the detailed full impairment review 
undertaken by management, which included testing of assumptions and sensitivity analysis. It also 
received and considered the independent auditor’s comments on the key assumptions and detailed 
forecasts made. The issue of impairment involves making significant judgements about the future 
results of the ANA business and the risks it faces. The Committee agreed with management’s 
recommendation that no impairment charge should be made but that there remains a risk of 
impairment of ANA goodwill in the future and relevant disclosures have therefore been included  
in the Annual Report and Accounts (note 16, page 148).
The Committee also considered a number of other judgements made by management, including judgements concerning accounting 
for acquisitions and disposals, provisions in the Group’s insurance captive, accounting for pension liabilities and taxation.
Fair, balanced and understandable
The Audit Committee examined the Annual Report and Accounts and was asked by the Board to advise it on whether they are fair, 
balanced and understandable. To enable it to draw its conclusions in this respect, the Committee:
•	 examined the preparation and review process for the Annual Report and Accounts and considered the level of challenge provided 
through that process
•	considered the accounting policies applied by the Group
•	 assessed the information contained in the Annual Report and Accounts against the Group’s strategy and business model to ensure 
the information provided was sufficient to enable shareholders to assess the Group’s performance. Governance 79 
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2014
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Corporate Information
Audit Committee Report continued
Independent auditor
The independent auditor is currently PwC, which has acted in this capacity since the Company listed on the London Stock Exchange 
in 1996. During the year the Committee conducted a review of the relationship with the independent auditor, as well as its 
qualification, expertise and resources and the effectiveness and quality of the audit. As part of this review, the Committee considers 
audit governance, audit planning and methodology, robustness of challenge to management and the quality of senior members  
of the audit team. It does so in consultation with senior management, particularly senior finance personnel. It has concluded that 
PwC’s appointment continues to meet the Group’s needs and therefore recommended to the Board its reappointment as 
independent auditor.
The Committee has agreed to implement a more formal process of review of the effectiveness of the independent auditor in future. 
The Committee will issue a questionnaire to the members of the Committee and senior management, which will be circulated after 
the publication of the Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 March 2014. The questionnaire will cover the robustness  
of the audit process, quality of deliverables, reporting and the audit team. The responses will be collated ahead of and fed into the 
Committee’s consideration of the audit strategy and approach for the financial year ending 31 March 2015.
The independence of the independent auditor is evidenced through its challenge to management. Its independence and objectivity 
are assured through the rotation of the audit partner on a regular basis, the last such rotation having taken place in 2012. 
Accordingly, the Committee has not considered it necessary to date to undertake a tender process for the audit work, although  
it has considered PwC’s tenure and appointment on an annual basis. There are no contractual obligations restricting the Company’s 
choice of independent auditor.
Audit tender policy
In September 2012 the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) amended the Code to include, among other changes, a requirement for 
FTSE 350 companies to put the independent audit contract out to tender at least once every 10 years. The FRC recognised that  
the audit market could be disrupted if a large number of companies chose to go out to tender in the first year in which the revised  
Code applied and hence proposed transitional arrangements that brought tenders in line with the cycle for rotating the audit partner.
The Competition Commission (now the CMA) issued its final report on its inquiry into the FTSE 350 audit market in October 2013.  
Its recommendations, which are yet to be enacted into law, included a mandatory audit tender once every 10 years, among other 
proposals intended to encourage competition.
In addition to the Code and Competition Commission developments, on 27 May 2014 the European Parliament published a directive 
and a regulation in the Official Journal of the EU implementing reforms of the audit sector in the EU. EU member states must adopt 
the necessary measures to implement the directive by 17 June 2016 while the regulation will apply from 17 June 2016 (other than the 
prohibition on contractual clauses limiting the choice of auditor, which will apply from 17 June 2017). The reforms require audit firms 
of public interest entities, including all listed companies, to rotate their auditor once every 10 years (with a possible extension for a 
further 10 years available where a tender is held) and introduce a range of new rules and measures to strengthen audit quality and 
independence across the EU.
It is not yet clear what impact the EU changes will have on the Competition Commission recommendations and on the Code or how 
the various requirements will interact. The Committee will therefore continue to monitor developments and will put in place a formal 
audit tender policy when the position has become clearer. In the meantime the reappointment of the independent auditor will 
continue to be the subject of rigorous review each year. 80 Governance

Auditor independence
The Committee understands that certain work of a non-audit nature may be best undertaken by the independent auditor as  
a result of its unique position and knowledge of key areas of the Company. Approval is required prior to the independent auditor 
commencing non-audit work in accordance with a Group policy, summarised in table 2. This policy is drafted to preserve the 
independence and objectivity of the independent auditor and is reviewed and approved annually by the Committee. The impact  
on independence, if any, of non-audit work performed by the independent auditor is also considered regularly by the Committee.  
The policy sets out safeguards to be considered when engaging the independent auditor for non-audit services. The appointment  
of former employees of the independent auditor to positions in the Group is also regulated by the Committee.

Executive management (via the Group finance director 
and company secretary) has delegated authority to use 
the independent auditor without prior consultation  
with the Committee (although the nature of, and fees 
associated with, that work will be regularly reported  
to the Committee).
The independent auditor’s audit partner also has to 
approve any such engagement before it can proceed.
Following a supplier review, if 
management does identify the 
independent auditor as being the best 
supplier in a specific field and also believes 
that such an assignment does not run the 
risk of prejudicing its independence, then 
an evaluated request will be made to the 
Committee to confirm the appointment.
Appointments for non-material fee levels 
may be approved by the Group finance 
director (or company secretary in his 
absence).
The independent auditor’s audit partner 
also has to approve any such engagement 
before it can proceed.
n/a
Note 5 to the Financial Statements (page 139) sets out the fees paid to the independent auditor for audit and non-audit work. 
Approximately 90% of the non-audit fees incurred related to taxation advice and it was therefore considered appropriate, in light of 
PwC’s detailed understanding of the Group and expertise in this area, to engage its services in this regard. The Committee concluded 
that the level of non-audit fees, which represent a value of 66.7% of the audit and audit-related fees for the Group, did not have  
any impact upon PwC’s independence.

Remuneration Report
Letter from the Remuneration Committee chairman
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present the annual report on directors’ 
remuneration. This report is divided into two sections in 
accordance with The Large and Medium-sized Companies  
and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 
2013 (the Regulations): a policy report which sets out our 
approach to remuneration, and a remuneration report which 
details what has been paid to directors during the year ended 
31 March 2014. Each report will be subject to a separate vote 
at our forthcoming annual general meeting (AGM). 
Responding to change
Since I last reported to shareholders on the work of the 
Committee, there has been a significant amount of change to 
the regulations concerning directors’ remuneration disclosure. 
Many of you will be aware of the debate and stakeholder 
consultation which took place ahead of these changes being 
implemented. Members of the Committee followed this 
debate closely and we have sought to respond to the new 
requirements comprehensively, building on the extensive 
remuneration disclosures we have made for the past two 
years. We are conscious that best practice will continue to 
evolve and the Committee will continue to monitor this, 
responding to change as appropriate.
Overview of our remuneration framework
The primary aim of the Committee is to align our remuneration 
framework with business strategy, calibrated to pay for 
performance.
Strategic alignment
Our remuneration framework seeks to:
•	reinforce business strategy 
•	 provide the right balance between short- and long-term 
incentives
•	 align senior management remuneration with that of  
the executive directors
•	 recognise that we operate a people business, where  
reward and incentive structures are critical to our success.
It is within this framework that we seek to pay for performance.
Paying for performance
We believe that our remuneration framework has created  
a clear link between the performance of the Group, the 
creation of shareholder value and the remuneration of our 
executive directors. This is achieved through the appropriate 
selection of performance measures and careful calibration  
of performance targets.
In the past year the Group has delivered another set of good 
results. The Group also made significant progress on the 
delivery of its strategy. The Group’s profit after tax for the  
year of £96.3m (2013 restated: £84.3m) exceeded the stretch 
target for bonus purposes. Group cash performance was  
also strong, with the cash conversion target for the year being 
met in full. Accordingly, the Committee has paid the maximum 
level of bonus to the executive directors for achieving the 
stretching financial targets that were set. The Committee also 
considered the performance of each of the executive directors 
against their key strategic objectives for the year, full details  
of which are contained in the Annual Remuneration Report  
on (page 98).
The three-year performance condition attached to the 2011 
LTIP awards ended on 31 March 2014. The Company EPS 
target was met in part and the relative TSR target was met  
in full. As a result 68.7% of the awards made will vest.
Ongoing dialogue
Last year, 85% of our shareholders voted in favour of the 
remuneration report including all 10 of the Company’s largest 
shareholders. The majority of those who voted against 
followed a voting recommendation from the proxy voting 
agency Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) whose primary 
concern related to the LGU. With this in mind, it is worth 
recapping on why the Committee first introduced this 
long-term incentive plan.
While our LTIP focuses executives on achieving strong earnings 
per share (EPS) growth over a three-year period, the LGU 
provides a direct link between remuneration and sustainable 
long-term increases in share price. Awards vest over a longer 
time frame than the LTIP and most conventional long-term 
incentives. In addition, the Committee is resolute that share 
price performance must be suitably underpinned by 
appropriate financial performance. As a consequence, the 
Committee will explicitly consider prior to the vesting of  
each tranche the Group’s progress against key quantifiable 
strategic measures. 
Following last year’s AGM we met again with ISS to explore  
its concerns regarding the LGU. In response we have increased 
our disclosure surrounding the LGU and address more  
explicitly the strategic measures which will be considered  
by the Committee prior to vesting (pages 87 and 100).

Committee activities 
The Committee uses a schedule of standing items to help structure the agendas for its meetings as well as responding to matters 
which arise during the course of the year, such as regulatory changes. The Committee’s standing agenda items are aligned to

Directors’ Remuneration Policy
This section of the report summarises the Company’s policy on directors’ remuneration and includes the following parts:
A. an overview of our remuneration policy and its alignment with our business strategy
B.  a future policy table detailing key remuneration elements for our executive directors
C. an illustration of the remuneration packages for each executive director under minimum, target and stretch performance scenarios
D. other relevant policies relating to executive directors’ remuneration, including on recruitment and termination
E. details of the remuneration policy for the chairman and non-executive directors
F. other matters considered when determining remuneration policy for directors. 
This policy will be put to shareholders for a binding vote at the Company’s AGM to be held on 30 July 2014. This policy is intended  
to last for three years and will take effect from the AGM, subject to shareholder approval.
A. Alignment with our strategy
Our strategy is to deliver long-term shareholder value through a focus on core growth sectors in engineering and design.  
As set out in the Strategy section (pages 16 to 17), this strategy has three principal priorities over the medium term:
•	operational excellence
•	portfolio optimisation
•	sector and regional focus.
The overall objective of our strategy remains to create shareholder value through:
•	driving margins above 8%
•	reducing dependence on the UK (with our long-term aspiration being to have more than 75% of our business outside the UK)
•	growing organically and through acquisition.
Our remuneration policy is directly aligned with the delivery of our strategy. The following key themes provide the basis for the 
framework:
•	as a people business, the remuneration policy must enable us to attract, retain and incentivise the best global talent
•	 the policy must be based on simple principles, aligned with our key performance indicators (page 20), and provide clear line  
of sight for participants and alignment with shareholders’ interests
•	 a significant portion of executive directors’ remuneration should be performance-related (on both a short- and long-term basis)  
and delivered in the form of Atkins shares
•	 growth in EPS is a key metric for measuring the performance of our business and should be balanced with a focus on long-term 
share price growth and delivery of our strategy.

increases across the Group. 
Increases above this level may be 
made in specific situations, such 
as progression and development 
in the role, material changes to 
the business, remit or 
responsibilities and internal 
promotion. In any event, any 
increase in salary to a current 
executive director will not exceed 
the competitive market range.
In the event of the promotion  
of an existing executive director, 
for example the finance director 
becoming chief executive, the 
salary increase of the relevant 
executive director will not exceed 
the salary of the outgoing 
director holding that office.
The maximum Company 
contribution is up to 25% of  
base salary. 
The Committee may change the 
directors’ pension arrangements 
in response to new legislation or

Executive Bonus Scheme (EBS) Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) 
Purpose and link 
to our strategy 
To incentivise and reward the delivery of stretching annual 
financial performance targets and key strategic objectives.
To incentivise and reward the creation of long-term 
shareholder value based on the delivery of growth in 
earnings per share (EPS).
Operation A bonus scheme which operates annually. Two thirds of the 
bonus is paid in cash and one third is deferred into shares 
over three years subject to continued employment. The 
deferral into shares is usually structured as a nil-cost share 
option. Following vesting, the option can be exercised at 
the discretion of the participant up to the tenth anniversary 
of grant.
Dividend equivalents accrue on the deferred shares and are 
payable in cash following the vesting and exercise of the 
nil-cost share option.
Annual bonuses do not form part of pensionable earnings 
and are non-contractual.
Measures and performance targets are set by the 
Committee at the beginning of each financial year with 
payout determined after year end following the 
Committee’s assessment of performance relative to targets 
and objectives.
The Committee may reduce the amounts paid if there has 
been a material quality, safety or environmental failure.
The shares are subject to malus provisions which allow the 
Committee to reduce the award in certain circumstances 
set out in the notes to the policy table.
An award is made on an annual basis with vesting 
conditional upon performance and continued employment 
over a three-year period. Awards are typically structured  
as nil-cost options. Following vesting, the options can be 
exercised at the discretion of the participant up to the  
tenth anniversary of grant.
Dividend equivalents accrue on the deferred shares and  
are payable in cash following the vesting and exercise  
of the nil-cost share option.
The shares are subject to malus provisions which allow the 
Committee to reduce the award in certain circumstances 
set out in the notes to the policy table.
Maximum 
opportunity
The current maximum annual bonus opportunity is 125% 
of base salary for the chief executive officer and 100%  
of salary for other executive directors. Base salary is the 
average salary paid to the executive director for the  
bonus year.
The Committee has the discretion to increase the overall 
maximum bonus level to 150% of salary for the chief 
executive and 125% for other executive directors, subject 
to this not being above the competitive market range.  
The Committee would consult with the Company’s major 
shareholders in advance of any increase in maximum bonus.
The maximum annual award limit is 150% of salary.  
It is not normally expected that awards will exceed 100%  
of salary.
In any year that an LGU award is made, awards will be 
capped at 75% of base salary.
Performance 
framework
Annual bonus will normally be subject to Group financial 
targets (75% of total bonus) and individual or non-financial 
strategic objectives (25% of total bonus).
Individual objectives will be directly linked to strategic 
priorities which may be functional or operational. 
Assessment, where not quantifiable, is based on judgement 
and is subject to a rigorous review by the Committee, both 
at the time objectives are set, during the financial year and 
at the year end when final performance is assessed. Any 
amounts due on this component are also subject to 
achieving a threshold Group financial target.
In assessing the formulaic outcomes of targets, the 
Committee can make adjustments to ensure that any 
resulting payment is fair to both the executive director  
and investors, including the ability to make no payment if 
deemed appropriate.
Vesting is subject to a stretching growth target in absolute 
EPS. This is considered the primary metric for measuring  
the delivery of our growth objective over the medium and 
long-term. 
In determining the level of vesting, the Committee will give 
consideration to: (1) cash conversion over the performance 
period to ensure that the achieved EPS growth has been 
suitably underpinned by cash generation; (2) the impact of 
any significant acquisitions in the performance period; (3) 
the impact of inflation during the performance period if it is 
deemed that this has had a significant impact on the level  
of challenge presented by the targets. In considering these 
factors the Committee may reduce the level of vesting.

Long-term Growth Unit plan (LGU) All-employee share plans
Purpose and link 
to our strategy 
To provide direct alignment with shareholders’ interests 
through sustained share price growth over the long-term 
(four to six years) and delivery against strategy.
To encourage share ownership across the organisation.
Operation An award of units is made on an annual basis.
The award vests in three equal tranches on the fourth, fifth 
and sixth anniversaries of grant. Following vesting, the units 
can be exercised at the discretion of the participant up to 
the tenth anniversary of grant. 
On exercise, the value of each unit is equal to the difference 
between the six-month average share price at exercise and 
the six-month average share price at grant. The value is 
normally delivered in the form of Atkins shares.
No more than 50% of any award can be exercised in any 
rolling 12-month period.
There is no entitlement to dividends or dividend 
equivalents.
The shares are subject to malus provisions which allow the 
Committee to reduce the award in certain circumstances 
set out in the notes to the policy table.
Executive directors can participate in the Share Incentive 
Plan (SIP) and a Save As You Earn Plan (SAYE) (or equivalent 
global plans) to the extent that such plans are operated.
Maximum 
opportunity
The maximum annual award limit is 50% of salary. Executive directors will be subject to the same maximums  
in place for all employees participating in the relevant plan 
or plans.
Performance 
framework
Value will only be delivered if the Company’s share price 
increases.
The vesting of each tranche is subject to the Committee’s 
assessment of the Group’s progress against its strategy. 
Types of areas that would be assessed include margin 
progression, the geographical split of revenues and  
growth. The Committee will also determine that share  
price performance has been suitably underpinned by the 
underlying financial performance of the Group over  
the period.

Additional notes to the future policy table
Malus provisions under incentive arrangements
Deferred shares awarded in connection with the EBS and LTIP and LGU awards are subject to malus provisions which allow the 
Committee to reduce awards in certain circumstances, including (but not limited to):
•	a material misstatement of the Company’s audited results
•	a material downturn in the financial performance of the Company
•	a material failure of risk management by the Company
•	serious reputational damage suffered by the Company 
•	the executive director’s misconduct.
Legacy arrangements under incentive plans
Any awards made under legacy incentive plans prior to the approval of the Company’s remuneration policy may be paid out  
subject to the terms of those plans (as originally applied at grant or subsequently amended) and the relevant performance conditions 
being achieved. 
LTIP and LGU awards made in the financial years ended 31 March 2012 and 31 March 2013 were consistent with the policy  
outlined in the future policy table.
Administrative powers under incentive plans
The policy table provides a summary of the incentive plans in the form required by the Regulations. In addition to the operational 
features described, the Committee retains standard administrative powers such as inviting individuals to participate and determining 
the structure of an award and deciding whether or not to apply malus provision. These powers, as set out in the rules of the plans, 
will continue to apply. 88 Governance

Directors’ Remuneration Policy
Selection of performance measures and target setting
The Committee has the flexibility to select performance measures and weightings and set targets annually to ensure continuing 
alignment with the strategic priorities of the Group. Any significant departure from the current operation of the policy as set out in 
the Annual Remuneration Report would be discussed in advance with our major shareholders.
In selecting performance measures the Committee takes into account the Group’s strategic objectives and short- and long-term 
business priorities. The performance measures selected incentivise and reward the delivery of stretching financial performance and 
the creation of shareholder value.
The performance targets chosen are set in accordance with the Group’s operating plan and are reviewed annually to ensure they  
are sufficiently stretching. In selecting the targets the Committee also takes into account analysts’ forecasts, economic conditions  
and the Committee’s expectation of performance over the relevant period. Targets and actual performance in relation to them  
will be disclosed in the annual remuneration report provided that the Committee determines that the information is not considered 
commercially sensitive. In practice it is anticipated that EBS targets will remain commercially sensitive and so a full description of actual 
performance and the committee’s performance assessment will be disclosed only at such time as the Committee considers they are 
no longer commercially sensitive. LTIP targets will be disclosed in the remuneration report prior to grant if determined at that time or, 
if not, in the first report following grant. For LGU awards, a full explanation will be provided on vesting of the performance 
assessment in the context of the Group’s strategic priorities over the period.
Remuneration policy for the broader employee population
The executive remuneration framework set out in this report follows similar principles to those applied to the Group’s senior 
leadership team (SLT) to ensure the senior management team is rewarded on a consistent basis. Any differences that exist arise either 
because of local market practice and/or the Committee’s assessment of business need and commercial necessity. The principles that 
underpin our executive remuneration philosophy also cascade throughout the organisation, although quantum will vary and the 
provision of certain components of remuneration (such as benefits, allowances and long-term incentives) will vary by seniority and 
geography. Viewpoint, the Group’s annual employee staff engagement survey, seeks employee feedback on remuneration. 
C. Illustration of the sensitivity of the remuneration package to performance
The following charts illustrate the packages for the chief executive officer, Group finance director and Group HR director, 
distinguishing the elements of the package that are performance-related. Three indicative levels of performance are shown: 
‘minimum’, ‘target’ and ‘stretch’ – taking into account an assumed level of vesting, as outlined in table 2.
Table 2: Minimum, target and stretch
Performance level Definition
Minimum Fixed pay comprising salary, benefits and pension. No annual bonus or vesting of  
long-term incentives.
Target Fixed pay comprising salary, benefits and pension. Annual bonus payable at 50% of maximum award 
(i.e. 62.5% of salary for the chief executive officer and 50% of salary for other executive directors). 
50% of LTIP award vests (i.e. 37.5% of salary at grant) and 50% of LGU vests, assuming  
it is worth 33% of the face value on vesting (i.e. 8.3% of salary at grant). 
Stretch Fixed pay comprising base salary, benefits and pension. Annual bonus payable at maximum level.  
LTIP and LGU payable in full, assuming the LGU is worth 33% of face value on vesting (i.e. 16.7%  
of salary at grant).
Salary and pension are based on levels to be implemented in the financial year ending 31 March 2015; benefits are based on the 
actual value level delivered in the year ended 31 March 2014. Given the value of the LGU is dependent on share price growth, it has 
been valued in a manner consistent with the guidance issued by the GC100 and the Financial Reporting Lab, namely assuming shares  
are worth 33% of their initial face value. Dividend equivalents have been excluded. Governance 89

The Company’s shareholding guidelines seek to strengthen further the alignment of the executive directors with shareholders. 
Executive directors are expected to build up a significant interest in the Company’s shares equivalent to one times their individual 
salaries, based on the value of such shares at the time of their acquisition or their current market value, whichever is the higher. 
Shares that count towards this guideline include those held by the executive director’s spouse and/or dependent children plus any 
vested shares awarded under a Company share plan. 
Our share ownership guidelines were adopted on 1 April 2012. Executive directors are expected to meet the guideline within  
a five-year period from 1 April 2012 or, if later, the date of their appointment to the Board. The Committee may vary the length  
of the periods within which the shareholding may be acquired.
Recruitment and appointment of executive directors 
The Committee determines the remuneration package for all new executive directors appointed to the Board. Such appointees  
may be individuals who are already employed by the Group or from elsewhere.
In determining the appropriate remuneration package for a new executive director the Committee will consider the calibre of the 
candidate, the level of their existing remuneration, the jurisdiction the candidate is recruited from and their skills and experience,  
data for companies of a similar size and complexity and contextual information regarding remuneration paid to employees elsewhere 
in the Group. 
The remuneration of a new executive director will include all elements set out in the policy table (table 1), namely salary, benefits, 
pension, participation in the EBS and long-term incentive awards under the LTIP and LGU. Depending on the level of salary set on 
appointment, the Committee may make larger initial increases to move salary to the desired level during the first three years following 
appointment. The maximum opportunity levels in relation to other elements of remuneration outlined in the policy table (table 1)  
will apply. 
Depending on the timing and circumstances of the appointment, the Committee may vary the weighting of objectives under the  
EBS in the first year that the individual serves on the Board.
For an external appointment the offer may include compensation for the forfeiture of awards from a previous employer. In assessing the 
level of such a ‘buyout’ award, the Committee will take into account the type of incentive scheme, performance targets (and whether 
they are likely to be achieved) and the performance period of the forfeited award. In so doing the Committee will seek to ensure up to 
equivalence in value. To the extent that the Committee determines that it is appropriate, such awards will be share-based with vesting 
subject to appropriate performance targets. The Committee reserves the right to rely on exemption 9.4.2 of the Listing Rules to enable  
a buyout award to be made. In such circumstances any arrangement put in place will only compensate for remuneration lost and will 
take the form of performance-related variable remuneration. For internal promotions, the Committee reserves the right to satisfy 
pre-existing executive incentive awards and other obligations which may be in place at the time of appointment.

Directors’ Remuneration Policy
Relocation of executive directors and expatriate assistance 
In circumstances where an executive is employed on an international assignment, their arrangements will be managed in a way that  
is consistent with other internationally mobile employees across the Group. International assignment remuneration may incorporate 
tax equalisation so that, whilst on assignment, the executive director will not have to pay any more tax than they would have paid 
had they remained in their home location. It is also likely to include additional allowances to reflect any cost of living and lifestyle 
differences between the assignee’s home and assignment locations and support to fund accommodation and schooling (if the 
executive has dependants of school age).

Copies of each director’s service agreement will be available for inspection prior to and during the AGM and are also available  
for inspection at the Company’s registered office during normal business hours.
In setting its policy on notice periods, the Company takes into account market practice and the need to attract and retain the 
best talent. 
In line with current market practice, the executive directors have rolling service contracts which are terminable on giving 12 months’ 
notice. On the recruitment of an executive director who previously had a longer notice period (commonly seen outside the UK),  
the Committee reserves the right to mirror the notice period with it reducing on a rolling basis to 12 months within two years  
of appointment.
No service agreement provides for predetermined amounts of compensation in the event of early termination of service contracts  
or a change in control.
The Committee retains its discretion to make a payment in lieu of notice which will be limited to one year’s base salary, benefits  
and pension. The Committee also retains its discretion to make phased payments. The service agreements include a duty for the 
executive director to mitigate loss and any payment in lieu of notice may be reduced to take account of such mitigation (for example 
if alternative employment is taken up). There is no contractual obligation to pay annual bonus. Depending on the circumstances,  
the Committee has the discretion to make a pro rata bonus payment, linked to the original performance conditions and delivered 
entirely in cash.  Governance 91

and (ii) settlement or compromise of any claim arising in connection with the termination of a director’s office or employment. 
Payment of the leaver’s reasonable legal fees will also be permissible.
External directorships
The Board and the Committee recognise the benefit we can obtain if our executive directors serve as non-executive directors of other 
companies. Subject to review in each case, the Board’s general policy is that each executive director may accept one non-executive 
directorship with another FTSE 350 company from which any fees received may be retained. The Board also encourages executive 
directors to undertake pro bono appointments with charitable or professional organisations to aid their personal development and 
further enhance the profile of the Company.

Table 5: Remuneration policy for the Company’s chairman and non-executive directors
Component of 
remuneration
Fixed fees
Purpose and link  
to strategy
To attract and retain high-calibre individuals by offering market-competitive fixed fees commensurate 
with time commitment and responsibilities.
Operation Fees
All fees are paid in cash in arrears.
The chairman is paid a basic fee. The non-executive directors are paid a basic fee and, if applicable, 
additional fees for chairmanship and membership of the Audit and Remuneration Committees.  
An additional fee is also paid to the director who serves as the senior independent director.
Reviewed annually by the executive directors with any changes effective from 1 April. A review  
does not automatically give rise to an increase in fees.
Benchmarked periodically against published fee data for companies of similar size and complexity  
and bespoke comparator groups as appropriate to ensure that fees remain market-competitive.
Considered in light of economic climate, market conditions, Company performance, pay and 
conditions across the wider workforce, the non-executive director role, remit and the level of  
salary increases made in the rest of the business.
No recovery provisions apply to fees.
Expenses
Fees for the chairman are currently inclusive of normal travel expenses for travelling to and from the 
Group’s London office. However, the Committee may pay such expenses in the future. Expenses  
are payable on all travel and subsistence payments to the non-executive directors and are grossed  
up where such expenses are deemed to be a taxable benefit by HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC). 
The Company may also meet the cost of compliance with HMRC’s individual reporting requirements 
where the director is not resident in the UK. The chairman and non-executive directors are not 
eligible for a pension, share incentives, annual bonus or any similar payments other than out-of-
pocket expenses in connection with the performance of their duties.
Opportunity Fee increases for non-executive directors will normally not exceed the average salary increases  
across the Group. Increases above this level may be made in specific situations, such as significant 
additional time commitment from non-executive directors in exceptional or unforeseen 
circumstances. The details and reasoning behind such an exceptional increase will be disclosed  
in the Annual Remuneration Report.
In aggregate, total fees (basic fees plus additional fees) paid to the chairman and non-executive 
directors shall not exceed £600,000 per annum as set out in the Company’s articles of association  
(as amended with shareholder approval from time to time).
Performance When determining fee increases the performance and time commitment of the non-executive 
directors is considered.
Letters of appointment
The chairman and non-executive directors have letters of appointment stating their annual fee. Their appointment is for an initial  
term of three years subject to satisfactory performance and their re-election at forthcoming AGMs. Their appointment may be 
terminated with six months’ written notice at any time. There are no entitlements in respect of loss of office. All directors are subject 
to re-election at the Company’s AGM. Governance 93

Copies of letters of appointment of the chairman and non-executive directors will be available for inspection prior to and during  
the AGM and are also available for inspection at the Company’s registered office during normal business hours. 
Recruitment of chairman and non-executive directors
When recruiting a chairman, fees will be set taking into account the calibre of the candidate, the level of existing remuneration,  
the jurisdiction the candidate is recruited from and the individual’s skill and experience. Any new non-executive directors will be  
paid in accordance with fee levels in place at the time of their appointment. 
 
F. Matters considered when determining remuneration policy for directors
Remuneration in the context of the wider Group
The Committee does not consult formally with employees regarding executive remuneration but regularly reviews the remuneration 
of employees throughout the Group to ensure that it is attuned to general pay and conditions when considering the remuneration 
of executive directors. For example, in determining salary increases for the executive directors, the Committee looks at salary increases 
across the Group. 
As a people business our reward and incentive structures are critical to the success of our business. Participation in the success  
of the Group, both through bonus arrangements and, for the SLT, through long-term share-based awards, is a cornerstone of  
our remuneration framework. The Committee also recognises the importance of having reward structures that create a sense  
of ownership and participation in the long-term growth of our shares. All UK employees are eligible to participate in the SIP and,  
at the 2013 AGM, we obtained approval for new all-employee share plans in the UK, the US and other major jurisdictions in  
which the Group operates. 
As many of the Company’s UK-based employees are shareholders through the SIP they, like other shareholders, are able to express 
their views on directors’ remuneration at each general meeting via voting on the remuneration resolutions.
Consideration of shareholder views in developing policy
The Committee regularly consults with shareholders on matters relating to executive remuneration. When significant changes are 
planned to remuneration, the Committee seeks feedback from investors and develops and considers its proposals in light of this 
feedback.
For example, in determining the new remuneration framework established in 2012/13 the Committee consulted extensively with 
shareholders. This highlighted the importance of incorporating a cash flow measure in the annual bonus scheme, as this is a key 
indicator by which the Company and its shareholders measure the performance of the business. In response, a cash conversion target 
was incorporated in the annual bonus for the executive directors and other senior management from 2013. During 2013 we have 
engaged with Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) to understand better its concerns with respect to the LGU as expressed in its 
proxy voting report. These concerns related largely to transparent disclosure of the performance metrics that are taken into account 
when determining vesting. In response, the Annual Remuneration Report provides more explicit detail of the criteria by which the 
Committee will assess progress against strategy for the awards made in 2013 and, in future years, will give a full explanation of the 
Committee’s decision on whether or not the awards have vested during the year being reported on. 
More generally, in developing the policy disclosed in this report we have considered the views of our majority shareholders based  
on published guidance and direct feedback from prior conversations.  94 Governance

Implementation of remuneration policy: executive directors
Salary
The salary of each of the executive directors increased with effect from 1 April 2013 as set out in table 12 (below) in accordance  
with the disclosed policy (page 85). Uwe Krueger’s and Alun Griffiths’ salaries increased by 3% and 3.5% respectively, in line with 
the average salary increase across the Group of just above 3%. 
As disclosed in the 2013 remuneration report, Heath Drewett received a salary increase of 7.4%. This increase, which was above  
the average salary increase across the Group, reflected the expanded remit of his role, which encompassed several areas traditionally 
carried out by a chief operating officer, delivery of operational improvement programmes and increased involvement in the 
development of strategy.

The maximum Company contribution to the defined contribution pension of other UK-based staff is 10% of salary, except for those 
affected by the removal of the link to final salary, as discussed further below. Heath Drewett and Uwe Krueger receive higher 
contributions reflecting their roles as executive directors.
Alun Griffiths retains an entitlement to a defined benefit pension on the same basis as other long-serving UK employees. During 2011 
a consultation was held with staff with a defined benefit pension entitlement to remove the link to final salary via an amendment  
to their contracts of employment. From 1 February 2012 this final salary link was removed and transitional relief is being paid to all 
employees (including Alun Griffiths) affected by the contractual change. The transitional relief is 2% of salary until 2015 and a further 
3% from 2015 to 2018. This is in addition to the maximum Company contribution of 10% of salary.

Annual bonus: 2013/14 performance against targets (audited)
The Committee’s assessment of performance in the financial year ended 31 March 2014 is shown in table 15.
Table 15: Assessment of performance and bonus payout
Component Overview of performance
Group profit after tax 
(50%)
The Group has delivered another set of good results in an international market that continues 
to experience a range of operating challenges. 
The reported profit after tax was £96.3m (2013 restated: £84.3m). The Committee adjusted actual 
performance downwards to remove the impact of significant one-off items to ensure that payment 
reflected underlying performance. The adjusted profit after tax result was £86.2m (2013 restated: 
£81.0m), exceeding the stretch target of £83.4m for the year (2013 restated: £80.9m). This resulted  
in full payment of this component of bonus. The Committee considered quality, safety and 
environmental performance when making the bonus awards and determined that no adjustment  
was necessary.
Cash conversion  
(25%)
The cash conversion target measured operating cash flow as a percentage of budgeted profit. 
The Group’s cash performance was good, with operating cash flow increasing to £95.5m  
(2013: £82.9m). 
The half year and full year stretch cash conversion targets were 40% and 85% respectively. The  
half year cash conversion result was 43% and the full year result was 85% leading to full payment  
for this component of the bonus.
Personal objectives 
(25%)
Heath Drewett
Payment of 95% achieved for:
•	 the successful conclusion of repayment plan negotiations with the trustee of the Atkins Pension 
Plan following the conclusion of the 2013 triennial valuation
•	 successfully driving improvements to operational and financial performance with specific  
reference to project performance
•	implementing changes to improve the budget structure and associated processes.
Alun Griffiths 
Payment of 100% achieved for:
•	 successfully strengthening regional management teams and developing a more robust talent 
pipeline
•	 progress in embedding the Group’s leadership capability model in development, assessment, 
promotion and succession processes
•	internationalisation of the Group’s recruitment process to provide access to a broader talent pool.

•	successfully implementing robust internal succession initiatives.
Annual bonuses payable to the executive directors for the financial year ended 31 March 2014 are shown in table 16. Two thirds  
will be payable in cash and one third will be deferred into shares for three years subject to continued employment.

Annual bonus: 2014/15 performance targets
The Committee has determined that the bonus for the year ending 31 March 2015 will be operated on similar terms to 2013/14.  
50% of the bonus will be based on Group profit after tax performance. 50% of the maximum will be paid for meeting the budgeted 
profit after tax target and 100% for meeting a stretch target. 25% of the bonus will be based on a cash conversion measure. The 
profit after tax and cash conversion targets are considered commercially sensitive so will not be disclosed, although the Committee’s 
assessment of performance against these targets will be confirmed in next year’s report. The remaining 25% will be based on 
individual objectives aligned to key strategic areas for each executive director.
Table 17 provides the headline strategic areas under which performance targets have been set. The performance targets which apply 
to these areas are measurable, challenging and subject to rigorous review by the Committee, both at the time they are set, during  
the year and at the year end when performance is assessed. Subject to commercial sensitivity, we intend to provide an overview of 
the Committee’s assessment of performance against the underlying targets in next year’s report.

LTIP outcomes in 2013/14 (audited)
The long-term incentive values shown in the single total remuneration figure table (table 10) relate to LTIP awards granted in 2011 
and for which the performance period ended on 31 March 2014. The performance targets and vesting levels are set out in table 18.
50% of the award was subject to a TSR condition. This performance measure has been met in full. The remaining 50% was subject 
to an EPS condition. In order to ensure that the performance of this element was determined on a consistent basis with the calculation 
of EPS at award, the Committee adjusted for the impact of the material IAS 19 accounting change introduced during the final year  
of the performance period. This adjustment resulted in an increase from the reported EPS of 88.1p to an adjusted EPS of 95.3p. 
Accordingly, 37.4% of the shares subject to this element of the award will vest.

LTIP and LGU awards in 2013/14
The long-term incentive framework is built around two performance measures, both of which are simple in design and fundamentally 
aligned to the creation of shareholder value, as illustrated in figure 4:
•	 Growth in EPS. The primary metric for measuring the delivery of our growth objective over the medium to long-term. It is 
incorporated into the long-term incentive framework via the LTIP, which is our primary long-term incentive vehicle, reflecting the 
importance of EPS growth to our strategy
•	 Sustained growth in the share price. This ensures alignment between executive reward and sustained share price growth over 
the long-term, representing the ultimate measure of performance for our shareholders, and is incorporated into the long-term 
incentive framework via the LGU.
Figure 4: Long-term incentive framework
Performance measure EPS Share price growth
Delivery mechanism LTIP LGU
Vesting period 3 years 4, 5 and 6 years
Executive directors received a LTIP award of 75% of salary. The vesting of these awards is subject to the EPS targets described  
in table 19.

The Committee believes that these EPS targets are appropriate and stretching in the current environment. Performance against  
these targets will be measured from 1 April 2013 to 31 March 2016. 
Executive directors also received a LGU award of 50% of salary. The vesting of each tranche of this award is subject to the 
Committee’s assessment of the Group’s progress against its strategy. This will include:
•	driving margins over the longer term above 8%
•	reducing dependence on the UK (with our long-term aspiration being to have more than 75% of our business outside the UK)
•	growing organically and through acquisition.

LTIP and LGU awards to be made in 2014/15
The Committee intends to make LTIP and LGU awards to Uwe Krueger and Heath Drewett on the same basis as the awards made

Executive director changes in 2014/15
James Cullens was appointed to succeed Alun Griffiths as Group HR director. As previously announced, James will join the Board  
as an executive director on 1 July 2014 and Alun will retire at the AGM on 30 July 2014.
James has been appointed with a salary of £270,000 per annum, a pension allowance of 25% of salary and a maximum bonus 
opportunity of 100% of salary, of which one-third will be deferred into shares for a period of three years. He will also be eligible to 
receive LTIP and LGU awards and other benefits at the levels contained within the future policy table (table 1). James’s appointment 
followed an extensive search process and his salary and package is within the competitive market range.
The following arrangement will apply to Alun as a consequence of his retirement following 28 years of service to the Group:
•	his bonus for the financial year ended 31 March 2014, due in July 2014 as detailed in table 16, will be paid entirely in cash
•	 any bonus due for the financial year ending 31 March 2015 will be paid in July 2015 in cash to the extent to which the relevant 
performance conditions have been met
•	 deferred share awards made under the terms of the DSP will vest on 30 July 2014 and be exercisable within six months of  
his retirement
•	 outstanding awards made under the Company’s LTIP and LGU plans (contained in tables 23 and 24) vest in accordance with the 
rules of the relevant plans subject to meeting the requirements of the applicable performance conditions; awards will be time 
pro-rated as specified in the relevant plan rules.
Alun will continue to work with the Group on a consultancy basis for the next 12 months. This will cover a number of areas including 
advice and support in relation to management development and client relationships. It is anticipated that he will be engaged for 
around 30 days during this period.

of 3.96% with effect from 1 April 2014 (2013: just above 3%).
Payments to past directors (not subject to audit)
Lord Boyce retired from the Board on 31 July 2013. He has continued to provide consultancy services to the Group, chairing the 
Group’s international advisory Board. 
Keith Clarke, who retired from the Board on 31 July 2011, retained a pro-rated entitlement to 16,309 shares granted under the  
terms of the Atkins Long-Term Incentive Plan. In accordance with the rules of this plan, 68.7% of his retained award will vest  
on 20 June 2014 and be exercisable within six months. 102 Governance

Statement of directors’ shareholdings and share interests (audited)
Share ownership guidelines
Executive directors are ordinarily expected to build up an interest in the Company’s shares equivalent to one times their salary,  
based on the value of such shares at the time of the acquisition or their current market value, whichever is the higher. 
The interests of the directors and their families in the ordinary shares of 0.5p each in the Company as at 31 March 2014 are shown  
in tables 22 and 23 (below). As the shareholding guideline only came into effect on 1 April 2012 and allows five years to build up  
an interest, it is not yet possible to determine whether or not it has been met, although it can be seen that all executive directors  
have increased their shareholdings during the year.
There are no shareholding requirements for the chairman or the non-executive directors.

rise to a one-off, non-cash pre-tax credit of £25m in the Group’s income statement for the year. It concluded that the non-trading nature of this benefit was not  
a fair reflection of underlying earnings. It was therefore excluded and the lower normalised basic EPS for the year ended 31 March 2010 of 79.4p was used to calculate 
the vesting of LTIP awards made in 2007 and was also used as the EPS for the financial year immediately before the commencement of the performance period for  
the 2010 awards.        104 Governance

Other Information
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is a committee of the Board. Its terms of reference are available on the Company’s website  
www.atkinsglobal.com or on request from the company secretary. The Committee has responsibility for setting remuneration policy 
and structure for the Company’s chairman and executive directors. The Committee also has oversight of remuneration practices 
across the Group. A summary of the Committee’s activities during the year is shown in figure 1 (page 82).
Committee membership
The independent non-executive directors who served on the Committee during the year are shown in table 26.

The Committee met eight times during the year (2013: six). Details of the attendance of members at meetings can be found in the 
Corporate Governance Report (page 69). 
Committee meetings are attended by the Group HR director, Alun Griffiths. The chairman of the Board and the chief executive officer 
also attend meetings at the discretion of the Committee chairman. The company secretary acts as secretary to the Committee.  
No director or other attendee, including the company secretary, participates in discussions regarding their own remuneration.
Advisors to the Committee
During the year the Committee undertook a comprehensive tender process for the provision of advisory services. As a result of this 
process, the Committee appointed Towers Watson Limited (Towers) as the provider of advice on remuneration policy and structure, 
replacing Deloitte LLP (Deloitte). Towers is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group (RCG) and adheres to its code of 
conduct. Table 26 provides a summary of advice received from each advisor to the Committee, fees paid and any other services 
provided by the advisor to the Group. The Committee is satisfied that the advice it has received has been objective and independent.
The Committee also consulted the chairman of the Board, the chief executive officer, the Group HR director and the company 
secretary regarding remuneration policy. Governance 105

Dilution
DSP share awards can only be satisfied using market purchase shares held in the employee benefit trust (EBT). LTIP and LGU share 
awards can be satisfied using new issue shares, shares held in treasury or market purchase shares held in the EBT. The Committee 
reviews the hedging and dilution position of the Company at least bi-annually prior to making grants of share awards. Both the  
LTIP and LGU operate 5% in 10 years (executive schemes) and 10% in 10 years aggregate dilution limits, in line with best practice.  
At 31 March 2014 the EBT held 2,524,663 shares to hedge outstanding awards over 3,925,406 shares and 361,169 units. Using an 
approximation of one unit to one share, at this date the EBT held shares to satisfy 64% of all outstanding awards. No new issue 
shares have been used to satisfy share awards since 2005 and, to date, no treasury shares have been used.

WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2014
Independent Auditor’s Report
to the members of WS Atkins plc
Report on the financial statements
Our opinion
In our opinion:
•	 the financial statements, defined below, give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Company’s affairs  
as at 31 March 2014 and of the Group’s profit and of the Group’s and Company’s cash flows for the year then ended
•	 the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) 
as adopted by the European Union
•	 the Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and  
as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 (the Act)
•	 the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Act and, as regards the Group financial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
This opinion is to be read in the context of what we say in the remainder of this report.
What we have audited
The Group financial statements and Company financial statements (the Financial Statements), which are prepared by WS Atkins plc, 
comprise:
•	the consolidated income statement and statement of comprehensive income for the year then ended
•	the consolidated and Parent Company balance sheets as at 31 March 2014
•	the consolidated and Parent Company statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended
•	 the notes to the Financial Statements, which include a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory 
information.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation comprises applicable law and IFRSs as adopted  
by the European Union and, as regards the Company, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Act.
Certain disclosures required by the financial reporting framework have been presented elsewhere in the Annual Report, rather than  
in the notes to the Financial Statements. These are cross-referenced from the Financial Statements and are identified as audited.
What an audit of financial statements involves
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (ISAs (UK & Ireland)). An audit 
involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the Financial Statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance 
that the Financial Statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of:
•	 whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed
•	the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors
•	the overall presentation of the Financial Statements.
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies  
with the audited Financial Statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Overview of our audit approach
Materiality
We set certain thresholds for materiality. These helped us to determine the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and  
to evaluate the effect of misstatements, both individually and on the Financial Statements as a whole.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the Group Financial Statements as a whole to be £5.3m,  
which is approximately 5% of profit before tax, adjusted for exceptional items because in our view this represents the Group’s 
underlying performance.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £0.5m  
as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons. Governance 107 
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2014
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Corporate Information
Independent Auditor’s Report
to the members of WS Atkins plc continued
Overview of the scope of our audit
The Group reports its operating results and financial position in five segments, being United Kingdom and Europe, North America, 
Middle East, Asia Pacific and Energy. The Group Financial Statements are a consolidation of the Group’s operating businesses and 
centralised functions.
In establishing the overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be performed by us, as the 
Group engagement team, or component auditors from other PwC network firms operating under our instruction. Where the work 
was performed by component auditors, we determined the level of involvement we needed to have in their audit work to be able  
to conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the Group Financial 
Statements as a whole.
Accordingly, the Group’s operating businesses subject to an audit of their complete financial information contributed 90% of the 
Group’s profit before tax adjusted for exceptional items.
This, together with additional procedures performed at the Group level (e.g. goodwill impairment testing), gave us the evidence  
we needed for our opinion on the Group Financial Statements as a whole.
Areas of particular audit focus
In preparing the Financial Statements, the directors made a number of subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant 
accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. We primarily 
focused our work in these areas by assessing the directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming our own judgements  
and evaluating the disclosures in the Financial Statements.
In our audit, we tested and examined information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we considered 
necessary to provide a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtained audit evidence through testing the effectiveness  
of controls, substantive procedures or a combination of both.
We considered the following areas to be those that required particular focus in the current year. This is not a complete list of all risks 
or areas of focus identified by our audit. We discussed these areas of focus with the Audit Committee. Its report on those matters 
that it considered to be significant issues in relation to the Financial Statements is set out in the Audit Committee Report (page 78).
Area of focus How the scope of our audit addressed the area of focus
Timing and fraud in contract 
revenue recognition
We focused on this area because the 
Group has entered into a number of 
large and complex long-term fixed  
price contracts. Revenue and profit 
recognition is determined based on the 
directors’ estimate of how complete  
the contracts are and the costs that  
will need to be incurred by the Group  
to complete them.
Further, ISAs (UK & Ireland) presume 
that there is a risk of fraud in revenue 
recognition because of the pressure 
management may feel to achieve the 
planned results.
We evaluated the relevant IT systems and tested the internal controls over the 
completeness, accuracy and timing of revenue recognised in the financial statements.
We attended a number of contract review meetings with senior management to 
understand and challenge how it determined that forecasts were up to date and how 
poor performing contracts are identified and investigated.
We tested, for a sample of contracts, management’s monthly monitoring of the total 
forecast revenue for the contract, costs expected to be incurred in its completion, 
 the profit recognised to date and the working capital position on the contract.
We challenged senior management’s judgements on the completeness of work for  
a sample of contracts by testing that contractual milestones had been reached and 
reading and considering the implications of correspondence with customers (both 
acceptance of work done and relating to disputes).
We tested the forecast costs to complete the contracts by obtaining an understanding 
from senior management as to how they had estimated these costs, challenging the 
assumptions underpinning those estimates, evaluating the outturn of previous estimates 
and agreeing the actual costs incurred post-year end to the forecast costs for that period. 108 Governance
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2014
Independent Auditor’s Report
to the members of WS Atkins plc continued
Area of focus How the scope of our audit addressed the area of focus
Goodwill impairment assessment 
We focused on this area because the 
determination of whether or not an 
impairment charge for goodwill was 
necessary involved significant 
judgements about the future results of 
the North American business because 
this part of the business accounted for 
£166m of the total goodwill and has  
the closest headroom.
The directors booked no impairment 
charge.
(Refer also to note 16 to the Financial 
Statements (page 148)).
We evaluated the directors’ future cash flow forecasts and the process by which they 
were drawn up, including comparing them to the latest Board-approved budgets,  
and testing the underlying calculations. We challenged:
•	 the directors’ key assumptions for profit margins and long-term growth rates in the 
forecasts, by comparing them to historical results and economic and industry forecasts
•	 the discount rate, by assessing the cost of capital for the North America business and 
comparable organisations.
We also performed sensitivity analysis around the key drivers of the cash flow forecasts, 
which were the discount rate and the profit margins. Having ascertained the extent of 
change in those assumptions that either individually or collectively would be required for 
the goodwill to be impaired, we considered the likelihood of such a movement in those 
key assumptions arising.
Risk of management override  
of internal controls
ISAs (UK & Ireland) require that  
we consider this.
We assessed the overall control environment of the Group, including the arrangements 
for staff to ’whistle-blow’ inappropriate actions, and interviewed senior management 
and the Group’s internal audit function.
We examined the significant accounting estimates and judgements relevant to the 
Financial Statements for evidence of bias by the directors that may represent a risk of 
material misstatement due to fraud (including, but not limited to, revenue recognition).
We also tested journal entries to determine the rationale for manual adjustments.
Going concern
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the directors’ statement (page 65) in relation to going concern. We have nothing  
to report having performed our review.
As noted in the directors’ statement, the directors have concluded that it is appropriate to prepare the Group’s and Company’s 
financial statements using the going concern basis of accounting. The going concern basis presumes that the Group and Company 
have adequate resources to remain in operation, and that the directors intend them to do so, for at least one year from the date  
the Financial Statements are signed. As part of our audit we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis  
is appropriate.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the Group’s  
and the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
•	 the information given in the Strategic Report (pages 2 to 59) and the Directors’ Report (pages 62 to 65) for the financial year  
for which the Financial Statements are prepared is consistent with the Financial Statements
•	the part of the Remuneration Report (pages 81 to 105) to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Act
•	 the information given in the Corporate Governance Report (pages 66 to 73) in the Annual Report with respect to internal control  
and risk management systems is consistent with the financial statements.
Other matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of accounting records and information and explanations received
Under the Act we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
•	we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit
•	 adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us
•	 the Company Financial Statements and the part of the Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. Governance 109

Directors’ remuneration
Under the Act we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law  
have not been made. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Corporate governance statement
Under the Act, we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, a corporate governance statement has not been prepared  
by the Company. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the part of the Corporate Governance Report (pages 66 to 73) relating to the 
Company’s compliance with nine provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code). We have nothing to report having 
performed our review.
As required by Provision C.1.1 of the Code, the directors state that they consider the Annual Report taken as a whole to be fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for members to assess the Group’s performance, business 
model and strategy (page 65). As required by Provision C.3.8 of the Code, the Audit Committee has set out the significant issues  
that it considered in relation to the Financial Statements and how they were addressed (page 78). Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we 
are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
•	 the statement given by the directors is materially inconsistent with our knowledge of the Group acquired in the course of 
performing our audit
•	 the section of the Annual Report describing the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately address matters 
communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Other information in the Annual Report
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the Annual Report is:
•	materially inconsistent with the information in the audited Financial Statements
•	 apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group and Company acquired  
in the course of performing our audit
•	otherwise misleading.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ statement of responsibility (pages 64 and 65), the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the Group and Company financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the Group and Company Financial Statements in accordance with applicable 
law and ISAs (UK & Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Act and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility  
for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly 
agreed by our prior consent in writing.

Notes to the Financial Statements
For the year ended 31 March 2014
1. Accounting policies
WS Atkins plc (the Company) is a public limited company, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is incorporated and domiciled  
in England and Wales. The address of its registered office is Woodcote Grove, Ashley Road, Epsom, Surrey, KT18 5BW, England.   
 
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements are set out below. These policies  
have been consistently applied to all the years presented, including the application of new International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) 
and interpretations, unless otherwise stated. 
Basis of preparation 
The Consolidated Financial Statements of WS Atkins plc have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union 
(EU), the Companies Act 2006 that applies to companies reporting under IFRS, and IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) applicable  
to companies reporting under IFRS. The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as 
modified by the revaluation of available-for-sale financial assets, and financial assets and financial liabilities (including derivative instruments) 
at fair value through profit or loss.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires 
management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of 
judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the Consolidated Financial Statements, are disclosed 
under critical accounting policies and are incorporated by reference in the Business Review (page 43).
Changes in accounting policy and disclosure
New and amended standards adopted by the Group
The following standards have been adopted by the Group for the first time for the financial year beginning on 1 April 2013 and have  
a material impact on the Group:
IAS 19, Employee benefits, was revised in June 2011. The changes on the Group’s accounting policies has been as follows: to replace the 
interest cost and expected return on plan assets with a net interest charge on the net defined benefit liability; to recognise immediately  
in the income statement unvested past service cost and administration costs; this also had a small impact on the Group’s defined benefit 
liability. For the comparative year ended 31 March 2013, the restated profit after tax is £4.1m lower and other comprehensive expense is 
£4.5m lower than previously reported. The effect of this resulted in the net defined benefit obligation at 1 April 2012 being restated as 
£262.5m (previously £265.3m); and 31 March 2013 as £295.6m (previously £298.8m), see note 32. Comparative information has been 
restated for the effect of the retrospective application of the amendment to IAS 19 as disclosed in note 44.
The following standards have been adopted by the Group for the first time for the financial year beginning on 1 April 2013 and does not 
have a material impact on the Group:
Amendment to IAS 1, Financial statement presentation regarding other comprehensive income. The main change resulting from this 
amendment is a requirement for entities to group items presented in ‘other comprehensive income’ (OCI) on the basis of whether they are 
potentially reclassifiable to profit or loss subsequently (reclassification adjustments). This amendment has been applied retrospectively and 
the presentation of items of comprehensive income have been reclassified. There has been no measurement impact on the consolidated 
accounts of applying the amendments to IAS 1.
Amendment to IFRS 7, Financial instruments: Disclosures, on asset and liability offsetting. This amendment introduces new disclosures  
of information about the significance of financial instruments to an entity.
IFRS 13, Fair value measurement. The objective of the standard is to define the term “fair value” and to establish guidance and disclosure 
requirements for fair value measurement that should be applied across standards. In the new standard, fair value is defined as the price  
that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between independent market participants 
at the measurement date. For non-financial assets, the fair value is determined based on the highest and best use of the asset as determined 
by a market participant. There has been no measurement impact on the consolidated accounts of applying IFRS 13. 
Annual Improvements 2011. These Annual Improvements address six areas, none of which materially impacted the Group’s primary 
statements.
In addition, following a change in its operational management, the Group has amended its operating segments for reporting purposes to 
reflect the United Kingdom and Europe as one segment; previously Europe had been managed and reported with Asia Pacific. The revised 
segments are: United Kingdom and Europe, North America, Middle East, Asia Pacific and Energy. The segmental results and assets and 
liabilities for the comparative year ended 31 March 2013 have been represented in line with these revised segments.  120 Financial Statements

New standards and interpretations not yet adopted by the Group
The following accounting standards, interpretations and amendments have been issued by the IASB but had either not been adopted  
by the European Union or were not yet effective in the European Union for the financial year beginning 1 April 2013:
•	IFRS 9, Financial Instruments      
•	IFRS 10, Consolidated Financial Statements
•	IFRS 11, Joint Arrangements
•	IFRS 12, Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities
•	IFRS 14, Regulatory deferral accounts
•	IAS 27 (revised 2011), Separate financial statements
•	IAS 28 (revised 2011), Associates and joint ventures  
•	IAS 36, Impairment of Assets on recoverable amount disclosures 
•	Amendments to the following standards:
 – IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27: Investment Entities
 – IFRS 10, IFRS 11 and IFRS 12: Transition Guidance
 – IAS 19, Employee Benefits: Defined Benefit Plans: Employee Contributions
 – IAS 32, Financial Instruments: Presentation
 – IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement 
The Group is currently assessing the impact of the new standards, amendments and interpretations that are not yet effective. The Group 
does not currently believe adoption of these would have a material impact on the consolidated results or financial position of the Group.
Going concern
The directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence 
for the foreseeable future and therefore continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Financial Statements. 
 
Basis of consolidation
The Consolidated Income Statement and Balance Sheet include the accounts of the Company, its subsidiary undertakings and its share of 
joint ventures. The results of the subsidiary undertakings acquired during the year are included in the Consolidated Income Statement from 
the date of acquisition. The results of subsidiary undertakings disposed of during the year are included in the Consolidated Income Statement 
up to the date of disposal.
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is 
exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power 
over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from 
the date that control ceases.
The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less 
impairments. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or 
assumed at the date of exchange. 
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values 
at the acquisition date irrespective of any non-controlling interest. 
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the Group is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the 
fair value of the contingent consideration that is deemed to be an asset or liability is recognised in accordance with IAS 39 either in profit  
or loss or as a change to other comprehensive income. Financial Statements 121 
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2014
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Corporate Information
The excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the cost of the 
acquisition is lower than the fair value of net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement. 
Goodwill is reviewed on finalisation of fair values and any adjustments required to the accounting are recorded within 12 months of the 
acquisition date.
Intercompany transactions, balances, income and expenses on transactions between Group companies are eliminated.
Where subsidiaries adopt accounting policies that are different from the Group’s, their reported results are restated to comply with the 
Group’s accounting policies. Where subsidiaries do not adopt accounting periods that are coterminous with the Group’s, results and net 
assets are based upon unaudited accounts drawn up to the Group’s accounting reference date.
Joint ventures
In accordance with IAS 31, Interests in joint ventures, the Group accounts for joint ventures under the equity method of accounting.  
The Group’s share of a joint venture’s profit after tax is included from the date on which the Group acquires joint control. Within the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet, the investment is recorded at cost (classified as a non-current asset) and subsequently adjusted to reflect  
the Group’s share of the movements in the joint venture’s net assets post acquisition.
The results, assets and liabilities of joint ventures are stated in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies. Where joint ventures adopt 
accounting policies that are different from the Group’s, their reported results are restated to comply with the Group’s accounting policies.
Where joint ventures do not adopt accounting periods that are coterminous with the Group’s, results and net assets are based upon 
unaudited accounts drawn up to the Group’s accounting reference date.
Employee benefit trusts
The accounts of the employee benefit trusts (EBTs) are incorporated into the results of the Group as, although they are administered by 
independent trustees and their assets are held separately from those of the Group, in practice, the Group’s recommendations on how the 
assets are used for the benefit of employees are normally followed. The Group bears the major risks and rewards of the assets held by the 
EBTs until the shares vest unconditionally with the employees. Shares in WS Atkins plc held by the EBTs are shown as a reduction in retained 
earnings. Other assets and liabilities held by the EBTs are consolidated with the assets of the Group. 
Foreign currency transactions and translation
Functional and presentation currency 
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency). The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in pounds sterling 
(£), which is the Company’s and Group’s presentation currency.         
  
Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions 
or valuation where items are remeasured. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the 
translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the Consolidated 
Income Statement, except when deferred in other comprehensive income, for example, as qualifying cash flow hedges.
Group companies
The results and financial position of all Group entities (none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy) that have a functional 
currency different from the Group’s presentation currency are translated into the Group’s presentation currency as follows:
•	assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet 
•	income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates
•	all resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity  
and translated at the closing rate. Exchange differences arising are recognised in other comprehensive income.

Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker (CODM). 
The CODM, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the 
chief executive officer and the Group finance director.
The Group’s operating segments for management purposes reflect predominantly its key geographical markets. As noted above, the 
segments are: United Kingdom and Europe, North America, Middle East, Asia Pacific and Energy. These segments form the basis for 
reporting the Group’s segment information as they are the main determinants of the Group’s risks and returns. The Group considers the  
UK to be its country of domicile. 
Intersegment transfers and transactions are entered into under the normal commercial terms and conditions that would also be available  
to unrelated third parties. 
Revenue
Revenue from long term contracts comprises the value of work performed during the period calculated in accordance with the Group’s 
policy for contract accounting set out below. Revenue from other contract activities represents fee income receivable in respect of services 
provided during the period.
Under certain services contracts, the Group manages customer expenditure and is obliged to purchase goods and services from third party 
contractors and recharge them to the customer at cost. The amounts charged by contractors and recharged to customers are excluded  
from revenue and cost of sales where the Group is acting solely as an agent. Receivables, payables and cash relating to these transactions  
are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Underlying profit
Underlying operating profit is profit before exceptional items, amortisation and impairment of intangible assets recognised on acquisition  
and material transaction costs associated with acquisitions, and relates to continuing operations.
Revenue recognition and contract accounting
The value of contract work in progress comprises the costs incurred on contracts plus an appropriate proportion of overheads and 
attributable profit. Fees invoiced on account are deducted from the value of work in progress and the balance is separately disclosed in  
trade and other receivables as amounts recoverable on contracts, unless such fees exceed the value of the work in progress on any contract 
in which case the excess is separately disclosed in trade and other payables as fees invoiced in advance. 
Revenue is recognised on the majority of the Group’s contracts on a percentage completion basis when the outcome of a contract or project 
can be reasonably foreseen. Under the percentage completion method, the percentage of the total forecast revenue reported at any point  
in time is calculated based upon the proportion of total costs incurred to date as a percentage of total forecast costs or, in some cases, based 
upon the estimated physical per cent complete of the total work to be performed under the contract.
In some cases, a margin provision is then made, depending on how far progressed each project is and the risk profile of the project. Where 
contracts span two or more accounting periods, profit is not generally recognised until the contract is 50% complete. In addition, provision  
is made in full for estimated losses and, where the outcome of a contract cannot be reasonably foreseen, profit is taken on completion.
Revenue recognition on outsourcing contracts is determined by reference to the proportion of the annual service delivered to date. Where 
the costs of obligations in relation to the non-renewal or termination of a contract are higher in the final period of the contract, a proportion 
of revenue is deferred each period to meet these anticipated costs. Full provision is made for losses on outsourcing contracts if the forecast 
costs of fulfilling the contract throughout the contract period exceed the forecast income receivable. In assessing the amount of the loss to 
provide on an outsourcing contract, account is taken of the Group’s share of the forecast results from any joint ventures which the contract  
is servicing.
Interest income 
Interest income is recognised on a time apportionment basis using the effective interest method. When a receivable is impaired, the Group 
reduces the carrying amount to its recoverable amount, being the estimated future cash flow discounted at the original effective interest  
rate of the instrument, and continues unwinding the discount as interest income. Interest income on impaired loans is recognised using the 
original effective interest rate. 
Dividend income 
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.  Financial Statements 123

Pre-contract costs
The Group accounts for all pre-contract costs in accordance with IAS 11, Construction contracts. Costs incurred before it becomes probable 
that a contract will be obtained are charged to expenses. Directly attributable costs incurred after that point are recognised in the balance 
sheet and charged to the income statement over the duration of the contract or, in the case of PPP/PFI concessions, over the same period  
as the Group’s interest in any special purpose company (SPC) charges the equivalent capitalised amounts to the income statement.
Bid recovery fees are deferred and credited to the income statement over the duration of the contract or, in the case of PPP/PFI concessions, 
over the same period as the Group’s interest in any SPC credits the equivalent capitalised amounts to the income statement. Where the 
Group’s interest in any SPC reduces, the deferred bid recovery fees are credited to the income statement in proportion to the reduction  
of the Group’s interest.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items are disclosed separately in the financial statements where it is necessary to do so to provide further understanding of the 
financial performance of the Group. They are items of income or expense that have been shown separately due to the significance of their 
nature or amount.
Exceptional items are also summarised by class in the segmental analyses, excluding those that relate to interest and tax.
Retirement benefit schemes
The Group operates various post-employment schemes, including both defined contribution and defined benefit pension plans. 
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. The Group has no legal 
or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating  
to employee service in the current and prior periods. 
A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that typically defines an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, 
usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation. 
For the defined benefit plan, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations 
being carried out at the end of each annual reporting period. Remeasurement, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of changes 
to the asset ceiling (if applicable) and the return on plan assets (excluding interest), is reflected immediately in the Consolidated Balance 
Sheet with a charge or credit recognised in other comprehensive income in the period in which it occurs. Remeasurement recognised in  
other comprehensive income is reflected immediately in retained earnings and will not be reclassified to profit or loss. Past service cost is 
recognised in profit or loss in the period of a plan amendment. Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate at the beginning  
of the period to the net defined benefit liability or asset. Defined benefit pension costs are categorised as follows: 
•	service cost (including current service cost, past service cost, as well as gains and losses on curtailments and settlements)
•	net interest expense or income
•	remeasurement. 
The net retirement benefit liabilities recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet represents the actual deficit in the Group’s defined  
benefit plan. 
For defined contribution plans, the Group pays contributions into a separate entity. The Group has no further payment obligations once  
the contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised as employee benefit expenses when they are due. Prepaid contributions 
are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or reduction in the future payments is available.
Share-based payments
The Group operates a number of equity and cash settled share-based compensation plans, under which the entity receives services from 
employees as consideration for equity instruments (options) or cash (phantom allocations) of the Group.
In accordance with IFRS 2, Share-based payments, the cost of share-based payments awarded after 7 November 2002 is charged to the 
income statement over the performance and vesting periods of the instruments. The cost is based on the fair value of the awards made at 
the date of grant adjusted for the number of awards expected to vest. In accordance with the transitional provisions within IFRS 2, no charge 
is made in respect of instruments awarded before 7 November 2002. In the case of equity settled awards, the credits associated with the 
amounts charged to the income statement are included in retained earnings/accumulated losses until the awards are exercised. In the case of 
cash settled awards, the credits associated with the amounts charged to the income statement are held as a liability in the balance sheet until 
the awards are transferred, at which point a cash amount (based on the Company’s share price at the vesting date) is paid to the employee. 
Where awards are settled by the new issue of shares, any proceeds received in respect of share options are credited to share capital and 
share premium. Where awards are settled in shares held by the EBTs, any proceeds are credited to retained earnings/accumulated losses.  124 Financial Statements
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2014
Notes to the Financial Statements 
continued
Share awards are granted by the Company to employees of its subsidiaries. The Company charges to cost of investment in subsidiaries  
an amount equivalent to the equity settled element of the annual IFRS 2 charge, with an equivalent credit to reserves in accordance with  
IFRIC 11, Group and treasury share transactions. 
Income tax
Current and deferred income tax are recognised in the income statement for the period except where the taxation arises as a result of  
a transaction or event that is recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. Income tax arising on transactions or events 
recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity is charged or credited to other comprehensive income or directly to  
equity respectively.
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in  
the countries where the Company and its subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income. 
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and 
liabilities and their carrying amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements. However, deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises 
from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects 
neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the 
deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which  
the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current  
tax liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either 
the taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle balances on a net basis.
No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries, branches and joint ventures, except where it is known  
that the earnings will be distributed.
Deferred tax assets of £3.7m have not been recognised due to the uncertainty of timing of utilisation. 
Intangible assets
Goodwill 
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration given for a business over  
the Company’s interest in the net fair value of the net identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree.
Goodwill is stated at cost less accumulated impairment. Prior to 1 April 2004, goodwill was amortised over its estimated useful economic  
life. Amortisation ceased on 1 April 2004 and the carrying value of existing goodwill was frozen at that date and is subject to impairment 
reviews.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business acquisition is allocated to each of the cash generating units (CGUs), 
or groups of CGUs, that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill  
is allocated represents the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. 
Goodwill impairment reviews are undertaken annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential 
impairment. The carrying value of goodwill is compared to the recoverable amount, which is the higher of value in use and fair value less 
costs to sell. Any impairment is recognised immediately as an expense and is not subsequently reversed. Gains and losses on the disposal  
of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
Goodwill that arose prior to 1 April 1997 was written off to retained earnings/accumulated losses. Profit or loss on disposal of the underlying 
businesses to which this goodwill related will not include goodwill previously recorded as a deduction from equity.
Acquired customer relationships
Acquired customer relationships consist of intangible assets arising on the consolidation of recently acquired businesses, that are separable 
from goodwill, in accordance with IFRS 3, Business combinations, and IAS 38, Intangible assets, and do not fall within the Group’s other 
classes of intangible assets. These comprise principally existing customer relationships which may give rise to future orders (customer 
relationships), and existing order books (backlog orders). Financial Statements 125 
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2014
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Corporate Information
Notes to the Financial Statements 
continued
Acquired customer relationships are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date and have a finite useful life. Amortisation of customer 
relationships is calculated using the straight line method to allocate the cost of customer relationships over their estimated useful lives of 
between one and twenty years. Acquired customer relationships are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment. 
Backlog orders are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date and amortised over their estimated useful lives of three years. Backlog 
orders are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment.
Software licences
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring into use the specific software. 
These costs are amortised using the straight line method to allocate the cost of the software licences over their useful lives of between  
two and five years. Software licences are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Corporate information systems
In accordance with IAS 38, Intangible assets, the Group’s corporate information systems are treated as an intangible asset. Costs included  
are those directly attributable to the design, construction and testing of new systems (including major enhancements and internally 
generated costs) from the point of inception to the point of satisfactory completion where the probable future economic benefits arising 
from the investment can be assessed with reasonable certainty at the time the costs are incurred. Maintenance and minor modifications are 
expensed in the income statement as incurred. The corporate information systems recognised as assets are amortised using the straight line 
method to allocate the cost of the corporate information systems over their estimated useful life of six years. Corporate information systems 
are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation. 
Trade names and trademarks
Trade names and trademarks have arisen on the consolidation of recently acquired businesses and are recognised at fair value at the 
acquisition date. Where trade names and trademarks are considered to have a finite useful life, amortisation is calculated using the straight 
line method to allocate the cost of trade names and trademarks over their estimated useful lives. Where trade names and trademarks are 
considered to have an indefinite useful life, they are not subject to amortisation; they are tested annually for impairment and when there  
are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable, as detailed within the impairment of non-financial assets section below. Trade 
names and trademarks are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment. 
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Cost comprises purchase price after 
discounts and rebates plus all directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to working condition for its intended use.
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that 
future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying 
amount of the replaced part is derecognised. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial 
period in which they are incurred.
Land is not depreciated. Depreciation on other assets is calculated using the straight line method to write off the cost less residual value of 
each asset over its estimated useful life, as follows:
Freehold buildings   – 10 to 50 years
Short term leasehold property  – over the life of the lease
Plant, machinery and vehicles   – 3 to 12 years
The assets’ useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period.
An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its estimated 
recoverable amount. 
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised within administrative 
expenses in the income statement.
Impairment of non-financial assets
Assets that have an indefinite useful life, such as goodwill, are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment and when 
there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment 
wherever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised  
for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair 
value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are 
largely independent cash flows (CGUs). Prior impairments of non-financial assets (other than goodwill) are reviewed for possible reversal at 
each reporting date. 126 Financial Statements

Financial assets
Classification
The Group classifies its financial assets into the following categories: at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, and available-
for-sale. The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired. Management determines the classification 
of its financial assets at initial recognition.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are financial assets held for trading. A financial asset is classified in this category if acquired 
principally for the purpose of selling in the short term. Derivatives are also categorised as held for trading unless they are designated as 
hedges. Assets in this category are classified as current assets if expected to be settled within 12 months, otherwise they are classified as 
non-current.
The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date. A market is 
regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service or 
regulatory agency and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm’s length basis. The quoted market 
price used for financial assets held by the Group is the mid market price. These instruments are included in Level 1, see note 2.
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation techniques. These valuation 
techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates. If all 
significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in Level 2, see note 2.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.  
They are included in current assets except where the maturity is greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date, in which case they  
are included as non-current assets. The Group’s loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents,  
and other receivables in the balance sheet. Other receivables include loan notes receivable. 
Available-for-sale financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other 
categories. They are included in non-current assets unless the investment matures or management intends to dispose of it within 12 months 
of the end of the reporting period. 
Recognition and measurement
Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade date – the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell 
the asset. Investments are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs for all financial assets not carried at fair value through profit 
or loss. Financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value, and transaction costs are expensed in 
the income statement. Financial assets are derecognised when the right to receive cash flows from the investments has expired or has been 
transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership. Available-for-sale financial assets and financial 
assets at fair value through profit or loss are subsequently carried at fair value.
Trade receivables are recognised at original invoice amount less provision for impairment which, due to their short term nature, approximates 
to their fair value. Other receivables include loan notes receivable, which are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method 
less any provision for impairment. This valuation approximates to their fair value. 
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are presented in the income 
statement in the period in which they arise. 
Changes in the fair value of monetary and non-monetary securities classified as available-for-sale are recognised in other comprehensive 
income.
When securities classified as available-for-sale are sold or impaired, the accumulated fair value adjustments recognised in equity are included 
in the income statement.
Interest on available-for-sale financial assets calculated using the effective interest method is recognised in the income statement as part of 
finance income.
Offsetting financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset 
the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Financial Statements 127

Impairment of financial assets
Assets carried at amortised cost
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is 
impaired. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred only if there is objective evidence  
of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a loss event) and that loss event (or 
events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.  
Evidence of impairment may include indications that the debtors or a group of debtors is experiencing significant financial difficulty, default 
or delinquency in payments, the probability that they will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and where observable data indicate 
that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows, such as changes in arrears or economic conditions that correlate  
with defaults.
Any impairment is charged to the income statement. Impairment testing for trade receivables is described below in the accounting policy 
paragraph relating to trade receivables. For other receivables carried at amortised cost, impairment loss is measured as the difference 
between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial asset’s original 
effective interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced and the amount of the loss is recognised in the Consolidated Income 
Statement.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring 
after the impairment was recognised (such as an improvement in the debtor’s credit rating), the reversal of the previously recognised 
impairment loss is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Assets classified as available-for-sale
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is 
impaired. The Group uses the criteria referred to above. If any evidence of impairment exists, the cumulative loss – measured as the 
difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in 
profit or loss – is removed from equity and recognised in profit or loss. If, in a subsequent period, the fair value of a debt instrument classified 
as available-for-sale increases and the increase can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised  
in profit or loss, the impairment loss is reversed through the Consolidated Income Statement. 
Inventories
Inventories are stated at cost less impairment. Cost is determined using the first in, first out method.
Trade receivables 
Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for services performed in the ordinary course of business. If collection is expected in  
one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer), they are classified as current assets. If not, they are presented  
as non-current assets.
Trade receivables are recognised at fair value. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence 
that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. 
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, demand deposits and other short term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible 
to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair 
value. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and, if 
so, the nature of the item being hedged. The Group designates certain derivatives as hedges of a particular risk associated with a recognised 
asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction (cash flow hedge).
The Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk 
management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge 
inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes 
in cash flows of hedged items.
The fair values of various derivative instruments used for hedging purposes are disclosed in note 23. The full fair value of a hedging derivative 
is classified as a non-current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is more than 12 months, and as a current asset 
or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months. 
Cash flow hedge
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in other 
comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.  128 Financial Statements
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2014
Notes to the Financial Statements 
continued
Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss (for example, 
when the forecast cash flow that is hedged takes place).
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain  
or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast cash flow is ultimately recognised in the 
Consolidated Income Statement. When a forecast cash flow is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported  
in equity is immediately transferred to the Consolidated Income Statement.
Lease obligations
Finance leases
Lease arrangements that transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee are treated as finance leases. Assets held 
under finance leases are capitalised within property, plant and equipment at the lease’s commencement and depreciated over the shorter  
of the lease term and the useful life of the asset. A liability is recognised for the present value of the minimum lease payments within current 
and/or non-current liabilities as appropriate. Rental payments are apportioned between capital and interest expense to achieve a constant 
rate of interest charge on the outstanding obligation. 
Operating leases
Where the Group acts as lessee in an operating lease arrangement, the lease payments are charged as an expense to the income statement 
on a straight line basis over the lease term. Lease incentives received are also recognised on a straight line basis over the lease term.   
Where the Group acts as lessor in an operating lease arrangement, rental income from operating leases is accounted for on a straight line 
basis over the period of the lease. Lease incentives provided are also recognised over the lease term on a straight line basis.
Trade payables 
Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. 
Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business 
if longer). If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities.
Trade payables are recognised at fair value.
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised cost; any 
difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement 
over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. 
Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that some  
or all of the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred until the draw down occurs. To the extent there is no evidence that  
it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down, the fee is capitalised as a prepayment for liquidity services and amortised 
over the period of the facility to which it relates.
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares or options are shown  
in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Provisions for other liabilities and charges
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an 
outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount has been reliably estimated. 
Vacant property provisions are recognised when the Group has committed to a course of action that will result in the property becoming 
vacant. The provision is calculated based on projected discounted cash flows to the end of the lease, after making assumptions for void and 
rent free periods. The pre-tax rate used reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the 
obligation. The increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognised as interest expense.
Dividend distribution
Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Group’s Financial Statements in the period in which  
the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders. Interim dividends are recognised when paid. 
Disposal groups held for sale
Disposal groups are classified as assets held for sale when their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction and 
a sale is considered highly probable. They are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Financial Statements 129

2. Financial risk management 
Financial risk factors 
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and price risk), 
credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks 
to minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance. The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain 
risk exposures.
Risk management is carried out by a central treasury department (Group Treasury) under policies approved by the Board of directors. Group 
Treasury identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close cooperation with the Group’s operating units. The Board provides written 
principles for overall risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, 
credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and investment of excess liquidity.
These policies are further described within the ‘Treasury policies and objectives’ section of the Business Review (page 42).
Where individual sensitivities are disclosed below, all other variables are held constant.
a) Market risk
Financial instruments affected by market risk include borrowings, deposits and derivative financial instruments. The following foreign 
exchange risk and interest rate risk analyses, required by IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures, are intended to illustrate the sensitivity  
to changes in market variables, being primarily the US dollar to sterling and euro to sterling exchange rates and UK interest rates.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analyses:
•	 changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedges are fully effective with no impact on the 
Consolidated Income Statement 
•	changes in the carrying value of other financial instruments not in hedging relationships only affect the Consolidated Income Statement.
i) Foreign exchange risk 
The Group operates in a number of international territories. Each business undertakes a large proportion of its commercial transactions 
within its local market and in its local functional currency. Foreign exchange risk arises from a proportion of commercial transactions 
undertaken in currencies other than the local functional currency, from financial assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than 
the local functional currency and on the Group’s investments in foreign operations.
Group policy is for each business to undertake commercial transactions in its own functional currency whenever possible. When this is not 
possible, the Group manages its foreign exchange risk from future commercial transactions using appropriate derivative contracts arranged 
via Group Treasury. Cash flows are reviewed on a monthly basis throughout the duration of projects and the future cover amended as 
appropriate.
Trade receivables and payables denominated in currencies other than the local functional currency arise from commercial transactions and 
are therefore largely hedged as part of the process described above. Remaining financial assets and liabilities denominated in currencies 
other than the local functional currency include bank accounts, loans and intercompany funding balances. These are generally unhedged, 
with the exception of balances that are themselves designated as hedging instruments used to hedge the Group’s investments in foreign 
operations.
The Group’s primary exposure to foreign exchange risk on unhedged financial instruments arises mainly in respect of movements between 
the US dollar (including dollar pegged currencies) and sterling and between the euro and sterling. 
At 31 March 2014, if sterling had strengthened by a reasonably possible change of 10% against the US dollar, post-tax profit for the year 
would have been lower by approximately £0.3m (2013: £1.7m) and equity would have been £0.3m lower (2013: £1.7m). If sterling had 
weakened by a reasonably possible change of 10% against the US dollar, post-tax profit for the year would have been higher by 
approximately £0.4m (2013: £2.1m) and equity would have been £0.4m higher (2013: £2.1m). 
At 31 March 2014, if sterling had strengthened by a reasonably possible change of 10% against the euro, post-tax profit for the year would 
have been lower by approximately £0.7m (2013: £0.3m) and equity would have been £0.7m lower (2013: £0.3m). If sterling had weakened 
by a reasonably possible change of 10% against the euro, post-tax profit for the year would have been higher by approximately £0.8m 
(2013: £0.4m) and equity would have been £0.8m higher (2013: £0.4m).
The Group has certain investments in foreign operations, whose net assets are exposed to foreign currency translation risk. A proportion  
of the currency exposure arising from the net assets of the Group’s foreign operations is managed through borrowings denominated in the 
relevant foreign currencies.  130 Financial Statements
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2014
Notes to the Financial Statements

ii) Interest rate risk
The Group’s exposure to interest rate risk arises from cash and cash equivalents and financial assets at fair value through profit or loss which 
are all interest bearing, offset in part by interest bearing bank loans. The majority of these items are at floating rates of interest or fixed 
deposits for periods of less than six months; changes in the interest rate results in changes in interest-related cash flows. No interest hedging 
is currently undertaken by the Group or its subsidiaries. If interest rates for the year to 31 March 2014 had been 10 basis points higher/lower, 
post-tax profit for the year would have been approximately £0.1m (2013: £0.1m) higher/lower.
iii) Price risk 
Price risk is the risk that a decline in the value of assets adversely impacts the profitability of the Group.
The Group is exposed to equity securities price risk because of investments held by the Group and classified on the Consolidated Balance 
Sheet as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. To manage this risk, the Group diversifies its portfolio. Diversification of the 
portfolio is done in accordance with limits set by the Group. 
In the prior year, the Group was also exposed to price risk because of investments held by the Group in unlisted corporate bonds (available-
for-sale financial assets). These investments were disposed of during the prior year.
Management monitors exposures to price risk on an ongoing basis.
The Group is not materially exposed to commodity price risk. Certain longer term project and framework contracts include indexation clauses 
that are applied to unit rates to offset the effect of inflation on input costs over the duration of the agreement. The Group is exposed to 
price risk to the extent that inflation differs from the index used and forecast project outcomes that form the basis of revenue recognition 
include an estimate of this risk where it is present. 
b) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that the Group will suffer financial loss as a result of counterparties defaulting on their contractual obligations. 
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well  
as credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions, with the maximum exposure to the risk 
equivalent to 100% of the carrying value disclosed in the Group’s balance sheet at 31 March. The Group does not hold any collateral as 
security. The Group’s policy is that cash and investments should not be concentrated with any one counterparty.
For trade and other receivables, concentration of credit risk is very limited due to the Group’s broad customer base. An assessment of  
credit quality of the customer is made where appropriate using a combination of external rating agencies, past experience and other factors. 
In circumstances where credit information is unavailable or poor, the risk is mitigated primarily by the use of advance payments resulting  
in positive cash flows. Exposure and payment performance are monitored closely both at individual project and client level, with a series  
of escalating debt recovery actions taken where necessary. In view of current economic circumstances, additional management attention 
remains focused on the recovery of debtors.
c) Liquidity risk 
The Group funds its activities through cash generated from its operations and, where necessary, borrowings and finance leases. The Group’s 
borrowing facilities include bank facilities and private placement debt. Cash flow forecasting is performed in the operating entities of the 
Group and aggregated by a central finance department (Group Finance). Group Treasury monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s liquidity 
requirements to ensure it has sufficient cash to meet operational needs while maintaining sufficient headroom on its undrawn committed 
borrowing facilities (note 29) at all times so that the Group does not breach borrowing limits or covenants (where applicable) on any of its 
borrowing facilities. Such forecasting takes into consideration the Group’s debt financing plans and covenant compliance.
Any surplus cash is invested by Group Treasury in interest bearing current accounts, term deposits and money market deposits, choosing 
instruments with appropriate maturities or sufficient liquidity to provide sufficient headroom as determined by the forecasts mentioned 
above. Financial Statements 131

Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns 
for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
The Group maintains or adjusts its capital structure through the payment of dividends to shareholders and through its borrowing facilities.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of the ratio of its net debt plus net defined benefit pension deficit net of total deferred tax to 
adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA). This policy is unchanged from the prior year. Financial Statements 133

As detailed in note 1, during the year the Group adopted and retrospectively applied IAS 19 (revised 2011). As a result, profit before interest 
and tax, net defined benefit pension deficit and net deferred tax for the year ended 31 March 2013 have been restated accordingly. See 
notes 20, 32 and 44 for further details regarding the impact of the adoption of IAS 19 (revised 2011) on the Group.
Given the Group’s current net funds position, the Board has not formally agreed a target ratio of net debt plus net defined benefit pension 
deficit net of total deferred tax to adjusted EBITDA.
Fair value estimation
The table below analyses the Group’s financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method. The different levels have been defined 
as follows:
•	quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1)
•	 inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or 
indirectly (that is, derived from prices) (Level 2).
The following table presents the Group’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value at 31 March 2014 and 2013. See note 11 for

There have been no changes to the classification of the Group’s financial instruments carried at fair value between Level 1 and Level 2  
at 31 March 2014 or 2013. 134 Financial Statements
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2014
Level 1 financial instruments
The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date. A market is 
regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service or 
regulatory agency and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm’s length basis. The quoted market 
price used for financial assets held by the Group is the mid market price.
Level 2 financial instruments
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation techniques. These valuation 
techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on estimates. If all significant inputs 
required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in Level 2. The fair value of certificates of deposit is calculated 
as the present value of the future cash flows, discounted at an appropriate market rate of interest. The fair value of forward foreign exchange 
contracts is determined using quoted forward exchange rates at the reporting date and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates 
matching the maturities of the foreign exchange contracts.
Specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments include:
•	the fair value of derivatives used for hedging are provided by The Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC and Bank of America Merrill Lynch
•	 the fair value of all marketable securities, with the exception of life insurance policies, are provided by the financial institutions holding  
the Group’s funds and investments 
•	the fair value of all life insurance policies are provided by the Group’s insurance companies.

3. Segmental information
The CODM has been identified as the chief executive officer and the Group finance director. The chief executive officer and the Group 
finance director review the Group’s internal reporting to assess performance and allocate resources. Management has determined the 
operating segments based on these reports.
Following a change in its operational management, the Group has amended its operating segments for reporting purposes to reflect the 
United Kingdom and Europe as one segment; previously Europe had been managed and reported with Asia Pacific. The revised segments 
are: United Kingdom and Europe, North America, Middle East, Asia Pacific and Energy. The segmental results and assets for the comparative 
year ended 31 March 2013 have been represented in line with these revised segments.
The chief executive officer and the Group finance director assess the performance of the operating segments based on operating profit 
before interest and tax. Information provided to the chief executive officer and the Group finance director is measured in a manner 
consistent with that in the Financial Statements.

As detailed in note 1, during the period the Group adopted and retrospectively applied IAS 19 (revised 2011). As a result, operating profit  
for the year ending 31 March 2013 reduced by £0.1m, which impacted the results of the United Kingdom and Europe operating segment. 
Consequently, the segmental results for the year ended 31 March 2013 have also been restated. See note 44 for further details regarding  
the impact of the adoption of IAS 19 (revised 2011) on the Group.
Assets and liabilities are allocated based on the operations of the segments and the physical location or territory of the asset or liability.
Group cash balances; derivative financial instruments; financial assets at fair value through profit or loss; centrally managed joint ventures; 
and corporate assets are not considered to be segment assets as they are managed centrally. Consequently they are shown within 
unallocated central items.
Similarly, post-employment benefit liabilities; bank loans and private placement debt; derivative financial instruments; central tax provisions; 
and corporate liabilities are not considered to be segment liabilities as they are managed centrally. Consequently they are shown within 
unallocated central items.
Capital expenditure includes additions to goodwill, other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment. 
b) Group geographical segments
External revenue is measured by location of operation. There was no material difference between geographic revenue by location of 
operation and by location of customer. 
The Group considers the UK to be its country of domicile. Outside the UK, only the Group’s business in the United States (US) contributes 
more than 10% of the Group’s revenue or non-current assets.

10. Business combinations
Confluence Project Management Pte. Ltd
On 4 October 2013 the Group acquired the entire share capital of Confluence Project Management Pte. Ltd (Confluence), a Singapore-based 
project management business, for a debt-free cash consideration of Singapore $17.0m (approximately £8.4m). Confluence is an international 
consultancy employing around 200 people, offering services in the areas of project and construction management, and has operations in 
Asia Pacific, the Middle East and India. 
Confluence’s teams in Singapore, Hong Kong, Abu Dhabi and India have integrated with the Group’s existing operations in Asia Pacific  
and the Middle East. The acquisition complements the Group’s Faithful+Gould project and cost management consultancy business and,  
in particular, augments its presence in the commercial, retail and hospitality sectors.
At 31 March 2014 the fair value of acquired assets, liabilities and goodwill for this business combination have been determined on  
a provisional basis, pending finalisation of the post-acquisition review of the fair value of the acquired net assets. Under IFRS 3, Business 
combinations, adjustments to these provisional values can be made within one year of the date of acquisition relating to facts and 
circumstances that existed at the acquisition date. The finalised position will be reflected in the Group’s financial statements for the  
year ending 31 March 2015.
The goodwill of £5.7m arising from the acquisition was allocated to the Asia Pacific segment. None of the goodwill is expected to be 
deductible for income tax purposes. The goodwill of £5.7m is attributable to the extensive complementary skills which enable the Group’s 
combined operations to provide an enhanced offering to clients in Asia Pacific and the Middle East, which will augment its presence  
in the commercial, retail and hospitality sectors in particular.
The following table summarises the consideration paid for Confluence and the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the 
acquisition date.

As at 31 March 2014, one EBT had an agreement in place to waive dividends in excess of 0.01 pence per share on 213,461 ordinary shares 
(2013: 213,461). A separate EBT also had an agreement in place as at 31 March 2014 to waive future dividends in their entirety on 2,311,202 
ordinary shares (2013: 2,618,276). These arrangements reduced the dividends paid in year by £0.8m (2013: £0.8m).
As at 31 March 2014, 4,341,000 ordinary shares (2013: 4,341,000) were held by the Group as treasury shares on which no dividends are 
paid. These shares reduced the dividends paid in year by £1.4m (2013: £1.3m).
14. Earnings per share (EPS)
Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of shares in issue 
during the year, excluding shares held by the EBTs which have not unconditionally vested in the employees and shares held in treasury. 
Diluted EPS is the basic EPS after allowing for the dilutive effect of the conversion into ordinary shares of the number of options outstanding 
during the year. The options relate to discretionary employee share plans.
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below:

15. Parent Company Income Statement and Statement of Comprehensive Income  
The Company has not presented its own Income Statement or Statement of Comprehensive Income as permitted by Section 408 of the 
Companies Act 2006. The profit and total comprehensive income for the year attributable to the owners of the parent was £43.7m  
(2013: £23.4m), which included £45.4m (2013: £16.1m) of dividend income from subsidiary companies and no profit on disposal of  
a subsidiary undertaking (2013: £0.5m), see note 9.
The Company’s individual Income Statement and Statement of Comprehensive Income were approved by the Board on 10 June 2014.

Impairment test for goodwill
Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36, Impairment of assets, at least annually or more frequently 
if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment. 
Goodwill is allocated to the Group’s CGU, or group of CGUs, that management has identified in order to carry out impairment tests. 
Following a change in its operational management, the Group has amended its operating segments for reporting purposes to reflect the  
United Kingdom and Europe as one segment; previously Europe had been managed and reported with Asia Pacific. The segmental summary 
of goodwill for the comparative year ended 31 March 2013 has therefore been represented in line with the revised segments. The following 
is a summary of goodwill allocation by CGU or group of CGUs, summarised at the operating segment level:

North America 131.0  141.8
Asia Pacific 5.5  –
Energy 22.4  24.1
Total 204.0  211.4
The impairment test involves comparing the carrying value of the CGU or group of CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated to their 
recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is based on the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. An impairment loss  
is recognised immediately when the carrying value of those assets exceeds their recoverable amount.
Recoverable amount
Fair value less costs to sell is the best estimate of the amount obtainable from the sale of a CGU or group of CGUs in an arm’s-length 
transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties, less the costs of disposal. Value in use is the present value of the future cash flows 
expected to be derived from the CGU or group of CGUs.
Fair value is assessed from an external perspective and value in use from a Group-internal perspective. Both are determined using a business 
valuation model, taking into account planned future cash flows. If available, third-party valuations are taken as a basis for determining  
fair value. Financial Statements 149

Value in use calculations
Methodology
The internal value in use calculations use cash flow projections based on the following financial year’s budget approved by the Board,  
which is based on past performance and management’s expectations of market developments. The key assumptions in the budget relate  
to revenue and profit margins. Budgeted revenue is based on management’s knowledge of actual results from prior years, along with the 
existing committed and contracted workload, as well as management’s future expectations of the level of work available within the market. 
Profit margins are based on current margins being achieved in conjunction with economic conditions in the market or country of operation.
The cash flow projections from that budget are extrapolated for the next four years using an estimated growth rate and projected margin. 
Growth rates of between 1.7% and 5.4% are based on the economic environment for the country in which the CGU operates. As required 
by IAS 36, cash flows beyond the five year period are extrapolated based on the long term average growth rate for the primary country in 
which the CGU operates of between 1.8% and 5.3%. These growth rates are derived from the International Monetary Fund’s World 
Economic Outlook published Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rates. Projected margins reflect the historical and budgeted performance 
of the CGU. The projections do not include the impact of future restructuring projects to which the Group is not yet committed. 
The cash flows have been discounted using the CGUs specific pre-tax discount rates of between 6.7% to 17.9%. The discount rates have 
been calculated based on the Group’s weighted average cost of capital using the capital asset pricing model to determine the cost of equity 
and risks specific to the CGU. The discount rates are revised annually using updated market information. 
Assumptions
The growth rate and discount rate assumptions used for the internal value in use calculations are as follows:
2014 
Group
 2013 
Five year growth rate 1.7% – 5.4% 1.5% – 3.3%
Post five year growth rate 1.8% – 5.3% 1.7% – 3.3%
Pre-tax discount rate 6.7% – 17.9% 7.7% – 15.2%
Sensitivities
Goodwill of £131.0m (2013: £141.8m) allocated to the North America operating segment includes £124.1m of goodwill arising on the 
acquisition of PBSJ. This goodwill has been allocated to the North America group of CGUs and is considered significant in comparison with 
the Group’s total carrying amount of goodwill. The recoverable amount of this group of CGUs has been determined using an internal value 
in use calculation. The growth rate and discount rate assumptions used for this calculation are as follows:
2014  2013
Five year growth rate 2.7% 3.3%
Post five year growth rate 2.2% 3.3%
Pre-tax discount rate 13.5% 12.4%
Given the materiality of goodwill allocated to the North America group of CGUs, together with the relative headroom derived by the 
calculations, sensitivity analysis has been performed on the key assumptions used in the value in use calculations. The two assumptions  
to which these calculations are most sensitive are the projected profit margin and the discount rate. Specific sensitivity analysis with regard  
to these assumptions shows that, with respect to the profit margin, it would need to fall by 180 basis points before any impairment would  
be triggered, and similarly the pre-tax discount rate would need to increase from 13.5% to 16.6%.
For the other CGUs, management has considered the level of headroom resulting from the impairment tests. Where appropriate, further 
sensitivity analysis has been performed by changing the base case assumptions applicable to each CGU. The analysis has indicated that  
no reasonably possible changes in any individual key assumption would cause the carrying amount of the business to exceed its recoverable 
amount. 
As at 31 March 2014 and 2013, based on these valuations, the recoverable value of goodwill required no impairment. 150 Financial Statements

life of the other assets included within acquired customer relationships is 15.5 years.
In the prior year, the carrying amounts of acquired customer relationships and trade names and trademarks relating to Peter Brown, a wholly 
owned subsidiary of the Group, were reduced to recoverable amounts of £nil following an impairment review. Impairment charges of £2.6m 
and £4.8m were recognised respectively, as well as £2.6m amortisation on acquired intangibles, as shown above. These impairment charges 
were included in administrative expenses in the Consolidated Income Statement. The recoverable amounts of Peter Brown’s intangible assets 
were based on their value in use. The post-tax discount rate used in the value in use calculation was 9.3%. Peter Brown has been reported 
within the Group’s North America operating segment, note 3. The ongoing operations of this business were disposed of on 30 August 2013. 
Further details regarding this disposal are given in note 9.
The amortisation charge for the year of £7.5m (2013: £6.6m) is included in administrative expenses in the Consolidated Income Statement.   Financial Statements 151

The hedged highly probable forecast transactions denominated in foreign currency are expected to occur at various dates during the next  
12 months. Gains and losses recognised in the hedging reserve in equity on forward foreign exchange contracts as at 31 March 2014 are 
recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in the period or periods during which the hedged forecast transaction affects the 
Consolidated Income Statement. This is within 12 months of the end of the reporting period.
Derivatives are classified as a current asset or liability. The full fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability  
if the remaining maturity of the hedged item is more than 12 months and, as a current asset or liability, if the maturity of the hedged item  
is less than 12 months.

The Group used derivative instruments to hedge foreign currency receipts and payments on current contracts, as described in note 2.  
All of the Group’s financial instruments are classified as Level 2 under amendments to IFRS 7, Financial instruments: disclosures. A definition 
of Level 2 financial instruments is included in note 2. The fair value of derivative financial instruments is calculated based on quoted forward 
currency rates at the balance sheet date.
The Group has reviewed all contracts for embedded derivatives and does not have any such instruments that are closely related to the 
host contract.  Financial Statements 157

£1.8m), a company in which the Group has a 10% shareholding. Under the terms of the Connect Plus M25 finance agreement, the Group  
is required to lend Connect Plus (M25) Intermediate Limited £20m over a period from May 2009 to October 2012. This funding is lent on by 
Connect Plus (M25) Intermediate Limited to Connect Plus (M25) Limited, the main trading entity for the Connect Plus M25 project and the 
company which holds the 30 year PFI contract with the Highways Agency to design, build, fund and then operate and maintain the M25. 
One of the subcontractors used by Connect Plus (M25) Limited to deliver its main obligations under this project is Connect Plus Services.  
The Group’s interest in Connect Plus Services is disclosed in note 41 and Connect Plus (M25) Intermediate Limited is considered a related 
party of the Group.
At 31 March 2014 the Group held £19.9m of interest-bearing loan notes in Connect Plus (M25) Intermediate Limited (2013: £20.0m).  
These loan notes mature in 2039, and has a nominal interest rate of 12% per annum.

All of the Group’s undrawn committed borrowing facilities will be subject to floating rates of interest.
On 10 October 2013 the Group entered into a new five year revolving credit facility (RCF). This facility matures in October 2018. The new 
arrangement provides the Group with an enlarged committed credit facility of £200m, and replaced the Group’s previous £150m RCF and 
£30m bilateral facility. This larger facility provides the Group with increased and longer term financial capacity to support its strategy. The 
total letters of credit in issue under the committed facility at 31 March 2014 were £3.3m (31 March 2013: £6.9m).
The new facility includes four of the Group’s existing lenders, Banc of America Securities Limited, Barclays Bank plc, HSBC Bank plc and 
National Westminster Bank plc, together with three new banks, The National Bank of Abu Dhabi, Abbey National Treasury Services plc and 
United Overseas Bank Limited.
The Group’s borrowing facilities include a number of undertakings and financial covenants. Compliance with these covenants is monitored. 
As at 31 March 2014, and since, there have been no breaches (2013: none). 
In the prior year, the Group raised $75m through the successful execution of its debut issue in the US private placement market. The 
proceeds were used to repay drawn funds under the Group’s existing banking facilities. The private placement is due for repayment on  
31 May 2019 and carries a nominal interest rate of 4.38%.

As detailed in note 1, during the year the Group adopted and retrospectively applied IAS 19 (revised 2011). IAS 19 (revised 2011) and the 
related consequential amendments have impacted the accounting for the Group’s defined benefit scheme by replacing the interest cost and 
expected return on plan assets with a net interest charge on the net defined benefit liability. In addition, the standard requires that unvested 
past service cost and administration costs be recognised immediately in the income statement, which has also had a small impact on the 
Group’s defined benefit liability. The effect of this resulted in the net defined benefit obligation at 1 April 2012 being restated as £262.5m 
(previously £265.3m); and 31 March 2013 as £295.6m (previously £298.8m). Comparative information has been restated for the effect of 
the retrospective application of the amendment to IAS 19 as disclosed in note 44. 162 Financial Statements

a) Net retirement benefit liabilities
The Group, through trustees, operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes. 
Defined contribution schemes are those where the Group’s obligation is limited to the amount that it contributes to the scheme and the 
scheme members bear the investment and actuarial risks.
Defined benefit schemes are schemes other than defined contribution schemes where the Group’s obligation is to provide specified benefits 
on retirement.
The two main defined benefit schemes are the Atkins Pension Plan (the Plan) and the Railways Pension Scheme, both of which are funded 
final salary schemes. The assets of both schemes are held in separate trustee-administered funds. Other pension schemes include the Atkins 
McCarthy Pension Plan in the Republic of Ireland, which is a final salary funded defined benefit scheme, and a range of defined contribution 
schemes or equivalent. 
The schemes operate under trust law and are managed and administered by trustees on behalf of the members in accordance with the terms 
of the trust deed and rules and relevant legislation. Defined benefit contributions are determined in consultation with the trustees, after 
taking actuarial advice. The trustees are responsible for establishing the investment strategy and ensuring that there are sufficient assets to 
meet the cost of current and future benefits.
The Plan is closed to the future accrual of benefit; all defined benefit members of the Plan were transferred to a defined contribution section 
for future service where it was clear they did not benefit from a statutory or contractual right to a final salary pension. 
In 2012 Atkins Limited, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, undertook an enhanced transfer value (ETV) exercise for 
deferred members of the Plan. The exercise gave rise to a settlement gain under IAS 19 in respect of those members who transferred out 
their benefits. The Plan recognised a net settlement gain of £0.1m in respect of the ETV exercise for the year ended 31 March 2013. This is  
to allow for the difference between the expected impact of the exercise already included in the 31 March 2012 disclosures and the actual 
impact of the exercise. The settlement gain of £0.1m is based on the transfer out of the Plan of a further £1.3m of assets and corresponding 
liabilities of £1.4m in respect of those members.            
         
The Railways Pension Scheme invests in a range of pooled investment funds intended to generate a combination of capital growth and 
income and as determined by the trustee, taking account of the characteristics of the obligations and the trustee’s attitude to risk. The 
majority of the Railways Pension Scheme’s assets that are intended to generate additional returns, over the rate at which the obligations are 
expected to grow, are invested in a single pooled “growth” fund. This fund is invested in a wide range of asset classes and the fund manager 
RPMI has the discretion to vary the asset allocation to reflect its views on the relative attractiveness of different asset classes at any time.  
The remaining assets in the Railways Pension Scheme are principally fixed and index-linked bonds. 
The Railways Pension Scheme recognised a curtailment gain in the year ended 31 March 2013 in respect of the two new benefit bases that 
came into effect for certain members from 1 January 2013. The curtailment gain arose for members moving from the existing uncapped 
salary category or retail price index (RPI) capped salary category to the new consumer price index (CPI) capped category. The reduction  
in the past service liability for this curtailment was £4.3m and this was recognised as a curtailment gain in the year ended 31 March 2013. 
The Atkins McCarthy Pension Plan was closed to future accrual of benefits for members who do not benefit from a statutory or contractual 
right to a final salary pension on 31 March 2009. These members transferred to the Personal Retirement Savings Accounts – Ireland (PRSA 
– Irish Life) scheme with effect from 1 April 2009. 
The defined benefit sections of all pension schemes are closed to new entrants, who are offered membership of the defined contribution 
section.

The actuarial tables used to calculate the retirement benefit liabilities for the Plan were the Self-Administered Pension Schemes (SAPS) tables, 
with medium cohort improvements from 2002 to 2009 and a scaling factor of 0.85/0.90 for males/females respectively. Future improvements 
are based on CMI improvements with a 1.5% per annum improvement trend, based on year of use application. The Railways Pension 
Scheme results have been adjusted on an approximate basis to be based on the same mortality tables.

The Group completed its last triennial valuation as at 31 March 2013 and is therefore due to complete its next triennial valuation as at  
31 March 2016. The Group considers that the contribution rates set at the recent valuation date are sufficient to eliminate the deficit over  
the agreed period.
The nature of the funding regime in the UK creates uncertainty around the size and timing of cash that the Company will be required  
to pay to the pension schemes.
The Group has agreed that it will proceed with a new repayment plan that ends in March 2025, with one-off payments of £32m for each  
of the two years ending 31 March 2015, which escalate thereafter at 2.5% per annum.
The Group expects employer contributions to be paid during the financial year to 31 March 2015 to be around £34.9m, of which £32m  
is in relation to the funding of the actuarial deficit, and employee contributions paid to be around £1.5m. Expected benefit payments made 
directly by the Group to pensioners in the financial year to 31 March 2015 are £nil.
The approximate effect on the liabilities from changes in the main assumptions used to value the liabilities are as follows: 
Change in assumption Effect on plan liabilities
Atkins Pension Plan Railways Pension Scheme
Discount rate increase/decrease 0.5% decrease/increase 10.0% decrease/increase 8.0%
Inflation increase/decrease 0.5% increase/decrease 5.0% increase/decrease 8.0%
Real rate of increase in salaries increase/decrease 0.5% increase/decrease 2.0% increase/decrease 1.0%
Longevity increase 1 year increase 3.0% increase 2.0%
The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. In practice, this  
is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit 
obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same method (present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated with the 
projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period) has been applied as when calculating the pension liability recognised  
within the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
The methods and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis did not change compared to the previous period.
The effect of the change in inflation on liabilities assumes a corresponding change in salary increases and inflation-related pension increases.  
b) Other post-employment benefit liabilities
The Group operates unfunded schemes within certain of its non-UK businesses, including gratuity schemes, Key Employee Supplemental 
Option Plans (KESOP) and post-retirement medical benefit schemes.
Members of the gratuity schemes are entitled to receive a cash gratuity on leaving the business which is dependent on their length of 
employment and final salary. Valuation of the gratuity obligation is carried out in line with the principles of IAS 19, Employee benefits. 
The Group operates a KESOP providing some key officers and employees in its North American business (the business) with post-retirement 
benefits, known as the Supplemental Income Program (SIP). The SIP is an unfunded plan that provides participants with retirement income 
for a specified period of between 5 and 15 years upon retirement, death or disability. The plan fixes a minimum level for retirement benefits 
to be paid to participants based on the participant’s position in the business, their age and length of service at retirement. Additionally, 
certain executive agreements have been amended to provide post-retirement medical benefits to those employees and their spouses, at  
a level substantially similar to those medical and hospitalisation benefits paid and provided to senior executives currently employed by the 
business. The insurance benefits will be provided without any further or additional services from the employee to the business and they  
will be paid for and provided for as long as the employee and their spouse shall live.

c) Post-employment benefit liabilities – Risks
Through its defined benefit pension plans and other post-employment benefit liabilities, the Group is exposed to a number of investment 
and actuarial risks, the most significant of which are detailed below:
Asset volatility 
The Retirement benefit plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields. If plan assets 
underperform this yield, this will create a deficit. Both the UK and Irish plans hold a significant proportion of equities, which are expected  
to outperform corporate bonds in the long-term while exposing the Group to greater volatility and valuation risk in the short-term. The 
government bonds represent investments in UK Government securities only. 
Life expectancy
The majority of the plans’ obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an 
increase in the plans’ liabilities. This is particularly significant in the UK and Irish plans, where inflationary increases result in higher sensitivity 
to changes in life expectancy. The Atkins Pension Plan has had interest and inflation rate hedging in place for some time, but due to the 
relative immaturity of the longevity hedging market, to date the Group has held off implementing a longevity hedging programme.  
As a consequence, the Plan remains fully exposed to any future improvements in mortality beyond those already assumed by the Actuary. 
Changes in bond yields
A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the  
plans’ bond holdings. 170 Financial Statements
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2014
Notes to the Financial Statements 
continued
Inflation risk
Some of the Group pension obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities (although, in most cases,  
caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect the plan against extreme inflation). The majority of the plans’ assets are 
either unaffected by fixed interest bonds or loosely correlated with equities inflation, meaning that an increase in inflation will also increase 
the deficit.
The Group does not use derivatives or hedging, other than interest and inflation rate hedging, to manage its risk. Investments are well 
diversified, such that the failure of any single investment would not have a material impact on the overall level of assets. A large portion of 
assets in 2014 consists of equities and bonds, although the Group also invests in property, cash and investment (hedge) funds. The Group 
believes that equities offer the best returns over the long term with an acceptable level of risk. The majority of equities are in a globally 
diversified portfolio of international blue chip entities. A breakdown of the major categories of plan assets as a percentage of total plan 
assets for the two UK schemes is detailed above.
Expected maturity analysis of other post-employment benefit liabilities are as follows:

Proportion relating to pensioners 39.0 33.0 47.0 46.0
Total 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 20 years (2013: 20 years) for the Atkins Pension Plan, 16 years (2013:  
16 years) for the Railways Pension Scheme and between 25 and 30 years (2013: between 25 and 30 years) for the McCarthy Pension Plan.
Expected future benefit payments from the Atkins Pension Plan (the Plan) are mostly in respect of pension payments that are either linked  
to price inflation or receive fixed pension increases. These projected benefit payments are expected to be made from the Plan over the next 
80 or so years. The payments are expected to rise over the next 30 years, when they will peak, before beginning to decline.  
The Group expects pension benefits to be paid by the schemes during the financial year to 31 March 2015 to be approximately £46.7m.

35. Share-based payments
Long Term Incentive Plans
WS Atkins plc Long Term Growth Unit plan (LGU) August 2012 onwards
A share plan for senior executives where units are granted at a base price which is normally based on the six-month average share price 
calculated at the date of grant. The vesting of units occurs in three equal tranches on the fourth, fifth and sixth anniversaries of the date of 
grant. Vesting is subject to a strategic underpin which is considered by the Remuneration Committee. On exercise, the value of each unit is 
equal to the increase, if any, in the average share price of one notional Company share between the grant date and the exercise date. Any 
such increase will normally be calculated using the six-month average share price. No more than 50% of a participant’s total number of  
units subject to a single grant may be exercised in any 12-month rolling period. The increase will usually be delivered in the form of a nil cost 
option except in the US, where awards are granted as market value options and are scaled back on exercise to allow only the exercise of 
options equivalent to the gain that would have been made under a non-US award. The units will generally be settled in equity.
As a general rule, awards granted to participants who leave employment prior to vesting will be forfeited. In the event a participant leaves  
as a result of a qualifying reason, they receive a pro rata entitlement.
WS Atkins plc Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) August 2012 onwards
A share plan for senior executives used to grant awards that are settled in equity or, in limited circumstances, in cash. Subject to the 
Company’s real growth in absolute EPS over the performance period. The growth target requires the increase to be more than 12% per 
annum in the three-year performance period to allow full vesting. If the increase is less than 5% per annum, there will be no vesting. If the 
increase is 5% per annum, vesting will be at 25%, and a sliding scale operates between 5% and 12% per annum.
As a general rule, awards granted to participants who leave employment prior to vesting will be forfeited. In the event a participant leaves  
as a result of a qualifying reason, they receive a pro rata entitlement.      
Subject to vesting, participants are entitled to receive the benefit of dividends declared following grant, without interest.
Atkins Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) September 2006 to July 2012
A share plan for senior executives and key employees used to grant awards to employees that are settled in equity or, in limited 
circumstances, in cash. There are different performance targets for different categories of management. Grants made to executive directors 
and senior employees have 50% of the grant subject to the Company’s total shareholder return (TSR) performance relative to the 
constituents of the FTSE 250 Index (excluding investment trusts) at the start of the performance period. Full vesting of this portion of the 
grant will take place if the Company is ranked in the upper quartile and 30% vesting will be achieved with a median ranking, with pro rata 
vesting for intermediate performance. No vesting will occur for a ranking below median.
The remaining 50% of the grant made to executive directors and senior employees is subject to the Company’s real growth in underlying 
EPS over the performance period. For the 2006 and subsequent grants, the growth target requires the increase to be more than 10% per 
annum above the UK RPI in the three-year performance period to allow full vesting. If the increase is less than 4% per annum above the UK 
RPI, then there will be no vesting. If the increase is 4% per annum above the UK RPI, vesting will be at 30%, and a sliding scale operates 
between 4% and 10% above the UK RPI.
Awards granted to other participants are subject solely to the EPS condition. As a general rule, awards granted to participants who leave 
employment prior to vesting will be forfeited. In the event a participant leaves as a result of a qualifying reason, they receive a pro rata 
entitlement.
Subject to vesting, participants are entitled to receive the benefit of dividends declared following grant without interest.  172 Financial Statements

Atkins Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) September 2003 to August 2006
A share plan for senior executives and key employees used to grant awards to employees that are settled in equity or, in limited 
circumstances, in cash. The performance condition was TSR with an EPS growth underpin measured over three financial years starting with 
the financial year beginning immediately after the award was granted. Full vesting of any award took place for a TSR performance where  
the Company ranked in the top 20% in a group of up to 16 comparator companies, 30% vesting for median ranking and no vesting if  
TSR fell below the median. The EPS underpin was the UK RPI plus 2% per annum. As a general rule, awards granted to participants who  
left employment prior to vesting were forfeited. In the event a participant left as a result of a qualifying reason, they received a pro rata 
entitlement. All awards have now vested.
Deferred Share Plans
Atkins Deferred Bonus Plan (DBP)
A share plan for senior executives and key employees used to grant awards to employees that are settled in equity or, in limited 
circumstances, in cash. There is no performance condition but awards are restricted for at least three years from the date of grant.  
As a general rule, awards granted to participants who leave employment prior to vesting will be forfeited. In the event a participant leaves  
as a result of a qualifying reason, they will receive their award in full. Subject to vesting, participants are entitled to receive the benefit of 
dividends declared following grant without interest. All awards have now vested.
Atkins Deferred Share Plan (DSP) 
A share plan for senior executives and key employees used to grant awards to employees that are settled in equity or in cash. There is no 
performance condition but awards are restricted for a set period from the date of grant, fixed by the Remuneration Committee at grant.  
As a general rule, awards granted to participants who leave employment prior to vesting will be forfeited. In the event a participant leaves  
as a result of a qualifying reason, they will receive their award in full. Subject to vesting, participants are entitled to receive the benefit of 
dividends declared following grant without interest. Awards granted to executive directors in relation to the executive bonus scheme are 
restricted for three years from the date of grant.

38. Contingent liabilities
The Group has given indemnities in respect of performance and contractual related bonds, as well as letters of credit issued on its behalf.  
The amount outstanding at 31 March 2014 includes £3.3m letters of credit issued as a result of the acquisition of PBSJ. 
During the year ended 31 March 2011, the Group acquired PBSJ. Prior to the acquisition, the Audit Committee of the Board of directors  
of PBSJ undertook an internal investigation to determine whether any laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), had been 
violated in connection with certain projects undertaken by PBS&J International, Inc. (one of PBSJ’s subsidiary undertakings). The investigation 
suggested that FCPA violations may have occurred but did not extend beyond the international operation and that none of PBSJ’s executive 
management were involved in criminal conduct. PBSJ voluntarily disclosed this matter to the Department of Justice and to the Securities  
and Exchange Commission and is cooperating fully with their review. The FCPA provides for penalties, criminal and civil sanctions and other 
remedies. Neither at the date of acquisition nor at subsequent year ends has management been able to estimate the potential penalties that 
may be imposed and therefore no provision has been made. It is not considered possible to determine an accurate estimate of the fines and 
penalties that may be imposed as they are not formula driven or in any way the result of a predefined calculation. The Group does not have 
an estimate of when this will be resolved but it is considered possible to be within the next financial year.
Group companies are from time to time involved in claims and litigation. The Group carries Professional Indemnity insurance cover for  
such claims.
39. Operating lease arrangements
The Group leases various offices under operating lease arrangements. The leases have various terms, escalation clauses and renewal rights. 
The Group also leases vehicles, plant and equipment under operating lease arrangements.
At the end of the reporting period, the future aggregate minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases are payable

44. Prior period amounts
During the year the Group adopted IAS 19 (revised 2011) which increased net finance costs in the Consolidated Income Statement with a 
corresponding restatement of the actuarial movements in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. In addition, unvested past 
service cost and administration costs have been recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement, which has also had a small 
impact on the Group’s defined benefit liabilities. The Consolidated Income Statement, Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, 
Consolidated Balance Sheet, Statement of Changes in Equity and notes for the year ended 31 March 2013 have been restated accordingly.  
The effects on the Consolidated Income Statement and Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income are as follows:

Giving your shares to charity
If you only have a small number of shares 
whose value makes it uneconomic to sell 
them, you may wish to consider donating 
them to charity though ShareGift, an 
independent share donation scheme.  
The relevant share transfer form can be 
obtained from the registrar. ShareGift is 
administered by The Orr Mackintosh 
Foundation Limited, registered charity 
number 1052686. Further information  
may be obtained on +44 (0)20 7930 3737 
or from www.sharegift.org.
Identity theft
Identity theft is on the increase. Criminals 
may steal your personal information,  
putting your Atkins shareholding at risk.
Tips for protecting your Atkins shares:
•	  ensure all your certificates are kept in  
a safe place or hold your shares 
electronically in CREST via a nominee
•	  keep all correspondence from the registrar 
that shows your shareholder reference 
number in a safe place, or destroy your 
correspondence by shredding it
•	  if you change address inform the registrar 
in writing or via our share portal at  
www.myatkinsshares.com
•	  know when dividends are paid and 
consider having your dividend paid directly 
into your bank account. This will reduce 
the risk of the cheque being intercepted  
or lost in the post. If you change your 
bank account, inform the registrar of the 
details of your new account. You can do 
this by post or online using our share 
portal at www.myatkinsshares.com. 
Respond to any letters the registrar sends 
you about this
•	  if you receive a letter from the registrar 
regarding a change of address or a 
dividend instruction but have not recently 
moved or requested a change to how  
you receive your dividends please contact  
them immediately as you may have been  
a victim of identity theft
•	  if you are buying or selling shares only deal 
with brokers registered in your country of 
residence or the UK.
Warning to shareholders
Share fraud includes scams where investors 
are called out of the blue and offered shares 
that often turn out to be worthless or 
non-existent, or an inflated price for shares 
that they own. These calls often require you 
to make a quick decision and come from 
fraudsters operating in ‘boiler rooms’ that 
are mostly based abroad. High pressure sales 
tactics can also come by email, post, word 
of mouth or at a seminar. Sometimes scams 
are also advertised in newspapers, 
magazines or online and appear as if they 
are genuine investment opportunities.
In addition, be aware of money recovery 
scams which can be initiated by someone 
claiming to be from the police or a 
government agency. Organisations’ names 
vary but can include the National Fraud 
Intelligence Bureau and the US Securities & 
Exchange Commission. You should check 
the latest information on the Financial 
Conduct Authority (FCA) website at www.
fca.org.uk/consumers/scams/what-to-do-if-
you-are-scammed for more details of scams 
pretending to be the police or a government 
agency.
While high profits are promised, those who 
buy or sell shares in this way usually lose 
their money. The FCA found that even 
experienced investors have been caught out 
by share fraud and on average, share fraud 
victims lose an average of £20,000, with 
around £200m lost in the UK each year.
If you are offered unsolicited investment 
advice, discounted shares, a premium price 
for shares you own, or free company or 
research reports, you should take these 
steps before handing over any money:
1.  get the name of the person and 
organisation contacting you
2.  check the Financial Services Register  
(FSR) at www.fca.org.uk/firms/systems-
reporting/register/search to ensure they 
are authorised
3.  use the details on the FSR to contact the 
firm
4.  if you are based in the UK, call the FCA 
Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768  
if there is no telephone number on the  
FSR or you are told it is out of date
5.  search the FCA’s list of known 
unauthorised firms and individuals to 
avoid doing business with
6.  remember that law enforcement and 
other agencies will not contact members 
of the public asking for their bank details 
or money
7.  remember: if it sounds too good to be 
true, it probably is.
If you use an unauthorised firm to buy or  
sell shares or other investments, you will not 
have access to the Financial Ombudsman 
Service or Financial Services Compensation 
Scheme (FSCS) if things go wrong.
If you are approached about a share scam 
you should tell the FCA using the share 
fraud reporting form at www.fca.org.uk/
consumers/scams, where you can find out 
about the latest investment scams. If you  
are based in the UK, you can also call the 
FCA Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768.
If you have already paid money to share 
fraudsters you should contact Action Fraud 
online at www.actionfraud.police.uk or,  
if you are based in the UK, by telephone on 
0300 123 2040. 184 Corporate Information

Short Bowel Syndrome (“SBS”) is a rare 
condition in which a large portion of the 
intestine has been removed by surgery. 
It can also be caused by disease or 
injury that prevents the small intestine 
from functioning properly despite 
normal length. As a result, people can’t 
absorb enough nutrients or fluids from 
food and liquids to stay healthy. In the 
US, an estimated 7,000 patients have 
SBS requiring parenteral support, and  
a similar number in Europe.
In some cases, patients may be 
prescribed intravenous (IV) feeding 
(parenteral support) to help them take 
in additional nutrients or fluids.

GATTEX®
GATTEX is a classic example of how we 
help improve lives by providing innovative 
treatments to patients with rare conditions 
where there is a high unmet need. We will 
continue to look for ways to maximize 
access to GATTEX for patients around 
the world.

We are well on our way to creating the 
leading global biotech focused on rare 
diseases. Our journey continues to 
intensify, as we seek to grow, innovate 
and excel clinically and commercially to 
transform the lives of people around the 
world with rare and other specialized 
conditions. You don’t transform lives by 
standing still. Continuous change for the 
better is at the heart of our business. 
For us above all, it’s about what’s next.
The next challenge. 
The next opportunity. 
The next great idea. 
The next breakthrough.

 Shire Annual Report 2015 3 LEADING 
THE WAY
Chairman’s review
Throughout 2015, I’ve had the privilege 
of listening to Shire people as they talk 
about the future. I’ve heard the stories 
that are driving our business forward. 
I’ve also watched as one Shire team 
after another presented ideas and 
possibilities, often in novel, even moving 
ways. This is a passionate and highly 
promising organization. I see and 
hear this passion and promise in 
my daily interactions.
4 Shire Annual Report 2015 Our purpose as a company is to enable 
people with life-altering conditions to lead 
better lives. Our focus is on building 
long-term sustainable value for shareholders 
as a global biotechnology company while 
balancing the needs of all our stakeholders 
including patients, employees, partners, 
payers, physicians and regulators. We aim 
to be the world leader in rare diseases and 
a leading global biotechnology and as a 
result of our clear focus on innovation, 
efficiency, growth and people, we are well on 
our way to achieving this goal.
Looking ahead, our announced 
combination with Baxalta Incorporated 
(“Baxalta”), which at closing would create 
the world’s leading biotech company 
focused on rare diseases, and provide a 
platform for sustainable innovation, growth 
and value creation. This is an exciting time 
for Shire and Baxalta alike, and is great 
news for our current and future rare 
disease patients.
The Shire 2015 Annual Report provides 
details of our key activities for the year. 
In this letter I highlight those events and 
accolades that I believe demonstrate 
our leadership and our commitment to 
our patients. 
We have been successful in driving the 
business forward through original research, 
creative acquisitions and novel licensing 
agreements, advancing our innovative 
pipeline. In 2016, our pipeline will be 
comprised of 29 programs in clinical 
development, with 14 in Phase 3 or 
planned to enter Phase 3 in 2016. 
Completed acquisitions including 
NPS Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“NPS 
Pharma”), Dyax Corp. (“Dyax”), Foresight 
Biotherapeutics Inc. (“Foresight”), and 
Meritage Pharma, Inc. (“Meritage”), and 
new research partnerships such as those 
with Foundation Fighting Blindness and the 
Cincinnati Children’s Hospital, will help 
us make a real difference to the lives 
of patients.
2015 brought good news for the millions 
of adults in the US with Binge Eating 
Disorder (“BED”). With the Food and Drug 
Administration (“FDA”) approval of 
VYVANSE for the treatment of moderate 
to severe BED in adults, physicians now 
have an effective treatment for a widely 
unmet need.
We at Shire take a responsible, transparent 
and sustainable approach to our business. 
In 2015 we were once again confirmed as a 
constituent company in the FTSE4Good 
Index, which measures globally recognized 
standards for corporate responsibility. We 
were also ranked as the #2 “greenest” 
company in the world according to 
Newsweek magazine. This year we held 
our first Global Day of Service, raised 
awareness for rare diseases, improved 
access to our therapies, participated in 
industry-wide roundtables, presented new 
research at world conferences, and 
furthered the dialogue about patient health. 
I’d like to welcome the many individuals 
who have joined Shire around the world 
since the beginning of the year. They have 
joined a company with a strong identity 
and sense of purpose, and a high 
performance culture that rewards creativity, 
innovation and delivering results. The 
perspectives and experiences of these 
new colleagues will no doubt add new 
dimensions and depth to the innovation 
we are seeing across the business.
Shire also has great leadership. Our CEO, 
Flemming Ornskov, MD was named by 
Harvard Business Review in October as 
one of the 100 Best-Performing CEOs in 
the World. I would like to thank Flemming 
for his vision, leadership and exceptional 
dedication to the company. 
I’d also like to recognize the Board of 
Directors for their contributions, insights 
and rigorous approach in challenging and 
assessing Shire’s activities over the course 
of the year. In particular, I’d like to thank 
David Kappler, Deputy Chairman and 
Senior Independent Director, who will retire 
at the 2016 AGM, for his many years of 
exceptional service. 
In 2015, two Non-Executive Directors 
joined our Board — Olivier Bohuon, Chief 
Executive Officer at Smith & Nephew, plc, 
and Sara Mathew, who, until 2013, served 
as Chairman, President, and Chief 
Executive Officer of Dun & Bradstreet. 
Jeffrey Poulton also joined the Board this 
year on his promotion to Chief Financial 
Officer. You can read more about the 
Board in my corporate governance report 
on page 64.
We’ve had a remarkable year at Shire, and 
I’ve felt extraordinarily privileged to play a 
role in this company’s emergence as a true 
global leader. I wish to thank all of those 
who are making this company what it is — 
and what it will continue to become.
Susan Kilsby 
Chairman

Our year in review
2015 has been a year of transformation. 
With our streamlined One Shire 
organization in place, we advanced our 
ambition to become a leading global 
biotechnology company.  We built category leadership, launched 
multiple products in our core therapeutic 
areas, greatly expanded our global footprint 
and strengthened our innovative pipeline, 
now the most robust in Shire’s history. We 
did all this while delivering excellent results, 
investing in future growth drivers and 
announcing several, game-changing deals.
Our achievements are grounded in our clear 
and focused strategy of growth, innovation, 
efficiency and people. In 2015, we made 
significant progress across each of these 
strategic drivers. These achievements 
reflect the contributions of our people who 
work passionately every day to help those 
with life-altering conditions to lead better 
lives, and to whom I am extremely grateful. 
Becoming a leading global 
biotechnology company
We are transforming into a fast-growing, 
leading global biotech with best-in-class 
products for patients with rare diseases and 
specialty conditions. We strive to become 
leaders within the categories where we have 
product offerings, which are Neuroscience, 
Gastrointestinal/Endocrinology, hereditary 
angioedema (“HAE”)/ lysosomal storage 
disorders (“LSDs”), and Ophthalmics. Rare 
Diseases are at the center of our strategy 
and the mindset we bring to our work every 
day. Today, approximately 45% of product 
sales come from rare diseases and biologics, 
with over 75% of our 29 R&D clinical 
programs in rare conditions. 
As we advance our portfolio, business 
development continues to play an important 
role. In 2015, we added promising rare 
disease assets and technologies through 
complimentary, highly strategic, mid-sized 
acquisitions. These bolt-on acquisitions 
benefit from our domain leadership, 
commercial and R&D expertise, and 
our proven abilities in integration and 
advancing assets through development 
to commercialization. I describe this as our 
“string of pearls” approach to transactions.
There were many times during 2015 
when we were able to put this into action. 
We started the year with the acquisition of 
NPS Pharma, adding Natpara and Gattex/
Revestive to our innovative portfolio of 
products, and supporting our GI franchise 
past the eventual loss of Lialda exclusivity. 
With the acquisition of Meritage, we 
acquired the global rights to Oral 
Budesonide Suspension (SHP621), for the 
treatment of adolescents and adults with 
eosinophilic esophagitis, a rare, chronic 
inflammatory GI disease, further bolstering 
our GI/IM portfolio.
Our acquisition of Foresight underscored 
our commitment to building a leadership 
position in ophthalmology, with the potential 
for SHP640 (formerly FST-100), if approved, 
to become the first agent to treat both viral 
and bacterial conjunctivitis.
The $6 billion acquisition of Dyax expands 
and extends our industry-leading portfolio 
in HAE, a rare, debilitating genetic 
inflammatory condition that causes episodes 
of swelling in the face, extremities and GI 
tract, and can be life threatening. With Dyax 
we bring into our portfolio DX-2930. If 
approved, this therapy has the potential to 
expand HAE-treated patients and achieve 
worldwide sales of up to $2 billion with 
exclusivity beyond 2030. 
As we add to our “string of pearls,” we have 
pursued transformational transactions 
with the potential to lead the industry. 
Our announced combination with Baxalta, 
pending shareholder and certain regulatory 
approvals, would create the global leader in 
rare diseases with a strong strategic fit and 
a leading, diversified portfolio. The combined 
company would have the ability to deliver 
an anticipated $20 billion in product sales 
by 2020, multiple $1+ billion disease 
franchises, and over 50 inline and pipeline 
rare disease products and programs, more 
than any other company. Assuming the 
necessary approvals, this transaction is 
expected to close in mid-2016.
Delivering growth through new launches 
and commercial excellence
This year we showed our launch 
capabilities with several new products 
successfully entering markets around the 
globe. We launched VYVANSE for 
moderate to severe BED in adults, and 
VYVANSE outperformed the adult attention 
deficit hyperactivity disorder (“ADHD”) 
market and grew 19% over the prior year. 
The recently launched NPS products, 
NATPARA® and GATTAX/REVESTIVE®, 
have shown early promise. Internationally, 
we achieved 25 in-market launches and 
expanded our international presence, with 
Shire medicines now available in 72 countries.
Throughout, we continued to execute across 
our core commercial business. Our HAE 
portfolio, CINRYZE and FIRAZYR, grew 
23% and 22%, respectively. In our GI 
franchise, LIALDA continued to gain 
market share and now represents 36% 
of the 5-ASA US market.

 Shire Annual Report 2015 7 Looking ahead, we will continue to prioritize 
investment in our future growth drivers. 
We are especially excited by the potential 
for leadership in Ophthalmics, with SHP640 
from Foresight and lifitegrast (SHP606) 
which has potential to be the only product 
approved in the US in the past decade 
indicated for the treatment of signs and 
symptoms of Dry Eye Disease (“DED”) 
in adults. Today, there are an estimated 
29 million people living with the symptoms 
of DED in the US. Only about half are 
diagnosed, and only a small fraction of 
these are treated. Following the positive 
results of OPUS-3, we have been 
working on advancing lifitegrast through 
the regulatory process by addressing the 
FDA’s complete response letter and 
resubmitted the New Drug Application 
(“NDA”) for lifitegrast on January 22, 2016. 
We expect to remain on track for potential 
US approval in 2016. 
Progressing our innovative pipeline — 
the most robust in our history
We entered 2016 with the strongest pipeline 
in Shire’s 30-year history, with 29 clinical 
development programs, including 14 in 
Phase 3 or planned to enter Phase 3 in 
2016. Just a few highlights from our Phase 
3 programs include SHP620 (maribavir) for 
CMV infection in transplant patients; 
SHP621 for Eosinophilic Esophagitis; and 
SHP609 for Hunter syndrome-intrathecal 
delivery (phase 2/3); all in areas of high 
unmet medical need.
Having worked for years in pediatrics, 
I am personally excited by the potential of 
SHP607 for the prevention of Retinopathy

8 Shire Annual Report 2015 gestation. ROP is a leading cause of visual 
loss in childhood and can lead to lifelong 
vision impairment and blindness. Shire is 
investigating SHP607, an experimental 
insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) protein 
replacement therapy, specifically to determine 
whether it may prevent ROP. Phase 2 results 
are expected in the second half of 2016. 
If successful, SHP607 will add to our 
growing category leadership in Ophthalmics.
Ensuring a streamlined, 
efficient organization
We continued to look critically at how we 
work and where we can improve our core 
processes and systems to do things 
better and faster. Much was achieved in 
this area over the past year. This includes 
consolidating our US operational 
headquarters in Massachusetts. We also 
worked to strengthen our manufacturing 
position through renegotiation of our 
agreement with Sanquin. We are now in 
a position to seek a second source of 
supply to boost production of CINRYZE, 
an important treatment for HAE.
Aligning and engaging our people 
We had amazing growth last year — 
hiring many new employees — reflecting 
our dynamism as an organization and 
the attractiveness of our culture: high 
performing, patient-focused, and one that 
rewards innovation and results. This year 
we integrated our new colleagues from 
NPS Pharma, adding to Shire’s deep 
expertise in rare diseases. We look forward 
to doing the same with our colleagues from 
Dyax now that the deal has been closed. 
Supporting our local communities and 
giving back has long been one of Shire’s 
key strengths and passions. This year, on 
October 2nd, we held our First Global Day 
of Service. More than 1,700 Shire employees 
donated 8,000 volunteer hours in more than 
20 locations around the world. Because 
of the positive feedback from employees 
and our community partners, plans are 
underway to hold our second Global Day 
of Service in 2016. Our corporate 
responsibility efforts also received more 
formal recognition in 2015, for example, 
through our continued inclusion on the 
FTSE4Good Index. 
Shaping what’s next 
In 2016, we mark the 30th anniversary of 
Shire. It was three decades ago, in 1986, 
that we opened our doors with our first 
product. Like many journeys, ours has not 
been a straight road. It’s had many twists 
and turns — and there will certainly be 
many more. This is the reality of our industry 
— with advances in science, and with shifts 
in the healthcare environment — the journey 
is never quite linear. But one thing that’s 
defined Shire since day one is its forward-
looking mindset. We are never complacent. 
Our journey for the past 30 years has been 
shaped by a shared focus on what’s next 
— on how we can be ahead of what’s 
needed or expected — to do things better 
and faster so we can meet the needs of our 
patients, our physicians, our employees 
and our business, not just today but also 
tomorrow. Throughout the years, we set 
bold aspirational goals and did what was 
needed to achieve them.
But of course, we’re not stopping there. 
We’re already looking ahead to what’s next 
for Shire — which is the opportunity we 
have to shape what’s next as a leading 
global biotech. 
As we look toward the next 30 years 
(and beyond), I want to express my 
appreciation and gratitude to our employees 
for the impact they have every day on 
the growth of our business — and most 
importantly to our patients who inspire us 
to keep pushing forward. 
I look forward to working with all of Shire’s 
stakeholders on shaping what’s to come.

 Shire Annual Report 2015 9 Key industry trends 
Shaping the industry
We see three trends impacting the industry:
 > Changes across diseases and patient 
populations
 > Increasing levels of physician engagement
 > Rising demand for value and reimbursement
Together, these trends are creating an 
exciting playing field rich in opportunity for 
our particular brand of biotech focused on 
delivering innovative medicines to patients 
with rare diseases and specialty conditions. 
We aim to lead in shaping the future for 
these patients, and in so doing create 
tremendous value for all our stakeholders.
The changing face of diseases and 
patient populations
The industry is moving away from “one size 
fits all” where undifferentiated products for 
broad diseases are sold at volume to 
patients. Increasingly, therapies which once 
were seen as a solution for millions, are 
becoming more targeted to narrow patient 
populations to meet specific, critical unmet 
needs. In tune with this highly targeted 
approach, patients are ever more active 
in their care.
The increasing levels of physician 
engagement
Just as patients are becoming more 
active participants, so too are physicians. 
Physicians are increasingly at the heart of 
highly focused engagement, sophisticated 
dialogue and disease education.
The rising demand for value and 
reimbursement
Approaches to value and reimbursement 
are also changing. The shift is from broad 
access, with discounting, to highly active 
and demanding payers prepared to block 
access where there isn’t a clear 
demonstration of value.
Three key trends shaping the industry
1
Diseases and 
patient populations
From To
“One size fits all,” undifferentiated,  
“me too” products for broad diseases
Targeted therapies, narrow patient 
populations, critical unmet needs, 
patients highly active in their care.
2
Physician engagement
Share of voice across broad  
prescribing base, “reach and frequency”
Highly focused engagement with 
physicians, sophisticated dialogue 
and education.
3
Value and reimbursement
Minimal access constraints for broad 
patient populations, achieved through 
significant discounting
Highly active payers/ governments ready 
to completely block access where there 
isn’t a clear demonstration of value.
10 Shire Annual Report 2015 From big pharma to better biotech
The key trends are combining to put 
pressure on traditional industry players. 
These are tough times for companies 
over-reliant on high volume, broad-brush 
blockbuster drugs.
Specialty pharma firms have strong 
platforms for consolidating assets and 
sophisticated lifecycle and financial 
management, but relatively limited R&D. 
Independent biotechs by contrast are high 
in value-creating innovation and deep focus 
on specific therapeutic areas.

Combining the best of biotech 
and specialty pharma
We are positioning ourselves for 
sustained success in this highly 
dynamic, ever more specialty pharma. 
We continue to build on our platform 
and track record of successful M&A, 
and the same time, drawing from the 
best of biotech to intensify our focus on 
key therapeutic areas and innovation.
Leveraging our strength in both these 
areas, we are forging ahead to become 
the world’s leading biotech focused on 
rare diseases and specialty conditions.
It is a leadership characterized by high 
growth, constant improvement and 
ongoing innovation — not just in 
R&D but across every aspect of 
our business.
Deeply involved in and inspired by our 
ever-changing industry, we continue to 
move forward — driving on to the next 
step, the next opportunity, the next 
breakthrough.
What it takes to win in this 
fast‑changing industry:

 > Innovation
 > Active participation
 > Delivering true value

 Shire Annual Report 2015 17 In-line products 
To drive continued 
growth we focus on 
commercial excellence. 
Product sales ($million)
VYVANSE
$1,722m +1 9%
2014 $1,449m
ADHD and BED
VYVANSE product sales grew strongly (up 19%) in 
2015. Growth was driven by prescription growth in 
the US (up 8%), the benefit of price increases and 
to a lesser extent the benefit of stocking in 2015 
as compared to destocking in 2014 and growth 
from international markets. This growth was partially 
offset by higher sales deductions as a percentage of 
product sales in 2015 as compared to 2014.
ELAPRASE
$553m -7%
2014 $593m
Hunter syndrome
ELAPRASE product sales were down 7% (up 4% 
on a Non GAAP CER basis
1
) reflecting the negative 
impact of foreign exchange movements and to a 
lesser extent a lower average price due to pricing 
pressures and geographic mix. These negative factors 
were partially offset by higher volumes primarily due 
to an increase in the number of patients on therapy.
LIALDA/MEZAVANT
$684m +8%
2014 $634m
Ulcerative Colitis
The 8% growth in product sales for LIALDA/
MEZAVANT in 2015 was primarily driven by higher 
prescription demand (up 10%) and, to a lesser 
extent, a price increase taken at the beginning of 
2015. The growth was partially offset by higher sales 
deductions as a percentage of sales in 2015 as 
compared to 2014 and, to a lesser extent, the effect 
of slight destocking in 2015 compared to stocking 
in 2014.
FIRAZYR
$445m +22%
2014 $364m
For the treatment of acute HAE attacks in 
adults 18 years of age and older
FIRAZYR product sales were up 22% compared 
to 2014, driven by a higher number of patients on 
therapy and, to a lesser extent, the effect of a price 
increase in the US market.
CINRYZE
$618m +23%
2014 $503m
For routine prophylaxis against
angioedema attacks in adolescent and 
adult patients with HAE
CINRYZE sales were up 23% on 2014, primarily 
driven by strong growth in patients on therapy and 
to a lesser extent, sales also benefited from a price 
increase taken since 2014.
REPLAGAL
$441m -1 2%
2014 $500m
Fabry disease
REPLAGAL sales were down 12% compared to 
2014 (up 1% on a Non GAAP CER basis
1
), as the 
benefit of more patients on therapy was more than 
offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange 
and to a lesser extent, pricing pressures.

ADDERALL XR product sales were down 5% in 
2015, as growth in prescription demand (up 10%) 
was more than offset by higher sales deductions as 
a percentage of product sales in 2015 compared to 
2014, primarily due to mix of business.
GATTEX

HAE runs in my family, so 
for me diagnosis was less 
of a mystery than for some. 
My symptoms vary a lot 
— from my hands swelling 
to my stomach swelling.
30-40%
Hereditary Angioedema (“HAE”) is a 
rare genetic disorder characterized by 
spontaneous and recurring attacks of 
swelling (oedema) in various parts of 
the body.
An estimated 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 50,000 
people have HAE. An estimated 30-40% 
of patients with HAE in the US and EU 
remain undiagnosed.
Tyler 
HAE patient
Tyler is a lab technician and a full time 
student who was diagnosed with 
HAE when he was a young 
teenager. Tyler is an avid video 
game player and enjoys the  
little things in life.
22 Shire Annual Report 2015 SHP643 (DX-2930)
HAE attacks can be temporarily disfiguring, painful and 
sometimes life threatening when affecting the throat. It 
is most often caused by a lack of a protein called C1 
esterase inhibitor (C1-INH), which helps regulate 
several complex processes involved in immune system 
function, blood clotting and bleeding. 
Through our acquisition of biotech Dyax Corp, we are 
expanding and extending our industry-leading HAE 
portfolio, which includes FIRAZYR and CINRYZE.
The lead pipeline product, SHP643, is a Phase 3 
long-acting injectable monoclonal antibody for HAE 
prophylaxis. SHP643 has received Fast Track, 
Breakthrough Therapy, and Orphan Drug designations 
by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and has 
also received Orphan Drug status in the EU. It has 
patent protection and anticipated regulatory exclusivity 
beyond 2030. 
With its potential to lower rates of HAE attacks and 
improve patient convenience, SHP643 is an innovative 
therapy that further advances our leadership in biotech 
treatments for rare diseases.
What’s next for 
SHP643
Assuming regulatory approval, we expect 
a US launch in 2018. If approved for the 
prophylaxis of HAE, SHP643 could 
generate estimated annual global sales 
of up to $2 billion.

What’s next for 
NATPARA
With NATPARA, we are proud to be 
meeting a highly focused therapeutic 
need for this rare condition. It is the first 
FDA-approved parathyroid hormone to 
help treat hypocalcemia in patients with 
hypoparathyroidism. Looking ahead, we 
will work to ensure the widest access to 
NATPARA for patients in the US and 
beyond. In Europe, the European 
Medicines Agency (EMA) has validated 
and initiated its review of our marketing 
authorization application for Natpar™.

NATPARA
Hypoparathyroidism is the most common cause of 
hypocalcemia: low levels of calcium in the blood. 
Maintaining the right level of calcium is important for 
vital organ function.
With our $5.2 billion acquisition of NPS Pharma in 
February 2015, we took on board NATPARA — a 
therapy, that represents a significant medical advance 
to help control hypocalcemia in patients with HPT. 
NATPARA is a parathyroid hormone administered with 
calcium and vitamin D, to control calcium level in 
patients with hypocalcemia, NATPARA is self-
administered once daily by subcutaneous injection. 
In April 2015, we launched NATPARA in the US, following 
its approval by the US FDA as an adjunct treatment to 
calcium and vitamin D in hypoparathyroidism patients 
who are not adequately controlled on calcium and 
vitamin D alone to control hypocalcemia.
Because of the potential risk of osteosarcoma, NATPARA 
is recommended only for patients who cannot be 
well-controlled on calcium supplements and active 
forms of vitamin D alone. The treatment is distributed 
through a select network of specialty pharmacies, 
and patients have access to comprehensive support 
services. NATPARA was not studied in patients with 
hypoparathyroidism caused by calcium sensing 
receptor mutations and in patients with acute post-
surgical hypoparathyroidism.
I developed hypoparathyroidism 
in 2004 after surgery to remove 
my thyroid due to Hashimoto’s 
Disease. I was diagnosed 
that same year after 
developing hypocalcemia.

Binge Eating Disorder (“BED”) is a real 
medical condition that was formally 
recognized by the American Psychiatric 
Association in 2013. BED is the most 
common eating disorder among US adults 
and more than twice as prevalent as bulimia 
nervosa and anorexia nervosa combined.
Joanna

Joanna loves anything and everything that 
has to do with art. She is an Art 
Ambassador for a Boston charity and her 
favorite place is the Boston Museum of 
Fine Arts.
Joanna had been concerned for more 
than three years about her eating 
behaviors. Eventually she went to talk 
about it with her doctor, who was able 
to diagnose her with BED.
26 Shire Annual Report 2015 What’s next for 
VYVANSE
The strength of our intellectual property 
surrounding VYVANSE has been upheld in 
the US Court of Appeals for the Federal 
Circuit. As a result, we will not face 
competition from generics until patents 
expire in 2023, and we can concentrate 
on making the most of both existing and 
new VYVANSE-based treatments for 
patients around the world.

It was a great relief to 
be diagnosed. I knew 
something was wrong but 
had no idea what until my 
clinician diagnosed BED. 
I was reassured that 
there was a name to 
my challenges and there 
was help available.
A distinct disorder
2015 marked the first time that treatment for patients with 
moderate to severe BED was made available in the US, 
addressing a significant unmet need.
Vyvanse
On January 30, 2015 the US FDA approved VYVANSE 
for the treatment of moderate to severe BED in adults. 
VYVANSE is currently the only FDA approved treatment 
for this condition. 
Efficient innovation
For Shire, this is a story of one of the key paths we take to 
live up to our commitment to support people with rare and 
other specialized conditions around the world — extending 
an existing product into new area of significant unmet 
need. It is an example of how we look for efficient ways to 
innovate and make the most of our assets. Through 
product extension we can innovate at pace to stay ahead, 
take the first step and lead in a particular treatment.

Dry Eye Disease (“DED”) is a very common 
complaint to eye care specialists in the 
US, with approximately 29 million adults 
living with the symptoms. It varies in 
severity, with symptoms most commonly 
being eye discomfort, dryness and may 
include episodes of blurred vision. 
This multifactorial disease of the tears

Building on the strong trial results, we 
resubmitted an application to the FDA on 
January 22, 2016 with PDUFA date of July 
22, 2016. If approved by the FDA, this

My symptoms make vision-related 
things in life really challenging. 
Dryness and photophobia (extreme 
sensitivity to light) make it difficult 
when I spend time outside doing 
the things I love to do like 
gardening and traveling.
Many possible causes
There are many possible causes of DED, including a 
range of medical conditions, physical damage to either 
tear glands or the eyelids and certain medications. In 
addition, DED is strongly associated with being older, 
post-menopausal; exposure to environmental 
conditions such as wind and dry air; and tasks that 
may result in long periods without blinking such as 
computer work or driving. 
New opportunities
In October 2015, we saw positive trial results for the 
symptoms of DED, with lifitegrast, our investigational 
medicine for the treatment of DED, meeting its primary 
and key secondary endpoints. We believe the new 
data will meet the US FDA’s request for an additional 
clinical study and we are continuing to focus on 
preparing to maximize the potential of this innovative 
pipeline product.
With lifitegrast as a lead candidate, Shire formed the 
Ophthalmics business unit. If approved, the compound 
will help lay the foundation on which Shire’s commitment 
to and leadership in Ophthalmics will grow. Shire is 
focused on continuing to expand its Ophthalmics 
portfolio to include treatment options for rare diseases 
and those for anterior and posterior eye conditions. 
In just over two years, acquisitions include Foresight 
Biotherapeutics, SARcode Bioscience, Premacure AB, 
and BIKAM Pharmaceuticals, which have helped 
bolster Shire’s early-, mid- and late-stage Ophthalmics 
pipeline. The Company currently has an Ophthalmics 
pipeline of investigational candidates in retinopathy of 
prematurity, autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa, 
glaucoma, and infectious conjunctivitis.

30 Shire Annual Report 2015 Focusing on core areas 
We continue to focus on the three highest priority 
areas identified in our 2014 materiality assessment: 
access to medicines, disease awareness and transparency.
Access to 
medicines
Disease 
awareness
Transparency
We are committed to leading 
the way in improving access to 
medicines for those with rare 
and specialty conditions.
Championing early diagnosis of 
rare diseases
For those with rare diseases, diagnosis 
is a major challenge. To help, in 2015 
we launched a new education initiative, 
Diagnosis Doesn’t Have To Be Rare. 
We worked in partnership with the rare 
disease community — sharing educational 
materials to highlight the issues and raise 
awareness to help ensure early diagnosis 
of rare diseases.
Exploring new treatments
We view the development of orphan drugs 
and treatments for specialty conditions 
with significant unmet needs as a core 
responsibility. In 2015, we had 20 unique 
programs in our pipelines — testing 
treatments for conditions that currently 
have none at all.
Improving access to existing treatments
We also work to improve access to our 
existing treatments by reducing barriers, 
such as affordability and geographic 
access. We have several programs to 
assist patients with affordability challenges 
in the US. Outside the US, we have Named 
Patient programs and work with our NGO 
partners Direct Relief and Project HOPE to 
provide charitable access.
Our products treat often 
extremely rare conditions 
that are not well or widely 
understood, so we know how 
important it is to increase 
disease awareness and build 
a thorough understanding.
Disease awareness
We aim to share our expertise and provide 
balanced, reliable and scientifically sound 
information to help improve understanding 
and appreciation of difficult and life-
altering conditions.
In 2015, one of many examples of how 
we did this was through a Spotlight on 
Gaucher film contest to mark International 
Gaucher Day on October 1, supported 
by the European Gaucher Alliance. The 
contest encouraged people whose lives 
have been touched by Gaucher disease 
to share a video to raise awareness of the 
condition and share a message of hope. 
A winner and runner up were selected 
from the entries submitted from across 
the world including Argentina, Colombia, 
Israel, Japan, Jordan, Russia, Rwanda 
and the US.
We also continue to encourage responsible 
use of our ADHD products, through a 
coalition of medical, mental health, higher 
education, students and industry experts.
We focus on transparency 
across many aspects of our 
business, notably clinical trials, 
grants and donations and 
reporting.
Clinical trials
We recognize the importance of transparency 
in clinical studies and are committed to 
the responsible sharing of clinical data 
with patients, physicians and researchers. 
Through shiretrials.com, we provide 
patients, physicians and researchers with 
a single portal to access information on 
Shire’s trials — current and past.
Grants and donations
We publish details on shire.com regularly 
about our educational grants as well as 
donations made to patient groups and 
charitable organizations. In 2015, Shire 
provided $8.6 million in educational grants, 
an increase of $2 million from 2014, and 
made more than $13 million in donations 
to US charitable organizations.
Reporting
In 2014, Shire ranked in the top 25 of 
60 companies in the UK evaluated by 
Transparency International for transparency 
in corporate reporting based on companies’ 
publication of anti-bribery and corruption 
efforts, disclosure of subsidiaries/operations 
and disclosure of financial data on foreign 
operations. In 2015, they also rated Shire 
as “above average” in overall transparency 
regarding corporate political engagement. 
Our publications include an Annual 
Responsibility Review which captures 
Shire’s approach to responsibility, sets 
forth goals in key focus areas and provides 
progress made to date.

accommodation of applicants or 
employees disabilities in accordance with 
all applicable laws in the respective 
locations of all Shire facilities.
Fostering an open, supportive culture
We do not have diversity targets or quotas 
and we do not focus exclusively on one 
group of employees over and above any 
other group of employees. However, we do 
focus very strongly on fostering our culture, 
which aims to provide all our employees 
with a supportive work environment that 
values diverse opinions and experiences, 
and enables individual, group and 
organizational success.
Supporting supplier diversity
Beyond our immediate workforce, we 
also actively seek and select suitable and 
qualified suppliers from all segments of the 
business community in all of the markets 
in which we operate. In the US, we have a 
Supplier Diversity Program, which provides 
opportunities for minority or disabled and 
veteran-owned businesses. Shire’s total 2015 
US spend in support of these businesses 
was 13%, exceeding our goal of 11.3%.

32 Shire Annual Report 2015 Supporting strong performance
We believe we are better able to achieve 
our goals and continuously improve by 
supporting a strong performance culture. 
Research has shown that the most 
important factor here is an employee’s 
relationship with their manager, and we 
devote considerable resources to help 
our managers be the best they can be. 
Implementing a smart new 
support system
In 2015, we introduced the best-in-class 
cloud-based HR system: Workday. It 
provides a shared all-in-one, easy-to-use 
HR resource for employees and managers, 
freeing up more time to focus on 
performance and progress.
Promoting health and safety
We provide a safe work environment as 
well as promoting healthy lifestyles and 
behavior. We also take health and safety 
factors into consideration when working 
with our partners and suppliers.
Recognizing and rewarding
Our pay for performance philosophy provides 
managers with a variety of programs to 
recognize and reward employee contributions, 
and our employee share purchase plans 
enable employees to have a vested interest 
in the success of the business.
Communicating clearly
To drive performance we promote a clear 
understanding of where we are heading. 
This happens at every level of the business 
— from one-on-one performance discussions 
between managers and employees to 
all-employee meetings held at our major 
sites. We communicate with all employees 
via periodic all-company meetings, the 
intranet, all-employee emails from the 
CEO and other executives, a social 
networking platform, and leadership 
briefings and cascades.
Volunteering around the world
On October 2, 2015, we held our first 
Global Day of Service. It was a great 
success, with 1,700 employees from 20 
locations volunteering 8,000 hours to give 
back to their local communities around the 
world through more than 50 projects 
primarily focused on children — from 
hosting science days to creating activity 
books for children in hospitals.
Valuing our people
We are proud of the commitment and talent 
of our people around the world. They are 
at the heart of our journey to become the 
leading global biotech focused on rare 
diseases and specialty conditions. 
Attracting and promoting
We aim to attract and retain great people 
and give them the environment and 
encouragement to excel. We promote the 
best use of our people on the basis of 
individual skills and experience matched 
against those required for the work to be 
performed, and actively seek diverse views 
and experiences.

continued
Looking after our planet
We are committed to operating a sustainable 
organization that protects our employees, 
the environment and the communities in 
which we live and work. Effective use of 
resources is a key component in achieving 
excellent company performance and 
making Shire a world-class organization 
and responsible corporate citizen.
We strive to conserve resources and 
minimize adverse environmental impacts 
and risks that may be associated with 
our products, facilities and operations. 
We promote the sustainable and efficient 
use of natural resources, waste 
minimization, recycling, energy efficiency, 
and responsible product stewardship in 
our business activities. 
We have implemented key components 
of a health, safety and environmental 
management system for our operations. 
Our health, safety and environmental team 
continually work to improve this system.
Focusing on local initiatives
We believe environmental impacts are most 
effectively addressed locally where they 
occur. We therefore focus on local, rather 
than global, goals and initiatives to reduce our 
impacts, for example through site-specific 
recycling and energy reduction programs. 
We source 100% renewable energy for our 
Basingstoke and Zug locations. 
Continuing to improve
The success of our local approach is 
illustrated by our performance in the CDP 
2015 Climate Change disclosure and 
performance results. In 2015 we equaled 
our prior year’s performance achieving a 
Disclosure score of 91% (A) and a B for 
Performance, both above the pharmaceutical 
industry and FTSE averages.
Earning a top green ranking
Our green performance was underlined 
when Shire received the outstanding 
ranking as the #2 greenest company in the 
world in Newsweek’s 2015 Green Rankings 
of the world’s biggest companies based on 
their corporate sustainability and 
environmental impact.

Boundary Summary All facilities with emissions greater than 1% of the overall footprint were included in the Scope 1 and 2 reporting 
of emissions from natural gas and electricity. All global fleet fuel usage is included. Emissions from diesel/
fuel oil generators are less than 1% of total footprint and are excluded. Scope 3 includes business air travel 
and business vehicle travel which are significant enough to warrant inclusion in our annual report though not 
required by law. 
Consistency with the financial statements Any facility with less than 1% of overall emissions is excluded from the reported inventory.

34 Shire Annual Report 2015 Upholding human rights
We support the UN Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights (http://www.un.org/en/
documents/udhr/) and recognize the 
obligation to promote universal respect 
for and observance of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms for all, without 
distinction to sex, age, race, religion, or 
any other characteristic protected by law.
Clinical trials
Of paramount importance, we safeguard 
the human rights of those taking part in 
our clinical trials, which is primarily achieved 
through informed consent. Shire adheres 
to the International Conference on 
Harmonization (ICH) Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP) Guidelines. 
Employment
We are committed to protecting the human 
rights of our employees in our offices and 
manufacturing facilities around the world. 
We recognize that commercial success 
depends on the full commitment of all our 
employees. We commit to respecting their 
human rights, to provide them with safe 
and favorable working conditions that are 
free from unnecessary risk and to maintain 
fair and competitive terms and conditions 
of service at all times.
We seek to comply fully with all relevant 
laws, rules and regulations governing labor, 
employment and the employment 
relationship in all of the countries where 
Shire does business.
We commit to the principles articulated in 
the International Labor Organization’s (ILO) 
“Declaration on Fundamental Principles 
and Rights at Work” which includes the 
following four major principles:
 > Freedom of association and the 
effective recognition of the right to 
collective bargaining;
 > Elimination of all forms of forced or 
compulsory labor;
 > Abolition of child labor; and,
 > Elimination of employment discrimination. 
We also commit to the protection of human 
rights of our partners and suppliers, and in 
turn, expect them to do the same in their 
operations and to their employees around 
the world. We do this through a regular and 
risk-based audit of our suppliers, and our 
Responsible Supply Chain policy explicitly 
states our expectations of suppliers to 
uphold the ILO principles. This policy can 
be found on our website, www.shire.com.
Organizing to lead
Throughout Shire we are organized to 
take the lead not only in living up to our 
own responsibilities, but also across the 
biotech industry.
From our Executive Sponsor of Responsibility 
who is a member of the Executive Committee, 
through our core team, to our individual 
sponsors — we have key people driving 
responsibility throughout Shire. A number 
of internal responsibility leaders serve 
as sponsors for focus areas such as 
the environment, our people and the 
community. They are responsible for 
setting goals which support our overall 
strategy, ensuring progress and maintaining 
high standards. Our sponsors include 
senior representatives from Research 
& Development, Human Resources, 
Procurement, Health, Safety and 
Environmental, Compliance and Risk 
Management, Pharmacovigilance, Corporate 
Communications, Patient Advocacy and 
Public Affairs. Our Responsibility team 
facilitates the activities of responsibility 
working groups, oversees communications 
and works with sponsors to identify 
risks and opportunities. Our approach to 
responsibility is championed by our CEO, 
supported by the Executive, In-line, Pipeline 
and Corporate Committees, and endorsed 
by our Board.
Engaging with our 
stakeholders
During the year we engaged with investors, 
patient groups and policy makers on a 
range of issues including our environmental 
approaches and disclosure, our approach 
to clinical trials, our role in ensuring the 
appropriate use of our ADHD products, 
philanthropy and access to medicines. 
We communicate widely and regularly 
on responsibility with all our stakeholders, 
for example through our website,  
www.shire.com. We’re always interested 
to hear feedback and suggestions 
on how we can be an even more 
responsible organization.
Moving forward
We continue to look ahead and strive to 
improve as a responsible leader in the 
biotech industry focused on rare diseases 
and specialty conditions. Our distinctive 
position in the industry creates a great 
requirement and opportunity to keep 
moving forward with responsibility, as 
with every core aspect of our business.
To coincide with our 30th anniversary in 
February 2016, we launched a three-year 
partnership with the SeriousFun Children’s 
Network to enable hundreds of children 
with rare diseases to attend camps 
exclusively for children with serious illnesses. 
We also announced that Shire will fund ten 
genetic fellowships to help better support 
the next generation of patients. It’s an 
example of our commitment to lead by 
doing the right things to make a long-
lasting impact.

 Shire Annual Report 2015 35 Shire’s risk management strategy is to identify, 
assess and mitigate any significant risks that it 
faces. Despite this, no risk management strategy 
can provide absolute assurance against loss.
Risk management 
framework 
As a highly regulated biopharmaceutical 
company with a keen patient focus, Shire 
has implemented policies and procedures 
intended to reduce risk and to ensure 
appropriate and lawful conduct within the 
increasing number of countries in which 
the Company operates. Success in these 
areas is of benefit to shareholders and 
other stakeholders alike. Shire’s risk 
management strategy is to identify, assess 
and mitigate any significant risks that it 
faces. Despite this, it should be noted that 
no risk management strategy can provide 
absolute assurance against loss.
Board of Directors
The Board is responsible for determining 
the Group’s risk tolerance and for ensuring 
the maintenance of sound systems of risk 
management and internal control. In 
fulfilling this responsibility, the Board sets 
Shire’s corporate risk culture; ensuring its 
dissemination throughout the organization. 
This is achieved through interaction with 
key stakeholders which, in turn, enables 
the Board to monitor and review the Group’s 
risks as well as its risk management and 
internal control systems. During the year 
the Board undertook a robust assessment 
of the principal risks facing the Company, 
including those that might threaten its 
business model, future performance, 
solvency or liquidity. Stakeholders to the 
risk management framework, which is 
overseen by the Board and designed to 
manage and mitigate the Group’s risks, 
are detailed below.
Audit, Compliance & Risk Committee
The Committee supports the Board by, 
on a biannual basis, reviewing and 
reporting on the principal risks faced by 
the Company, with each assessed on 
likelihood of materialization and potential 
impact. Furthermore, alongside the Board 
the Committee monitors and reviews the 
risk management and internal control 
systems; ensuring oversight through its 
interaction with functional stakeholders, 
through its review and challenge of key 
risk and control processes and through 
its evaluation of key strategy updates 
from management. 
Executive Committee
The Committee is responsible for ensuring 
the implementation of the risk management 
and internal control infrastructure; overseeing 
its operation and ensuring it remains 
effective. Committee members receive 
regular updates from functional stakeholders 
and, along with the Chief Compliance and 
Risk Officer and the Head of Internal Audit, 
are responsible for

Compliance & Risk (“ACR”) Committee as 
required. In addition, on a biannual basis the 
Committee validates any significant risks 
put forward by the Risk Council; identifying 
and putting forward for review by the ACR 
Committee those that have the capacity 
to materially impact the Group’s strategy. 
Risk Council
The Risk Council comprises senior members 
of the Company’s business units and 
corporate functions, including the Head 
of Internal Audit, and is chaired by the 
Chief Compliance and Risk Officer. The 
Council is charged with overseeing risk 
management at an operational level; 
ensuring that each identified risk is 
allocated an “owner” within the business 
who is responsible for related management 
and mitigation activities. As part of the 
biannual risk review process the Council 
appraises risk schedules produced by 
individual business units and corporate 
functions; validating and revising assessments 
made and evaluating mitigation practices. 
A report is prepared for review by the 
Executive Committee detailing all risks 
meeting a prescribed threshold along 
with recommendations on their mitigation. 
The Chief Compliance and Risk Officer 
then presents these matters to the ACR 
Committee; highlighting those risks of 
strategic importance to the Company.
Global Compliance and Risk 
Management Department
The Department, led by the Chief 
Compliance and Risk Officer, is made 
up of compliance, privacy, corporate 
security and risk management, and Health, 
Safety & Environment sub-teams. It is 
responsible for supporting the development, 
implementation and maintenance of 
effective compliance and risk management 
systems. This is achieved through policy 
development, the delivery of training programs 
and communications, and through the 
ongoing monitoring of compliance and 
risk-assessed activity, with follow-up 
investigation undertaken where necessary. 
Such activity provides for the timely 
undertaking of mitigation and/or remediation 
actions, as well for the escalation of matters 
to the ACR Committee and to the Board 
as appropriate. In addition, the Chief 
Compliance and Risk Officer provides regular 
updates to the ACR Committee on all matters 
falling within the Department’s remit. 
Chief Compliance and Risk Officer
The Chief Compliance and Risk Officer 
is responsible for the global compliance 
program and for coordinating oversight 
of risk mitigation activity through the 
Enterprise Risk Management process. 
In addition to maintaining relationships 
with assurance functions outside of the 
Global Compliance and Risk Management 
Department, the Chief Compliance and 
Risk Officer has direct access to the Board 
and the ACR Committee; providing an 
independent mechanism of escalation, 
should the need arise. The Chief Compliance 
and Risk Officer provides twice-yearly 
updates to the ACR Committee on risk 
and risk mitigation, as well as more regular 
updates regarding compliance monitoring 
and investigation. 
Internal Audit
The Internal Audit function provides 
independent assurance to the ACR 
Committee with respect to the operation 
of internal control and risk management 
systems. 
Business units and corporate functions
Business units and corporate functions 
are responsible for implementing risk 
management processes and establishing 
internal controls within their respective 
organizations in accordance with a 
centrally approved framework. In addition, 
each produces a schedule of material risks 
and associated mitigation plans as part of 
the Group’s biannual review process for 
submission to the Risk Council.
Risk factors
Set out below are the principal risk factors 
associated with the business that have 
been identified through the Company’s risk 
management and internal control systems. 
The Company believes that these risk 
factors apply equally and therefore all 
should be carefully considered before 
any investment is made in Shire.
The Company’s products may not be 
a commercial success.
The commercial success of the Company’s 
marketed products and other new products 
that the Company may launch in the 
future, will depend on their approval and 
acceptance by physicians, patients and 
other key decision-makers, as well as the 
receipt of marketing approvals in different 
countries, the time taken to obtain such 
approvals, the scope of marketing approvals 
as reflected in the product labels, approval 
of reimbursement at commercially 
sustainable prices in those countries 
where price and reimbursement is 
negotiated, and safety, efficacy, convenience 
and cost-effectiveness of the product as 
compared to competitive products. 
The Company’s revenues, financial 
condition or results of operations may 
be adversely affected if any or all of the 
following occur: 
 > if the Company’s products, or 
competitive products, are genericized; 
 > if the prices of the Company’s products 
suffer forced reductions or if prices of 
competitor products are reduced 
significantly; 
 > if there are unanticipated adverse events 
experienced with the Company’s 
products or those of a competitor’s 
product not seen in clinical trials that 
impact physicians’ willingness to 
prescribe the Company’s products; 
 > if issues arise from clinical trials being 
conducted for post-marketing purposes 
or for registration in another country 
which raise questions or concerns about 
a product; 
 > if the regulatory agencies in one country 
act in a way that raises concerns for 
regulatory agencies or for prescribers or 
patients in another country; 
 > if patients, payers or physicians favor 
other treatments over the Company’s 
products; 
 > if the Company’s products are subject 
to more stringent government regulation 
than competitor products; 
 > if patent protection or other forms of 
exclusivity are lost or curtailed, or if 
competitors are able to successfully 
challenge or circumvent the Company’s 
patents or other forms of exclusivity 
(See Note 18, “Commitments and 
Contingencies, Legal and other 
proceedings” to the consolidated 
financial statements set forth in this 
Annual Report; 
 > if launches of the Company’s products 
in new markets are not successful; 
 > if the sizes of the patient populations for 
the Company’s products are less than 
expected; or 
 > if there are lawsuits filed against Shire, 
including but not limited to, product 
liability claims, consumer law claims, 
and payer or reimbursement litigation. 
If the Company is unable to commercialize 
its products successfully, there may be a 
material adverse effect on the Company’s 
revenues, financial condition or results 
of operations.
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information
 Shire Annual Report 2015 37  > price controls, unsuccessful government 
tenders, or non-reimbursement of new 
medicines or new indications.
Moreover, the cost of treatment for 
some of the Company’s products is high, 
particularly those which are used for the 
treatment of rare diseases. The Company 
may encounter difficulty in obtaining or 
maintaining satisfactory pricing and 
reimbursement for such products. The 
failure to obtain and maintain pricing and 
reimbursement at satisfactory levels for 
its products may adversely affect the 
Company’s revenues, financial condition 
or results of operations.
The Company depends on third parties 
to supply certain inputs and services 
critical to its operations including 
certain inputs, services and ingredients 
critical to its manufacturing processes.
The Company relies on third-party 
suppliers, vendors and outsourcing 
partners to, among other things, research, 
develop, manufacture and commercialize 
its products, to provide certain key 
ingredients and manufacturing inputs and 
to manage certain sales, distribution, 
marketing, information technology, 
accounting, transaction-processing and 
other business services. While the Company 
depends on these third parties for multiple 
aspects of its product development, 
manufacturing, commercialization and 
business activities, it does not control 
these third parties directly.
As a result, there is a possibility these 
third parties may not complete activities 
on schedule or in accordance with the 
Company’s expectations, and their failure 
to meet certain contractual, regulatory or 
other obligations to Shire, or any disruption 
of Shire’s relationship with these third 
parties could delay or prevent the 
development, approval, manufacture 
or commercialization of the Company’s 
products, result in non-compliance with 
applicable laws and regulations, disrupt 
Shire’s operations, or result in reputational 
or other harm to the Company.
This outsourcing risk is of particular concern 
with respect to third-party suppliers of 
key manufacturing inputs of Shire’s drug 
products. Although the Company dual-
sources certain key products and/or active 
ingredients, the Company currently relies 
on a single source for production of the 
final drug product for each of ADDERALL 
XR, CINRYZE, FIRAZYR, FOSRENOL, 
INTUNIV, LIALDA, PENTASA and NATPARA/ 
NATPAR. The Company currently relies on 
a single active ingredient source for each 
of ELAPRASE, FIRAZYR, FOSRENOL, 
INTUNIV, REPLAGAL and GATTEX/
REVESTIVE and also relies on limited third 
party sources to provide the donated 
human plasma necessary for the 
manufacture of CINRYZE. Following the 
completion of the acquisition of Dyax Corp 
on January 22, 2016 Shire acquired 
DX-2930, which currently relies on separate 
sole sources for both production of the 
final drug product and supply of the active 
ingredient for its Phase 3 trial. In addition, 
one of those drug substance sites has not 
been approved by the FDA and would need 
to be approved prior to commercial launch. 
Any failure by a single-source supplier to 
provide the Company with the required 
volumes on time or at all, or to provide 
products that do not meet regulatory 
requirements, could lead to significant 
delays in the production of Shire’s products, 
increases in operating costs, lost product 
sales, an interruption of research activities, 
or the delay of new product launches, all of 
which could have a material adverse effect 
on the Company’s revenues, financial 
condition or results of operations. 
Any disruption to the supply chain 
for any of the Company’s products, 
or any difficulties or delays in the 
manufacturing, distribution and sale of 
its products may result in the Company 
being unable to continue marketing or 
developing a product, or may result in 
the Company being unable to do so on 
a commercially viable basis for some 
period of time.
A disruption, delay or other difficulties in 
the manufacturing, distribution and sale 
of Shire’s products, or in the supply chain 
of any of its products, may have a material 
adverse effect on the Company and 
its revenues, financial condition and 
results of operations. Examples of 
such manufacturing and supply chain 
difficulties include, but are not limited to:
 > regulatory or enforcement actions 
that result in shut-downs, delays in 
or withdrawal of regulatory approvals 
necessary to carry on manufacturing 
activities, product recalls and penalties 
or fines resulting in unanticipated costs in 
production, whether imposed directly on 
the Company or imposed indirectly through 
one or more of its third-party suppliers;
 > the inability of the Company to increase 
its production capacity for certain drugs 
commensurate with market demand; 
 > the possibility that the supply of incoming 
materials may be delayed or become 
unavailable and that the quality of 
incoming materials may be substandard 
and not detected; 
Principal risks and uncertainties 
continued
Increased pricing pressures and limits 
on patient access as a result of 
governmental regulations and market 
developments may affect the Company’s 
future revenues, financial condition and 
results of operations.
The Company’s product revenues are subject 
to increasing pressures from governmental 
initiatives to regulate or influence prices 
and access to customers. Regulations in 
the United States, the European Union and 
other jurisdictions mandating price controls 
or imposing constraints on patients’ ability 
to purchase Shire’s products significantly 
impacts its business, and the Company’s 
financial condition and results of operations 
could be adversely affected in the future 
by changes in such regulations, practices 
or policies.
Regulatory measures that could have a 
material adverse effect on the Company 
include the imposition of government-
approved drug pricing schedules, the 
use of drug formularies, prohibitions on 
direct-to-consumer advertising or drug 
marketing practices and caps or limits on 
the level of reimbursement provided to the 
Company by governmental reimbursement 
schemes for its products. 
These pressures have also resulted in market 
developments, such as the consolidation 
of managed care organizations and private 
health insurers, that have increased the 
relative bargaining power of institutional 
drug purchasers and enhanced their ability 
to negotiate discounts and extract other 
concessions in exchange for purchasing 
Shire’s products.
Such regulatory and market developments 
create downward pressures on the prices at 
which the Company can offer its products 
and on the level of reimbursement its 
treatments receive from health care providers, 
private health insurers and other organizations, 
such as health maintenance organizations 
and managed care organizations. 
Additional factors affecting the Company’s 
ability to obtain and maintain adequate 
prices and levels of reimbursement for its 
products include: 
 > higher levels of controls on the use 
of the Company’s products and/or 
requirements for further price 
concessions mandated or negotiated 
by managed health care organizations 
or government authorities; 
 > legislative proposals to reform health 
care and government insurance

markets; and

to maintain appropriate quality standards 
throughout its internal and third-party 
supply network, or to comply with 
current manufacturing best practices, 
rules or other applicable regulations; 
 > disruptions to supply chain continuity as 
a result of natural or man-made disasters 
at the Company’s facilities or at one or 
more of its third-party suppliers’ facilities; 
and
 > failure to maintain the integrity of the 
Company’s supply chains against fraudulent 
and criminal acts, such as intentional 
product adulteration, diversion, theft, 
or counterfeiting activities.
Also, as noted above, the Company has 
also entered into many agreements with 
third parties for the provision of goods and 
services to enable it to manufacture its 
products. If these third parties are unable 
to manufacture products, or provide these 
goods and services, in each case in 
accordance with its respective contractual 
obligations, the Company’s ability to 
manage its manufacturing processes or to 
operate its business, including to continue 
the development or commercialization of 
its products as planned or on a commercial 
basis, may be adversely impacted.
The manufacture of the Company’s 
products is subject to extensive 
oversight by various regulatory 
agencies. Regulatory approvals or 
interventions associated with changes 
to manufacturing sites, ingredients or 
manufacturing processes could lead 
to significant delays, an increase in 
operating costs, lost product sales, 
an interruption of research activities 
or the delay of new product launches.
Pharmaceutical and device manufacturing 
sites must be inspected and approved by 
regulatory agencies such as the FDA, and 
similar agencies in other countries. Active 
ingredients, excipients and packaging 
materials used in the manufacturing 
process must be obtained from sources 
approved by regulatory agencies. 
The development, approval and 
manufacturing of the Company’s products 
depend on the ability to procure ingredients 
and packaging materials from approved 
sources and for the manufacturing 
process to be conducted at approved 
sites. Changes of manufacturer or changes 
of source of ingredients or packaging 
materials must generally be approved by 
the regulatory agencies, which will involve 
testing and additional inspections to ensure 
compliance with the applicable regulatory 
agency’s regulations and standards. 
The need to qualify a new manufacturer 
or source of ingredients or packaging 
materials can take a significant amount 
of time. Should it become necessary to 
change a manufacturer or supplier of 
ingredients or packaging materials, or to 
qualify an additional supplier, the Company 
may not be able do so quickly, or at all, 
which could delay or disrupt the 
manufacturing process. 
US-based manufacturers must be registered 
with the DEA and similar regulatory 
authorities in other countries if they handle 
controlled substances. Certain of the 
Company’s products, including ADDERALL 
XR and VYVANSE, contain ingredients 
which are controlled substances subject 
to quotas managed by the DEA. As a 
result, the Company’s procurement and 
production quotas may not be sufficient 
to meet commercial demand. 
CINRYZE, ELAPRASE, REPLAGAL and 
VPRIV are manufactured using highly 
complex biological processes. The complexity 
of the manufacturing results in a number 
of risks, including the risk of microbial 
contamination. Additionally, CINRYZE 
is derived from human plasma, and is 
therefore subject to the risk of biological 
contamination inherent in plasma-derived 
products. The sole manufacturer of CINRYZE 
has received observations on Form 483 
and a warning letter from the FDA 
identifying issues with respect to the 
manufacturing process for CINRYZE which 
must be addressed to the satisfaction 
of the FDA. Any regulatory interventions, 
in relation to these, or any other issues, 
if they occur, may delay or disrupt the 
manufacture of the Company’s products. 
The failure to obtain regulatory approvals 
promptly or at all and/or regulatory 
interventions associated with changes 
to manufacturing sites, ingredients or 
manufacturing processes could lead to 
significant delays, an increase in operating 
costs, lost product sales, an interruption 
of research activities, the delay of new 
product launches or constraints on 
manufacturing output, all of which could 
have a material adverse effect on the 
Company’s revenues, financial condition 
and results of operations. 
The Company has a portfolio of 
products in various stages of research 
and development. The successful 
development of these products is highly 
uncertain and requires significant 
expenditures and time, and there is 
no guarantee that these products will 
receive regulatory approval.
Products that initially appear promising 
in research or development may be 
delayed or fail to reach later stages of 
development as: 
 > preclinical or clinical tests may show 
the product to lack safety or efficacy; 
 > delays may be caused by slow enrollment 
in clinical studies; regulatory requirements 
for clinical trial drug supplies; extended 
length of time to achieve study endpoints; 
additional time requirements for data 
analysis or dossier preparation; time 
required for discussions with regulatory 
agencies, including regulatory agency 
requests for additional preclinical or clinical 
data; delays at regulatory agencies 
due to staffing or resource limitations; 
analysis of or changes to study 
design; unexpected safety, efficacy, or 
manufacturing issues; delays may arise 
from shared control with collaborative 
partners in the planning and execution 
of the product development, scaling of 
the manufacturing process, or getting 
approval for manufacturing; 
 > manufacturing issues, pricing or 
reimbursement issues, or other factors may 
render the product economically unviable; 
 > the proprietary rights of others and their 
competing products and technologies 
may prevent the product from being 
developed or commercialized; or 
 > submission of an application for regulatory 
approval of any of the Company’s product 
candidates may be subjected to lengthy 
review and ultimately rejected. 
Success in preclinical and early clinical 
trials does not ensure that late stage 
clinical trials will be successful. Clinical 
results are frequently susceptible to varying 
interpretations that may delay, limit, or 
prevent regulatory approvals. The length 
of time necessary to complete clinical trials 
and to submit an application for marketing 
approval for a final decision by a regulatory 
authority varies significantly and may 
be difficult to predict. Moreover, once 
an application is submitted, additional 
data may be sought by regulators or 
an application may be rejected. If the 
Company’s large-scale or late-stage clinical 
trials for a product are not successful, the 
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information
 Shire Annual Report 2015 39 of, pharmaceutical products and medical 
devices in a number of jurisdictions around 
the world. The promotion, marketing and 
sale of pharmaceutical products and 
medical devices is highly regulated and the 
sales and marketing practices of market 
participants, such as the Company, have 
been subject to increasing supervision by 
governmental authorities, and Shire 
believes that this trend will continue.
In the United States, the Company’s sales 
and marketing activities are monitored by 
a number of regulatory authorities and law 
enforcement agencies, including the US 
Department of HHS, the FDA, the US 
Department of Justice, the SEC and the 
DEA. These authorities and agencies and 
their equivalents in countries outside the 
US have broad authority to investigate 
market participants for potential violations 
of laws relating to the sale, marketing and 
promotion of pharmaceutical products and 
medical devices, including the False Claims 
Act, the Anti-Kickback Statute and the 
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, among 
others, for alleged improper conduct, 
including corrupt payments to government 
officials, improper payments to medical 
professionals, off-label marketing of 
pharmaceutical products and medical 
devices, and the submission of false 
claims for reimbursement by the federal 
government. Healthcare companies may 
also be subject to enforcement actions or 
prosecution for such improper conduct. 
Any inquiries or investigations into the 
operations of, or enforcement or other 
regulatory action against, the Company by 
such authorities could result in significant 
defense costs, fines, penalties and 
injunctive or administrative remedies, 
distract management to the detriment of 
the business, result in the exclusion of 
certain products, or the Company, from 
government reimbursement programs or 
subject the Company to regulatory controls 
or government monitoring of its activities 
in the future. The Company is also subject 
to certain ongoing investigations by 
governmental agencies. For further 
information, see Note 18, “Commitments 
and Contingencies, Legal and other 
proceedings” to the consolidated financial 
statements set forth in this Annual Report.
The Company’s products are subject 
to intense competition from generics.
Shire faces significant competition from the 
manufacturers of generic drug products in 
all of its major markets. The introduction of 
lower-priced generics by the Company’s 
competitors or their successful efforts in 
aggressively commercializing and marketing 
their alternative drug products pose 
significant challenges to maintaining Shire’s 
market share, revenues and sales growth. 
For example, since 2009, generic versions 
of ADDERALL XR have been marketed 
and, since 2014, generic versions of 
INTUNIV have been marketed in the United 
States. As a result, product sales of 
ADDERALL XR and INTUNIV have declined. 
Factors which could cause further or more 
rapid declines in Shire’s product sales include:
 > the loss or earlier than expected expiration 
of intellectual property rights or regulatory 
exclusivity periods with respect to the 
Company’s branded products;
 > generic or authorized generic versions of 
these products capturing more of Shire’s 
branded market share than expected; 
 > lower prices and the actual or perceived 
greater effectiveness or safety of generic 
drug products relative to Shire’s branded 
products;
 > the FDA approving additional ANDAs 
for generic versions of these products 
which, if launched, would further reduce 
branded market share or impact the 
amount of Shire’s authorized generic 
product sales; 
 > changes in reimbursement policies of 
third-party payers; or 
 > changes to the level of sales deductions 
for branded Shire products for private or 
public payers. 
Should any of the above developments 
occur, the resulting generic competition 
could reduce sales and market share of 
Shire’s branded products and have a 
material adverse effect on the Company’s 
revenues, financial condition or results 
of operations.
Adverse outcomes in legal matters and 
other disputes, including the Company’s 
ability to enforce and defend patents 
and other intellectual property rights 
required for its business, could have 
a material adverse effect on the 
Company’s revenues, financial 
condition or results of operations.
During the ordinary course of its business 
the Company may be involved in claims, 
disputes and litigation with third parties, 
employees, regulatory agencies, 
governmental authorities and other parties. 
The range of matters of a legal nature that 
might arise is extremely broad but could 
include, without limitation, intellectual 
property claims and disputes, product 
liability claims and disputes, regulatory 
litigation, contract claims and disputes, 
employment claims and disputes, and 
tax or other governmental agency audits 
and disputes. 
Principal risks and uncertainties 
continued
Company will not recover its substantial 
investments in that product. The Company 
has a range of programs in or entering late 
stage clinical development. For example, 
an NDA for SHP606 for the treatment of 
signs and symptoms of adults with DED is 
currently in registration with the FDA and 
following the acquisition of Dyax in January 
2016 the Company has acquired SHP643 
(formerly DX-2930) for the treatment of 
HAE, which is in Phase 3. 
In addition, even if the products receive 
regulatory approval, they remain subject to 
ongoing regulatory requirements, including, 
for example, obligations to conduct 
additional clinical trials or other non-clinical 
testing, changes to the product label 
(which could impact its marketability and 
prospects for commercial success), new 
or revised requirements for manufacturing, 
written notifications to physicians, or 
product recalls or withdrawals.
The actions of certain customers could 
affect the Company’s ability to sell or 
market products profitably. Fluctuations 
in buying or distribution patterns by 
such customers can adversely affect 
the Company’s revenues, financial 
conditions or results of operations.
A considerable portion of the Company’s 
product sales are made to major 
pharmaceutical wholesale distributors, 
as well as to large pharmacies, in both 
the US and Europe. In 2015, for example, 
47% of the Company’s product sales were 
attributable to three customers in the US: 
AmerisourceBergen Drug Corp., McKesson 
Corp. and Cardinal Health, Inc. In the event 
of financial failure of any of these customers 
there could be a material adverse effect 
on the Company’s revenues, financial 
condition or results of operations. The 
Company’s revenues, financial condition or 
results of operations may also be affected 
by fluctuations in customer buying or 
distribution patterns. These fluctuations 
may result from seasonality, pricing, 
wholesaler inventory objectives, or other 
factors. A significant portion of the Company’s 
revenues for certain products for treatment 
of rare diseases are concentrated within 
a small number of customers. Changes 
in the buying patterns of those customers 
may have an adverse effect on the Company’s 
revenues, financial condition or results 
of operations.
Failure to comply with laws and 
regulations governing the sales and 
marketing of its products could materially 
impact Shire’s revenues and profitability.
The Company engages in various 
marketing, promotional and educational 
activities pertaining to, as well as the sale 
40 Shire Annual Report 2015 Any unfavorable outcome in such matters 
could adversely impact the Company’s 
ability to develop or commercialize its 
products, adversely affect the profitability 
of existing products, subject the Company 
to significant defense costs, fines, penalties, 
audit findings and injunctive or administrative 
remedies, distract management to the 
detriment of the business, result in the 
exclusion of certain products, or the Company, 
from government reimbursement programs 
or subject the Company to regulatory 
controls or government monitoring of its 
activities in the future. Any such outcomes 
could have a material adverse effect on 
the Company’s revenue, financial condition 
or results of operations. For further 
information see Note 18, “Commitments 
and Contingencies, Legal and other 
proceedings” to the consolidated financial 
statements set forth in this Annual Report. 
The Company faces intense competition 
for highly qualified personnel from other 
companies and organizations.
The Company relies on recruiting and 
retaining highly skilled employees to meet 
its strategic objectives. The Company faces 
intense competition for highly qualified 
personnel and the supply of people with 
the requisite skills may be limited, generally 
or geographically. The range of skills 
required and the geographies in which 
they are required by the Company may 
also change over time as Shire’s business 
evolves. If the Company is unable to retain 
key personnel or attract new personnel 
with the requisite skills and experience, it 
could adversely affect the implementation 
of the Company’s strategic objectives and 
ultimately adversely impact the Company’s 
revenues, financial condition or results 
of operations. 
Failure to successfully execute or attain 
strategic objectives from the Company’s 
acquisitions and growth strategy may 
adversely affect the Company’s financial 
condition and results of operations.
The Company’s business depends to a 
significant extent on its ability to improve 
and expand its product pipeline through 
strategic acquisitions. Such improvements 
and expansions, however, are subject to 
the ability of the Company’s management 
to effectively identify appropriate strategic 
targets and effectuate the contemplated 
transactions, the availability and relative 
cost of acquisition opportunities as well 
as competition from other pharmaceutical 
companies seeking similar opportunities. 
Moreover, even when such transactions are 
successfully executed, the Company may 
face subsequent difficulties in integrating 
the operations, infrastructure and personnel 
of acquired businesses and may experience 
unanticipated risks or liabilities that were 
not discovered, accurately disclosed 
or sufficiently assessed during the 
transactions’ due diligence process. 
Finally, even successfully acquired and 
integrated businesses may ultimately fail 
or fall short of achieving the Company’s 
strategic objectives for the transaction 
over the long term. 
Any failures in the execution of a transaction, 
in the integration of an acquired business 
or in achieving the Company’s strategic 
objectives with respect to such acquisitions 
could result in slower growth, higher than 
expected costs, the recording of asset 
impairment charges and other actions 
which could adversely affect the Company’s 
business, financial condition and results 
of operations.
The Company has recently completed and 
is currently pursuing a number of strategic 
acquisitions. On February 21, 2015, Shire 
completed the acquisition of NPS Pharma 
for a total cash consideration of 
approximately $5.2 billion. On January 22, 
2016 Shire also completed the acquisition 
of all the outstanding share capital of 
Dyax for a total upfront cash consideration 
of approximately $5.9 billion and a 
further approximately $0.6 billion in cash 
consideration contingent upon the 
approval of DX-2930 for the prophylactic 
treatment of HAE. Finally, on January 11, 
2016 Shire announced a combination with 
Baxalta Incorporated had been agreed by 
both Boards.
These proposed and completed 
acquisitions as well as future acquisitions 
each entail various risks, which include but 
are not limited to:
 > a proposed acquisition may not be 
consummated due to the occurrence of 
an event, change or other circumstances 
that gives rise to the termination of the 
applicable merger agreement;
 > a governmental, regulatory, board, 
shareholder or other approval required 
for a proposed acquisition may not be 
obtained, or may be obtained subject 
to conditions that are not anticipated, 
or another condition to the closing 
of a proposed acquisition may not 
be satisfied, resulting in delays or 
ultimate failure of consummating 
a proposed acquisition;
 > shareholders may initiate legal action 
to prevent or delay consummation 
of a proposed acquisition or to seek 
judicial reevaluation of a proposed 
acquisition’s consideration;
 > a lengthy, uncertain process when 
pursuing a combination could disrupt 
relationships between Shire and a target 
company’s customers, suppliers and 
employees, distract Shire’s or a target’s 
management from operating its business, 
and could lead to additional and 
unanticipated costs;
 > a target company may be unable to 
retain and hire key personnel and/or 
maintain its relationships with customers, 
suppliers and other business partners 
pending the consummation of the 
proposed acquisition by Shire;
 > after the consummation of an acquisition, 
the Company may be unable to retain 
the acquired company’s key personnel, 
existing customers, suppliers and 
other business partners or attract 
new customers;
 > the businesses of an acquired company 
may be otherwise disrupted by the 
acquisition, including increased costs 
and diversion of its respective 
management’s time and resources;
 > failure to achieve the targeted growth 
and expected benefits of the acquisition 
if sales of an acquired company’s 
products are lower than anticipated, or 
these products cannot be successfully 
commercialized or cannot obtain 
necessary regulatory approvals;
 > any integration of an acquired company 
into Shire could be complex and 
time-consuming, and difficulties in 
effectuating these integrations may lead 
to the combined companies not being 
able to realize the expected operating 
efficiencies, cost savings, revenue 
enhancements, synergies or other benefits 
in the timeframe anticipated, or at all;
 > failure to successfully obtain regulatory 
approval of an acquired company’s late 
stage pipeline assets in a timely manner 
or at all, or to successfully commercialize 
such products after regulatory approval 
has been obtained;
 > undiscovered or unanticipated risks and 
liabilities, including legal and compliance 
related liabilities, may emerge in 
connection with an acquisition, or 
may be higher than anticipated; and
 > even after successfully completing an 
acquisition and integrating the acquired 
company’s businesses into Shire, the 
anticipated benefits of the combinations 
may ultimately prove less than anticipated.
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information
 Shire Annual Report 2015 41 The failure of a strategic partner to 
develop and commercialize products 
could result in delays in development, 
approval or loss of revenue.
The Company enters into strategic 
partnerships with other companies in areas 
such as product development, manufacturing, 
sales and marketing. In these partnerships, 
the Company is sometimes dependent on 
its partner to deliver results. While these 
partnerships are governed by contracts, 
the Company may not exercise direct control. 
If a partner fails to perform or experiences 
financial difficulties, the Company may 
suffer a delay in the development, a delay 
in the approval or a reduction in sales, or 
royalties of a product. 
The failure to secure new products or 
compounds for development either 
through in-licensing, acquisition or 
internal research and development 
efforts, or the failure to realize expected 
benefits from acquisitions of businesses 
or products, may have an adverse 
impact on the Company’s future results.
The Company’s future results will depend, 
to a significant extent, upon its ability to 
develop, in-license or acquire new products 
or compounds, or to acquire other 
businesses. The expected benefits from 
acquired products, compounds or 
businesses may not be realized or may 
require significantly greater resources and 
expenditure than originally anticipated. 
The failure to realize expected benefits from 
acquisitions of businesses or products 
including those resulting from integration 
into the Company, or the failure to develop, 
in-license or acquire new products or 
compounds on a commercially viable 
basis, could have a material adverse effect 
on the Company’s revenues, financial 
condition or results of operations. 
The Company may fail to obtain, 
maintain, enforce or defend the 
intellectual property rights required 
to conduct its business.
The Company’s success depends upon 
its ability and the ability of its partners 
and licensors to protect their intellectual 
property rights. Where possible, the 
Company’s strategy is to register intellectual 
property rights, such as patents and 
trademarks. The Company also relies on 
various trade secrets, unpatented know-
how and technological innovations and 
contractual arrangements with third 
parties to maintain its competitive position. 
The failure to obtain, maintain, enforce 
or defend such intellectual property rights, 
for any reason, could allow third parties to 
make competing products or impact the 
Company’s ability to develop, manufacture 
and market its own products on a 
commercially viable basis, or at all, which 
could have a material adverse effect on the 
Company’s revenues, financial condition or 
results of operations. 
The Company intends to enforce its patent 
rights vigorously and believes that its 
commercial partners, licensors and third 
party manufacturers intend to enforce 
vigorously those patent rights they have 
licensed to the Company. However, the 
Company’s patent rights, and patent rights 
that the Company has licensed, may not 
provide valid patent protection sufficiently 
broad to prevent any third party from 
developing, using or commercializing 
products that are similar or functionally 
equivalent to the Company’s products or 
technologies. These patent rights may be 
challenged, revoked, invalidated, infringed 
or circumvented by third parties. Laws 
relating to such rights may in future also 
be changed or withdrawn. 
Additionally, the Company’s products, or 
the technologies or processes used to 
formulate or manufacture those products 
may now, or in the future, infringe the 
patent rights of third parties. It is also 
possible that third parties will obtain patent 
or other proprietary rights that might be 
necessary or useful for the development, 
manufacture or sale of the Company’s 
products. The Company may need to 
obtain licenses for intellectual property 
rights from others and may not be able 
to obtain these licenses on commercially 
reasonable terms, if at all. 
The Company also relies on trade 
secrets and other un-patented proprietary 
information, which it generally seeks to 
protect by confidentiality and nondisclosure 
agreements with its employees, consultants, 
advisors and partners. These agreements 
may not effectively prevent disclosure of 
confidential information and may not 
provide the Company with an adequate 
remedy in the event of unauthorized 
disclosure. In addition, if the Company’s 
employees, scientific consultants or 
partners develop inventions or processes 
that may be applicable to the Company’s 
products under development, such 
inventions and processes will not necessarily 
become the Company’s property, but may 
remain the property of those persons or 
their employers. 
The Company has filed applications to 
register various trademarks for use in 
connection with its products in various 
countries and also, with respect to certain 
products, relies on the trademarks of third 
parties. These trademarks may not afford 
adequate protection or the Company or the 
third parties may not have the financial 
resources to enforce their rights under 
these trademarks which may enable 
others to use the trademarks and dilute 
their value. 
Principal risks and uncertainties 
continued
A slowdown of global economic growth, 
or economic instability of countries in 
which the Company does business, 
could have negative consequences for 
the Company’s business and increase 
the risk of non-payment by the 
Company’s customers.
Growth of the global pharmaceutical 
market has become increasingly tied to 
global economic growth. Accordingly a 
substantial and lasting slowdown of the 
global economy, or major national economies, 
could negatively affect growth in the 
markets in which the Company operates. 
Such a slowdown, or any resultant austerity 
measures adopted by governments in 
response to a slowdown, could result in 
national governments making significant 
cuts to their public spending, including 
national healthcare budgets, or reducing 
the level of reimbursement they are willing 
and able to provide to the Company for 
its products and, as a result, adversely 
affect the Company’s revenues, financial 
condition or results of operations.
A slowdown of a nation’s economy could 
also lead to financial difficulties for some 
of the Company’s significant customers, 
including national governments, and result 
in a greater risk of delayed orders or 
payments, defaults or non-payments of 
outstanding payment obligations by the 
Company’s customers in that country, 
which could adversely affect the 
Company’s revenues, financial condition 
or results of operations. 
The Company is subject to evolving and 
complex tax laws, which may result in 
additional liabilities that may adversely 
affect the Company’s financial condition 
or results of operations.
The Company is subject to evolving and 
complex tax laws in the jurisdictions in 
which it operates, and routinely obtains 
advice on matters, including the tax 
treatment of the break fee received in 
connection with the terminated offer for 
Shire by AbbVie Inc. (“AbbVie”) in 2014. 
Significant judgment is required in determining 
the Company’s tax liabilities, and the 
Company’s tax returns are periodically 
examined by various tax authorities. 
The Company regularly assesses the 
likelihood of outcomes resulting from these 
examinations to determine the adequacy 
of its accrual for tax contingencies; 
however, due to the complexity of tax 
contingencies, the ultimate resolution of 
any tax matters may result in payments 
greater or less than amounts accrued. 
In addition, the Company may be affected 
by changes in tax laws, including tax 
rate changes, new tax laws, and revised 
tax law interpretations in domestic and 
foreign jurisdictions.
42 Shire Annual Report 2015 In the regular course of business, the 
Company is party to litigation or other 
proceedings relating to intellectual 
property rights. For details of current 
intellectual property litigation, See Note 18, 
“Commitments and Contingencies, Legal 
and other proceedings” to the consolidated 
financial statements set forth in this 
Annual Report.
The introduction of new products by 
competitors may impact future revenues.
The pharmaceutical, biotechnology and 
device industries are highly competitive and 
are characterized by substantial investment 
in continuous product development and 
technological change. The Company 
faces significant competition from large 
pharmaceutical and biotechnology 
companies, many of whom have 
substantially greater resources than the 
Company. In addition, many of the 
Company’s competitors have more products 
and have operated longer in the fields in 
which the Company competes. A number 
of companies are pursuing the development 
of technologies which compete with the 
Company’s existing products or research 
programs. These competitors include 
specialized pharmaceutical firms and large 
pharmaceutical companies acting either 
independently or together with other 
pharmaceutical companies. Furthermore, 
academic institutions, government 
agencies and other public and private 
organizations conducting research may 
seek patent protection and may establish 
collaborative arrangements for competitive 
products or programs. As a result of this 
competition the Company’s products 
could be rendered obsolete or uneconomic 
or lose market share following the 
development of new products, new methods 
of treatment, or technological advances 
in manufacturing or production by 
competitors which could adversely affect 
the Company’s revenues, financial 
condition, and results of operations. 
If a marketed product fails to work 
effectively or causes adverse side 
effects, this could result in damage 
to the Company’s reputation, the 
withdrawal of the product and legal 
action against the Company.
Unanticipated side effects or unfavorable 
publicity from complaints concerning any 
of the Company’s products, or those of its 
competitors, could have an adverse effect 
on the Company’s ability to obtain or 
maintain regulatory approvals or 
successfully market its products. The 
testing, manufacturing, marketing and 
sales of pharmaceutical products and 
medical devices entail a risk of product 
liability claims, product recalls, litigation 
and associated adverse publicity. The 
cost of defending against such claims is 
expensive even when the claims are not 
merited. A successful product liability claim 
against the Company could require the 
Company to pay a substantial monetary 
award. If, in the absence of adequate 
insurance coverage, the Company does 
not have sufficient financial resources to 
satisfy a liability resulting from such a claim 
or to fund the legal defense of such a claim, 
it could become insolvent. Product liability 
insurance coverage is expensive, difficult 
to obtain and may not be available in the 
future on acceptable terms. Although the 
Company carries product liability insurance 
when available, this coverage may not be 
adequate. In addition, it cannot be certain 
that insurance coverage for present or 
future products will be available. Moreover, 
an adverse judgment in a product liability 
suit, even if insured or eventually overturned 
on appeal, could generate substantial 
negative publicity about the Company’s 
products and business and inhibit or 
prevent commercialization of other products.
The Company is dependent on 
information technology and its systems 
and infrastructure face certain risks, 
including from service disruptions, the 
loss of sensitive or confidential 
information, cyber-attacks and other 
security breaches or data leakages that 
could have a material adverse effect 
on the Company’s revenues, financial 
condition or results of operations.
The Company relies to a large extent 
upon sophisticated information technology 
systems to operate its businesses. In the 
ordinary course of business, the Company 
collects, stores and transmits large amounts 
of confidential information (including, but 
not limited to, personal information and 
intellectual property), and it is critical that 
the Company does so in a secure manner 
to maintain the confidentiality and integrity 
of such confidential information. The 
size and complexity of the Company’s 
information technology and information 
security systems, and those of third-party 
vendors with whom the Company contracts 
(and the large amounts of confidential 
information that is present on them), make 
such systems potentially vulnerable to 
service interruptions or to security breaches 
from inadvertent or intentional actions by 
the Company’s employees or vendors, or 
from attacks by malicious third parties. 
The Company and its vendors’ 
sophisticated information technology 
operations are spread across multiple, 
sometimes inconsistent platforms, which 
pose difficulties in maintaining data integrity 
across systems. The ever-increasing use 
and evolution of technology, including 
cloud-based computing, creates 
opportunities for the unintentional 
dissemination or intentional destruction 
of confidential information stored in the 
Company’s systems. The Company and its 
vendors could also be susceptible to third 
party attacks on their information security 
systems, which attacks are of ever 
increasing levels of sophistication and are 
made by groups and individuals with 
a wide range of motives and expertise, 
including criminal groups, “hackers” and 
others. While the Company has taken steps 
to protect such information and invested 
heavily in information technology, there 
can be no assurance that these efforts will 
prevent service interruptions or security 
breaches in its systems, the loss of data 
or other confidential information due to a 
lack of redundant backup systems, or the 
unauthorized or inadvertent wrongful use 
or disclosure of confidential information 
that could adversely affect the Company’s 
business operations or result in the loss, 
dissemination, or misuse of critical or 
sensitive information. 
A breach of the Company’s security 
measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent 
disclosure, unapproved dissemination, 
misappropriation or misuse of trade 
secrets, proprietary information, or other 
confidential information, whether as a result 
of theft, hacking, fraud, trickery or other 
forms of deception, or for any other cause, 
could enable others to produce competing 
products, use the Company’s proprietary 
technology or information, and/or adversely 
affect the Company’s business position. 
Further, any such interruption, security 
breach, loss or disclosure of confidential 
information, could result in financial, legal, 
business, and reputational harm to the 
Company and could have a material 
adverse effect on the Company’s revenues, 
financial condition or results of operations.
In addition, legislators and/or regulators in 
countries in which the Company operates 
are increasingly adopting or revising privacy, 
information security and data protection 
laws, as well as focusing on increased 
privacy-related enforcement activity, that 
potentially could have a significant impact 
on the Company’s current and planned 
privacy, data protection and information 
security-related practices, its collection, 
use, sharing, retention and safeguarding 
of consumer and/or employee information, 
and some of its current or planned 
business activities.

 Shire Annual Report 2015 43 Risks related to the 
proposed merger with 
Baxalta Incorporated
Failure to consummate the merger as 
contemplated could negatively impact 
the price of the Company’s ordinary 
shares and ADSs and the future 
business and financial results of the 
Company and/or the combined company.
The consummation of the merger of 
BearTracks, Inc., a wholly-owned 
subsidiary of the Company (“Merger Sub”) 
within and into Baxalta, with Baxalta 
surviving the merger as a wholly-owned 
subsidiary of the Company (the “merger”) 
may be delayed, the merger may be 
consummated on terms different than 
those contemplated by Agreement and 
Plan of Merger, dated as of January 11, 
2016, as it may be amended from time 
to time, (“the merger agreement”) between 
the Company, Merger Sub and Baxalta, 
or the merger may not be consummated 
at all. Failure to consummate the merger 
would prevent the Company’s ordinary 
shareholders from realizing the anticipated 
benefits of the merger. The current market 
price of the Company’s ordinary shares 
and ADSs may reflect a market assumption 
that the merger will occur, and a failure to 
consummate the merger could result in a 
significant decline in the market price of the 
Company’s ordinary shares and ADSs and 
a negative perception of the Company 
generally. Any delay in the consummation 
of the merger or any uncertainty about the 
consummation of the merger could also 
negatively impact the share price and 
future business and financial results of the 
Company and/or the combined company 
following the proposed merger.
There is no assurance that Shire and 
Baxalta will be able to obtain the 
required governmental and regulatory 
approvals to consummate the merger, 
which, if delayed or not granted, may 
delay or jeopardize the merger. 
The merger is conditioned on the expiration 
or termination of the applicable waiting 
period (or extension thereof) under the 
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements 
Act of 1976, as amended, merger control 
approval under the relevant merger 
control laws of the European Union and 
the consent of certain other merger control 
authorities and other governmental entities. 
The governmental and regulatory agencies 
from which Shire and Baxalta are seeking 
these approvals have broad discretion in 
administering the applicable governing 
regulations. As a condition to their approval 
of the transactions contemplated by the 
merger agreement, those agencies may 
impose requirements, limitations or costs 
or require divestitures or place restrictions 
on the conduct of the combined company’s 
business. The required approvals may not 
be obtained or the required conditions to 
the merger may not be satisfied, or, even 
if the required approvals are obtained and 
the conditions to the consummation of the 
merger are satisfied, the terms, conditions 
and timing of such approvals are uncertain. 
Any delay in consummating the merger 
could cause Shire and/or the combined 
company not to realize some or all of the 
synergies that Shire expects to achieve if 
the merger is successfully consummated 
within the expected time frame.
The merger remains subject to additional 
conditions, some of which Shire and 
Baxalta cannot control, which could 
result in the merger not being 
consummated or being delayed, any of 
which could negatively impact the share 
price and future business and operating 
results of the Company and/or the 
combined company. 
The merger is subject to the satisfaction 
or waiver of other conditions in addition to 
the approval of governmental authorities 
described above, including, but not limited 
to, (i) the approval of the issuance of 
ordinary shares and ADSs by the 
Company’s ordinary shareholders; (ii) the 
adoption of the merger agreement by the 
stockholders of Baxalta; (iii) effectiveness 
of a registration statement on Form S-4 
registering ordinary shares to be issued in 
the merger; (iv) the absence of any orders, 
injunctions or rulings, or laws that would 
have the effect of enjoining or preventing 
the consummation of the merger; (v) the 
approval of the United Kingdom Listing 
Authority (the “UKLA”) of a prospectus 
relating to the ordinary shares and a circular 
convening a meeting of Shire’s ordinary 
shareholders; (vi) approval from the NASDAQ 
Global Select Market to list the ADSs; 
(vii) approval of the UKLA and London 
Stock Exchange to list the ordinary shares; 
and (viii) Section 4.02 of the tax matters 
agreement dated as of June 30, 2015 
(the “tax matters agreement”), by and 
between Baxter International Inc. (“Baxter”) 
and Baxalta, shall have been waived 
with respect to the closing of the merger, 
pursuant to the terms of the letter 
agreement, dated as of January 11, 2016 
(the “letter agreement”), among the 
Company, Baxter and Baxalta, and each 
of the Company and Baxalta shall have 
received from Baxter a certificate, as 
described in the letter agreement, to the 
effect that the tax advisor to Baxter has 
furnished an opinion in substantially the 
same form and substance as the tax 
opinion delivered by such advisor on the 
date immediately prior to the signing of the 
merger agreement. Certain conditions to 
the merger may not be satisfied or, if they 
are, the timing of such satisfaction is 
uncertain. If any conditions to the merger 
are not satisfied or, where waiver is 
permitted by applicable law, not waived, 
the merger will not be consummated. 
The merger is not subject to a financing 
condition. While Shire has secured an 
$18 billion fully underwritten bank facility 
of which $13 billion is available to finance 
the cash component of the per share 
merger consideration, certain customary 
conditions precedent to funding must be 
satisfied in order for the Company to utilize 
its bank facility, and if such conditions are 
not satisfied or if the Company’s lenders 
do not satisfy their funding commitment, 
the Company may be unable to obtain the 
funds necessary to consummate the merger.
If for any reason the merger is not 
completed, or the closing of the merger is 
significantly delayed, the market price of 
the Company’s ordinary shares and ADSs 
and business and results of operations of 
the Company and/or the combined 
company may be adversely affected. 
Lawsuits have been filed, and other 
lawsuits may be filed, against the 
Company and Baxalta and Baxalta’s 
board of directors challenging the merger, 
and an adverse ruling in any such lawsuit 
may delay or prevent the completion 
of the merger or result in an award 
of damages against the Company. 
Multiple putative class action complaints 
have been filed by purported Baxalta 
stockholders in connection with the 
merger. The complaints generally allege 
that the members of the Baxalta board 
breached their fiduciary duties to Baxalta 
stockholders by entering into the merger 
agreement and approving the merger, and 
that the Company, Baxalta and/or Merger 
Sub, aided and abetted such breaches of 
fiduciary duties. The complaints further 
allege that, among other things, the per 
share merger consideration undervalues 
Baxalta and certain provisions of the 
merger agreement inappropriately inhibit 
competing bids. The complaints seek, 
among other things, to enjoin the merger.
Additional lawsuits arising out of or relating 
to the merger agreement or the merger 
may be filed in the future. The results of 
complex legal proceedings are difficult 
to predict and could delay or prevent the 
completion of the merger. The existence 
of litigation relating to the merger could 
impact the likelihood of obtaining the 
Principal risks and uncertainties 
continued
44 Shire Annual Report 2015 stockholder approvals from either the 
Company or Baxalta. Moreover, the pending 
litigation is, and any future additional 
litigation could be, time consuming and 
expensive and could divert the Company’s 
management’s attention away from their 
regular business. 
One of the conditions to completion of 
the merger is the absence of any law or 
judgment issued by any court or tribunal 
of competent jurisdiction that prevents, 
makes illegal or prohibits the closing of 
the merger. Accordingly, if a plaintiff is 
successful in obtaining a judgment 
prohibiting completion of the merger, then 
such judgment may prevent the merger 
from being completed, or from being 
completed within the expected time frame.
If the proposed merger is not completed, 
the Company will have incurred 
substantial costs that may adversely 
affect the Company’s financial results 
and operations.
The Company has incurred and will continue 
to incur substantial costs in connection 
with the proposed merger with Baxalta. 
These costs are primarily associated with 
the fees of attorneys, accountants and 
financial advisors. In addition, the Company 
diverted significant management resources 
in an effort to complete the merger and 
are subject to restrictions contained in the 
merger agreement on the conduct of the 
Company’s business during the pendency 
of the merger. If the merger is not completed, 
the Company will have received little or no 
benefit in respect of such costs incurred. 
The merger agreement restricts the 
Company’s ability to pursue alternatives 
to the merger, however, in specified 
circumstances, the Company may 
terminate the merger agreement to 
accept a superior proposal.
Under the merger agreement, the Company 
has agreed not to (1) take certain actions 
to solicit proposals relating to alternative 
business combination transactions or 
(2) subject to certain exceptions, including 
the receipt of a “parent superior proposal” 
(as such term is defined in the merger 
agreement), enter into discussions or 
an agreement concerning, or provide 
confidential information in connection 
with, any proposals for alternative business 
combination transactions. However, in 
specified circumstances, the Company 
may terminate the merger agreement 
to enter into a definitive agreement with 
response to a “parent superior proposal” 
prior to obtaining approval of the merger 
from its stockholders. 
Upon termination of the merger agreement 
in specified circumstances, the Company 
would be required to disburse a termination 
fee equal to $369 million to Baxalta and/or 
reimburse Baxalta for its merger-related 
expenses in an amount not to exceed 
$65 million, which expense reimbursement 
would be offset against any termination 
fee subsequently disbursed. Following 
the disbursement of the termination fee 
and/or reimbursement of merger-related 
expenses, the Company will, other than 
in certain circumstances, have no further 
obligation or liabilities to Baxalta. Such 
termination would deny the Company and 
its respective stockholders any benefits 
from the merger and could negatively 
impact market price of the Company’s 
ordinary shares and ADSs.
These provisions could discourage a third 
party that may have an interest in acquiring 
all or a significant part of the Company from 
considering or proposing that acquisition, 
even if such third party were prepared to 
enter into a transaction that is more favorable 
to the Company or the Company’s ordinary 
shareholders than the merger.
In specified circumstances, Baxalta 
could terminate the merger agreement 
to accept an alternative proposal.
Under the merger agreement, Baxalta may 
terminate the merger agreement to enter 
into a definitive agreement with respect to 
a “company superior proposal” (as such 
term is defined in the merger agreement) 
prior to obtaining approval of the merger 
from its ordinary shareholders. In such 
event, Baxalta would be obligated to disburse 
a termination fee equal to $369 million, 
but would have no further obligation or 
liabilities to the Company. Such termination 
would deny the Company and its 
stockholders any benefits from the merger 
and could negatively impact the price of 
the Company’s ordinary shares and ADSs.
Uncertainties associated with the 
merger may cause a loss of employees 
and may otherwise affect the future 
business and operations of Shire and 
the combined company.
Uncertainty about the effect of the merger 
on employees and customers may have 
an adverse effect on the Company and, if 
the proposed combination with Baxalta is 
consummated, on the combined company 
following the merger. These consequent 
uncertainties may impair the Company’s, 
and following the closing of the merger, 
the combined company’s, ability to retain 
and motivate key personnel and could also 
cause customers, suppliers, licensees, 
partners and other business partners to 
defer entering into contracts with, making 
other decisions concerning, or seeking to 
change existing business relationships with 
the Company, and following the closing 
of the merger, the combined company. 
Because the Company depends on the 
experience and industry knowledge of 
their executives and other key personnel to 
execute their business plans, the combined 
company may be unable to meet its 
strategic objectives. 
While the merger is pending, the Company 
may not be able to hire qualified personnel 
to replace any key employees that may 
depart to the same extent that they have 
been able to in the past. In addition, if the 
merger is not completed, the Company 
may also encounter challenges in hiring 
qualified personnel to replace key employees 
that may depart the Company subsequent 
to the merger announcement.
Risks related to the 
combined company 
following the merger 
The Company may not successfully 
integrate the businesses of Shire 
and Baxalta. 
If the merger is consummated, achieving 
the anticipated benefits of the proposed 
combination of Shire and Baxalta will 
depend in part upon whether the two 
companies integrate their businesses 
in an effective and efficient manner. The 
Company may not be able to accomplish 
this integration process successfully. 
The integration of businesses is complex 
and time-consuming. The difficulties that 
could be encountered include the following: 
 > integrating personnel, operations and 
systems, while maintaining focus on 
selling and promoting existing and newly 
acquired or produced products; 
 > coordinating geographically dispersed 
organizations; 
 > distraction of management and 
employees from operations;
 > changes or conflicts in corporate culture; 
 > management’s inability to manage 
a substantial increase in the number 
of employees;
 > management’s inability to train and 
integrate personnel, who may have 
limited experience with the respective 
companies’ business lines and products, 
and to deliver a consistent message 
regarding diseases treated by the 
combined company; 
 > retaining existing customers and 
attracting new customers; 
 > retaining existing employees and 
attracting new employees;
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information
 Shire Annual Report 2015 45 Principal risks and uncertainties 
continued
 > maintaining business relationships; and 
 > inefficiencies associated with the 
integration and management of the 
operations of the combined company.
In addition, there will be integration costs 
and non-recurring transaction costs (such 
as fees paid to legal, financial, accounting 
and other advisors and other fees paid in 
connection with the merger) associated 
with the proposed merger, including costs 
associated with combining their operations 
and achieving the synergies the Company 
expects to obtain, and such costs may 
be significant. 
An inability to realize the full extent of 
the anticipated benefits of the proposed 
combination of Shire and Baxalta, including 
estimated cost synergies, as well as any 
delays encountered in the integration 
process and realizing such benefits, could 
have an adverse effect upon the revenues, 
level of expenses and operating results 
of the combined company, which may 
materially adversely affect the value of 
the Company’s ordinary shares and ADSs 
after the consummation of the merger. 
The Company will incur significant 
additional indebtedness in connection 
with the merger, which will decrease the 
combined company’s business flexibility 
and increase the its interest expense. All 
of the Company’s debt obligations, and 
any future indebtedness the Company 
may incur, will have priority over the 
Company’s ordinary shares and ADSs 
with respect to payment in the event of 
a liquidation, dissolution or winding up. 
The Company has secured an $18 billion 
fully underwritten bank facility of which 
$13 billion is available to finance the cash 
component of the per share merger 
consideration. The Company has announced 
the that it intends to maintain an investment 
grade credit rating for the combined 
company, but one or more credit rating 
agencies may determine that the 
combined company’s credit rating is 
below investment grade, which could 
increase the combined company’s 
borrowing costs. The combined company’s 
indebtedness following consummation of 
the merger could have the effect, among 
other things, of reducing the combined 
company’s flexibility to respond to changing 
business and economic conditions as 
well as reducing funds available for capital 
expenditures, acquisitions, and creating 
competitive disadvantages for the combined 
company relative to other companies with 
lower indebtedness levels. The Company 
will also incur various costs and expenses 
associated with the debt financing. 
The Company intends to refinance the 
bank facility through capital market debt 
issuances in due course. Its ability to 
refinance the indebtedness will depend on 
the condition of the capital markets and the 
combined company’s financial condition at 
such time. Any refinancing of indebtedness 
could be at higher interest rates and may 
require the combined company to comply 
with more onerous covenants, which could 
further restrict business operations and 
such refinancing may not be available at all.
Moreover, the combined company may 
be required to raise substantial additional 
financing to fund capital expenditures and 
acquisitions. The combined company’s 
ability to arrange additional financing and 
the costs of that financing will depend on, 
among other factors, the combined 
company’s financial position and 
performance, as well as prevailing market 
conditions and other factors beyond 
Shire’s control. 
In any liquidation, dissolution or winding up 
of Shire, the Company’s ordinary shares 
and ADSs would rank below all debt claims 
against Shire or any of its subsidiaries. In 
addition, any convertible or exchangeable 
securities or other equity securities that 
Shire may issue in the future may have 
rights, preferences and privileges more 
favorable than those of the Company’s 
ordinary shares and ADSs. As a result, 
holders of the Company’s ordinary shares 
and ADSs will not be entitled to receive 
any payment or other distribution of assets 
upon any liquidation or dissolution until 
after Shire’s obligations to its debt holders 
and holders of equity securities, which rank 
senior to the Company’s ordinary shares 
and ADSs, have been satisfied. 
The merger could result in significant 
liability to Baxalta and the Company if 
the merger causes the spin-off of Baxalta 
from Baxter or a Later Distribution, 
as defined below, to be taxable.
Under the letter agreement, from and after 
the closing of the merger, Baxalta agreed 
to indemnify, and the Company agreed to 
guarantee such indemnity to, Baxter and 
each of its affiliates and each of their 
respective officers, directors and employees 
against certain tax-related losses 
attributable to, or resulting from, in whole 
or in part, the merger. If the contribution of 
property by Baxter in one or more transfers 
to Baxalta in exchange for shares of 
Baxalta common stock, cash, and the 
assumption of certain liabilities, together 
with the distribution or exchange by Baxter 
on July 1, 2015 of approximately 80.5% 
of the shares of Baxalta common stock to
shareholders of Baxter (the “spin-off”)  
and/or a Later Distribution, collectively the 
“Baxter Transactions”, are determined to 
be taxable as a result, in whole or in part, 
of the merger (for example, if the merger 
is deemed to be part of a plan, or series 
of related transactions, that includes 
the Baxter Transactions), Baxter and its 
shareholders could incur significant tax 
liabilities, and under the tax matters 
agreement, and the letter agreement, 
Baxalta and the Company may be required 
to indemnify Baxter for any such tax 
liabilities. Baxter’s waiver of the provisions 
under the tax matters agreement restricting 
Baxalta’s ability to enter into and 
consummate the merger will not relieve 
Baxalta or the Company of its obligation to 
indemnify Baxter if the merger causes any 
of the Baxter Transactions to be taxable. 
In connection with the signing of the 
merger agreement, the Company received 
an opinion from Cravath, Swaine & Moore 
LLP, tax counsel to the Company, to 
the effect that the merger will not cause 
Baxter’s contribution of assets to Baxalta, 
Baxter’s initial distribution of Baxalta shares 
on July 1, 2015, Baxter’s distribution of 
cash received from Baxalta to its creditors 
or a Later Distribution to fail to qualify as 
tax-free to Baxter and its shareholders 
under Sections 355, 361 and 368(a)(1)(D) 
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as 
amended. The merger is conditioned on 
the receipt by the Company at the time of 
the consummation of the merger of a tax 
opinion to the same effect. 
The tax opinion referred to in the immediately 
preceding paragraph is based upon various 
factual representations and assumptions, 
as well as certain undertakings made by 
the Company, Baxter and Baxalta. If any 
of the factual representations or the 
assumptions in the tax opinion is untrue 
or incomplete in any material respect, an 
undertaking is not complied with or the 
facts upon which the tax opinion is based 
are materially different from the facts at the 
time of the merger, the opinion may not be 
valid. Moreover, opinions of counsel are 
not binding on the Internal Revenue 
Service (the “IRS”). As a result, the 
conclusions expressed in the tax opinion 
could be challenged by the IRS. None 
of the Company, Baxalta or Baxter has 
requested a ruling from the IRS regarding 
the impact of the merger on the tax 
treatment of the Baxter Transactions. 
Further, the tax opinion does not address 
all tax aspects of the spin-off, a Later 
Distribution and other related transactions 
and it is possible the Company may be 
obligated to indemnify Baxter despite the 
continuing validity of the tax opinion. 
46 Shire Annual Report 2015 The Company’s indemnification obligations 
to Baxter and its subsidiaries, officers, 
directors and employees under the tax 
matters agreement and letter agreement 
are not limited in amount or subject to any 
cap. If Baxalta or the Company is required 
to indemnify Baxter and its subsidiaries 
and their respective officers, directors and 
employees under the circumstances set 
forth in the tax matters agreement, as 
supplemented by the letter agreement, 
it could have a material adverse effect 
on Baxalta and the Company. 
In this annual report, references to the 
“Later Distributions” includes the following 
transactions that may be undertaken by 
Baxter: (i) any debt-for-equity exchange 
(and related underwritten offering) with 
respect to Baxalta shares, (ii) any offer 
to exchange Baxter shares for Baxalta 
shares, (iii) a contribution of Baxalta shares 
to Baxter’s U.S. pension fund, and/or 
(iv) a dividend of Baxalta shares to 
Baxter’s stockholders, in each case, that 
are undertaken prior to the earlier of any 
Baxalta or Company stockholder vote 
with respect to the merger and that are 
intended to be part of a plan that includes 
the spin-off. 
Certain Baxalta agreements may contain 
change of control provisions that may 
be triggered by the merger that, if not 
waived, could cause the combined 
company to lose the benefit of such 
agreement and incur liabilities or 
replacement costs, which could have 
material adverse effect on the 
combined company. 
Baxalta and its affiliates are each party 
to various agreements with third parties, 
including certain license agreements, 
business development-related agreements, 
production and distribution related 
agreements, bonding/financing facilities, 
contracts for the performance of services 
material to the operations of Baxalta and/or 
its affiliates, IT contracts, technology 
licenses and employment agreements that 
may contain change of control provisions 
that could be triggered upon the closing 
of the merger. Agreements with change of 
control provisions typically provide for or 
permit the termination of the agreement 
upon the occurrence of a change of control 
of one of the parties which can be waived 
by the relevant counterparties. In the 
event that there is such a contract or 
arrangement requiring a consent or waiver 
in relation the merger, there can be no 
assurance that such consent will be obtained 
at all or on favorable terms. If such a waiver 
is not obtained from any such counterparty, 
the combined company could lose the
benefit of the underlying agreement and 
incur liabilities or replacement costs, which 
could have an adverse effect on the 
combined company. 
Sales of the Company’s ordinary shares 
and/or ADSs in anticipation of the merger, 
and resales of such shares following the 
consummation of the merger may 
adversely affect the market price of the 
Company’s ordinary shares and/or ADSs 
prior to, and following, the merger. 
Certain Baxalta stockholders, such as 
index funds or funds with concentration, 
geographic or other limitations on their 
permitted investments, may be required to 
sell ordinary shares or ADSs of Shire that 
they receive in the merger. Other Baxalta 
stockholders may already hold ordinary 
shares or ADSs of Shire and those 
stockholders may decide not to hold the 
shares that they receive in the merger. 
Such sales of ordinary shares or ADSs 
could adversely affect the market price of 
the Company’s ordinary shares and/or ADSs. 
Upon consummation of the merger, the 
Company expects that it will issue up to 
approximately 311 million ordinary shares, 
based on the number of shares of Baxalta 
common stock outstanding as of 
December 31, 2015, in the aggregate. In 
addition, the per share merger consideration 
represents a premium of approximately 
37.5% to the unaffected share price of 
Baxalta common stock on August 3, 2015, 
the day prior to the public announcement 
of the Company’s initial offer for Baxalta, 
based on the closing price of the 
Company’s ADSs on January 8, 2016, 
which may cause significant arbitrage 
activity by investors seeking to take 
advantage of the price differential. The risk 
of dilution coupled with the possibility of 
merger arbitrage activity could result in 
downward pressure on the Company’s 
ordinary shares and ADSs and encourage 
third parties to engage in short sales of the 
Company’s shares. 
In addition, these factors could also make 
it more difficult for the combined company 
to raise funds through future offerings of 
ordinary shares and ADSs. The issuance 
of ordinary shares and ADSs in the merger 
and the sale of additional ordinary shares 
or ADSs that may become eligible for sale 
in the public market from time to time 
upon exercise of options or the vesting of 
restricted securities will further dilute the 
combined company’s ordinary shares and/
or ADSs. Moreover, the increase in the 
number of ordinary shares or ADSs, or 
an increase in the number of such shares 
outstanding following a future issuance, 
sale or transfer of such ordinary shares or 
ADSs by the Company or the possibility of 
such an issue, sale or transfer may lead to 
sales of such shares or the perception that 
such sales may occur, either of which may 
adversely affect the market for, and the 
market price of, the Company’s ordinary 
shares or ADSs. 
The market price of the Company’s 
ordinary shares and ADSs may be 
adversely affected by reports of 
third-party analysts published in 
connection with the consummation 
of the merger.
The trading market for the Company’s 
ordinary shares and ADSs depends in part 
on the research and reports that third-party 
securities analysts publish about Shire 
and its industry. In connection with the 
consummation of the merger, one or more 
of these analysts could downgrade the 
Company’s ordinary shares and ADSs or 
issue other negative commentary about 
Shire or its industry, which could cause the 
market price of the Company’s ordinary 
shares and ADSs to decline. 
The market price of the Company’s 
ordinary shares and ADSs may be 
affected by factors different from those 
affecting the market price for shares 
of the Company’s ordinary shares and 
ADSs prior to the merger.
If the merger is consummated, the risks 
associated with the combined company 
may affect the results of operations of the 
combined company and the market price 
of the Company’s ordinary shares and 
ADSs following the merger differently than 
they could affect the results of operations 
of Shire and the market price of its 
securities while it is a separate company. 
Additionally, the results of operations of 
the combined company may be affected 
by additional or different factors than 
those that currently affect the results of 
operations of Shire, including, but not 
limited to: complexities associated with 
managing the larger, more complex, 
combined business; integrating personnel 
from the two companies while maintaining 
focus on providing products and services; 
and potential performance shortfalls 
resulting from the diversion of 
management’s attention caused by 
integrating the companies’ operations.
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information
 Shire Annual Report 2015 47 Through deep understanding of patients’ 
needs, the Company is able to:
 > Serve patients with high unmet needs in 
select, commercially attractive specialty 
TAs;
 > Drive optimum performance of its 
marketed products — to serve patients 
today;
 > Build its pipeline of innovative specialist 
treatments through both R&D and 
Corporate Development activities — 
to enable the Company to serve patients 
in the future.
Shire’s in-licensing and acquisition efforts 
are focused on products in specialist 
markets with strong intellectual property 
protection or other forms of market 
exclusivity and global rights. Shire believes 
that a carefully selected and balanced 
portfolio of products with strategically 
aligned and relatively small-scale sales 
forces will deliver strong results.
Company revenues, expenditures and 
net assets are attributable to the R&D, 
manufacture, sale and distribution of 
pharmaceutical products within one 
reportable segment. The Company also 
earns royalties (where Shire has out-
licensed products to third parties) which 
are recorded as royalty revenues. 
Revenues are derived primarily from two 
sources — sales of the Company’s own 
products and royalties: 
 > 95% (2014: 97%) of total revenues are 
derived from product sales; and
 > 5% of total revenues are derived from 
royalties (2014: 3%). 
The markets in which the Company 
conducts its business are intensely 
competitive and highly regulated.
The health-care industry is also experiencing:
 > Pressure from governments and 
healthcare providers to keep prices low 
while increasing access to drugs;
 > Increased discount liability due to the 
population of “baby boomers” covered 
under Medicare, specifically those 
beneficiaries receiving drug cost offset 
through the Medicare Part D Coverage 
Gap (the “Donut Hole”);
 > Increasing challenges from third party 
payers for products to have 
demonstrable clinical benefit, with pricing 
and reimbursement approval becoming 
increasingly linked to a product’s clinical 
effectiveness and impact on overall costs 
of patient care; 
 > Increased R&D costs, because 
development programs are typically 
larger and take longer to get approval 
from regulators; 
Review of our business 
Overview
The Company has grown both organically 
and through acquisition, completing a 
series of major transactions that have 
brought therapeutic, geographic and 
pipeline growth and diversification. The 
Company will continue to conduct its own 
research and development, focused on 
rare diseases, as well as evaluate companies, 
products and pipeline opportunities that 
offer a strategic fit and have the potential 
to deliver value to all of the Company’s 
stakeholders: patients, physicians, policy 
makers, payers, investors and employees.
The Company’s purpose is to enable 
people with life altering conditions to lead 
better lives. The Company will execute 
on its purpose through its strategy and 
business model. For further details of 
Shire’s strategy and business model, refer 
to pages 12 to 15.
Jeff Poulton
Chief Financial Officer
Shire delivers record full-year revenue 
and strong double digit growth in 
Non GAAP diluted earnings per ADS 
in 2015.
48 Shire Annual Report 2015  > Challenges to existing patents from 
generic manufacturers;
 > Governments and healthcare systems 
favoring earlier entry of low cost generic 
drugs; and
 > Higher marketing costs, due to increased 
competition for market share.
Shire’s strategy has been developed to 
address these industry-wide competitive 
pressures. This strategy has resulted in a 
series of initiatives in the following areas:
Markets
Shire’s current portfolio of approved 
products focuses on the following markets: 
HAE/LSD, Neuroscience, and GI and 
Internal Medicine. Shire has also established 
an Ophthalmics commercial unit in 
preparedness for the commercialization 
of Shire’s ophthalmic pipeline candidates. 
In addition, Shire has a number of marketed 
products for other TAs from which it 
generates product revenues or royalties 
from third parties. In 2015 Shire derived 
approximately 45% of product sales 
from rare disease products, 36% from 
Neuroscience products and 19% from 
GI and Internal Medicine products. Shire’s 
early stage research is primarily focused 
on rare diseases.
Shire has grown in part through acquisition 
which has brought therapeutic, geographic 
and pipeline growth and diversification. 
In 2015 Shire acquired NPS Pharma, 
Meritage and Foresight. On January 11, 
2016, Shire announced that the Boards of 
Directors of Shire and Baxalta had reached 
an agreement under which Shire will 
combine with Baxalta. On January 22, 
2016, Shire announced the closing of the 
acquisition of Dyax. 
The acquisition of NPS Pharma added 
global rights to an innovative product 
portfolio with multiple growth catalysts, 
including GATTEX/REVESTIVE and 
NATPARA. The acquisition of Meritage 
provided global rights to OBS, a Phase 
3-ready asset for the treatment of 
adolescents and adults with EoE, a rare, 
chronic inflammatory GI disease. This 
enhances Shire’s late-stage pipeline and 
builds upon the Company’s rare disease 
and GI commercial infrastructure and 
expertise. With the acquisition of Foresight 
Shire acquired the global rights to FST-100 
(topical ophthalmic drops combining 0.6% 
povidone iodine (PVP-I) and 0.1% 
dexamethasone), a therapy in late-stage 
development for the treatment of infectious 
conjunctivitis, an ocular surface condition 
commonly referred to as pink eye. This 
acquisition further strengthens Shire’s 
late-stage pipeline, has a clear strategic 
fit with lifitegrast, which is in late-stage 
development for treatment of dry eye 
disease, and further demonstrates Shire’s 
commitment to building a leadership 
position in ophthalmics.
The acquisition of Dyax and their lead 
pipeline product, DX-2930, alongside 
Dyax’s currently marketed product 
KALBITOR, expands and extends Shire’s 
industry-leading HAE portfolio (FIRAZYR 
and CINRYZE), advancing its leadership 
position in rare diseases and enhancing 
the Company’s growth profile.
The proposed combination with Baxalta 
will enable Shire to become a global leader 
in rare diseases.
In 2015 Shire derived 27% (2014: 30%) 
of product sales from outside of the US. 
Shire has ongoing commercialization and 
late-stage development activities, which 
are expected to further supplement the 
diversification of revenues in the future, 
including the following:
 > Launch of INTUNIV in the EU for children 
and adolescents and the submission of 
INTUNIV NDA in Japan;
 > Continued launch of REVESTIVE 
across Europe;
 > Review of MAA for NATPAR in the EU.
R&D
In 2013 Shire combined the R&D 
organizations of its former divisions into 
a single One Shire R&D organization, 
focused around a prioritized portfolio of 
clinical development and research programs. 
Shire has focused its R&D efforts on five 
TAs: Neuroscience, GI/Metabolic Diseases, 
Renal/Fibrotic Diseases, Ophthalmic 
Diseases, and Diseases of the Complement 
Cascade. Shire concentrates its resources 
on obtaining regulatory approval for 
later-stage pipeline products within these 
therapeutic areas and focuses its early 
stage research activities in rare diseases.
Evidence of the successful progression of 
the late stage pipeline can be seen in the 
granting of approval and associated launches 
of the Company’s products over the last 
five years. In this time several products 
have received regulatory approval including: 
in the US, FIRAZYR in 2011, VYVANSE 
for BED and NATPARA in 2015; in the EU, 
ELVANSE/TYVENSE for adults, INTUNIV 
for children and adolescents in 2015.
Shire’s management reviews direct costs 
for all R&D projects by development phase. 
Shire’s R&D costs in 2015 and 2014 
included expenditure on programs in all 
stages of development. The following table 
provides an analysis of the Company’s 
direct R&D spend categorized by 
development stage, based upon the 
development stage of each program as 
at December 31, 2015 and 2014:
Year to December 31,
2015

2014
$’M
Early stage programs 177 170
Late stage programs 225 253
Currently marketed 
products 179 143
Total 581 566
In addition to the above, the Company 
recorded R&D employee costs of 
$303 million in 2015 (2014: $270 million) 
and other indirect R&D costs of $680 
million (2014: $232 million), comprising 
depreciation and impairment charges.

development projects see pages 20 to 21. 
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information
 Shire Annual Report 2015 49 Patents and market exclusivity The loss or 
expiration of patent protection or regulatory 
exclusivity with respect to any of the 
Company’s major products could have a 
material adverse effect on the Company’s 
revenues, financial condition and results 
of operations, as generic or biosimilar 
products may enter the market. Companies 
selling generic products often do not need 
to complete extensive clinical studies 
when they seek registration of a generic 
or biosimilar product and accordingly, 
are generally able to sell a generic version 
of the Company’s products at a much 
lower price.
As expected, in 2009 Teva and Impax 
commenced commercial shipments of their 
authorized generic versions of ADDERALL 
XR, which led to lower sales of branded 
ADDERALL XR compared to the periods 
prior to the authorized generic launches. 
In 2011 generic versions of the Company’s 
CARBATROL and REMINYL products 
respectively were launched, which led 
to lower sales of these branded products 
compared to the period before loss 
of exclusivity.
In 2014 and 2015 generic versions of 
the Company’s INTUNIV product was 
launched, which led to lower sales of 
Shire’s INTUNIV product compared to 
the period before loss of exclusivity.
Shire is engaged in various legal 
proceedings with generic manufacturers 
with respect to its VYVANSE and LIALDA 
patents. For more detail of current patent 
litigation, see Note 18, “Commitments 
and Contingencies, Legal and other 
proceedings” to the consolidated financial 
statements set forth in this Annual Report.
Corporate development
Shire focuses its corporate development 
activity on the acquisition and in-licensing 
of businesses, products or compounds 
which offer a strategic fit and have the 
potential to deliver demonstrable value 
to all of the Company’s stakeholders. 
Recent mergers or acquisitions
On January 22, 2016 Shire completed the 
acquisition of Dyax which has expanded 
and extended Shire’s industry-leading 
HAE portfolio by adding the currently 
approved product, KALBITOR, SHP643 
(formerly DX-2930), a Phase 3 program 
for the treatment of HAE as well as other 
programs in early stages of development. 
On January 11, 2016 Shire announced 
that the Boards of Directors of Shire and 
Baxalta had reached an agreement under 
which Shire will combine with Baxalta, 
creating the global leader in rare diseases. 
Under the agreement Baxalta shareholders 
are to receive $18.00 in cash and 0.1482 
Shire ADS per Baxalta share. Closing of 
the transaction is subject to approval by 
Baxalta and Shire shareholders, certain 
regulatory approvals, redelivery of tax 
opinions delivered at signing and other 
customary closing conditions. For further 
details, see “Risks Related to the Proposed 
Merger with Baxalta Incorporated” 
included within Principal Risks and 
Uncertainties and “The January 2016 
Facilities Agreement” in the Liquidity and 
Capital Resources section.
In 2015, Shire acquired:
 > NPS Pharma which added global rights 
to an innovative product portfolio with 
multiple growth catalysts, including 
GATTEX/REVESTIVE with growing sales 
for the treatment of adults with SBS, 
a rare GI condition; and NATPARA, the 
only bioengineered hormone replacement 
therapy for use in the treatment of HPT, 
a rare endocrine disease; 
 > Meritage which provided Shire with 
worldwide rights to Meritage’s Phase 
3-ready compound OBS for the potential 
treatment of adolescents and adults 
with EoE, a rare, chronic inflammatory 
GI disease; and
 > Foresight which added global rights to 
SHP640 (formerly FST-100), a Phase-3 
ready therapy for the treatment of infectious 
conjunctivitis, an ocular surface condition 
commonly referred to as pink eye. 
In 2014, Shire acquired:
 > ViroPharma which added a leading 
marketed product for the prophylactic 
treatment of HAE, CINRYZE, as well as 
a number of other marketed products 
and a pipeline of product candidates 
in the rare disease area;
 > Lumena which added global rights to 
two late stage pipeline assets: SHP625, 
in Phase 2 clinical development with 
potential orphan indications; and SHP626, 
in Phase 1b clinical development;
 > Fibrotech which added global rights to 
SHP627 in Phase 1b, a new class of oral 
drug with a novel mechanism of action 
which has the potential to address both 
the inflammatory and fibrotic components 
of disease processes. In addition Shire 
has acquired rights to Fibrotech’s library 
of novel molecules including SHP628, 
which is in pre-clinical development; and
 > BIKAM which added global rights to 
SHP630 in pre-clinical development, 
for the potential treatment of autosomal 
dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP).
Collaboration and licensing activity
Shire has also entered into a number of 
collaboration and license agreements in 
recent years, including:
 > A worldwide licensing and collaboration 
agreement with ArmaGen in 2014 to 
develop and commercialize AGT-182, 
an investigational ERT for the potential 
treatment of both the central nervous 
system and somatic manifestations in 
patients with Hunter syndrome;
 > A collaboration and license agreement 
with Sangamo to develop ZFP 
Therapeutic clinical leads for Huntington’s 
disease and a ZFP Therapeutic for 
one additional gene target; and
 > An agreement with Shionogi in 2012 
to co-develop and co-commercialize 
VYVANSE and INTUNIV in Japan.

50 Shire Annual Report 2015 Organization and structure 
In 2013 the Company integrated its operations 
into a simplified One Shire organization in 
order to drive future growth and innovation. 
Shire now comprises a single operating 
and reportable segment. For further details 
see Note 24 “Segmental reporting” to the 
consolidated financial statements set forth 
in this Annual Report. As part of the 
One Shire reorganization, the Company 
undertook a review of all of its pipeline 
programs and identified those projects 
that fit with the Company’s new strategic 
direction and have an acceptable likelihood 
of success. Following that review and 
overall streamlining of the R&D organization, 
several clinical and pre-clinical projects 
were discontinued which resulted in the 
elimination of a significant number of R&D 
roles and functional roles that support 
R&D in Basingstoke, and some positions 
were re-located. 
In addition the Company also relocated its 
international commercial hub from Nyon, 
Switzerland to Zug, Switzerland. 
In 2014 certain aspects of the One Shire 
program were temporarily put on hold 
due to AbbVie’s offer for Shire, which was 
terminated in October 2014. Subsequent 
to the termination of AbbVie’s offer, Shire 
announced on November 10, 2014 its plans 
to relocate over 500 positions to Lexington, 
Massachusetts from its Chesterbrook, 
Pennsylvania, site and establish Lexington 
as the Company’s US operational 
headquarters in continuation of the One 
Shire efficiency program. This relocation 
streamlines business globally through two 
principal locations, Massachusetts and 
Switzerland, with support from regional and 
country-based offices around the world.
For further details see Note 5 
“Reorganization costs” to the consolidated 
financial statements set forth in this 
Annual Report.
On October 22, 2013 Shire discontinued 
the construction of its new manufacturing 
facility in San Diego. Subsequently on 
January 16, 2014, the Company sold and 
transferred certain of the assets relating 
to the manufacturing, marketing, sale 
and distribution of DERMAGRAFT to 
Organogenesis Inc. For further information, 
see Note 9, “Results of discontinued 
operations” to the consolidated 
financial statements.
Results of operations for 
the years to December 31, 
2015 and 2014
Financial highlights for the year to 
December 31, 2015 are as follows:
 > Product sales excluding INTUNIV were 
up 10% (up 14% on a Non GAAP CER
1
 
basis), with growth driven by VYVANSE
2
 
(up 19% to $1,722 million), CINRYZE 
(up 23% to $618 million), LIALDA/
MEZAVANT (up 8% to $684 million) 
and FIRAZYR (up 22% to $445 million). 
GATTEX/REVESTIVE and NATPARA 
acquired with NPS Pharma contributed 
3 percentage points, or $166 million of 
product sales growth.
 > Product sales growth in 2015 was held 
back, as expected, by 4 percentage 
points due to the foreign exchange 
headwinds from the strong US dollar, 
primarily affecting sales of ELAPRASE, 
REPLAGAL and VPRIV.
 > Total product sales were up 5% on 2014 
(up 9% on a Non GAAP CER basis
1
) to 
$6,100 million (2014: $5,830 million). 
Total product sales were held back 
by significantly lower INTUNIV sales 
(down 80% to $65 million) following the 
introduction of generic competition from 
December 2014.
 > Total revenues were up 7% to 
$6,417 million (2014: $6,022 million), due 
to our product sales growth and higher 
royalties and other revenues (up 65%), 
primarily $115 million of SENSIPAR 
royalties acquired with NPS Pharma.
 > Operating income in 2015 was down 16% 
to $1,420 million (2014: $1,698 million), as 
higher total revenues in 2015 were offset 
by higher operating costs as we advance 
our pipeline, invest behind current and 
anticipated product launches and include 
NPS Pharma operating costs for the first 
time. Operating income in 2015 was 
held back by higher IPR&D impairment 
charges ($644 million in 2015 relating 
to SHP625 and SHP608), and higher 
intangible asset amortization charges 
following the acquisition of NPS Pharma, 
which were in part offset by a net 
credit from changes in the fair value 
of contingent consideration liabilities 
($150 million).
 > Diluted earnings per ordinary share from 
continuing operations decreased 62% to 
$2.20 (2014: $5.76) primarily as a result 
of comparison to strong diluted earnings 
per ordinary shares in 2014 which 
benefited from the $1,635 million break 
fee received following AbbVie’s 
terminated offer for Shire.

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information
 Shire Annual Report 2015 51 VYVANSE — ADHD and BED
VYVANSE product sales grew strongly 
(up 19%) in 2015. Growth was driven by 
prescription growth in the US (up 8%), the 
benefit of price increases
1
 and to a lesser 
extent the benefit of stocking in 2015 as 
compared to destocking in 2014 and 
growth from international markets. This 
growth was partially offset by higher sales 
deductions as a percentage of product 
sales in 2015 as compared to 2014.
Litigation proceedings regarding VYVANSE 
are ongoing. Further information about 
this litigation can be found in Note 18, 
“Commitments and Contingencies, Legal 
and other proceedings” to the consolidated 
financial statements.
LIALDA/MEZAVANT — UC
The 8% growth in product sales for 
LIALDA/MEZAVANT in 2015 was primarily 
driven by higher prescription demand 
(up 10%) and, to a lesser extent, a price 
increase
1
 taken at the beginning of 2015. 
The growth was partially offset by higher 
sales deductions as a percentage of sales 
in 2015 as compared to 2014 and, to a 
lesser extent the impact of destocking in 
2015 compared to stocking in 2014.
Litigation proceedings regarding LIALDA 
are ongoing. Further information about 
this litigation can be found in Note 18, 
“Commitments and Contingencies, Legal 
and other proceedings” to the consolidated 
financial statements.
CINRYZE — prophylactic treatment 
of HAE
CINRYZE sales were up 23% on 2014, 
primarily driven by strong growth in 
patients on therapy and, to a lesser extent, 
sales also benefited from a price increase
1
 
taken since 2014.
ELAPRASE — Hunter syndrome
ELAPRASE product sales were down 
7% (up 4% on a Non GAAP CER basis
2
) 
reflecting the negative impact of foreign 
exchange movements and to a lesser 
extent a lower average price due to pricing 
pressures and geographic mix. These 
negative factors were partially offset by 
higher volumes primarily due to an increase 
in the number of patients on therapy.

on therapy was more than offset by the 
negative impact of foreign exchange and 
to a lesser extent, pricing pressures.
ADDERALL XR — ADHD
ADDERALL XR product sales were down 
5% in 2015, as growth in prescription 
demand (up 10%) was more than offset by 
higher sales deductions as a percentage of 
product sales in 2015 compared to 2014.
VPRIV — Gaucher disease
VPRIV product sales were down 7% 
(up 1% on a Non GAAP CER basis
2
), as 
sales growth was negatively impacted by 
foreign exchange and the impact of new 
competition in the US market partially 
offset by higher utilization per patient.
PENTASA — UC
PENTASA product sales were up 6% as 
the benefit of price increases
1
 was partially 
offset by higher sales deductions as a 
percentage of product sales and lower 
prescription demand in 2015 compared 
to 2014.
GATTEX — SBS
Shire acquired GATTEX/REVESTIVE 
through its acquisition of NPS Pharma 
on February 21, 2015, and recorded 
sales of $142 million in 2015 (up 51% 
on a pro-forma basis
3
).
INTUNIV — ADHD
INTUNIV product sales were down 80% 
compared to 2014, reflecting the impact of 
generic competitors since December 2014.
NATPARA — Hypocalcemia in 
Hypoparathyroidism
Shire made NATPARA available on April 1, 
2015, after acquiring the product through 
its acquisition of NPS, and following a 
strong US launch, sales of $24 million 
were recorded in 2015.

Royalty income increased by 87% in 2015 
due primarily to the inclusion of royalty 
income receivable from Amgen Inc. for 
SENSIPAR (following the acquisition of 
NPS Pharma by Shire). 
Cost of product sales from continuing 
operations
Cost of product sales decreased to 
$969.0 million for the year to December 31, 
2015 (16% of product sales), down from 
$979.3 million in the corresponding period 
in 2014 (17% of product sales). Cost of 
product sales as a percentage of product 
sales was one percentage point lower 
compared to the same period in 2014, as 
the impact of the inclusion of lower margin 
products acquired with NPS Pharma was 
more than offset by lower charges on the 
unwind of fair value adjustments on 
acquired inventories. 
For the year to December 31, 2015 cost 
of product sales included depreciation of 
$46.1 million (2014: $57.1 million). 
R&D from continuing operations
R&D expenditure increased to $1,564.0 million 
for the year to December 31, 2015 (26% of 
product sales), compared to $1,067.5 million 
in the corresponding period in 2014 (18% 
of product sales). R&D expenditure in 2015 
includes impairment charges of $467 million 
relating to the SHP625 IPR&D intangible 
asset, due to a lower probability of regulatory 
approval following trial results and revised 
commercial potential, and $176.7 million 
relating to the SHP608 IPR&D intangible 
asset, following preclinical toxicity findings. 
R&D expenditure in 2014 includes impairment 
charges of $190.3 million, primarily relating 
to the SHP602 IPR&D intangible asset 
of $166.0 million, following the Phase 2 
trial being placed on clinical hold and
$22.0 million relating to the SHP613 IPR&D 
intangible asset, following the decision to 
discontinue further development based 
on portfolio prioritization as well as 
unexpected challenges and complexities 
with the development program. Also 
included in 2014 R&D expenditure is a 
payment of $12.5 million in respect of 
in-licensed and acquired products. 
Excluding these costs, R&D expenditure in 
the year to December 31, 2015 increased 
by 6% or by $56 million, due to the 
inclusion of NPS Pharma costs since 
February 2015 and increased investment in 
existing pipeline programs, partially offset 
by lower spend on certain programs in 
2014 which was not repeated in 2015. 
R&D expenditure in the year to December 31, 
2015 included depreciation of $21.7 million 
(2014: $24.5 million). 
SG&A from continuing operations
SG&A expenditure increased to 
$2,341.2 million for the year to December 31, 
2015 from $2,025.8 million. SG&A 
expenditure as a proportion of product 
sales also increased by three percentage 
points to 38% of product sales for the year 
to December 31, 2015 compared with 
35% of product sales in the corresponding 
period in 2014, due to the inclusion of NPS 
Pharma’s SG&A costs, higher amortization 
of intangible assets acquired with NPS 
Pharma and increased sales and marketing 
spend supporting the launch of VYVANSE 
for the treatment of BED and the anticipated 
launch of lifitegrast for the treatment of DED.
For the year to December 31, 2015 SG&A 
included depreciation of $70.7 million 
(2014: $81.9 million) and amortization of 
$498.7 million (2014: $243.8 million).
Gain on sale of product rights
For the year to December 31, 2015 Shire 
recorded a net gain on sale of product 
rights of $14.7 million (2014: $88.2 million) 
due primarily to the re-measurement of the 
contingent consideration receivable relating 
to the divestment of DAYTRANA. In 2014 
Shire additionally recorded a net gain 
on sale of product rights following the 
divestment of CALCICHEW, VANCOCIN, 
ESTRACE and EXPUTEX.

  The actual net effect of price increases on current period net sales compared to the comparative period is 
difficult to quantify due to the various managed care rebates, Medicaid discounts, other discount 
programs in which the Company participates and fee for service agreements with wholesalers customers.

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information
 Shire Annual Report 2015 53 Reorganization costs
For the year to December 31, 2015 
Shire recorded reorganization costs of 
$97.9 million (2014: $180.9 million) primarily 
related to the relocation of roles from 
Chesterbrook to Lexington. 2014 also 
included costs relating to the One Shire 
reorganization, which included termination 
benefits and other reorganization costs.
Integration and acquisition costs
For the year to December 31, 2015 Shire 
recorded net integration and acquisition 
costs of $39.8 million, representing 
acquisition and integration costs of 
$189.7 million, primarily related to NPS 
Pharma, ViroPharma, Baxalta and Dyax. 
These costs were offset by a net credit of 
$149.9 million on the change in fair value of 
contingent consideration liabilities, primarily 
relating to SHP625 (acquired with Lumena) 
and SHP608 (acquired with Lotus Tissue 
Repair, Inc.).
In 2014 Shire recorded integration and 
acquisition costs of $158.8 million, 
comprising acquisition and integration 
costs of $144.1 million, primarily related 
to ViroPharma, and a $14.7 million charge 
relating to the change in fair values of 
contingent consideration.
Interest expense
For the year to December 31, 2015 Shire 
incurred interest expense of $41.6 million 
(2014: $30.8 million). Interest expense in 
2015 principally relates to interest and 
financing costs incurred on facilities 
drawn down in respect of the acquisition 
of NPS Pharma.
Taxation from continuing operations
The effective tax rate on income from 
continuing operations was 3% (2014: 2%).
The effective rate of tax on income from 
continuing operations in 2015 is low 
primarily due to the deferred tax accounting 
for acquisitions in higher tax territories, 
including the amortization and impairments 
of acquired intangible assets and 
changes in the fair values of contingent 
consideration liabilities, which do not reduce 
the Company’s cash tax liability. In addition, 
the effective rate of tax on income from 
continuing operations is reduced by 
increased R&D credits, the effect of the 
finalization of various tax returns and 
changes in profit mix including the benefit 
in higher tax territories of significant 
reorganization and integration costs.
The effective rate of tax on income from 
continuing operations in 2014 includes the 
receipt of the break fee from AbbVie and 
recognition of a net credit to income taxes 
of $235 million, following the settlement of 
certain tax positions with the Canadian 
revenue authorities in 2014. The Company 
has obtained advice that the break fee 
should not be taxable in Ireland. The 
Company has therefore concluded that 
no tax liability should arise and did not 
recognize a tax charge in the income 
statement in 2014. The relevant tax return 
was submitted on September 23, 2015.
Discontinued operations
The loss from discontinued operations 
for the year to December 31, 2015 was 
$34.1 million net of tax (2014: gain of 
$122.7 million) primarily relating to a change 
in estimate for onerous lease provisions. 
2014 included a tax credit of $211.3 million 
primarily driven by a tax benefit arising 
following a reorganization of the 
Regenerative Medicine business 
undertaken in Q4 2014, associated with 
the divestment of the DERMAGRAFT 
business in Q1 2014. The gain was 
partially offset by costs associated with the 
divestment of the DERMAGRAFT business, 
including a loss on re-measurement of 
contingent consideration receivable from 
Organogenesis to its fair value.
Financial condition at 
December 31, 2015 
and 2014
Cash & cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents decreased 
by $2,846.9 million to $135.5 million at 
December 31, 2015 (December 31, 2014: 
$2,982.4 million), primarily due to the use 
of existing cash and cash equivalents to 
partially fund the acquisitions of NPS 
Pharma, Foresight and Meritage. 
In the year to December 31, 2014 Cash 
and cash equivalents included the receipt 
of the $1,635 million break fee in relation 
to AbbVie’s terminated offer for Shire, 
the benefit of the $417 million repayment 
received from the Canadian revenue 
authorities and the net proceeds of 
$554.5 million from Shire’s line of credit 
and other borrowings. These inflows were 
offset by the cost of acquiring ViroPharma, 
Lumena and Fibrotech.
Accounts receivable, net
Accounts receivable, net increased by 
$166.1 million to $1,201.2 million at 
December 31, 2015 (December 31, 2014: 
$1,035.1 million), primarily due to the 
inclusion of NPS Pharma’s accounts 
receivable and an increase in revenue. 
Days sales outstanding slightly decreased 
to 42 days (December 31, 2014: 43 days).
Inventories
Inventories increased by $90.6 million 
to $635.4 million at December 31, 2015 
(December 31, 2014: $544.8 million), 
primarily due to the inventories acquired 
as part of the acquisition of NPS Pharma 
and an increase in inventories of certain 
products following continued sales growth.
Goodwill
Goodwill increased by $1,672.9 million 
to $4,147.8 million at December 31, 2015 
(December 31, 2014: $2,474.9 million), 
principally due to the acquisitions of 
NPS Pharma, Meritage and Foresight.
Other intangible assets, net
Other intangible assets increased by 
$4,238.9 million to $9,173.3 million at 
December 31, 2015 (December 31, 2014: 
$4,934.4 million), principally due to the 
intangible assets acquired with NPS 
Pharma, Meritage and Foresight, offset 
by IPR&D intangible asset impairment 
charges and intangible asset amortization. 
Short term borrowings
Short term borrowings increased by 
$661.5 million to $1,511.5 million at 
December 31, 2015 (December 31, 2014: 
$850.0 million), reflecting the utilization of 
short term debt facilities to partially fund 
the acquisition of NPS Pharma and the 
recognition of secured non-recourse 
debt liabilities assumed as part of the 
NPS Pharma acquisition. 
Other current liabilities 
Other current liabilities decreased by 
$118.5 million to $144.0 million at 
December 31, 2015 (December 31, 2014: 
$262.5 million) principally due to the 
reduction in the fair value of contingent 
consideration payable associated with 
the SHP625 IPR&D intangible asset.
Non-current deferred tax liabilities
Non-current deferred tax liabilities increased 
by $995.3 million to $2,205.9 million at 
December 31, 2015 (December 31, 2014: 
$1,210.6 million) primarily due to deferred 
tax liabilities arising on intangible assets 
partially offset by deferred tax assets 
arising on tax attributes both acquired 
with NPS Pharma, Meritage and Foresight.

54 Shire Annual Report 2015 Other non-current liabilities 
Other non-current liabilities increased by 
$62.1 million to $798.8 million at 
December 31, 2015 (December 31, 2014: 
$736.7 million) principally due to a change 
in estimate in respect of onerous lease 
liabilities and recognition of contingent 
consideration payable in respect of the 
Meritage acquisition, offset by a reduction 
in the fair value of contingent consideration 
payable associated with the SHP608 and 
SHP625 IPR&D intangible assets.
Liquidity and capital 
resources 
General 
The Company’s funding requirements 
depend on a number of factors, including 
the timing and extent of its development 
programs; corporate, business and 
product acquisitions; the level of resources 
required for the expansion of certain 
manufacturing and marketing capabilities 
as the product base expands; increases in 
accounts receivable and inventory which 
may arise with any increase in product 
sales; competitive and technological 
developments; the timing and cost of 
obtaining required regulatory approvals 
for new products; the timing and quantum 
of milestone payments on business 
combinations, in-licenses and collaborative 
projects; the timing and quantum of tax 
and dividend payments; the timing and 
quantum of purchases by the Employee 
Benefit Trust of Shire shares in the market 
to satisfy awards granted under Shire’s 
employee share plans; and the amount 
of cash generated from sales of Shire’s 
products and royalty receipts.
An important part of Shire’s business 
strategy is to protect its products and 
technologies through the use of patents, 
proprietary technologies and trademarks, 
to the extent available. The Company 
intends to defend its intellectual property 
and as a result may need cash for funding 
the cost of litigation.
The Company finances its activities through 
cash generated from operating activities; 
credit facilities; private and public offerings 
of equity and debt securities; and the 
proceeds of asset or investment disposals. 
Shire’s balance sheet includes 
$135.5 million of cash and cash equivalents 
at December 31, 2015. 
Shire has a revolving credit facility of 
$2,100 million which matures in 2020, 
$750 million of which was utilized as 
December 31, 2015. 
In connection with the acquisitions of 
NPS Pharma and Dyax and the proposed 
combination with Baxalta, Shire entered 
into a number of facility arrangements in 
the year to December 31, 2015 and 
subsequently in 2016. The details of these 
facility arrangements are presented below. 
Shire also assumed non-recourse secured 
debt obligations as part of the NPS Pharma 
acquisition with a carrying value of 
$81.4 million as at December 31, 2015. See 
Note 16, “Borrowings” to the consolidated 
financial statements.
In addition Shire has access to certain 
short-term uncommitted lines of credit 
which it utilizes from time to time to provide 
short-term flexibility in cash management. 
At December 31, 2015, these lines of credit 
were not utilized.
Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement
On December 12, 2014, Shire entered into 
a $2,100 million revolving credit facilities 
agreement (the “RCF”) with a number of 
financial institutions, for which Abbey 
National Treasury Services PLC (trading 
as Santander Global Banking and Markets), 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch International 
Limited, Barclays Bank PLC, Citigroup 
Global Markets Limited, Lloyds Bank PLC, 
The Royal Bank of Scotland PLC and 
Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation 
acted as mandated lead arrangers and 
bookrunners and DNB Bank ASA, The 
Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., Credit 
Suisse AG, London Branch, Deutsche 
Bank Luxembourg S.A., Goldman Sachs 
Bank USA, Mizuho Bank, Ltd. and Morgan 
Stanley Bank International Limited acted 
as arrangers. Shire is an original borrower 
and original guarantor under the RCF. 
Shire has agreed to act as guarantor for any 
of its subsidiaries that become additional 
borrowers under the RCF. As at December 
31, 2015 the Company utilized $750 million 
of the RCF.
The RCF, which terminates on December 
12, 2020, may be applied towards financing 
the general corporate purposes of Shire. 
The RCF incorporates a $250 million US 
dollar and euro swingline facility operating 
as a sub-limit thereof.
Interest on any loans made under the RCF 
is payable on the last day of each interest 
period, which may be one week or one, 
two, three or six months at the election 
of Shire, or as otherwise agreed with the 
lenders. The interest rate for the RCF is: 
LIBOR (or, in relation to any revolving loan 
in euro, EURIBOR); plus 0.30% per year 
subject to change depending upon (i) the 
prevailing ratio of Net Debt to EBITDA (each 
as defined in the RCF) in respect of the 
most recently completed financial year or 
financial half year and (ii) the occurrence 
and continuation of an event of default in 
respect of the financial covenants or the 
failure to provide a compliance certificate.
Shire shall also pay (i) a commitment fee 
equal to 35% of the applicable margin on 
available commitments under the RCF for 
the availability period applicable thereto 
and (ii) a utilization fee equal to (a) 0.10% 
per year of the aggregate of all outstanding 
loans up to an aggregate base currency 
amount equal to $700 million, (b) 0.15% per 
year of the amount by which the aggregate 
base currency amount of all outstanding 
loans exceeds $700 million but is equal to 
or less than $1,400 million and (c) 0.30% 
per year of the amount by which the 
aggregate base currency amount of all 
outstanding loans exceeds $1,400 million.
The RCF includes customary 
representations and warranties, covenants 
and events of default, including requirements 
that Shire’s (i) ratio of Net Debt to EBITDA 
in respect of the most recently ended 
12-month relevant period (each as defined 
in the RCF) must not, at any time, exceed 
3.5:1 except that, following an acquisition 
fulfilling certain criteria, Shire may on a 
once only basis elect to increase this ratio 
to (a) 5.5:1 for the relevant period in which 
the acquisition was completed (b) 5.0:1 in 
respect of the first relevant period following 
the relevant period in which the acquisition 
was completed and (c) 4.5:1 in respect of 
the second relevant period following the 
relevant period in which the acquisition 
was completed, and (ii) ratio of EBITDA to 
Net Interest for the most recently ended 
12-month relevant period (each as defined 
in the RCF) must not be less than 4.0:1.
The RCF restricts subject to certain 
exceptions, Shire’s ability to incur additional 
financial indebtedness, grant security over 
its assets or provide loans/grant credit. 
Further, any lender may require mandatory 
prepayment of its participation if there 
is a change of control of Shire, subject 
to certain exceptions for schemes of 
arrangement and analogous schemes.
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information
 Shire Annual Report 2015 55 Events of default under the RCF include, 
subject to customary grace periods and 
materiality thresholds: (i) non-payment 
of any amounts due under the finance 
documents (as defined in the RCF), 
(ii) failure to satisfy any financial covenants, 
(iii) material misrepresentation in any of the 
finance documents, (iv) failure to pay, or 
certain other defaults, under other financial 
indebtedness, (v) certain insolvency 
events or proceedings, (vi) material adverse 
changes in the business, operations, 
assets or financial condition of Shire as a 
whole, (vii) if it becomes unlawful for Shire 
(or any successor parent company) or 
any of their respective subsidiaries that 
are parties to the RCF to perform their 
obligations thereunder or (viii) if Shire 
(or any successor parent company) or any 
subsidiary thereof which is a party to the 
RCF repudiates such agreement or other 
finance document, among others.
The RCF is governed by the English law.
Term Loan Facilities Agreement
January 2016 Facilities Agreement
On January 11, 2016, Shire (as original 
guarantor and original borrower), entered 
into, an $18.0 billion bridge facilities 
agreement with, among others, Barclays 
Bank PLC (“Barclays”) and Morgan Stanley 
Bank International Limited, acting as 
mandated lead arrangers and bookrunners 
(the “January 2016 Facilities Agreement”). 
The January 2016 Facilities Agreement 
comprises two credit facilities: (i) a 
$13.0 billion term loan facility which, 
subject to a one year extension option 
exercisable at Shire’s option, matures on 
January 11, 2017 (“January 2016 Facility A”) 
and (ii) a $5.0 billion revolving loan facility 
which, subject to a one year extension 
option exercisable at Shire’s option, matures 
on January 11, 2017 (“January 2016 Facility 
B”). Shire has agreed to act as guarantor 
for any of its subsidiaries that become 
additional borrowers under the January 2016 
Facilities Agreement. As of February 23, 2016 
the January 2016 Facility was undrawn.
January 2016 Facility A may be used to 
finance the cash consideration payable in 
respect of the proposed combination with 
Baxalta and certain costs related to the 
proposed combination. January 2016 
Facility B may be used to finance the 
redemption of all or part of Baxalta’s 
senior notes upon completion of the 
proposed combination. 
Interest on any loans made under the 
January 2016 Facilities Agreement will be 
payable on the last day of each interest 
period, which may be one week or one, 
two, three or six months, or as otherwise 
agreed with the lenders. The interest rate 
applicable to the January 2016 Facilities 
Agreement is LIBOR plus 1.25 percent per 
annum, increasing by: (i) 0.25 percent per 
annum on July 11, 2016 and on each 
subsequent date falling at three month 
intervals thereafter until (and excluding) 
April 11, 2017 and (ii) 0.50 percent per 
annum on April 11, 2017 and on each 
subsequent date falling at three month 
intervals thereafter. 
Shire shall also pay a commitment fee on 
the available but unutilized commitments 
under the January 2016 Facilities Agreement 
for the availability period applicable to each 
facility. With effect from first utilization, 
the commitment fee rate will be 35 percent 
of the applicable margin. Before first 
utilization, the commitment fee rate shall 
be increased in stages from 10 percent to 
35 percent of the applicable margin over 
the period to May 11, 2016. 
The January 2016 Facilities Agreement 
includes customary representations and 
warranties, covenants and events of 
default, including requirements that Shire’s 
(i) ratio of Net Debt to EBITDA in respect of 
the most recently ended 12-month relevant 
period, (each as defined in the January 2016 
Facilities Agreement), must not, at any time, 
exceed 3.5:1, except that following the 
combination with Baxalta, or any other 
acquisition fulfilling certain criteria, Shire 
may elect on a once only basis to increase 
this ratio to (a) 5.5:1 for the relevant period 
in which the acquisition was completed, 
(b) 5.0:1 in respect of the first relevant 
period following the relevant period in 
which the acquisition was completed and 
(c) 4.5:1 in respect of the second relevant 
period following the relevant period in 
which the acquisition was completed, and 
(ii) ratio of EBITDA to Net Interest, for the 
most recently ended 12-month relevant 
period (each as defined in the January 
2016 Facilities Agreement), must not be 
less than 4.0:1. 
The January 2016 Facilities Agreement 
restricts, subject to certain exceptions, 
Shire’s ability to incur additional financial 
indebtedness, grant security over its assets 
or provide loans/grant credit. Further, any 
lender may require mandatory prepayment 
of its participation if there is a change 
of control of Shire, subject to certain 
exceptions for schemes of arrangement 
and analogous schemes. In addition, in 
certain circumstances and subject to 
certain broad exceptions, the net cash 
proceeds of disposals and certain issues, 
loans, sales or offerings of debt securities 
by any member of Shire’s group must 
be applied in cancellation of the available 
commitments under the January 2016 
Facilities Agreement and, if applicable, 
mandatory prepayment of any loans made 
under the January 2016 Facilities Agreement. 
Events of default under the January 2016 
Facilities Agreement include, subject to 
customary grace periods and materiality 
thresholds: (i) non-payment of any 
amounts due under the finance documents 
(as defined in the January 2016 Facilities 
Agreement), (ii) failure to satisfy any financial 
covenants, (iii) material misrepresentation 
in any of the finance documents, (iv) failure 
to pay, or certain other defaults, under 
other financial indebtedness, (v) certain 
insolvency events or proceedings, 
(vi) material adverse changes in the 
business, operations, assets or financial 
condition of Shire as a whole, (vii) if it 
becomes unlawful for Shire (or any 
successor parent company) or any of their 
respective subsidiaries that are parties to 
the January 2016 Facilities Agreement to 
perform their obligations thereunder or 
(viii) if Shire (or any successor parent 
company) or any subsidiary thereof which 
is a party to the January 2016 Facilities 
Agreement repudiates the January 2016

56 Shire Annual Report 2015 November 2015 Facilities Agreement
On November 2, 2015, Shire (as original 
guarantor and original borrower) entered 
into a $5.6 billion facilities agreement with, 
among others, Morgan Stanley Bank 
International Limited and Deutsche Bank 
AG, London Branch acting as mandated 
lead arrangers and bookrunners (the 
“November 2015 Facilities Agreement”). 
The November 2015 Facilities Agreement 
comprises three credit facilities: (i) a $1.0 billion 
term loan facility which, subject to a one 
year extension option exercisable at Shire’s 
option, matures on November 2, 2016 
(“November 2015 Facility A”), (ii) a $2.2 billion 
amortizing term loan facility which matures 
on November 2, 2017 (“November 2015 
Facility B”) and (iii) a $2.4 billion amortizing 
term loan facility which matures on 
November 2, 2018 (“November 2015 
Facility C”). 
As of December 31, 2015, the November 
2015 Facilities Agreement was undrawn. 
In January 2016 the November 2015 
Facilities Agreement was utilized in full 
to finance the purchase price payable in 
respect of Shire’s acquisition of Dyax and 
certain costs related to the acquisition.
Interest on any loans made under the 
November 2015 Facilities Agreement is 
payable on the last day of each interest 
period, which may be one week or one, 
two, three or six months, or as otherwise 
agreed with the lenders. The interest rate 
applicable is LIBOR plus, in the case of 
November 2015 Facility A, 0.55% per annum, 
in the case of November 2015 Facility B, 
0.65% per annum and, in the case of 
November 2015 Facility C, 0.75% per 
annum, in each case until delivery of the 
first compliance certificate required to be 
delivered after the date of the November 
2015 Facilities Agreement and is subject 
to change thereafter depending on (i) the 
prevailing ratio of Net Debt to EBITDA 
(each as defined in the November 2015 
Facilities Agreement) in respect of the 
most recently completed financial year or 
financial half year and (ii) the occurrence 
and continuation of an event of default in 
respect of the financial covenants or failure 
to provide a compliance certificate.
The November 2015 Facilities Agreement 
includes customary representations 
and warranties, covenants and events of 
default, including requirements that Shire’s 
(i) ratio of Net Debt to EBITDA in respect of 
the most recently ended 12-month relevant 
period, (each as defined in the November 
2015 Facilities Agreement) must not, at any 
time, exceed 3.5:1, except that following an 
acquisitions fulfilling certain criteria, Shire 
may elect on a once only basis to increase 
this ratio to (a) 5.5:1 for the relevant period 
in which the acquisition was completed, 
(b) 5.0:1 in respect of the first relevant 
period following the relevant period in 
which the acquisition was completed and 
(c) 4.5:1 in respect of the second relevant 
period following the relevant period in 
which the acquisition was completed, 
and (ii) the ratio of EBITDA to Net Interest 
in respect of the most recently ended 
12-month relevant period (each as defined 
in the November 2015 Facilities Agreement) 
must not be less than 4.0:1.
The November 2015 Facilities Agreement 
restricts, subject to certain exceptions, 
Shire’s ability to incur additional financial 
indebtedness, grant security over its assets 
or provide loans/grant credit. Further, any 
lender may require mandatory prepayment 
of its participation if there is a change of 
control of Shire, subject to certain 
exceptions for schemes of arrangement 
and analogous schemes.
Events of default under the November 2015 
Facilities Agreement include, subject to 
customary grace periods and materiality 
thresholds: (i) non-payment of any 
amounts due under the finance documents 
(as defined in the November 2015 
Facilities Agreement), (ii) failure to satisfy 
any financial covenants, (iii) material 
misrepresentation in any of the finance 
documents, (iv) failure to pay, or certain 
other defaults, under other financial 
indebtedness, (v) certain insolvency 
events or proceedings, (vi) material adverse 
changes in the business, operations, 
assets or financial condition of Shire as a 
whole, (vii) if it becomes unlawful for Shire 
(or any successor parent company) or any 
of their respective subsidiaries that are 
parties to the November 2015 Facilities 
Agreement to perform their obligations 
thereunder or (viii) if Shire (or any successor 
parent company) or any subsidiary thereof 
which is a party to the November 2015 
Facilities Agreement repudiates the 
November 2015 Facilities Agreement or any 
other finance document, among others. 
The November 2015 Facilities Agreement is 
governed by English law.
January 2015 Facility Agreement
On January 11, 2015, Shire entered into an 
$850 million term facility agreement with, 
among others, Citigroup Global Markets 
Limited (acting as mandated lead arranger 
and bookrunner) (the “January 2015 Facility 
Agreement”) with an original maturity date 
of January 10, 2016. The maturity date was 
subsequently extended to July 11, 2016 in 
line with the provisions within the January 
2015 Facility Agreement allowing the maturity 
date to be extended twice, at Shire’s option, 
by six months on each occasion.
The January 2015 Facility Agreement was 
available to finance the purchase price 
payable in respect of Shire’s acquisition 
of NPS Pharma (including certain related 
costs). On September 28, 2015 the 
Company reduced the January 2015 
Facility Agreement by $100 million. As 
at December 31, 2015 the January 2015 
Facility Agreement, was fully utilized in the 
amount of $750 million. In January 2016 
and at various points thereafter, the 
Company canceled parts of the January 
2015 Facility Agreement. On February 22, 
2016, the Company repaid in full the 
remaining balance of $100 million.
2013 Facilities Agreement
On November 11, 2013, Shire entered into 
a $2,600 million facilities agreement with, 
among others, Morgan Stanley Bank 
International Limited (acting as mandated 
lead arranger and bookrunner) (the “2013 
Facilities Agreement”). The 2013 Facilities 
Agreement comprised two credit facilities: 
(i) a $1,750 million term loan facility and 
(ii) an $850 million term loan facility. 
On December 13, 2013 and at various points 
thereafter, the Company cancelled parts 
of the 2013 Facilities Agreement. On 
September 28, 2015 the Company repaid 
in full the remaining balance of $350 million 
under the 2013 Facilities Agreement.
Short-term uncommitted lines of credit 
(“Credit lines”)
Shire has access to various Credit lines 
from a number of banks which provide 
flexibility to short-term cash management 
procedures. These Credit lines can be 
withdrawn by the banks at any time. The 
Credit lines are not relied upon for core 
liquidity. As at December 31, 2015 these 
Credit lines were not utilized.

Financing
Shire anticipates that its operating cash 
flow together with available cash, cash 
equivalents and the RCF will be sufficient 
to meet its anticipated future operating 
expenses, capital expenditures, tax and 
interest payments, lease obligations, 
repayment of the term loans and milestone 
payments as they become due over the 
next twelve months. 
Shire’s existing cash, January 2016 
Facilities Agreement and the RCF are 
sufficient to finance Shire’s proposed 
combination with Baxalta.
If the Company decides to acquire other 
businesses, it expects to fund these 
acquisitions from cash resources, the 
RCF, term loan facilities and through new 
borrowings (including issuances of debt 
securities) or the issuance of new equity 
if necessary.
Sources and uses of cash 
The following table provides an analysis 
of the Company’s gross and net cash 
(excluding restricted cash), as at 
December 31, 2015 and 2014:

  Substantially all of the Company’s cash and 
cash equivalents are held by foreign subsidiaries 
(i.e, those subsidiaries incorporated outside of 
Jersey, Channel Islands, the jurisdiction of 
incorporation of Shire plc, Shire’s holding company). 
The amount of cash and cash equivalents held 
by foreign subsidiaries has not had, and is not 
expected to have, a material impact on the 
Company’s liquidity and capital resources.
2
  Net (debt)/cash is a Non GAAP measure. The 
Company believes that Net (debt)/cash is a useful 
measure as it indicates the level of net cash/
borrowings after taking account the cash and 
cash equivalents that could be utilized to pay 
down the outstanding borrowings. See above 
for reconciliation to cash and cash equivalents.
Cash flow activity
Net cash provided by operating activities 
for the year to December 31, 2015 
decreased by $1,891.4 million or 45% to 
$2,337.0 million (2014: $4,228.4 million). 
Net cash provided by operating activities 
in 2014 included the receipt of the 
$1,635 million break fee in relation to 
AbbVie’s terminated offer for Shire, and 
the benefit of the $417 million repayment 
received from the Canadian revenue 
authorities. Excluding these items net cash 
provided by operating activities in 2015 
increased by $160.6 million as a result of 
higher cash receipts from gross product 
sales and royalties, which were partially 
offset by higher operating expense 
payments, including payments in relation 
to integration, reorganization activities and 
employee retention payments following 
AbbVie’s terminated offer for Shire. 
Net cash provided by operating activities 
for the year to December 31, 2014 
increased by $2,765.4 million or 189% to 
$4,228.4 million (2013: $1,463.0 million) 
primarily due to the receipt of the 
$1,635 million break fee in relation to 
AbbVie’s terminated offer for Shire, the 
benefit of the $417 million repayment 
received from the Canadian revenue 
authorities and higher cash receipts from 
gross product sales, offset by payments for 
sales deductions, payments of acquisition 
and integration costs in respect of the 
acquisitions of ViroPharma, Lumena and 
Fibrotech, costs in connection with Abbvie’s 
terminated offer for Shire and cash payments 
in respect of the One Shire reorganization.
Net cash used in investing activities was 
$5,619.9 million in the year to December 
31, 2015, principally relating to the cash 
paid for the acquisition of NPS Pharma of 
$5,220 million (excluding cash acquired 
with NPS Pharma of $42 million) and for the 
acquisitions of Foresight ($299 million) and 
Meritage ($75 million).
Net cash used in investing activities was 
$4,030.6 million in the year to December 
31, 2014, principally relating to the cash 
paid for the acquisition of ViroPharma of 
$3,997 million (excluding cash acquired 
with ViroPharma of $233 million) and for 
the acquisition of Lumena of $300 million 
(excluding cash acquired with Lumena of 
$46 million), offset by the proceeds received 
on the sale of non-core product rights. 
Net cash provided by financing activities 
was $439.0 million for the year to 
December 31, 2015, principally due to the 
drawings, net of subsequent repayments, 
made under Shire’s various borrowing 
facilities to partially fund the NPS Pharma, 
Meritage and Foresight acquisitions. In 
addition the Company made dividend 
payments of $134.4 million.
Net cash provided by financing activities 
was $554.5 million for the year to 
December 31, 2014, principally due to the 
drawings, net of subsequent repayments, 
made under the facilities to partially fund 
the ViroPharma acquisition. In addition 
the Company paid cash of $551.4 million 
to settle the convertible debt assumed 
with ViroPharma, received cash of 
$346.7 million upon settlement of a 
purchased call option acquired with 
ViroPharma and made dividend payments 
of $121.2 million.
Outstanding letters of credit
At December 31, 2015, the Company had 
irrevocable standby letters of credit and 
guarantees with various banks totaling 
$48 million, providing security for the 
Company’s performance of various 
obligations. These obligations are 
primarily in respect of the recoverability 
of insurance claims, lease obligations and 
supply commitments. 
58 Shire Annual Report 2015 Off-balance sheet arrangements
There are no off-balance sheet 
arrangements, aside from those outlined 
above, that have, or are reasonably likely 
to have, a current or future material effect 
on the Company’s financial condition, 
revenues or expenses, results of 
operations, liquidity, capital expenditures 
or capital resources.
Foreign currency fluctuations 
A number of the Company’s subsidiaries 
have a functional currency other than the 
US Dollar. As such, the consolidated 
financial results are subject to fluctuations 
in exchange rates, particularly in the Euro, 
Swiss Franc and Pound Sterling against 
the US Dollar. 
The accumulated foreign currency 
translation differences at December 31, 
2015 of $156.4 million are reported within 
accumulated other comprehensive income 
in the consolidated balance sheet and 
foreign exchange losses for the year to 
December 31, 2015 of $26.5 million are 
reported in the consolidated statements 
of income.
At December 31, 2015, the Company 
had outstanding swap and forward 
foreign exchange contracts to manage the 
currency risk associated with intercompany 
transactions. At December 31, 2015 the fair 
value of these contracts was a net liability 
of $9.6 million.
Cash Requirements 
At December 31, 2015 the Company’s cash requirements for short and long term liabilities reflected on the Balance Sheet and other 
contractual obligations were as follows:

1
  The Company leases certain land, facilities, motor vehicles and certain equipment under operating leases expiring through 2021. 
2
  Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods, investments or services (including clinical trials, contract manufacturing and capital equipment), 
including open purchase orders, that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. Shire expects to fund these commitments with cash 
flows from operating activities.
3
  Unrecognized tax benefits and associated interest and penalties of $201.2 million are included within payments due in one to three years.
In addition to the above contractual 
obligations, the Company is committed 
to make milestone payments (principally 
arising from the in-licensing or acquisition 
of products, assets and businesses), 
contingent upon the occurrence of future 
events (and therefore payment is not 
yet due). At December 31, 2015, the 
Company is contingently committed to 
pay up to approximately $0.8 billion 
(aggregate contractual amount) in respect 
of potential future research and development 
milestone payments and up to approximately 
$1.1 billion (aggregate contractual amount) 
in respect of commercial milestones as 
a result of prior business combinations 
and in-licensing agreements. Payments 
under these agreements are generally 
due and payable only upon achievement 
of certain development, regulatory and 
commercial milestones. 
From a business perspective, these 
payments signify that the product is 
successfully moving through development 
and is now generating or is more likely to 
generate cash flows from product sales. 
However, it is not possible to predict with 
reasonable certainty whether these 
milestones will be achieved or the timing 
of their achievement. As a result, these 
potential payments are not included in 
the table of contractual obligations.
Inflation
Although at reduced levels in recent 
years, inflation continues to apply upward 
pressure on the cost of goods and services 
which are used in the business. However, 
the Company believes that the net effect of 
inflation on its revenues and operations has 
been minimal during the past three years.
Treasury policies and organization
The Company’s principal treasury 
operations are coordinated by its corporate 
treasury function. All treasury operations 
are conducted within a framework of 
policies and procedures approved annually 
by the Board of Directors. As a matter of 
policy, the Company does not undertake 
speculative transactions that would increase 
its credit, currency or interest rate exposure.
Interest rate risk
The Company is principally exposed to 
interest rate risk on any borrowings under 
the Company’s various debt facilities (see 
Liquidity and Capital Resources for details 
of each of the Company’s facilities). Interest 
on each of these facilities is set at floating 
rates, to the extent utilized. Shire’s exposure 
under these facilities is to US dollar interest 
rates. At December 31, 2015 the Company 
had fully utilized the January 2015 Facility 
Agreement and utilized $750 million of the 
RCF. Other facilities were not utilized at 
December 31, 2015.

The Company regularly evaluates the 
interest rate risk on its facilities. At 
December 31, 2015 the Company 
considered the risks associated with 
floating interest rates on borrowings under 
its facilities as appropriate. A hypothetical 
one percentage point increase or decrease 
in the interest rates applicable to drawings 
under the January 2015 Facility Agreement 
and the RCF at December 31, 2015 would 
increase interest expense by approximately 
$15 million per annum or would decrease 
the interest expense by approximately 
$7 million per annum. 
The Company is also exposed to interest 
rate risk on its restricted cash, cash and 
cash equivalents and on foreign exchange 
contracts on which interest is set at floating 
rates. This exposure is primarily limited to 
US dollar, Pounds sterling and Euro interest 
rates. As the Company maintains all of 
its cash, liquid investments and foreign 
exchange contracts on a short term basis 
for liquidity purposes, this risk is not 
actively managed. In the year to December 
31, 2015 the average interest rate received 
on cash and liquid investments was less 
than 1% per annum. These cash and liquid 
investments were primarily invested in 
US dollar term deposits with banks and 
money market and liquidity funds. 
No derivative instruments were entered 
into during the year to December 31, 2015 
to manage interest rate exposure. The 
Company continues to review its interest 
rate risk and the policies in place to 
manage the risk and may enter into 
derivative instruments to manage interest 
rate risk in the future. 
Foreign exchange risk
The Company trades in numerous 
countries and as a consequence has 
transactional and translational foreign 
exchange exposures.
Transactional exposure arises where 
transactions occur in currencies different 
to the functional currency of the relevant 
subsidiary. The main trading currencies 
of the Company are the US dollar, Pounds 
Sterling, Swiss Franc, Canadian dollar 
and the Euro. It is the Company’s policy 
that these exposures are minimized to 
the extent practicable by denominating 
transactions in the subsidiary’s 
functional currency. 
Where significant exposures remain, the 
Company uses foreign exchange contracts 
(being spot, forward and swap contracts) 
to manage the exposure for balance sheet 
assets and liabilities that are denominated 
in currencies different to the functional 
currency of the relevant subsidiary. These 
assets and liabilities relate predominantly 
to inter-company financing. The foreign 
exchange contracts have not been 
designated as hedging instruments. 
Cash flows from derivative instruments 
are presented within net cash provided 
by operating activities in the consolidated 
cash flow statement, unless the derivative 
instruments are economically hedging 
specific investing or financing activities.
Translational foreign exchange exposure 
arises on the translation into US dollars of 
the financial statements of non-US dollar 
functional subsidiaries.
At December 31, 2015 the Company had 
39 swap and forward foreign exchange 
contracts outstanding to manage currency 
risk. The swap and forward contracts 
mature within 90 days. The Company 
did not have credit risk related contingent 
features or collateral linked to the derivatives. 
The Company has master netting 
agreements with a number of counterparties 
to these foreign exchange contracts and 
on the occurrence of specified events, 
the Company has the ability to terminate 
contracts and settle them with a net 
payment by one party to the other. The 
Company has elected to present derivative 
assets and derivative liabilities on a gross 
basis in the consolidated balance sheet. 
As at December 31, 2015 the potential 
effect of rights of set-off associated with 
the foreign exchange contracts would be 
an offset to both assets and liabilities of 
$1.4 million, resulting in net derivative 
assets and derivative liabilities of $0.5 million 
and $10.1 million, respectively. Further 
details are included below.
Foreign exchange risk sensitivity
The following exchange rate sensitivity 
analysis summarizes the sensitivity of the 
Company’s reported revenues and net 
income to hypothetical changes in the 
average annual exchange rates of the Euro, 
Pound Sterling and Swiss Franc against 
the US Dollar (assuming a hypothetical 
10% strengthening of the US Dollar 
against each of the aforementioned 
currencies in the year to December 31, 
2015) (see Table 1 below).
A 10% weakening of the US Dollar against 
the aforementioned currencies would have 
an equal and opposite effect.
The table below provides information about 
the Company’s swap and forward foreign 
exchange contracts by currency pair. The 
table presents the net principal amounts 
and weighted average exchange rates of 
all outstanding contracts. All contracts 
have a maturity date of less than three 
months (see Table 2 below).
Concentration of credit risk
Financial instruments that potentially 
expose Shire to concentrations of credit 
risk consist primarily of short-term cash 
investments, derivative contracts and trade 
accounts receivable (from product sales 
and from third parties from which the 
Company receives royalties). Cash is 
invested in short-term money market 
instruments, including money market and 
liquidity funds and bank term deposits. 
The money market and liquidity funds in 
which Shire invests are all triple A rated by 
both Standard and Poor’s and by Moody’s 
credit rating agencies.
60 Shire Annual Report 2015 The Company is exposed to the credit risk 
of the counterparties with which it enters 
into bank term deposit arrangements and 
derivative instruments. The Company limits 
this exposure through a system of internal 
credit limits which vary according to ratings 
assigned to the counterparties by the major 
rating agencies. The internal credit limits are 
approved by the Board and exposure against 
these limits is monitored by the corporate 
treasury function. The counterparties to 
these derivatives contracts are major 
international financial institutions. 
The Company’s revenues from product 
sales in the US are mainly governed by 
agreements with major pharmaceutical 
wholesalers and relationships with other 
pharmaceutical distributors and retail 
pharmacy chains. For the year to 
December 31, 2015 there were three 
customers in the US that accounted for 
47% of the Company’s product sales. 
However, such customers typically have 
significant cash resources and as such 
the risk from concentration of credit is 
considered acceptable. The Company has 
taken positive steps to manage any credit 
risk associated with these transactions and 
operates clearly defined credit evaluation 
procedures. However, an inability of one 
or more of these wholesalers to honor 
their debts to the Company could have an 
adverse effect on the Company’s financial 
condition and results of operations. 
A substantial portion of the Company’s 
accounts receivable in countries outside 
of the United States is derived from 
product sales to government-owned 
or government-supported healthcare 
providers. The Company’s recovery of 
these accounts receivable is therefore 
dependent upon the financial stability 
and creditworthiness of the relevant 
governments. In recent years global 
and national economic conditions 
have negatively affected the growth, 
creditworthiness and general economic 
condition of certain markets in which the 
Company operates. As a result, in some 
countries outside of the US, specifically, 
Argentina, Greece, Italy, Portugal and 
Spain (collectively the “Relevant Countries”) 
the Company is experiencing delays in 
the remittance of receivables due from 
government-owned or government-
supported healthcare providers. The 
Company continued to receive remittances 
in relation to government-owned or 
government-supported healthcare providers 
in the Relevant Countries in the year to 
December 31, 2015, including receipts of 
$116.0 million and $100.0 million in respect 
of Spanish and Italian receivables, respectively. 
The Company’s exposure to Greece, both 
in terms of gross accounts receivable and 
annual revenues, is not material.
The Company’s aggregate accounts 
receivable, net of the allowance for doubtful 
accounts, in total from government-owned 
or government-supported healthcare 
providers in those territories in which the 
Company is experiencing the most significant 
delays, (i.e. in the “Relevant Countries”) 
are as follows (see Table 3 below).
Accounts receivable due from government-
owned or government-supported healthcare 
providers in the Relevant Countries of 
$106 million (2014: $77 million) are split 
by country as follows:  
Greece $7 million (2014: $4 million); 
Italy $49 million (2014: $30 million); 
Portugal $9 million (2014: $11 million); 
Spain $33 million (2014: $15 million); and 
Argentina $8 million (2014: $17 million).
The Company continues to receive 
remittances in relation to government-
owned or government-supported healthcare 
providers in the Relevant Countries and in 
the year to December 31, 2015 received 
$294 million in settlement of accounts 
receivable in the Relevant Countries; 
$3 million was from Greece; $100 million 
from Italy; $13 million from Portugal; 
$116 million from Spain; and $62 million 
from Argentina.
To date the Company has not incurred 
material losses on accounts receivable in 
the Relevant Countries, and continues to 
consider that such accounts receivable 
are recoverable. 
Other than the accounts receivable from 
government-owned or supported healthcare 
providers outlined above, the Company 
does not hold any other government debt 
from the Relevant Countries. Additionally 
the Company does not consider it is 
currently exposed to significant credit 
risk outside of the Relevant Countries.
The Company continues to evaluate all its 
accounts receivable for potential collection 
risks and has made provision for amounts 
where collection is considered to be 
doubtful. If the financial condition of the 
Relevant Countries or other countries 
suffer significant deterioration, such that 
their ability to make payments becomes 
uncertain, additional allowances for 
doubtful accounts may be required, and 
losses may be incurred, in future periods. 
Any such loss could have an adverse effect 
on the Company’s financial condition and 
results of operations.

 Shire Annual Report 2015 63 appointed Senior Independent Director 
from the same date. Bill’s international 
business, Board and leadership experience 
makes him particularly well-suited to this 
position, and I am grateful for him 
assuming this additional responsibility.
As a Board our primary purpose is to 
provide a balanced perspective on matters 
material to Shire’s stakeholders. In doing 
so, we do our utmost to promote a culture 
of good governance throughout the 
organization and to ensure that effective 
internal control and risk management 
measures are in place. Integral to this 
work is our continued, active engagement 
with Shire leaders, teams and individual 
employees. In 2015 we took the time to 
meet with these groups in multiple 
locations; to ask questions, to listen and 
to understand emerging opportunities.
The Board remains committed to the 
promotion of diversity in all of the Company’s 
recruitment practices. That commitment 
is reflected in the Board Diversity Policy. 
We continue to heighten our emphasis on 
succession planning and talent management; 
developing new policies and opportunities 
within Shire’s performance-based culture. 
In 2015, the Board underwent an externally 
facilitated performance evaluation. This 
reaffirmed many of the strengths of the 
Board and its committees and highlighted 
areas where performance could be further 
enhanced. Details on the procedure, 
conclusions and points of focus can be 
found on pages 67 to 68.
The past year has been transformative for 
Shire. The Board has overseen the growth 
of the business with multiple strategic 
acquisitions announced and completed, 
several successful new product launches, 
an expansion in global footprint and the 
strengthening of our pipeline to be the 
most robust in Shire’s history. These 
achievements along with many others have 
contributed to Shire’s increased dynamism 
and are in support of a culture where the 
delivery of excellence is rewarded.
Looking ahead to 2016, the Board and I will 
continue to focus on the rigorous oversight 
of the Company and on investment in our 
four strategic drivers of growth, innovation, 
efficiency and people.
Susan Kilsby 
Chairman
Corporate governance report 
Effective corporate governance is integral 
to the delivery of Shire’s strategy.
We brought sharp vision to our work; a 
commitment to challenging dialogue coupled 
with a spirit of collaboration and shared

a Non-Executive Director with international 
business and leadership experience who 
is currently the Chief Executive Officer at 
Smith & Nephew plc; Sara Mathew, a 
Non-Executive Director with financial, 
strategic and technological experience 
who recently served as Chairman, 
President and Chief Executive Officer of 
Dun & Bradstreet, Inc.; and Shire’s new 
Chief Financial Officer, Jeff Poulton, who 
brings his financial, commercial and 
strategic acumen to the Board having held 
various finance and operational leadership 
roles within the Company. Each of these 
appointments has broadened the Board’s 
perspective as we work with management 
to plan for Shire’s future. 
I would also like to thank David Kappler 
for his significant contribution and service 
to Shire during his extended tenure. As 
announced, David will be stepping down as

Code”) were applied throughout the 
financial year ended December 31, 2015. 
The Board is of the opinion that, during 
this period, the Company complied with

Leadership 
Role of the Board
The principal purpose of the Board is to 
provide leadership to the Company in a 
manner that promotes its long term 
success, thereby maximizing value for its

Company faces and associated mitigation 
actions, and succession planning.
Division of responsibilities 
The Board comprises the Chairman, eight 
other Non-Executive Directors, the Chief 
Executive Officer and the Chief Financial 
Officer. The Chief Executive Officer, together 
with the Executive Committee, is responsible 
for business operations. The Non-Executive 
Directors are charged with exercising 
independent judgment during Board 
deliberation and ensuring the effective 
performance of members of management. 
The Chairman, Deputy Chairman, Senior 
Independent Director and Chief Executive 
Officer have distinctly different roles which 
are defined in writing and approved by the 
Board. These are summarized as follows:
Chairman 
The Chairman’s primary responsibility is to 
provide leadership to the Board; ensuring 
its effective operation. This is achieved in 
part through the promotion of an open and 
engaged culture that facilitates constructive 
dialogue both with management and in 
executive sessions of the Board. The 
Chairman is also responsible for ensuring 
effective communications between the 
Board and shareholders.
Deputy Chairman 
The Deputy Chairman is responsible 
for providing support and guidance to 
the Chairman; deputizing as required. 
In addition, in the absence of the Chairman 
the Deputy Chairman holds the casting 
vote in the case of an equality of votes. 
Senior Independent Director 
The Senior Independent Director is 
responsible for providing a sounding board 
for the Chairman and for serving as a 
trusted intermediary for the other Directors. 
In addition, the Senior Independent 
Director is responsible for leading meetings 
of the Non-Executive Directors in the 
absence of the Chairman and for consulting 
with shareholders when communication 
with the Chairman or Chief Executive 
Officer would be inappropriate. 
Chief Executive Officer
The principal responsibility of the Chief 
Executive Officer is to manage Shire’s 
day-to-day business. Having regard for the 
strategy, risk profile, objectives and policies 
set forth by the Board and its committees, 
the Chief Executive Officer is accountable 
to the Board for the development of the 
Company and its operations.
Full details of the aforementioned roles 
and responsibilities can be found on the

Corporate governance report

Board effectiveness 
Effective leadership is integral to the 
execution of the Company’s strategy and 
therefore to the fulfillment of its objectives. 
The Board is committed to ensuring the 
Company operates in accordance with the 
highest standards of governance in order 
to promote its success for the benefit of 
all stakeholders.
Composition and diversity 
The Board has reviewed the independence 
of the Non-Executive Directors, other than 
the Chairman, in accordance with the 
factors set forth for consideration in the 
Governance Code and determined that 
each individual seeking election/re-election 
continues to be independent in character 
and judgement. In addition, the Board 
regards each of its members as possessing 
the skills, knowledge and experience 
necessary for it to function effectively. 
Board members’ biographical information 
can be found on pages 62 to 63.
The Board recognizes the inherent value 
of diversity at all levels within the Group and 
is therefore committed to its furtherance. 
Shire’s Board Diversity Policy acknowledges 
that the Company, its shareholders and 
other stakeholders are best served by a 
Board diverse in skill, experience and 
background, including gender. The principles 
of the policy are taken into account by both 
the Board and the Nomination Committee 
in their consideration of potential Board 
members, with its diversity-endorsing 
values reflected in recruitment policies in 
effect throughout the Group. Additional 
disclosure relating to diversity within Shire 
is made on page 32.
Appointments
The Board may appoint any individual 
as a Director either to fill a vacancy or 
as an additional member of the Board. 
The process for new appointments is led 
by the Nomination Committee (procedural 
details are available on page 73) which 
ultimately makes a recommendation to 
the Board.
Appointments may be made by the Board 
at any time subject to subsequent election 
and annual re-election by the Company’s 
shareholders. With the exception of 
David Kappler, all of the Directors are 
seeking election or re-election at the 
Annual General Meeting to be held on 
April 28, 2016. At this meeting Non-
Executive Director terms of appointment 
and Executive Director service contracts 
will be made available for inspection 
by shareholders. 
Only members of the Board are entitled to 
attend Board meetings, however, during 
the year the following additional individuals 
regularly attended by invitation:
Attendee
 > General Counsel and Company 
Secretary (including interim 
appointee) 
 > Head of Corporate Development
 > Chief Human Resources Officer
 > Head of Research and Development
 > Head of Clinical Development
 > Group Financial Controller
 > Head of Treasury and Insurance
 > Head of Tax
 > Head of Transactions
 > Chief Compliance and Risk Officer
 > Head of Communications and 
Public Affairs
External professional advisors also 
attended meetings when necessary. At the 
conclusion of scheduled Board meetings it 
is customary for the Non-Executive 
Directors to meet without Executive 
Directors or management present, 
 
following which a meeting of the Non-
Executive Directors led by the Senior 
Independent Director is held in the absence 
of the Chairman. Matters considered by the 
Board are those reserved for their 
judgment and decision, as defined in the 
Board Reserve Powers, although 
supplementary matters are considered 
by the Board as circumstances require. 
The Board Reserve Powers are available 
on the Company’s website. 
The agenda for Board meetings is 
determined by the Chairman in 
collaboration with the Chief Executive 
Officer and the Company Secretary. 
The Chairman also has the responsibility 
of ensuring that all necessary information 
is provided to the Board in a timely manner, 
in respect of which she is supported by 
the Company Secretary and other members 
of management, and that sufficient time 
is made available at meetings for the 
consideration of individual agenda items. 
The Chairman encourages discussion with 
a view to achieving resolution by 
consensus. If this is unable to be achieved, 
decisions are to be taken by majority vote, 
with the Chairman having a casting vote 
in the case of an equality of votes.
66 Shire Annual Report 2015 Commitment 
Prior to appointment, each Non-Executive 
Director is required to disclose to the Board 
their other significant commitments so as 
to enable an assessment of their capacity 
to effectively discharge their anticipated 
duties and responsibilities. The Board in 
turn is informed by each Non-Executive 
Director of any changes to their other 
significant commitments. Each Non-
Executive Director has undertaken that 
they are able to meet the time commitment 
expected of them, which was duly 
communicated by the Board prior to 
appointment. As part of the externally 
facilitated Board performance evaluation, 
feedback was provided to the Chairman 
in respect of individual Board members. 
It was concluded that each of the Directors 
evidenced continued effective performance 
and commitment to their role. 
Conflicts of interest
Directors are required to seek consent 
from the Board prior to being appointed to, 
or acquiring any material financial interest 
in, any enterprise which competes, is likely 
to compete or has a significant business 
relationship with the Company. In addition, 
Directors are required to disclose the 
nature and extent of any interest they 
have, whether direct or indirect, in any 
transaction entered into, or proposed to be 
entered into, by the Group which conflicts, 
or may conflict, with the Company’s 
interests. Such disclosures are made at the 
first Board meeting at which the transaction 
is considered after the Director concerned 
becomes aware of the conflict of interest, 
or potential conflict, following which the 
Director abstains from all associated 
discussion and voting.
Induction and development 
Upon appointment to the Board all Directors 
undergo a formal induction program 
tailored to their individual skills, knowledge 
and experience. The purpose of such a 
program is to facilitate each Director’s 
familiarization with the Company’s business, 
strategy and governance structure, as well 
as their own duties and responsibilities. 
Induction activities undertaken during the 
year are as follows:
Chief Financial Officer
Jeff Poulton has served Shire for 
many years in various finance and 
leadership positions and is therefore 
familiar with the Company’s 
operations and strategy. Induction 
activities undertaken as a result of 
his Board appointment have focused 
on the responsibilities associated 
with serving as a director of a global, 
listed company.
Non-Executive Directors
As newly appointed Board members, 
Olivier Bohuon and Sara Mathew 
have each undertaken induction 
meetings with members of Shire’s 
Executive Committee and other 
members of management. In addition, 
Mr. Bohuon participated in an 
orientation visit to Shire’s International 
Operational Headquarters in Zug as 
well as a further sales integration 
visit, whilst Ms. Mathew undertook 
an in-depth exercise concerning 
executive remuneration processes 
and regulations. Further induction 
activities will be made available to 
both Directors; typically coinciding 
with scheduled Board meetings.
In addition to undergoing an initial 
induction, on an annual basis each 
Director discusses with the Chairman 
their individual development requirements 
with a view to ensuring their skills, 
knowledge and experience are regularly 
refreshed, and that their familiarity with 
the Company’s business is maintained. 
A standing schedule of training topics 
enables directors to undertake, as required, 
detailed development initiatives focused 
on matters specific to the Company and 
its operating environment.
Information and support 
The Chairman, in collaboration with the 
Company Secretary and management, 
is responsible for ensuring that Board 
members are provided at all times with the 
information necessary for them to effectively 
discharge their duties and responsibilities. 
Before decisions are taken at Board 
meetings, consideration is had as to the 
adequacy of the information available to 
the Board; enabling the deferral of decision 
making if necessary. Directors are able 
to seek clarification, additional information 
or professional advice necessary to the 
fulfillment of their duties and responsibilities 
from across the business, from the 
Company Secretary or from independent 
sources at the Company’s expense.
 
In addition, the Chairman, supported by the 
Company Secretary, ensures that effective 
channels of communication exist between 
the Board, its committees and the 
Company’s management.
Board performance evaluation 
2014 progress 
In considering the results of the 2014 
internal evaluation and how effectiveness 
might be improved, the Board agreed that 
greater emphasis would be placed on 
succession planning and talent management 
in 2015. To this end, during the year 
the Board sought to ensure sufficient 
replenishment amongst its members 
such that its collective skill and experience 
greater supports the delivery of the 
Company’s strategy. A new Executive 
Director and two new Non-Executive 
Directors were appointed; each bringing 
valuable qualities to the Board and providing 
a broader perspective to its deliberations. 
Moreover, succession plans were put in 
place concerning the appointment of a 
new Senior Independent Director and 
consideration was had as to the skills and 
experience sought in future potential 
Board appointees. Further details regarding 
succession planning can be found in the 
Nomination Committee Report on page 73.
2015 procedure, conclusions and points 
of focus 
The 2015 Board performance evaluation 
was externally facilitated by Ffion Hague 
of Independent Board Evaluation. Neither 
Ms. Hague nor Independent Board 
Evaluation have any other connection 
with the Company. The evaluation was 
conducted in accordance with the principles 
of the Governance Code and therefore 
considered the balance of skills, experience, 
independence and knowledge of the 
Company on the Board, its diversity, including 
gender, its general cohesion and other 
factors relevant to its effectiveness. Led 
by Ms. Hague, the evaluation comprised:
 > Observations of Board and 
committee meetings
 > Detailed interviews, on an individual 
basis, with the Directors, members of 
management, the external audit partner 
and third-party advisors
 > Consideration of information provided to 
directors in support of the undertaking 
of their duties, including specific 
resource materials and briefing packs
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information
 Shire Annual Report 2015 67 A report detailing analysis and 
recommendations was subsequently 
compiled with conclusions discussed with 
the Chairman and then the Board as a 
whole. In drafting the report the evaluation 
team had regard to feedback received on 
matters specific to the operation of the 
Board and its committees including 
strategy and risk management, governance 
and compliance, succession planning and 
Board composition, culture and other 
pertinent matters. In addition, Ms. Hague 
provided specific feedback to:
 > Individual committee chairmen on their 
respective committee’s performance
 > The Chairman with respect to the 
performance of individual directors 
 > The Senior Independent Director 
concerning the Chairman’s performance
The overall conclusion drawn from the 
evaluation is that the Board is functioning 
well; demonstrating particular strength 
in culture with there existing a positive 
dynamic during discussion and debate. 
Individual directors are seen to exhibit a 
notable commitment to their roles with the 
Non-Executive Directors maintaining a 
high level of confidence in the Executive 
Directors and members of management. 
In pursuit of optimal effectiveness, the 
following areas were recommended for 
Board focus during the forthcoming year:
 > Structure and content of Board papers 
and presentations
 > Board agenda, objectives and priorities
 > Board induction and development 
programs 
Accountability
Risk management and internal control
The Board retains responsibility for Shire’s 
risk management and internal control 
systems which include the processes for 
identifying, evaluating and managing the 
principal risks faced by the Company. 
These systems are developed alongside 
the Company’s strategy and in accordance 
with applicable regulatory guidelines 
including the Internal Control — Integrated 
Framework 2013, issued by the 
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations 
of the Treadway Commission (“COSO 
Framework”), and the UK Financial 
Reporting Council’s Guidance on Risk 
Management, Internal Control and Related 
Financial and Business Reporting. Shire’s 
risk management and internal control 
framework has been in place for the 
duration of the financial year covered by, 
and to the date of the approval of, this 
Annual Report and Accounts.
Risk management and internal controls 
relating to financial reporting
The Group’s internal control program related 
to financial reporting (“ICPFR”) is aligned 
with the COSO Framework. It comprises 
a combination of manual, automated, 
preventative and detective controls, as well 
as underlying IT controls for key financial 
systems, which are documented, tested 
and reported on throughout the year. The 
ICPFR takes into account key policies such 
as the Financial Controller’s Manual and 
the Delegation of Authority matrix, as well 
as pervasive entity level controls including 
those relating to integrity and ethical 
values, adherence to codes of conduct and 
the Board’s oversight of internal control 
and organizational structure. In addition, on 
an annual basis the Internal Audit function 
develops and executes a risk-based audit 
plan covering areas of financial, compliance 
and operational risk across the various 
Group functions and geographic locations. 
Results of these audits together with results 
of ICPFR testing are regularly reviewed 
by the Audit, Compliance & Risk (“ACR”) 
Committee which, along with management, 
assesses the ongoing effectiveness of 
the ICPFR against the COSO Framework. 
In addition, an established process of 
escalation enables the ACR Committee 
and the Board to review matters material 
to the Group on a timely basis as they 
arise. Based on its ongoing assessment, 
management believes that the ICPFR was 
effective as of December 31, 2015.
Due to the inherent limitation of internal 
controls over financial reporting, material 
misstatements due to error may not be 
prevented or detected. Projections of 
any evaluation of effectiveness for future 
periods are subject to the risk that controls 
may become inadequate because of 
changes in conditions, or that the degree 
of compliance with the policies or 
procedures may deteriorate. 
Monitoring and review
The Board, supported by the ACR 
Committee, is responsible for the ongoing 
monitoring and review of the Company’s 
risk management and internal control 
systems. At the start of the year the Board 
determines how this is to be achieved, 
including agreeing a scheduled monitoring 
program and identifying those aspects that 
will be overseen, on its behalf, by the ACR 
Committee. In addition, the Board ensures 
that considerations of risk feature within 
its wider discussions including those 
concerning the Company’s business 
model and strategy. Together, this allows 
for reflection on the determination, 
identification, assessment and mitigation of 
the Company’s principal risks; enabling the 
Board to continually evaluate whether the 
risk management and internal control 
systems remain appropriate. 
In addition to its ongoing appraisal, the 
Board is responsible for undertaking an 
annual review of the effectiveness of the 
Company’s risk management and internal 
control systems. This is achieved through 
dedicated discussion during which key 
factors related to the Company’s risk 
management and internal control regime 
are considered. Typically, these include its 
operation and integration, management’s 
oversight and related reporting, risk 
tolerance and culture as well as any 
other aspects pertinent to the affairs of 
the Company. Moreover, drawing on its 
more-regular discussions and feedback 
from the ACR Committee, the Board 
reflects on key matters that have arisen 
during the year and the Company’s ability 
to respond appropriately to internal and 
external developments as they arise. 
Together, this enables the Board to 
evaluate the principal features of the risk 
management and internal control systems, 
consider their composition relative to Shire’s 
strategic direction and draw conclusions as 
to their overall effectiveness. Following its 
review in respect of the 2015 financial year 
and the period up to the approval of this 
Annual Report and Accounts, the Board 
neither identified, nor was advised of, any 
deficiencies within the Company’s risk 
management and internal control systems 
that were considered material to the Group 
as a whole. Further details on Shire’s risk 
management framework can be found on 
pages 36 to 37.
Going concern
The Directors’ Report (covering pages 
1 to 104) sets out information on the 
financial position of the Group including its 
cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing 
facilities, its business activities together 
with factors likely to affect future 
development, performance and financial 
position, its objectives, policies and 
processes for managing capital, its financial 
risk management objectives, details of its 
hedging activity and its exposures to credit 
and liquidity risk. Details of the Group’s 
financial instruments are disclosed in 
Note 20 to the consolidated financial 
statements. The Directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group 
has adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. Thus, they consider it appropriate 
to adopt the going concern basis of 
accounting in preparing the annual 
financial statements.

68 Shire Annual Report 2015 Ongoing viability
On an annual basis the Company undertakes 
a long-range planning exercise (the “LRP”) 
as part of its wider strategic review. 
Stress-testing of the LRP is undertaken 
through the application of key sensitivities 
related to the Company’s principal risks 
and uncertainties (as outlined on pages 
36 to 47) with a view to determining their 
potential impact on the Company’s financial 
position and performance. Analysis of the 
LRP in conjunction with the Board’s robust 
assessment of principal risks, including the 
realistic availability and likely effectiveness 
of mitigating actions, underpins the Group’s 
planning processes and contributes to the 
determination and implementation of the 
Company’s strategy. 
For the purpose of assessing ongoing 
viability the Board considered the Company’s 
prospects over a four-year period, consistent 
with the relative focus within the LRP as well 
as brand and business planning horizons. 
The Board also keeps the Company’s 
solvency and liquidity under review through 
regular reporting from its committees, 
management and from the Group’s external 
auditor. The Board continually evaluates 
the assurance it receives and considers 
the impact of significant projects, strategic 
developments and other significant 
commitments on the Company’s risk 
profile and ultimately its ongoing viability. 
Having regard to the strategic review, the 
LRP and the Company’s principal risks and 
uncertainties, the Board has a reasonable 
expectation that the Company will be 
able to continue in operation and meet its 
liabilities as they fall due over the four-year 
period of its assessment. In making its 
assessment, the Board considered the 
potential effect of key sensitivities, including 
generic competition and the potential 
failure of key pipeline programs. The Board 
also considered as an additional sensitivity 
the effect of the announced combination 
with Baxalta, Inc. including the announced 
refinancing plans and the likelihood that the 
proposed combination would interfere with 
the tax-free status of Baxalta’s spinoff 
from Baxter International, Inc. To support 
the Board’s conclusion, the Company 
conducted extensive due diligence and 
received an unqualified “will” opinion that 
the combination will not interfere with the 
tax-free status of the spinoff. On the basis 
that the transaction completes as anticipated, 
the Board’s expectation of the Company’s 
ongoing viability remains unchanged. 
Relations with shareholders
The Board is committed to maintaining 
open and constructive dialog with 
shareholders; helping to ensure common 
awareness and interpretation of strategic 
objectives, matters of governance and of 
the Company’s performance. The principal 
points of contact for major shareholders 
are the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief 
Financial Officer and the Company’s Investor 
Relations team, with the views of investors 
communicated to the Board as a whole. 
During the year the Group engaged with 
shareholders through the below media.
Meetings with shareholders The Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and members of the Investor Relations 
team engaged with many of Shire’s major shareholders to receive views on matters material to the 
Company and its operations. Such matters included the acquisitions of NPS Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 
Dyax Corp. and the announced acquisition of Baxalta, Inc., the Company’s strategy, financial targets 
and executive remuneration.
Healthcare conferences Representatives of the Company engaged with shareholders and potential investors at many conferences 
held throughout the year at which presentations and other reference materials were made available.
Results announcements and presentations The Company communicated its performance to shareholders and analysts through quarterly 
financial results announcements; each accompanied by an explanatory webcast and Q&A session 
provided by the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer.
Financial reporting The Company published half and full-year reports and filed quarterly Form 10-Qs and an annual Form 
10-K in accordance with obligations arising from its listing on the London Stock Exchange and the 
NASDAQ Global Select Market.
Annual General Meeting The Company’s Annual General Meeting was held in Dublin on April 28, 2015. Shareholders were 
invited to attend and vote on resolutions and also to meet with members of the Board.

Committee
70 Shire Annual Report 2015 Role of the Committee 
The purpose of the Committee is to 
oversee Shire’s accounting and financial 
reporting processes, the audits of its 
financial statements and the effectiveness 
of the Company’s risk management and 
internal control framework. In doing so, 
the Committee’s principal duties are to:
 > monitor the integrity of the financial 
reports and statements of the Group 
and, where requested by the Board, 
advise on whether, taken as a whole, the 
Annual Report and Accounts is fair, 
balanced and understandable.
 > make recommendations to the Board 
on matters relating to the appointment 
of the external auditor, to determine and 
agree the scope of the external audit 
engagement and to consider findings 
and recommendations arising from the 
external audit process.
 > monitor and review the integrity and 
effectiveness of the Group’s internal 
financial controls and internal control 
and risk management systems.
 > review the Group’s strategy for the 
management of key corporate and 
financial risks.
 > review the status of the Group’s compliance 
program to ensure adherence to applicable 
legal and regulatory standards and to the 
Group’s internal policies.
In addition, the Committee is authorized to 
investigate any activity included within its 
terms of reference and is responsible for 
the resolution of any disagreement 
between management and the Group’s 
external auditor regarding financial 
reporting matters. The Committee is also 
permitted to seek any information it 
requires from any employee of the Group, 
and any external professional advice at the 
Company’s expense, necessary to the 
fulfillment of its duties.
Key considerations 
The significant issues considered by the 
Committee during the year in relation to the 
financial statements were:
 > purchase accounting related to the 
Group’s acquisition of NPS 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Meritage Pharma, 
Inc. and Foresight Biotherapeutics, Inc. 
The Committee reviewed and critiqued 
the critical accounting estimates used 
in the purchase price allocations, 
specifically the valuation of acquired 
intangible assets, and satisfied itself that 
these estimates were reasonable and 
appropriately applied. As a principal 
area of audit focus Deloitte LLP provided 
detailed reporting to the Committee 
in respect of these matters. Further 
information is available in Note 4 to 
the consolidated financial statements. 
 > accounting for sales deductions and 
rebates and the key judgments and 
estimates applied by the Company in 
calculating the liability recorded in the 
balance sheet for such items. As an 
area of audit focus Deloitte LLP also 
provided regular reporting to the 
Committee in respect of these matters. 
Further information is available in Note 3 (ii) 
to the consolidated financial statements. 
 > accounting for various tax related matters, 
including the level of tax provisions. 
Accounting for income tax is underpinned 
by a range of judgments (further information 
is available in Notes 3 (iii), 25 and 27 to 
the consolidated financial statements). 
The Committee addresses these issues, 
and the related accounting and 
disclosure, through a range of reporting 
from management and Deloitte LLP. 
 > accounting for the Company’s intangible 
assets, the recoverability of intangible 
assets and the impairments of SHP608 
and SHP625. The judgments in 
relation to intangible asset impairments 
principally related to the assumptions 
underlying the determination of the fair 
value of the asset being tested, 
primarily the achievability of the long 
term business plan underlying the valuation 
process. The Committee discussed 
with management the judgments and 
sensitivities relevant to intangible asset 
impairment reviews and Deloitte LLP 
provided detailed reporting to the 
Committee. Further information is 
available in Note 3 (i) to the consolidated 
financial statements. 
 > disclosure within the Group’s 2014 full-year 
and 2015 quarterly results announcements 
and related financial reports.
 > accounting for revenue recognition, 
including assessment of the risk relating 
to overstatement of the US Neuroscience, 
Gastrointestinal and Internal Medicine 
gross revenues, due to the potential for 
inventory to be shipped to wholesalers 
which significantly exceeds demand. As a 
principal area of audit focus Deloitte LLP 
provided detailed reporting to the 
Committee in respect of these matters. 
Further information is available in Note 3 (ii) 
to consolidated financial statements.
Committee activities 
The Committee’s activities during the 
year included:
Financial reporting
 > the review of the Company’s full-year 
results, quarterly earnings releases, key 
financial reports and earnings guidance
 > the monitoring of the Group’s 
compliance with its stated Non GAAP 
accounting policy applied in quarterly 
earnings releases.
 > the review of the Group’s treasury 
policies and ongoing treasury activities.
 > the monitoring of the Group’s accounts 
receivable exposure in certain Eurozone 
and Latin-American countries and the 
associated risk mitigation activities.
 > a review of tax matters impacting 
the Group.
External audit
 > the review of quarterly updates provided 
by the external auditor encompassing 
key areas of judgment and risk, audit 
planning, governance updates and other 
business-related matters.
 > the final review of the 2014 audit and 
the initial review of the external auditor’s 
performance and effectiveness during 
the 2015 financial year, including a review 
of management’s assessment of the 
performance and effectiveness of the 
external auditor.
 > the review and approval of the 2015 
Audit Plan and audit fee.
 > an assessment of the objectivity and 
independence of the external auditor.
Additional matters
 > compliance and audit updates from the 
Chief Compliance and Risk Officer and 
the Head of Internal Audit.
 > the renewal terms of the Group’s 
insurance program.
 > the Group’s internal audit program.
 > proposed arrangements to provide the 
Group with additional financial flexibility.
 > the Group’s foreign exchange exposure 
and hedging strategy.
 > the Group’s corporate risk schedule, 
including consideration of the principal 
risks faced by the Group and the 
associated mitigation strategy.
External audit 
Independence and objectivity 
The Committee recognizes both the need 
for an objective and independent external 
auditor and how such objectivity and 
independence might be, or appear, 
compromised through the provision of 
non-audit services. Accordingly, the 
Committee continues to oversee the 
established policy on the provision of 
non-audit services by the external auditor 
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information
 Shire Annual Report 2015 71 Corporate governance report 
continued
with a view to safeguarding these core 
attributes. The policy provides that, 
amongst other things, the auditor must 
not provide a service which:
 > creates a mutuality of interest.
 > places the auditor in a position where 
they would audit their own work.
 > results in the auditor acting as a manager 
or employee of the Company.
 > puts the auditor in role of advocate for 
the Company.
In addition, the policy prescribes services 
from which the external auditor is explicitly 
prohibited from providing, and those the 
provision of which has been pre-approved 
by the Committee subject to individual and 
aggregate monetary limits. All proposed 
services falling outside of the scope of the 
policy, or the monetary limits contained 
therein, must receive pre-approval from the 
Committee or from its Chairman subject to 
Committee approval at its next scheduled 
meeting. Fees in respect of non-audit 
services provided by the external auditor to 
the Company in 2015 totaled $4.4 million 
(2014: $4.6 million). These principally 
related to reporting accountant services 
provided in connection with the announced 
combination with Baxalta, Inc. (fees incurred 
in 2014 principally related to reporting 
accountant services provided in relation 
to the proposed merger with AbbVie, Inc. 
which was subsequently terminated). 
Further details on the breakdown of 
non-audit fees paid or due to the external 
auditor as a result of services provided 
during 2015 can be found in Note 30 to 
the consolidated financial statements.
Further factors identified as contributing to 
external auditor objectivity and independence 
include the external auditor’s retention of 
an impartial and questioning approach, 
particularly with respect to issues of 
heightened sensitivity, the firm’s prudent 
attitude to the consideration and undertaking 
of non-audit services and Shire’s own 
principle of not recruiting staff directly 
from the external audit engagement team.
During the year the Committee met with 
the external auditor to consider the 
external auditor’s independence and 
objectivity; ensuring that the relationship 
between the external auditor and members 
of financial management had not resulted, 
or appeared to result, in a lack of 
independence or objectivity. The Committee 
considers that, during 2015, the external 
auditor was sufficiently robust in dealings 
with members of financial management 
and that, in their absence, the external 
auditor was transparent and decisive in 
dealings with the Committee.
Effectiveness 
The Committee recognizes the importance 
of having a high-caliber of audit and as 
such, undertakes an annual assessment 
of the effectiveness of the external audit 
process. As part of its evaluation, the 
Committee drew upon a survey of 
members of financial management which 
measured the external auditor’s performance 
against predetermined “critical success 
factors”, designed to facilitate continuing 
and measurable improvement in the 
effectiveness of the external audit process. 
The Committee concluded that the 
“critical success factors” had been 
substantially met with there existing a 
constructive working relationship between 
the external auditor and members of financial 
management. Moreover, the Committee 
determined that the audit process was 
sufficiently robust, with the external auditor 
demonstrating continued commitment to 
the performance of high-quality audit work. 
Further areas of development were identified 
and communicated to the external audit 
firm which in turn has committed to 
working with management and the 
Committee to address these in 2016.
Appointment and tendering 
Deloitte LLP has served as Shire’s external 
auditor since 2002, with the current 
audit partner having served since his 
appointment in 2012. Following the 
review of Deloitte’s continued objectivity, 
independence and performance in respect 
of the 2015 financial year, and having 
received an expression of willingness to 
continue in office as external auditor, the 
Committee recommended to the Board 
the re-appointment of Deloitte LLP as the 
Company’s external auditor for the 2016 
financial year. There existed no contractual 
obligations that inhibited or influenced the 
Committee’s recommendation.
In accordance with European and 
national regulation, and the UK corporate 
governance regime, it is the Company’s 
policy that the external audit contract be 
put to tender at least once in every ten-year 
period, with the external audit partner 
rotating on a five-yearly basis. Notwithstanding 
such policy, having regard to transitional 
arrangements regarding external audit 
tendering and rotation provided by the 
relevant regulatory authorities, it is the 
Committee’s intention, subject to then-
prevailing circumstances, to put the 
external audit contract out to tender at a 
time that would see the process complete 
in 2020. This would result with the 
preferred external audit firm’s appointment 
aligning with the end of the incoming audit 
partner’s tenure in 2021. The incumbent 
audit partner is scheduled to step down 
in 2016. The Committee believes that the 
proposed timing of audit tender is in the 
best interests of shareholders as it stands 
to afford the Company continuity during 
the forthcoming years, particularly given 
the proposed transaction with Baxalta, Inc. 
It should be noted that, despite the 
Committee’s intention regarding the timing 
of tender, the external auditor is subject to 
ongoing effectiveness review and that the 
Committee may choose to put the external 
audit contract out to tender at any time 
it considers appropriate. In accordance 
with best practice, the Committee 
confirms voluntary compliance with the 
provisions of the Statutory Audit Services 
for Large Companies Market Investigation 
(Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender 
Processes and Audit Committee 
Responsibilities) Order 2014, as published by 
the UK Competition and Markets Authority.
Additional matters 
Internal audit 
Internal audit effectiveness is monitored 
and reviewed on an ongoing basis by 
the Committee. The Internal Audit Plan 
is approved annually by the Committee; 
progression against which is reviewed 
quarterly. In addition, periodically the 
Company’s internal audit procedures 
and capabilities undergo an independent 
external assessment against global 
standards, with the ensuing report 
reviewed by the Committee Chairman.
Whistleblowing 
Shire’s compliance effort is focused on 
the prevention and detection of misconduct 
through policy development, training, 
monitoring and audit. As part of this effort, 
Shire employees are encouraged to 
report suspected cases of misconduct, 
confidentially and without fear of retaliation, 
through management or through Shire’s 
Global Compliance Helpline. The helpline, 
the operation of which is overseen by 
the Chief Compliance and Risk Officer, 
is managed by an independent third 
party so as to preserve anonymity as 
appropriate. Concerns and allegations are 
thoroughly investigated with disciplinary 
action taken where necessary. Periodically 
the Chief Compliance and Risk Officer 
provides the Committee with a summary 
of matters raised through management 
and the helpline as well as details of any 
resultant investigations.

Role of the Committee 
The Committee’s responsibilities include:

Board and making recommendations to 
the Board with respect to any changes.
 > identifying, and nominating for the 
approval of the Board, candidates for 
new Board appointments.

Key considerations and activities 
During the year and up to the date of 
this report the Committee’s principal 
considerations and activities were:
Chief Financial Officer succession 
The search for a new Chief Financial Officer 
resumed in October 2014 following the 
termination of the proposed merger with 
AbbVie, Inc. Spencer Stuart, an executive 
search firm with no other connection to the 
Company, was retained to undertake the 
search. Shire announced in November 
2014 that Jeff Poulton, then Head of 
Investor Relations, would succeed the 
incumbent Interim Chief Financial Officer 
on January 1, 2015. Following an extensive 
review of internal and external candidates, 
Mr. Poulton was subsequently appointed 
Chief Financial Officer on April 29, 2015. 
Non-Executive Directors
The search continued for a new Non-
Executive Director with biotechnological 
and/or pharmaceutical experience as well 
as for an additional Non-Executive Director 
that would enhance the Board’s breadth 
of skills and experience. Search firms 
Russell Reynolds Associates and Odgers 
Berndtson were retained respectively to 
lead the searches, neither of which has 
any other connection with the Company. 
In each case an extensive review of 
prospective Board members was undertaken 
resulting with Olivier Bohuon’s appointment 
on July 1, 2015, and Sara Mathew’s 
appointment on September 1, 2015.
Senior Independent Director succession 
In anticipation of the conclusion of David 
Kappler’s tenure following the 2016 Annual 
General Meeting (“AGM”), succession 
plans were put in place regarding the 
appointment of a new Senior Independent 
Director. The Committee considered the 
skills and experience sought in the future 
appointee as well as the qualifications of 
existing Board members. With Bill Burns 
recusing himself from deliberations, 
the Committee agreed that Mr. Burns’ 
experience on the Shire Board, his 
understanding of UK and US corporate 
governance environments and his extensive 
international, commercial and operational 
experience in the pharmaceutical sector 
made him the preferred candidate for the 
role. The Committee recommended his 
appointment for the approval of the Board, 
which was subsequently announced to be 
effective following the conclusion of the AGM. 
Board Diversity Policy 
Following a review of the evolving 
environment regarding Board diversity, 
the Committee reviewed the Board 
Diversity Policy and agreed that it remains 
appropriate. In addition, the Committee 
reaffirmed its commitment to the promotion 
of diversity both in executive and non-
executive appointments and in recruitment 
practises throughout the Group. This view 
was shared with, and agreed by, the Board. 
Further details on diversity can be found 
on pages 32 and 66.
Board appointments procedure 
Board composition is central to the 
effective leadership of the Group and 
therefore, prior to commencing any 
search for prospective Board members, 
the Committee reflects on the Board’s 
current balance of skills and experiences 
and those that would be conducive to 
the delivery of the Company’s strategy. 
A recommendation is then made to the 
Board as to the core attributes sought, 
following which an appropriately qualified 
search firm is engaged and informed, 
amongst other things, of the experience, 
technical skills and other capabilities 
sought, of the time commitment required 
of any appointee and of Shire’s Board 
Diversity Policy. Short-listed candidates are 
interviewed by as many of the Committee 
members as is feasible, following which 
any preferred candidate meets with other 
Directors prior to a decision being made 
by the Board.

 Shire Annual Report 2015 75 Directors’ remuneration report
Anne Minto
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
Dear Shareholder
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to 
present the Remuneration Committee’s 
report for the financial year ending 
December 31, 2015. 
Context of the Committee’s decisions
It was another year of very good 
performance for the business in 2015 
as we forged ahead in executing our 
strategy to be the leading global biotech 
company focused on rare diseases and 
other specialty pharmaceutical areas. 
Highlights included the acquisitions of 
NPS, Meritage and Dyax (in early 2016) 
and the approval of Natpara as well as the 
further development of our rare diseases 
therapeutics pipeline. Our underlying 
business continued to perform well.
A number of new appointments were 
made to our leadership team at the executive 
management level: Jeff Poulton (Chief 
Financial Officer and Board member), 
Bill Mordan (General Counsel and Corporate 
Secretary) and Jeff Rosenbaum (Chief 
Compliance and Risk Officer). In addition, 
Sara Mathew and Olivier Bohuon were 
appointed to the Board as Non-Executive 
Directors. Our new appointments bring a 
wealth of experience which will be valuable 
in helping the business to continue to 
deliver against its ambitious targets. 
We again recorded strong financial 
performance in 2015 against our key 
performance metrics. Highlights include:
 > Net Product Sales increased to 
$6,100 million (2014: $5,830 million).
 > Non GAAP EBITDA
1
 increased to 
$2,924 million (2014: $2,756 million).
 > Non GAAP Adjusted ROIC
1
 of 10.3% 
(2014: 14.7%). As expected, this 
represents a lower return due to a 
significant increase in the invested 
capital in the business primarily due 
to the acquisition of NPS in Q1 2015.
CEO salary increase 
The Committee considered a number 
of key issues during the year, the most 
significant of which was to award a 25% 
salary increase to our CEO, Dr. Flemming 
Ornskov (from $1,350,000 to $1,688,000) 
effective from July 1, 2015. The increase 
is within the parameters of the approved 
Remuneration Policy set out on page 94. 
Dr. Ornskov’s salary will be frozen at this 
level for three years and he will not be 
eligible for a further salary increase until 
July 1, 2018 (including in the event that the 
Baxalta deal is successfully completed).
I engaged with our largest shareholders in 
January 2016 prior to the publication of 
this report to inform them of the decision 
and to explain the rationale. Under normal 
circumstances, I would have liked to 
discuss the decision with our shareholders 
at the time of the increase. However, this 
was not possible owing to the ongoing 
negotiations with Baxalta on the proposed 
combination. Furthermore, the Committee 
did not feel that it was appropriate to 
delay the increase in light of Dr. Ornskov’s 
criticality to the business in continuing 
to deliver our long-term strategy, the 
positioning of his package compared to 
Shire’s peer groups, and his performance 
and development in role since his 
appointment. Further details on the 
Committee’s rationale for awarding 
Dr. Ornskov this increase are as follows:
 > Motivating and retaining talent: 
The Remuneration Committee was 
acutely aware in the run up to the 
summer of 2015 that the CEO’s 
remuneration was positioned behind his 
peers and that there was an immediate 
requirement to take action to ensure the 
CEO’s retention given his attractiveness 
Part 1 — Annual Statement
Following another year of significant growth 
and continued change for Shire, I would 
like to take this opportunity to provide you 
with an overview of the Committee’s major 
decisions taken during 2015, together 
with the context in which these decisions 
were taken.
We were delighted to receive a high level 
of shareholder support for the Executive 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy (the Policy) 
at the 2015 AGM, with 94% of shareholders 
voting in support of our Policy. We remain 
confident that for 2016, the Policy remains 
appropriate for the business and there 
are therefore no proposed changes for 
this year. 
To help shareholders understand our 
remuneration structure and its link to the 
Company’s strategy and performance, we 
have set out our “remuneration at a glance” 
on pages 78 to 81. This is followed by the 
Annual Report on Remuneration on pages 
82 to 93 which gives details of how the 
approved Policy was implemented in 2015 
and is proposed to be applied in 2016. 
For completeness, the key parts of our 
approved Directors’ Remuneration Policy 
are provided as an appendix to this report.

  This is a Non GAAP financial measure. For 
reconciliation to US GAAP please see page 159.
76 Shire Annual Report 2015 as a potential recruitment target. In this 
context the Remuneration Committee 
determined it was appropriate to make 
the salary increase in July 2015 despite 
the uncertainty surrounding the outcome 
of a possible transaction with Baxalta.
 > Sustainability of the Shire strategy: 
The Board strongly believes that the 
continuity of Dr. Ornskov’s outstanding 
leadership and drive is key to the execution 
of Shire’s long-term strategic plan. 
Since his appointment, Dr. Ornskov’s 
vision has transformed the business 
to position Shire’s future as the global 
leader in rare diseases. Through his 
efforts, Shire has generated superior 
financial performance in the business. 
In 2014 we achieved 23% product sales 
growth, a more than six percentage 
point improvement in Non GAAP EBITDA
1
 
margin, and 39% growth in Non GAAP 
EBITDA itself. This was achieved 
against the backdrop of completing 
11 acquisitions since the start of 
2013, continued improvements in our 
pipeline, market leading innovation 
in the digitization of the Company’s 
commercial model, Shire’s approach 
to R&D, and improved results in protein 
and cell engineering. The continuation of 
this accelerated business transformation 
and associated growth for shareholders 
is critically dependent on Dr. Ornskov’s 
continued leadership in order to deliver 
the growth set out as part of Shire’s 
long-term strategic plan.
 > Exceptional performance for 
our shareholders: 
The increase recognizes the shareholder 
value that has been created since 
Dr. Ornskov’s appointment and his role 
in delivering that value. For context, 
since the appointment of Dr. Ornskov 
up to December 31, 2015, Shire’s total 
shareholder return (TSR) has been 
128% versus a FTSE 50 (excluding 
Financial Services) median of 26% 
which ranks Shire 2nd amongst FTSE 50 
(excluding Financial Services) companies. 
Shire’s TSR growth over the period has 
ranked second and third against the 
US BioPharma and Global Biotech 
peer groups respectively. This has been 
achieved alongside strong growth in 
earnings per share (EPS) since 
Dr. Ornskov’s appointment. 
 > Size and complexity of the business: 
Shire’s exceptional performance has 
resulted in a more than doubling of the 
Company’s market capitalization from 
$17.0bn to $39.8bn during Dr. Ornskov’s 
tenure to December 31, 2015. The 
increase to Dr. Ornskov’s salary is therefore 
also a recognition that the business is of 
significantly greater size and complexity 
than at Dr. Ornskov’s appointment.
 > Competitive positioning of package: 
The salary increase ensures 
Dr. Ornskov’s compensation package 
remains retentive and competitive 
versus peers. This is particularly relevant 
in the face of possible recruitment 
pressure from competitors, for example 
the US BioPharma and Global Biotech 
markets (Shire’s primary competitors). 
An increase in Dr. Ornskov’s 
compensation package better aligns his 
positioning against the two sector peer 
groups used by the Committee in line 
with its Remuneration Policy. Against 
the secondary reference peer group 
of the FTSE 50 (excluding Financial 
Services) the total compensation 
package is aligned with the upper 
quartile of the market, consistent with 
Shire’s performance.
In making this increase the Committee 
was extremely mindful of the fact that this 
increase is high compared to market norms 
and that it followed a number of other 
changes to his remuneration arrangements, 
approved by shareholders at the 2015 
AGM. However, in light of the unique 
combination of reasons I have outlined 
above, the Committee determined 
that this was the right thing to do in the 
best interests of the business and our 
shareholders. We also gained comfort 
from the feedback I had received during 
the 2015 AGM shareholder consultation, 
in which nearly all of the shareholders 
I spoke to highlighted the value they placed 
in Dr. Ornskov as CEO and the criticality 
to the business of retaining him at this time. 
Recognising the scale of the increase, 
the Committee considered making three 
smaller (circa 7% p.a.) increases over the 
next three years. However, we felt that 
making the increase in one single step 
better addressed the issues we were facing 
and enabled us to position Dr. Ornskov’s 
compensation appropriately compared 
to our peers and to demonstrate the value 
the Board and shareholders place in his 
outstanding leadership skills, which have 
contributed significantly to the business, 
and his instrumental role in achieving 
Shire’s long-term plan. 
Finally, the Committee recognizes that the 
salary increase flows through to incentives 
but is satisfied that it contributes to a 
remuneration package which is appropriate 
for a company of Shire’s size and a CEO 
of Dr. Ornskov’s caliber, positioned as it is, 
at the median of the US BioPharma peer 
group, below the lower quartile of the 
Global Biotech peer group and above the 
upper quartile of the FTSE 50 excluding 
Financial Services. 
Appointment of new CFO
Jeff Poulton was appointed as our new 
Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and was 
made a member of the Board of Directors, 
effective April 29, 2015. Following an 
extensive search of both internal and 
external candidates, the Board unanimously 
agreed that Mr. Poulton’s expertise and 
extensive knowledge of Shire’s business 
and markets set him apart as CFO and will 
further strengthen the Board as it oversees 
the Company’s continued growth. The 
Committee carefully considered the 
appropriate remuneration arrangements as 
part of the appointment process and in line 
with Shire’s approved remuneration Policy. 
Details of Mr. Poulton’s remuneration 
arrangements are provided in the 
“At a glance” section. 
Remuneration outcomes
Overall it has been a strong year for the 
business in terms of both financial 
performance and product development. 
This has been reflected in the outcomes 
achieved under the incentive arrangements, 
with the 2015 Executive Annual Incentive 
Plan (EAIP) paying out at 100% and 66% 
of the maximum opportunity for the 
CEO and CFO respectively and the 2013 
Performance Share Plan (PSP) vesting 
at 100% of maximum, on the basis of 
a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) 
of 17.9% in Non GAAP EBITDA
1
 and an 
average of 175 basis points increase per 
annum in Non GAAP Adjusted ROIC
1
 over 
the 2012 to 2015 period.
I hope you find the contents of this report 
informative. Finally, I would like to thank my 
fellow Committee members as well as the 
internal and external teams who supported 
us with their commitment and hard work 
over the past year.

Remuneration arrangements for new CFO
Jeff Poulton was appointed as the Company’s new CFO and a member of the Board on April 29, 2015. Jeff has held a number of roles 
at Shire, most recently serving as Interim CFO since January 2015, while overseeing Investor Relations. As part of the appointment 
process, the Committee carefully considered his remuneration arrangements and took the following decisions in line with Shire’s 
approved remuneration Policy:
 > His salary on appointment was set at $575,000.
 > He receives a fixed contribution of 25% of base salary by way of a retirement benefits provision.
 > His maximum bonus opportunity is 160% of base salary.
 > The face value of his LTIP award is 662% of base salary.
Jeff Poulton’s contract does not have a fixed term but provides for a notice period of 12 months from both parties, in line with the 
approved remuneration Policy. His contract is dated April 29, 2015.

  The vesting value is calculated using the average share price over the last quarter of 2015 of $207.85 per the relevant UK regulations. Note that Dr. Ornskov’s 
disclosed long-term incentive awards are not due to vest until February and May 2016. The award vesting in February 2016 represents his annual equity grant 
under the PSP and has an estimated vesting value of $12,341,138. The award vesting in May 2016 represents his replacement equity award granted upon joining 
the Company which was subject to performance conditions and has an estimated vesting value of $4,473,222. 76% of the total LTIP value of $16,814,360 is 
delivered as a result of share price growth over the vesting period.

 Jeff Poulton was appointed as CFO on April 29, 2015 and therefore the figures above reflect the remuneration he received following his appointment.
CEO base salary increase
Dr. Ornskov’s base salary was increased to $1,688,000 effective July 1, 2015 in light of his exceptional performance since his 
appointment as CEO, the increased size and complexity of the business and the need for Dr. Ornskov’s compensation package to be 
positioned competitively against Shire’s peer groups. Dr. Ornskov’s salary will be frozen at this level for three years and he will not be 
eligible for a further salary increase until July 1, 2018 (including in the event that the Baxalta deal is successfully completed).

EAIP — This has been another exceptional year for Shire and as such, the Committee determined that a bonus payment equal to 180% 
and 106% of 2015 salary would be paid to the CEO and CFO respectively following an assessment of the 2015 corporate scorecard, as 
set out below, and taking into account the impact on the Company’s performance of strategic actions together with performance relative 
to overall objectives.

Long-term incentives — For the CEO’s 2013 PSP awards (which comprise his 2013 annual equity grant and replacement awards 
granted upon joining), the Committee determined that 100% of the awards would vest after taking into account performance against 
the 2013 performance matrix (achievement of a CAGR of 17.9% in Non GAAP EBITDA
1
 and an average of 175 basis points increase 
p.a. in Non GAAP Adjusted ROIC
1
 over the 2012 to 2015 period), as well as an overall assessment of the underlying performance of the 
Company over the performance period ending December 31, 2015. As the 2013 awards are not scheduled to vest until February and 
May 2016 (after the date of this report), an estimated vesting value of $16,814,360 has been included in the single figure table, based 
on the average share price over the last quarter of 2015 of $207.85.
No awards that have been previously granted to the CFO were scheduled to vest subject to the achievement of performance conditions 
for the year ending December 31, 2015.

a) Implementation of Directors’ Remuneration Policy in 2016
In 2016, the Executive Director and Non-Executive Director remuneration policies will be implemented as follows:

 Effective July 1, 2015.

 Effective from the date of his appointment (April 29, 2015).
CEO: In light of Dr. Ornskov’s exceptional performance since his appointment as CEO, the increased size and complexity of the 
business and the need for Dr. Ornskov’s compensation package to be positioned competitively against Shire’s peer groups, the 
Committee awarded a 25% increase in Dr. Ornskov’s salary (from $1,350,000 to $1,688,000) effective from July 1, 2015. Dr. Ornskov’s 
salary will be frozen at this level for three years and he will not be eligible for a further salary increase until July 1, 2018. 
The Committee recognizes that the 25% increase to Dr. Ornskov’s salary is atypical when considered in the context of normal market 
practice and, to reflect this, the Committee has committed to freezing Dr. Ornskov’s salary at this level for the next three years (including 
in the event that the Baxalta deal is successfully completed). 
CFO: Following the year end review, the Committee made the decision to award Jeff Poulton a base salary increase of 3%, to give 
him an annual base salary of $592,000 effective April 1, 2016 (in line with the salary increase effective date for all other employees). 
This decision reflected strong corporate performance and excellent leadership.
Fixed elements — Retirement and other benefits
The implementation of policy in relation to pension and benefits is unchanged and in line with the disclosed policy in the Appendix of 
this report.
Short-term incentives — EAIP
There is no change to the level of EAIP award opportunity for Executive Directors (maximum of 180% of base salary for the CEO and 
160% of base salary for the CFO).
A scorecard approach will continue to be used for the 2016 EAIP and this will be comprised of 75% financial and 25% non financial 
performance measures. This weighting recognizes the critical importance of financial results to our shareholders, bonus affordability 
and the important role that non financial performance plays in the success and growth of the Company. These measures are aligned 
with and support our four key strategic drivers for 2016 of Growth, Innovation, Efficiency and People.
The targets themselves are considered to be commercially sensitive on the grounds that disclosure could damage the Company’s 
commercial interests. However, retrospective disclosure of the targets and performance against them will be provided in next year’s 
Annual Report on Remuneration to the extent that they do not remain commercially sensitive at that time. Financial and non financial 
targets are set at the start of the performance year and are approved by the Committee, which believes the targets are suitably challenging, 
relevant and measurable. As and when the proposed combination with Baxalta closes, revised targets for the remainder of the performance 
period will be presented to the Committee for approval. The revised targets will be challenging in the context of the combined entity. 
The final outcome for the year will be assessed on performance against the targets up to the close of the combination with Baxalta 
and subsequent performance against the revised targets post combination. The 2016 corporate scorecard is set out below:

The face value allocation between SARs and PSUs is estimated as it is determined on an expected value basis upon grant.
1
 As at January 1, 2016.
20% of the award will be payable for threshold performance. There is no vesting below this performance level. 100% of the award will be 
payable for maximum performance, which would result in the total award vesting, with straight line vesting within this performance range. 
In all cases, awards will only vest if the Committee determines that the underlying performance of the Company is sufficient to justify the 
vesting of the award.
The 2016 LTIP awards will continue to be tested against two independent measures at the end of a three year performance period: 50% 
Product Sales targets and 50% Non GAAP EBITDA
2
 targets. The Committee will also use a Non GAAP Adjusted ROIC
2
 underpin at the 
end of the performance period to ensure vesting levels reflect the sustainability of revenue and profit growth.
The 2016 LTIP targets for Product sales and Non GAAP EBITDA
2
 are based off the Company’s 2018 forecast and are considered 
appropriately challenging by the Committee. The weightings, threshold and maximum target figures are provided in the table below.
Performance measures Weighting Threshold (20% of award vesting) Maximum (100% of award vesting)
Product Sales 50% $8,184m $9,480m
Non GAAP EBITDA
2
50% $3,928m $4,696m
Product Sales and Non GAAP EBITDA
2
 targets are expressed as absolute dollar values for consistency between the measures.
The Non GAAP Adjusted ROIC
2
 underpin will be set at a minimum of 10.625% for the 2016 LTIP award. If Non GAAP Adjusted ROIC over 
the performance period is below this level no vesting will occur under the LTIP, subject to Remuneration Committee discretion. This will 
ensure awards only pay out for a return in excess of Shire’s Weighted Average Cost of Capital and maintain focus on quality of earnings 
and sustainable returns both in the existing core business and from any future M&A activity.
The Committee has determined that the calibration of these proposed targets is sufficiently challenging without incentivizing 
inappropriate risk-taking by management, taking into account both Shire’s long range plans as well as brokers’ forecasts. As and when 
the proposed deal with Baxalta closes, revised targets will be presented to the Committee for approval, based on the long range plan of 
the combined entity. The revised targets will be challenging in the context of the combined entity and will ensure maximum payout only 
occurs in the event that significant value from the combination is delivered to shareholders. The revised targets will be disclosed to 
shareholders when they have been determined, as well as subsequently in the 2016 Directors’ Remuneration Report.
A two year holding period will apply following the three year vesting period for both PSUs and SARs, making a total vesting period of five 
years before shares can be sold.
Clawback and malus arrangements are in place for awards to cover situations where results are materially misstated or in the event of 
serious misconduct.
Chairman and Non-Executive Director remuneration policy
2016 fee levels for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors remained unchanged from 2015.
Basic fees 2016/2015
Chairman (inclusive of all committees) £450,000
Deputy Chairman and Senior Independent Non-Executive Director (inclusive of Non-Executive Director fee) £98,000
Non-Executive Director £93,000
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors will continue to receive 25% of their total fees in the form of shares.

EAIP – 2015 outcomes
In determining EAIP awards for the Executive Directors, the Committee considers performance against each of the financial and non 
financial performance measures within the Shire corporate scorecard, as well as personal performance during the year. 
Corporate scorecard
The EAIP outcome is calculated by way of a weighted average of the corporate scorecard outcomes of the financial and non financial 
performance measures. For each performance measure, outperformance or underperformance is measured as a percentage of target 
which is then converted into the corporate scorecard multiple. If the weighted average across all the measures falls below 85% then 
none of the award pays out. If the weighted average across all the measures is 120% or more of target, then the maximum opportunity of 
the award may pay out, subject to personal performance. As such, there are not actual threshold and stretch performance values for the 
independent measures as the assessment takes into account performance across all the measures in determining the scorecard 
outcome. However, for illustrative purposes, indicative threshold and stretch performance values are shown for each of the financial 
measures to serve as a guide to the performance range. Target performance is considered by the Committee to require an excellent 
level of performance. Details of actual corporate scorecard outcomes against the 2015 performance measure targets are set out in the 
table below. 2015 performance results in a weighted average corporate scorecard multiplier of 137%.

EAIP award outcomes
The corporate scorecard multiplier determines the bonus funding for all individuals within the plan. Once agreed, each individual’s bonus 
(including Executive Directors) is then determined based on their individual performance over the course of the year, which results in 
an adjustment to the corporate scorecard outcome based on an agreed matrix. As a result, bonus outcomes of 180% of salary for 
Dr. Ornskov and 106% of 2015 salary for Mr. Poulton were determined by the Committee. Full details of the overall EAIP outcomes for 
the Executive Directors are provided in the table below.

Notes
75% of the award is payable in cash (non-pensionable) and 25% is deferred into shares and released after a period of three years 
(subject to the participant’s employment not being terminated for cause).
The release of deferred shares will include dividend shares representing any accrued dividends (deferred shares are subject to malus 
and clawback).

Flemming Ornskov — vesting of 2013 PSP awards
The table below sets out a summary of the number of shares vesting and the resulting gross estimated vesting value for the 2013 PSP 
awards for Dr. Ornskov. The awards granted in February 2013 represent his annual equity grant under the PSP and the awards granted 
May 2013 represent his replacement equity awards granted upon joining. This estimate is on the basis of an average share price over the 
last quarter of 2015 of $207.85, given that the 2013 PSP awards (2013 — 2015 performance period) vest following the date of this report.

86 Shire Annual Report 2015 Performance outcome
17.9% CAGR in Non GAAP EBITDA; and 175 bp p.a. increase in Non GAAP Adjusted ROIC between 2012 and 2015. 
In determining the vesting multiplier under the matrix, the Committee rounds to the closest point on the matrix. This results in a vesting 
multiplier of 4.0x, meaning that 100% of the total award made will vest.
The Committee reserves the right to make adjustments to the performance conditions to reflect significant one off items which occur 
during the performance period. In respect of the 2013 PSP awards, the Committee carried out a comprehensive review of potential 
Significant Adjusting Events (SAEs) against pre-existing guidelines and determined that the following SAEs should be taken into account 
in the overall assessment of performance over the performance period:
1.  To exclude the impact of the acquisition of ViroPharma which had a short-term negative impact on Non GAAP adjusted ROIC 
performance in 2015. This acquisition was completed in January 2014 and not considered in the 2013 performance matrix;
2.  To exclude the impact of the acquisition of NPS which had a short-term negative impact on Non GAAP adjusted ROIC performance 
in 2015. This acquisition was completed in February 2015 and not considered in the 2013 performance matrix;
3.  To grant credit for DERMAGRAFT product as it was considered in the performance matrix. In line with our refined strategy to 
prioritize investments that have the greatest clinical and commercial value, the Company announced on January 17, 2014 that it had 
sold its DERMAGRAFT assets. Without DERMAGRAFT and its assets, Regenerative Medicine was no longer one of the Company’s 
Business Units; and
4.  To grant credit for INTUNIV early generic entry. The 2013 performance matrix considered INTUNIV generic entry in the third quarter 
of 2015 and actual generic entry started in December 2014.
Jeff Poulton — there is no scheduled vesting of long-term incentive awards subject to the achievement of performance conditions for 
the year ending December 31, 2015.

The following tables set out details of the SAR and PSU awards granted to the Executive Directors under the LTIP during 2015.
Vesting of the 2015 LTIP awards will be determined by the Committee in Q1 2018 taking into account performance against the 2015 
performance measures over the performance period (January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2017). In addition, any Significant Adjusting 
Events that are relevant will be taken into consideration, as well as an overall assessment of the underlying performance of the Company.

used to test underlying performance. The weightings, threshold and maximum target figures are provided in the table below.

Non GAAP EBITDA

50% $3,300m $3,675m
1
  This is a Non GAAP financial measure. For reconciliation to US GAAP please see page 159.
The Non GAAP Adjusted ROIC underpin is set at a minimum of 11% for the 2015 LTIP award. If Non GAAP Adjusted ROIC over the 
performance period is below this level no vesting will occur under the LTIP, subject to Remuneration Committee discretion. This will 
ensure awards only pay out for a return in excess of Shire’s Weighted Average Cost of Capital and maintain focus on quality of earnings 
and sustainable returns both in the existing core business and from any future M&A activity.
20% of the award will be payable for threshold performance. There is no vesting below this performance level. 100% of the award will be 
payable for maximum performance, which would result in the total award vesting, with straight line vesting within this performance range. 
In all cases, awards will only vest if the Committee determines that the underlying performance of the Company is sufficient to justify the 
vesting of the award.
2015 EAIP deferred shares
Awards of deferred shares under the EAIP were made as follows to the CEO and will vest three years from the point of deferral subject to 
continued service and the terms of the plan rules.

e) Payments to past Directors (subject to audit) and payments for loss of office 
(subject to audit)
During 2015, a payment of $16,538 was made to the former Shire CEO (Angus Russell) as reimbursement for a tax filing penalty incurred. 
The Company reimbursed the former CEO for the penalty, given that the late filing of his tax return was due to an error by the Company. 
The Company also paid costs of $12,018 in relation to the preparation and submission of his 2013 US tax return and 2013/14 UK tax 
return, in accordance with the tax equalization benefits provided for under his Service Agreement.
In line with Matthew Emmens’ contract as Chief Executive Officer of Shire, Mr. Emmens is entitled to continued medical cover up to the 
age of 65. During 2015, the value of this benefit was $20,102. 2016 will be the final year of this benefit as Mr. Emmens will reach the age 
of 65 during the year. 
No further payments were made to past Directors. 
No payments were made to Directors for loss of office during the year.
88 Shire Annual Report 2015 f) Directors’ shareholdings and scheme interests (subject to audit)
The Committee believes that employee share ownership is an important means to support long-term commitment to the Company and 
the alignment of employee interests with those of shareholders.
The interests of the Executive Directors and other senior executives are closely aligned with those of other shareholders in this regard 
through the operation of the Company’s long-term incentive plan and, for Executive Committee, the deferral of one quarter of any EAIP 
award into shares for a period of three years. These remuneration elements constitute a significant proportion of their individual 
remuneration packages.
In addition, to ensure that there are appropriate tools to retain Executive Directors and to encourage alignment with shareholders over 
the long-term through increased shareholding and ownership, a two year holding period post the three year performance period which 
applies to both PSUs and SARs, is in place.
The CEO, CFO and other members of the Executive Committee are encouraged to own shares in the Company equivalent to 200%, 
150% and 100% of base salary, respectively, within a five year period following their appointment. All shares beneficially owned by an 
executive or deferred under the EAIP count towards achieving these guidelines. The Committee reviews share ownership levels annually 
for this group. Current shareholding levels for Directors are set out in the table below and show that the shareholding guideline for the 
CEO has been achieved. The CFO is new in role and so has not yet met the requirement but has five years in which to do so.

The Company also operates broad-based share plans (a Sharesave scheme in the UK and Ireland and a Global Employee Stock 
Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) in the US and other countries) to encourage wider share ownership among the Company’s employees.
Awards under the Company’s long-term incentive plans and broad-based share plans are satisfied either by market purchased shares 
which are held in an employee benefit trust or the issue of new shares within limits agreed by shareholders when the plans were 
approved. These limits comply with the Investment Association’s guidelines which require that no more than 10% of a company’s issued 
share capital be issued accordance with all employee share plans in any 10 year period, with no more than 5% issued in accordance 
with discretionary employee share plans.

Performance conditions attached to SAR and PSU awards granted in 2013 and 2014 are Non GAAP Adjusted ROIC and Non GAAP EBITDA. Performance 
conditions attached to SAR and PSU awards granted from 2015 onwards are Product Sales and Non GAAP EBITDA. In all cases, awards will only vest if the 
Committee determines that the underlying performance of the Company is sufficient to justify the vesting of the award.

  As disclosed in the 2012 remuneration report, Dr. Ornskov was granted an award of restricted stock as part of his recruitment that subsequently vested on 
February 28, 2015. The vesting of this award resulted in a release of 15,286 ADSs to Dr. Ornskov. The award was subject to Dr. Ornskov’s continued service during 
the vesting period.

A two year holding period will apply following the three year vesting period for both SAR and PSU awards granted from 2015 onwards.
On January 1, 2015 Dr. Ornskov and Mr. Poulton were granted an option over ADSs pursuant to the Shire 2014 ESPP, saving $568.18 per fortnight. On November 2, 
2015 Dr. Ornskov and Mr. Poulton exercised their option over 69 ADSs at an exercise price of $180.66 per ADS. On November 1, 2015 Dr. Ornskov was granted on

The graph below shows the Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) for Shire and the FTSE 100 Index over the seven year period ending 
December 31, 2015. TSR is calculated as the change (indexed) between the fourth quarter TSR in the relevant year and the base year. 
The FTSE 100 Index reflects the 100 largest quoted companies by market capitalisation in the United Kingdom and has been chosen 
because the FTSE 100 represents the broad market Index within which the Company’s shares are traded.

T otal remuneration ($’000) $4,781 $9,634 $17,506 $13,430 $5,759 $3,402 $4,137 $21,581
These calculations are based on the methodology prescribed in the Schedule 8 Regulations. In particular, the long-term incentive figures 
relate to any awards that vest shortly after the end of the relevant financial year. Note Dr. Ornskov did not have any long-term incentive 
awards vest until 2015.
h) Percentage change in CEO remuneration 
The following table shows the percentage change in the base salary, taxable benefits and annual bonus of the CEO between the current 
and previous financial year compared to the average percentage change for all other employees.

  Due to timing of the 2015 year-end process, the actual short-term incentive figures for all other employees had not been finalized by the date of this report. 
Therefore, the 2015 short-term incentive figures represent target figures multiplied by the 2015 Corporate Bonus Modifier score approved by the Committee in 
early February, which represents the Company’s best estimate of actual bonus outcomes.

Reflects the 2014 and 2015 remuneration for Flemming Ornskov as reported in the single total figure of remuneration table in Part 2(b).
3
  Reflects the average change in remuneration for all other employees globally that were annual bonus eligible. To help minimise distortions in the underlying data, 
certain adjustments have been made. In particular, the figures have been prepared on the basis of permanent employees who have been employed with the 
Company for the two preceding calendar years to provide for a consistent employee comparator group. This approach is consistent with the disclosure presented 
in the 2014 Annual Report on Remuneration.
CEO
As previously explained in Part 1 of this report, the increase in the CEO’s salary is due to the 25% increase in his salary from $1,350,000 
to $1,688,000, effective July 1, 2015. This increase was awarded in light of Dr. Ornskov’s exceptional performance since his appointment 
as CEO, the increased size and complexity of the business and the need for Dr. Ornskov’s compensation package to be positioned 
competitively against Shire’s peer groups. The decrease of 49% in the CEO’s taxable benefits is because the CEO was provided with 
temporary living support and associated tax assistance in 2014 under the Company’s mobility policy, which he is no longer eligible for. 
The increase in the CEO’s short-term incentive is due to his short-term incentive being calculated as a percentage of his higher base salary.

continued
All other employees
The increase in salary and fees from 2014 to 2015 is primarily due to annual merit increases, as well as multiple inflationary increases 
in Latin American countries. The significant increase in taxable benefits is due to a much greater number of employees being eligible to 
receive bonuses under the Company’s retention program in 2015 than in 2014, in order to retain key personnel during the uncertainty 
of the AbbVie deal. The difference in the short-term incentives figure is due to actual short-term incentive payments in 2014 being 
compared to target figures (multiplied by the 2015 Corporate Bonus Modifier score) in 2015.
i) Relative importance of spend on pay 
The Company considers employee remuneration costs in the context of the general financial performance and position of the Company, 
including when determining the annual salary increase budget, the annual equity grant budget and annual bonus funding for the organization. 
The following graphs set out for 2014 and 2015 the overall spend on pay, shareholder distributions (dividends and share buybacks) and 
for further context, Non GAAP EBITDA

Advisors
In discharging its responsibilities in 2015, the Committee was materially assisted by those employees performing the roles of Chief 
Human Resources Officer and Group Vice President, Total Rewards and HR Operations. In addition, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP 
(“PwC”), appointed by the Committee, continued to serve as independent external advisor to the Committee following a competitive 
tendering process in early 2012. PwC also provided global consultancy services to the Company in 2015, primarily in respect of tax 
matters. Fees paid to PwC in relation to remuneration services provided to the Committee totalled £284,000 in 2015 and were 
determined based on the scope and nature of the projects undertaken for the Committee.
The Committee is satisfied that the advice received by PwC in relation to executive remuneration matters during the year was 
independent. The Committee reviewed the potential for conflicts of interest and judged that there were appropriate safeguards against 
any potential conflicts. PwC is a member of the Remuneration Consultants’ Group which operates a code of conduct in relation to 
executive remuneration consulting in the UK.

Appendix — Directors’ Remuneration Policy — key elements
a) Executive Director remuneration policy 
The purpose of the remuneration policy is to recruit and retain high caliber executives and encourage them to enhance the Company’s 
performance responsibly and in line with the Company’s strategy and shareholder interests. The remuneration policy was approved by 
shareholders at the April 2015 AGM (April 28, 2015) and will be effective for a period of three years. Whilst there is currently no intention 
to revise the policy more frequently than every three years, the Committee will review the policy on an annual basis to ensure it remains 
strategically aligned and appropriately positioned against the market. Where any change to policy is considered, the Committee will 
consult with major shareholders prior to submitting a revised policy for shareholder approval.
This section sets out the key parts of the remuneration policy. The complete remuneration policy as approved by shareholders can be 
found within the 2014 Directors’ Remuneration Report.
The overall remuneration package for the Executive Directors is designed to provide an appropriate balance between fixed and variable, 
performance-related components, with a significant element of long-term variable pay given the long-term nature of the business. 
In determining the positioning of overall remuneration, the Committee takes into consideration pay levels against a Global Biotech peer 
group and a US BioPharma peer group. These peer groups reflect the need for Shire to be aligned with the Biotech and BioPharma 
sectors in which the Company operates, the markets in which the Company competes for talent, and the geographies in which the 
Company operates. In addition, the FTSE 50 (excluding financial services) is used as a secondary reference point, given Shire’s position 
as a UK listed company. 
The Committee is satisfied that the composition and structure of the remuneration package is appropriate and does not incentivize 
undue risk taking.
Purpose & link to strategy Operation & Performance Assessment Opportunity
Fixed elements — base salary
T o recognize the market 
value of the role, an 
individual’ s skills, experience 
and performance and 
an individual’ s leadership 
and contribution to 
Company strategy.
Base salary is paid in cash and is pensionable. 
Individual and corporate performance are factors considered during the annual 
base salary review process. Any increases typically take effect on January 1 
each year.
Any significant salary increases, such as in cases where Executive Directors 
are relatively new in role, changes in responsibilities or significant variance to the 
market, will be appropriately explained.
Base salary is positioned with reference to Global 
Biotech and US BioPharma peer groups. A FTSE 
50 (excluding financial services) group is used as 
a secondary reference point. The exact positioning 
depends on a variety of factors such as individual 
experience and performance, total remuneration 
increases across the Company and shareholder views.
Where appropriate, base salary increases are 
made in line with the average of employees’ salary 
increases, unless the Committee determines 
otherwise based on the factors listed above.
The annual base salaries for the Executive Directors 
are set out in Part 2(a) of this report.
Fixed elements — retirement and other benefits
T o ensure that benefits 
are competitive in the 
markets in which the 
Company operates.
Executive pension benefits are provided in line with market practice in the 
country in which an Executive is based. 
The Company provides a range of other benefits which may include a car 
allowance, long-term disability and life cover, private medical insurance and 
financial and tax advisory support. These benefits are not pensionable. Other 
benefits may be offered if considered appropriate by the Committee. 
The Company may also meet certain mobility costs, such as relocation support, 
expatriate allowances, temporary living and transportation expenses, in line with 
the prevailing mobility policy and practice for senior executives.
Executive Directors are eligible to participate in the all employee share plans operated 
by the Company, such as the Global Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”).
Executive Directors can receive a fixed contribution 
of up to 30% of annual salary by way of a 
retirement benefit provision.
The cost to the Company of providing other benefits 
may vary depending on such things as, market 
practice and the cost of insuring certain benefits.
94 Shire Annual Report 2015 Purpose & link to strategy Operation & Performance Assessment Opportunity
Short-term incentives — Executive Annual Incentive Plan (“EAIP”)
T o reward individuals 
with an award based on 
achievement of pre-defined, 
Committee approved 
corporate objectives 
(the corporate scorecard) 
and the individual’ s 
contributions toward 
achieving those objectives.
Key performance measures 
are set by the Committee 
in the context of annual 
performance and ensuring 
progress towards the 
Company’ s strategy — 
to grow value for all our 
stakeholders — focusing 
and excelling in everything 
we do to meet the current 
and future needs of patients.
In determining EAIP awards for the Executive Directors, the Committee 
considers performance against each of the key performance measures 
within the corporate scorecard, taking into account the impact of strategic 
actions on the Company’ s performance, the Company’ s response to external 
opportunities and events that could not have been predicted at the beginning 
of the year and performance against personal objectives. In addition, the 
Committee may amend the performance measures or targets in exceptional 
circumstances where it considers that they are no longer appropriate.
The cash element (75% of any award) is paid in the first quarter of the year 
following the performance year, and the deferred shares element (25% of 
any award) is deferred and normally released after a period of three years. 
The release of deferred shares includes dividend shares representing 
accumulated dividends.
Malus and clawback arrangements are in place. These are compliant with 
the UK Corporate Governance Code 2012 (the “Code”) and in line with best 
practice in this area.
Up to 90% of base salary is payable for target 
performance for Executive Directors and up to 
180% is payable for maximum performance, 
although actual payouts can range from 0% 
(threshold performance) upwards.
Each year the Committee determines the measures 
and weightings for the corporate scorecard within 
the following parameters: 
 > At least 75% of the corporate scorecard will 
be based on financial performance; and
 > Non financial corporate scorecard measures 
will be based on other strategic priorities for 
the relevant financial year. For 2015, this was 
aligned with our four key strategic drivers:
 —Growth;
 —Innovation;
 —Efficiency; and
 —People.
The precise allocation between financial and non 
financial measures (as well as the weightings within 
these measures), will depend on the strategic focus 
of the Company in any given year.
Long-term incentives — Long-T erm Incentive Plan (“LTIP”)
T o incentivize individuals to 
achieve sustained growth 
through superior long-term 
performance and to create 
alignment with shareholders.
The LTIP measures, 
Product Sales and Non 
GAAP EBITDA, were 
selected by the Committee 
as it believes that they 
represent meaningful and 
relevant measurements of 
performance and are an 
important measure of the 
Company’ s ability to meet 
the strategic objective 
to grow value for all 
our stakeholders.
The Committee reviews 
annually whether the 
performance measures and 
calibration of targets remain 
appropriate and sufficiently 
challenging taking into 
account the Company’ s 
strategic objectives and 
shareholder interests.
LTIP grants for the Executive Directors comprise two types of award:
 > SAR awards. A Stock Appreciation Right (“SAR”) is the right to 
receive Ordinary Shares or ADSs linked to the increase in value of 
Ordinary Shares or ADSs from grant to exercise.
 > PSU awards. A Performance Share Unit (“PSU”)
1
 is the right to 
receive a specified number of Ordinary Shares or ADSs.
SAR and PSU awards granted to Executive Directors vest three years from 
the date of grant, subject to the satisfaction of performance measures and are 
governed by the LTIP rules. SAR awards can be exercised up to the seventh 
anniversary of the date of grant. 
Vesting of awards requires the achievement of two independent measures: 
 > Product Sales
2
 targets (50% weighting); and 
 > Non GAAP EBITDA
3
 targets (50% weighting). 
The Committee will also use a Non GAAP Adjusted ROIC
4
 underpin at the end 
of the three year performance period to assess the underlying performance of 
the Company before determining final vesting levels. 
The award may include dividend shares representing accumulated dividends 
on the portion of the award that vests.
The Committee reserves the right to make adjustments to the measures to 
reflect significant one off items that occur during the vesting period (Significant 
Adjusting Events (“SAEs”)). Potential SAEs are reviewed by the Committee 
against pre-existing guidelines
5
. The Committee will make full and clear 
disclosure of any such adjustments in the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
(“DRR”) at the end of the performance period. 
A two year holding period will apply following the three year vesting period 
for both PSUs and SARs. Shares may be sold in order to satisfy tax or other 
relevant liabilities as a result of the award vesting.
Malus and clawback arrangements are in place. These are compliant with the 
Code and in line with best practice in this area.
Executive Directors are encouraged to own shares in the Company equivalent 
to 200% (for the CEO) and 150% (for the CFO) of base salary within a five 
year period following their appointment. All shares beneficially owned by an 
executive or deferred under the EAIP count towards achieving these guidelines.
Maximum annual awards for Executive Directors 
in face value terms are 840% of salary for grants 
under the LTIP , consisting of:
 > 480% of base salary for SAR awards; and 
 > 360% of base salary for PSU awards.
Award levels are set to reflect an individual’ s role, 
responsibilities and experience. 
Threshold vesting is equal to 20% of any award 
made, with maximum vesting being equal to 100% 
of any award made.

 Product Sales is defined as product sales from continuing operations.

  Non GAAP EBITDA growth is defined as the CAGR of Non GAAP EBITDA, as derived from the Group’s Non GAAP financial results included in its full year earnings 
releases, over the three year vesting period. 
4
  Non GAAP Adjusted ROIC reflects the definition used by the Company in its corporate scorecard. This definition aims to measure true underlying economic 
performance of the Company, by making a number of adjustments to ROIC as derived from the Company’s Non GAAP financial results including:
 > Adding back to Non GAAP operating income all R&D expenses and operating lease costs incurred in the period;
 > Capitalizing on the Group’s balance sheet historical, cumulative R&D, in process R&D and intangible asset impairment charges and operating lease costs which 
previously have been expensed;
 > Deducting from Non GAAP operating income and an amortization charge for the above capitalized costs based on the estimated commercial lives of the 
relevant products;
 > Excluding the income statement and balance sheet impact of non-operating assets (such as surplus cash and non-strategic investments); and
 > Taxing the resulting adjusted operating income at the underlying Non GAAP effective tax rate.
5
 The Significant Adjusting Events pre-existing guidelines consist of the following:
 > The event results from a strategic action that has a short-term impact on Non GAAP Adjusted ROIC or Non GAAP EBITDA growth, but is in the long-term 
interest of shareholders or the event was external and results in a significant change to the Company’s operating environment;
 > The event is a one off (as opposed to recurring) in nature;
 > The event is “significant” which is defined by reference to its impact on Non GAAP EBITDA relative to a materiality threshold; and
 > The event was not taken into account when the performance matrix was set.
Legacy matters in relation to Executive Director remuneration
The Committee will honour remuneration and related commitments to current and former Directors (including the exercise of any 
discretions available to the Committee in relation to such commitments) where the terms were agreed prior to the approval and 
implementation of the remuneration policy detailed in this report.
96 Shire Annual Report 2015 Notes to the remuneration policy table
Elements of previous policy that continue to apply
The following existing arrangements will continue to operate on the terms and conditions set out in the relevant Portfolio Share Plan 
(“PSP”) rules.
Purpose & link to strategy Operation & Performance Assessment Opportunity
Long-term incentives — Portfolio Share Plan (“PSP”)
Previous awards granted 
to incentivize individuals 
to achieve sustained 
growth through superior 
long-term performance 
and create alignment with 
shareholders’ interests.
Outstanding and unvested awards for the CEO comprise SAR and PSU awards. 
Vesting of PSP awards will be subject to the achievement of Non GAAP 
EBITDA and Non GAAP Adjusted ROIC targets within a performance matrix. 
The Committee reserves the right to make adjustments to the measures to 
reflect significant one off items which occurred during the vesting period (SAEs). 
Potential SAEs are reviewed by the Committee against pre-existing guidelines. 
The Committee will make full and clear disclosure of any such adjustments in 
the relevant DRR at the end of the performance period.
In addition, awards will only vest if the Committee determines that the 
underlying financial performance of the Company is sufficient to justify the 
vesting of the awards. 
Malus and clawback arrangements are in place for past awards to cover situations 
where results are materially misstated or in the event of serious misconduct.
Where an individual’ s employment terminates, the PSP rules provide for 
unvested long-term incentive awards to lapse except as set out below.
Under PSP rules, where an individual is determined to be a “good” leaver, 
unvested long-term incentive awards vest upon termination subject to 
performance against applicable performance conditions and, unless the 
Committee determines otherwise, pro rating for time. Any Committee 
determination will take into account a number of considerations, in particular 
performance and other circumstances relating to their termination of employment.
 > Good leaver reasons include retirement in accordance with the 
Company’s retirement policy, ill health, injury or disability, and 
redundancy or in other circumstances that the Committee determines.
 > Pro rating for time will be calculated on the basis of the number of 
complete weeks in the relevant period during which the executive was 
employed (or would have been employed had the executive remained 
in employment throughout the notice period) as a proportion of the 
number of complete weeks in the relevant period.
The PSP rules provide that unvested awards will normally only vest on a 
change in control to the extent that any performance condition has been 
satisfied, unless the Committee determines otherwise, and would be reduced 
where less than two years have elapsed from the relevant grant date.
Outstanding awards granted to the CEO that were 
granted in 2013 and 2014, are set out in Part 2(f) 
of this report. 
Threshold vesting under the performance matrix is 
equal to 25% of any award made, with maximum 
vesting being equal to 100%.

b) Chairman and Non-Executive Director remuneration policy
Purpose & link to strategy Operation & Performance Assessment Opportunity
Overall remuneration
T o attract and retain high 
caliber individuals by offering 
market competitive fee levels.
The Chairman is paid a single fee for all of his/her responsibilities. The Non-
Executive Directors are paid a basic fee. The members and Chairmen of 
the main Board committees and the Senior Independent Director are paid 
a committee fee to reflect their extra responsibilities. 
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors receive 25% of their total fees 
in the form of shares. 
Additional fees may be paid to Non-Executive Directors (excluding the 
Chairman) on a per meeting basis for any non-scheduled Board or Committee 
meetings required in exceptional or unforeseen circumstances, up to the 
relevant fee cap as set out in the Company’ s Articles.
The Company reimburses reasonably incurred expenses and the Non-
Executive Directors are also paid an additional fee in respect of each 
transatlantic trip made for Board meetings.
The fees paid to the Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors are not 
performance related. The Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any 
of the Group share plans, pension plans or other employee benefit schemes.
Fees are determined by the Executive Directors and 
the Chairman, with the exception of the Chairman’ s 
fee which is determined by the Committee. 
T o reflect the governance environment in which 
Shire operates fees are benchmarked against a UK 
FTSE 50 (excluding financial services) group. As a 
secondary reference point fee levels in the Global 
Biotech peer group and US BioPharma peer group 
(the groups used for the Executive Directors) are 
taken into account.
In addition, the fee levels take into account the 
anticipated time commitment for the role and 
experience of the incumbent.
The Chairman’ s and Non-Executive Directors’ fees 
are reviewed on an annual basis. 
Where appropriate, increases are made with 
reference to the factors listed above and average 
employee salary increases since the last increase 
was applied.
c) Recruitment remuneration policy
The following table sets out the various components which would be considered for inclusion in the remuneration package for the 
appointment of an Executive Director and the approach to be adopted by the Committee in respect of each component.
Area Policy and operation 
Overall
 > The Committee’s approach when considering the overall remuneration arrangements in the recruitment of a member of 
the Board from an external party is to take account of the Executive Director’s remuneration package in their prior role, 
the market positioning of the remuneration package, and to not pay more than necessary to facilitate the recruitment of 
the individual in question.
Fixed elements 
(Base salary, retirement and 
other benefits)
 > The salary level will be set with reference to the Company’s Global Biotech and US BioPharma peer groups, with a FTSE 
50 (excluding financial services) group used as a secondary reference to ensure the positioning is appropriate.
 > The Executive Director shall be eligible to participate in Shire’s employee benefit plans, including coverage under all 
executive and employee pension and benefit programs in accordance with the terms and conditions of such plans, as 
may be amended by the Company in its sole discretion from time to time.
 > The Company may meet certain mobility costs, including but not limited to relocation support, expatriate allowances, 
temporary living and transportation expenses in line with the prevailing mobility policy and practice for senior executives.
Short-term incentives > The appointed Executive Director will be eligible to earn a discretionary annual incentive award in accordance with the 
rules and terms of Shire’s Executive Annual Incentive Plan.
 > The level of opportunity will be consistent with that stated in section (a) of this policy.
Long-term incentives > The Executive Director will be eligible for performance based equity awards in accordance with the rules and terms of 
Shire’s Long-Term Incentive Plan. 
 > The quantum will be consistent with that stated in section (a) of this policy.
Replacement awards > The Committee will consider what replacement awards (if any) are reasonably necessary to facilitate the recruitment of a 
new Executive Director in all circumstances. This includes an assessment of the awards and any other compensation or 
benefits item that would be forfeited on leaving their current employer.
 > The Committee will seek to structure any replacement awards such that overall they are not significantly more generous in 
terms of quantum or vesting period than the awards due to be forfeited.
 > In determining quantum and structure of these commitments, the Committee will seek to provide broadly equivalent value 
and replicate, as far as practicable, the timing and performance requirements of remuneration foregone. 
 > The Committee will seek to ensure that a meaningful proportion of the replacement awards which are not attributable 
to long-term incentives foregone will be delivered in Shire deferred shares, released at a later date and subject to 
continued employment.
 > If the Executive Director’s prior employer pays any portion of the remuneration that was deemed foregone, the replacement 
payments shall be reduced by an equivalent amount.
 > Replacement share awards, if used, will be granted using the Company’s existing long-term incentive plan to the extent 
possible, although awards may also be granted outside of this plan if necessary and as permitted under the Listing Rules.
 > In the case of an internal hire, any outstanding awards made in relation to the previous role will be allowed to pay out 
according to their original terms. If promotion is part way through the year, an additional top up award may be made to 
bring the Executive Director’s opportunity to a level that is appropriate in the circumstances.
98 Shire Annual Report 2015 d) Service contracts and termination arrangements
Executive Directors
The Committee’s policy on service contracts and termination arrangements for Executive Directors is set out below. As an overriding 
principle, it is the Committee’s policy that there should be no element of reward for failure. The Committee’s approach when considering 
payments in the event of termination is to take account of the individual circumstances including the reason for termination, performance, 
contractual obligations of both parties as well as share plan and pension scheme rules.
Notice period > The Committee’s policy is that Executive Directors’ service contracts should provide for a notice period of 12 months 
from the Company and the Executive Director.
 > The Committee believes this policy provides an appropriate balance between the need to retain the services of key individuals 
for the benefit of the business and the need to limit the potential liabilities of the Company in the event of termination.
 > Flemming Ornskov’s contract does not have a fixed term but provides for a notice period of 12 months in line with this 
policy. His contract is dated October 24, 2012.
Contractual payments > Executive Directors’ contracts allow for termination with contractual notice from the Company or termination by way of 
payment in lieu of notice, at the Company’s discretion. Neither notice nor a payment in lieu of notice will be given in the 
event of gross misconduct.
 > Payments in lieu of notice could potentially include up to 12 months’ base salary and the cash equivalent of 12 months’ 
pension contributions, car allowance and other contractual benefits. There is no contractual entitlement to annual 
incentive payments in respect of the notice period — any award is at the Committee’s absolute discretion, performance 
related and capped at the contractual target level.
 > Payment in lieu of notice would be made where circumstances dictate that the Executive Directors’ services are not 
required for the full 12 months of their notice period. Contracts also allow for phased payments on termination, which 
allow for further reduction in payments if the individual finds alternative employment outside of the Company during the 
notice period.
Retirement benefits > Normal treatment to apply as governed by the rules of the relevant pension plan; no enhancement for leavers will be made.
Short-term incentives > Where an Executive Director’s employment is terminated after the end of a performance year but before the payment is 
made, the executive will remain eligible for an annual incentive award for that performance year subject to an assessment 
based on performance achieved over the period. Where an award is made the payment may be delivered fully in cash. 
No award will be made in the event of gross misconduct. 
 > Where an Executive Director’s employment is terminated during a performance year, a prorata annual incentive award for 
the period worked in that performance year may be payable subject to an assessment based on performance achieved 
over the period.
 > The Committee’s policy is not to award an annual incentive for any portion of the notice period not served.
 > The relevant plan rules provide that any outstanding deferred shares will vest in accordance with the regular vesting period, 
except for where an Executive Director’s employment is terminated for cause in which case they will lapse. 
 > In the event of a variation in the equity share capital of the Company, demerger, a special dividend or distribution, or any 
corporate event which might affect the value of an award, the Committee may make adjustments to the number or class 
of stock or securities subject to the award.
Long-term incentives > The treatment of unvested long-term incentive awards is governed by the rules of the relevant incentive plan, as approved 
by shareholders.
 > Where an individual’s employment terminates, the LTIP rules provide for unvested long-term incentive awards to lapse 
except as set out below.
 > Under the LTIP rules, where an individual is determined to be a “good” leaver, unvested long-term incentive awards will 
vest at the normal vesting date subject to performance against applicable performance conditions and, unless the 
Committee determines otherwise, prorating for time. Any Committee determination will take into account a number of 
considerations, in particular performance and other circumstances relating to their termination of employment.
 > Good leaver reasons include retirement in accordance with the Company’s retirement policy, ill health, injury or disability, 
and redundancy or in other circumstances that the Committee determines.
 > Prorating for time will be calculated on the basis of the number of complete weeks in the relevant period during which 
the executive was employed as a proportion of the number of complete weeks in the relevant period. Where an executive 
does not work during their notice period, the Committee may apply prorating by reference to the date the notice period 
would have expired.
 > Where an Executive Director’s employment is terminated or an Executive Director is under notice of termination for any 
reason at the date of award of any long-term incentive awards, no long-term incentive awards will be made.
 > In the event of a variation in the equity share capital of the Company, demerger, a special dividend or distribution, or any 
corporate event which might affect the value of an award, the Committee may make adjustments to the number or class 
of stocks or securities subject to the award and, in the case of an option, the option price.
Change in control > In relation to unvested deferred annual bonus awards, the Deferred Bonus Plan rules provide that unvested awards will 
normally vest on a change in control.
 > In relation to unvested long-term incentive awards, the LTIP rules provide that unvested awards will normally only vest on 
a change in control to the extent that any performance condition has been satisfied and would be reduced where more 
than a year remains until the relevant vesting date, unless the Committee determines otherwise.
 > The Committee’s policy is that contracts of employment should not provide additional compensation on severance as 
a result of change in control.
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information
 Shire Annual Report 2015 99 Directors’ remuneration report 
continued
External appointments
Executive Directors are permitted to hold one fee-paying external non-executive directorship, subject to prior approval by the Board. 
Any fees received from such appointments are retained by the Executive Director. During 2015, there were no external non-executive 
directorships held by the Executive Directors.
Chairman and Non-Executive Directors
Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment and are appointed by the Board ordinarily for a term of two years. Their initial 
appointment and any subsequent re-appointment are subject to election, and thereafter annual re-election by shareholders. Non-Executive 
Directors are not entitled to compensation for loss of office. All Non-Executive Directors are subject to a three month notice period. 
All service contracts and letters of appointments are available for viewing at the Company’s registered office.
e) Shareholder engagement
The Committee takes the views of shareholders very seriously and is committed to ongoing dialogue with the Company’s shareholder 
base, which has a significant transatlantic element. This can take a variety of forms including meetings with major shareholders to 
consider significant potential changes to policy or specific issues of interest to particular shareholder groups, other dialogue to update 
shareholders and receive their feedback on planned refinements to arrangements, and annual voting on the DRR.
f) Remuneration of other employees
The Committee recognizes that remuneration has an important role to play in supporting the implementation and achievement of the 
Company’s strategy and ongoing performance. When making remuneration decisions in respect of the Executive Directors, the 
Committee is sensitive to pay and employment conditions across the Company, in particular in relation to base salary decisions where 
the Committee considers the broader employee salary increase budget. The Committee approves the overall annual bonus funding for 
the Company each year and has oversight over the grant of all LTIP awards across the Company. In addition, annual performance for 
the Executive Directors is measured against the backdrop of the same corporate scorecard that is appropriately used to assess performance 
across the organization. This assessment of corporate scorecard performance includes a review of Non GAAP EBITA
1
, Non GAAP 
Adjusted ROIC
1
 and product sales, adjusted to exclude the impact of the annual bonus corporate modifier on the full year results.
Given Shire’s diverse employee base, employing over 5,500 people in 50 locations, the Committee does not consider it appropriate to 
consult with employees over the remuneration policy for Executive Directors. However, many of the Company’s employees are 
shareholders through the Company’s all employee share plans, and are therefore able to express their views on director remuneration 
at each general meeting. The Company also periodically carries out an employee engagement survey which provides employees the 
opportunity to feedback their views on a variety of employment related matters, including remuneration. 
The diagram set out on the following page illustrates how our remuneration policy and arrangements reinforce the achievement of Shire’s 
success and ensures that executives and employees are focused on delivering the same core objectives.

  This is a Non GAAP financial measure. For reconciliation to US GAAP please see page 159.
100 Shire Annual Report 2015 The Shire Remuneration Policy
Strategically and 
culturally aligned
Remuneration should 
reflect and align with 
our business strategy & 
organizational culture
Equity ownership can 
drive the right, long-term 
behaviours & alignment, in 
particular for leaders
Performance oriented
The way remuneration 
is structured and 
communicated can 
promote a performance 
culture
Employees should be 
rewarded based on their 
contribution to value 
creation
Competitive
Remuneration must be 
market competitive in 
order to attract and retain 
talent as well as to avoid 
overpaying
Relevant to employees
Each element of the 
package should be valued 
by employees and, as far 
as practicable, meet their 
differing needs and 
preferences
The ability to impact 
company value should 
influence the remuneration 
mix for employees
Clear and 
understandable
Remuneration should be 
clear & understandable so 
that it can have real impact
Employees should 
understand the rationale 
for each element of 
remuneration and, where 
relevant, the link between 
performance and their 
reward
These act as a framework for remuneration decisions across the Company.
Overall remuneration
The structure and quantum of individual remuneration packages varies by geography, role and level of responsibility. In general, the 
proportion of variable remuneration in the total remuneration package increases with level of responsibility within the Company.
Fixed elements (base salary and 
benefits)
Employees’ base salaries are 
benchmarked against the relevant 
market taking into account the 
companies with whom we compete 
for talent, geography and, where 
relevant, company size.
For example, market data for the most 
senior leadership roles, in particular 
the Executive Committee reflects both 
the geographies in which we operate 
(with over two thirds of employees 
as well as the majority of senior 
management based in the US) and 
companies of a comparable size 
in the pharmaceutical and 
biotechnology sectors. 
Base salary increases across the 
Company are determined in light of 
similar factors as described for the 
Executive Directors.
Retirement and other benefit 
arrangements are provided to 
employees with appropriate 
consideration of market practice 
and geographical differences.
Short-term incentives
For Executive Directors’ short-term 
incentives, assessment is made 
against a corporate scorecard of key 
performance measures built around 
Shire’s key financial goals and other 
strategic priorities for the relevant year.
This same scorecard is appropriately 
used by each business and corporate 
function to ensure alignment with 
corporate goals, and also funds 
short-term incentives across the 
Company.
Scorecard targets are further used as 
a basis for determination of each 
employee’s performance objectives, 
with annual incentive awards payable 
in cash, strongly differentiated based 
on individual performance through 
linkages with the performance 
management system.
Long-term incentives
Discretionary long-term equity awards 
are made on an annual basis 
dependent on an employee’s level of 
responsibility within the Company and 
individual performance.
For Executive Directors and Executive 
Committee members, all awards vest 
at the end of a three year period. 
For the rest of the employee 
population, phased vesting of awards 
occurs over a period of three years 
with the majority vesting at the end of 
the three year period (except for PSU 
awards which vest at the end of a 
three year period subject to the 
satisfaction of performance 
conditions).

Directors may be appointed by the 
Company by ordinary resolution or by 
the Board. Non-Executive Directors are 
appointed ordinarily for a term of two 
years, subject to shareholder approval. 
Re-appointment of Non-Executive 
Directors following the expiry of their 
term of appointment is subject to Board 
approval. The Board may, from time-to-
time, appoint one or more Directors for 
such period and on such terms as it 
may determine and may also revoke 
or terminate any such appointment. 
The Company’s Articles of Association 
(the “Articles”) provide that at each Annual 
General Meeting (“AGM”) all those Directors 
who have been appointed by the Board 
since the last AGM, or who held office at 
the time of the two preceding AGMs and 
who did not retire at either of them, or who 
held office with the Company, other than 
executive office, for a continuous period 
of nine years or more at the date of the 
meeting, shall retire from office and may offer 
themselves for re-election by the members.
Notwithstanding the provisions in the Articles, 
in accordance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2014, all Directors will 
be subject to annual re-election. 
Powers 
Subject to the provisions of the 
Companies (Jersey) Law 1991, as amended 
(the “Companies Act”), the Articles and 
directions given by the Company in general 
meeting by special resolution, the business 
of the Company is managed by the Board 
which may exercise all the powers of 
the Company whether relating to the 
management of the business of the 
Company or not. In particular, the Board 
may exercise all the powers of the 
Company to borrow money and to 
mortgage or charge all or any part of the 
undertaking, property and assets (present 
and future) and uncalled capital of the 
Company and, subject to the Companies 
Act, to issue debentures and other 
securities, whether outright or as collateral 
security, for a debt, liability or obligation 
of the Company or of a third party. 
Additional statutory information
Liability insurance and indemnification 
In the year under review, the Group 
maintained an insurance policy for its 
Directors and Officers in respect of liabilities 
arising out of any act, error or omission 
whilst acting in their capacity as Directors 
or Officers. Qualifying third party indemnity 
provisions were also in place during the 
year under review for the benefit of Directors 
in relation to certain losses and liabilities 
which they may potentially incur to third 
parties in the course of their duties. These 
remain in force at the date of this report.
Interests in material contracts 
Other than the insurance/indemnity 
provisions disclosed under “Liability 
insurance and indemnification” above, 
none of the Directors had a material interest 
in any contract of significance to which 
the Company or any of its subsidiary 
undertakings was a party during the 
period under review.
Dividends
Subject to the provisions of the Companies 
Act, the Company may by ordinary 
resolution, from time-to-time, declare 
dividends not exceeding the amount 
recommended by the Board. Subject to the 
Companies Act, the Board may pay interim 
dividends, and also any fixed rate dividend, 
whenever the financial position of the 
Company, in the opinion of the Board, 
justifies its payment. 
The Board may withhold payment of all or 
any part of any dividends or other monies 
payable in respect of the shares from a 
person with a 0.25% interest (as defined 
in the Articles) if such person has been 
served with a restriction notice (as defined 
in the Articles) after failure to provide the 
Company with information concerning 
interests in those shares required to be 
provided under the Articles. 
Shire has put in place income access 
share arrangements which enable 
shareholders to elect to receive their 
dividends from a Group company resident 
for tax purposes in the UK. Further 
information is available in Note 22 to the 
consolidated financial statements. 
In respect of the six months to December 
31, 2015, the Board resolved to pay 
an interim dividend of 22.16 US cents 
(2014: 19.09 US cents) per Ordinary Share. 
Together with the first interim dividend 
payment of 4.21 US cents (2014: 
3.83 US cents) per Ordinary Share, 
this represents total dividends of 
26.37 US cents (2014: 22.92 US cents) 
per Ordinary Share for the year ended 
December 31, 2015.
ACS HR Solutions Share Plan Services 
(Guernsey) Limited (the “Trustee”), trustee 
of the Shire Employee Benefit Trust (the 
“Trust”), has waived its entitlement to any 
dividends which become due and payable, 
from time-to-time, in respect of shares or 
other securities which are registered in the 
name of the trustee or its nominee(s). Total 
dividends waived by the Trustee during the 
year amounted to £189,432.79.
Shares 
Share capital 
As at the year ended December 31, 2015, 
the Company’s issued share capital 
comprised 601,075,964 Ordinary Shares of 
5 pence each of which 8,527,703 Ordinary 
Shares were held in treasury. 
Rights and obligations attaching 
to shares 
The rights and obligations attaching to the 
Ordinary Shares are set out in the Articles 
which are available on the Company’s 
website. The Articles may only be 
amended by special resolution of the 
members of the Company. 
Variation of rights 
Subject to the Companies Act, rights 
attached to any class of shares may be 
varied with written consent of the holders 
of not less than two-thirds in nominal 
value of the issued shares of that class 
(calculated excluding any shares held in 
treasury) or with the sanction of a special 
resolution passed at a separate meeting 
of the holders of those shares. At each 
such separate general meeting, except an 
adjourned meeting, the quorum shall be 
two persons holding or representing by 
proxy not less than one third in nominal 
value of the issued shares of that class 
(calculated excluding any shares held 
in treasury). 
Issuance of shares 
Subject to applicable statutes and subject 
to and without prejudice to any rights 
attached to existing shares, shares may be 
issued with such rights and restrictions 
as the Company may by special resolution 
decide or, if no such resolution has been 
passed or so far as the resolution does not 
make specific provision, as the Board 
may decide. Subject to the Articles, the 
Companies Act and other shareholders’ 
rights, unissued shares are at the disposal 
of the Board. 
102 Shire Annual Report 2015 Restrictions on transfer of shares 
There are no restrictions on the transfer 
of shares in the Company, except (i) that 
certain restrictions may, from time-to-time, 
be imposed by laws and regulations 
(for example insider trading laws); and 
(ii) pursuant to the Listing Rules of the 
UK Financial Conduct Authority whereby 
certain Directors and employees of the 
Company require the approval of the 
Company to deal in the Company’s 
Ordinary Shares. 
Voting 
It is the Company’s practice to hold a poll 
on every resolution at general meetings. 
Every member present in person or by 
proxy has, upon a poll, one vote for every 
share held by him. In the case of joint 
holders of a share the vote of the senior 
who tenders a vote, whether in person 
or by proxy, shall be accepted to the 
exclusion of the votes of the other joint 
holders and, for this purpose, seniority 
shall be determined by the order in 
which the names stand in the register of 
members in respect of the joint holding.
Restrictions on voting 
No member shall, unless the Board 
otherwise decides, be entitled to attend 
or vote at any general or class meeting in 
respect of any shares held if any call or 
other sum payable by that member remains 
unpaid. Also, a member may not be entitled 
to attend or vote if served with a restriction 
notice (as defined in the Articles). 
The Company is not aware of any agreements 
between holders of securities that may 
result in restrictions on voting rights. 
The Company maintains an American 
Depositary Receipt (“ADR”) program in the 
US. Each American Depositary Share 
(“ADS”) represents three Ordinary Shares. 
An ADS is evidenced by an ADR issued by 
Citibank, N.A. as Depositary, and is listed 
on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. 
Each ADS holder is entitled to the financial 
rights attached to such shares although the 
ADR Depositary is the registered holder of 
the underlying Ordinary Shares. 
As at December 31, 2015, the Trust held 
0.18% of the issued share capital of the 
Company on trust for the benefit of 
participants in the Company’s employee 
share plans. The voting rights in relation to 
these shares are exercised by the Trustee. 
The Trustee may vote or abstain from 
voting in any way it thinks fit and in doing 
so may take into account both financial 
and non-financial interests of the 
beneficiaries of the Trust or their 
dependants. Historically the Trustee 
has not exercised its right to vote. 
Purchase of own shares 
At its AGM held on April 28, 2015 the 
Company was authorized, until the earlier 
of July 27, 2016 or the conclusion of the 
2016 AGM, to make market purchases 
of up to 59,126,620 of its own Ordinary 
Shares. Further details regarding 
purchases by the Company of its own 
shares can be found in Note 22 to the 
consolidated financial statements.

reconciliation to US GAAP please see page 159.
104 Shire Annual Report 2015 The Directors are responsible for preparing 
the Annual Report and the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to 
prepare financial statements for each 
financial year. Under that law the Directors 
are required to prepare the group financial 
statements in accordance with accounting 
principles generally accepted in the United 
States of America. Under company law the 
Directors must not approve the accounts 
unless they are satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view of the state of affairs of 
the Group and of the profit or loss of the 
Group for that period. 
In preparing the Group financial 
statements, the Directors are required to:
 > properly select and apply accounting 
policies;
 > present information, including accounting 
policies, in a manner that provides 
relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information; 
 > provide additional disclosures when 
compliance with the specific 
requirements within accounting 
principles generally accepted in the 
United States of America are insufficient 
to enable users to understand the impact 
of particular transactions, other events 
and conditions on the entity’s financial 
position and financial performance; and
 > make an assessment of the Group’s 
ability to continue as a going concern.
Directors’ responsibilities statement
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
proper accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the Group’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position 
of the Group and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements comply with 
the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991. They 
are also responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the Group and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Responsibility statement 
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
 > the financial statements, prepared in 
accordance with the accounting 
principles generally accepted in the 
United States of America, give a true and 
fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit or loss of the Group 
and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole;
 > the strategic report includes a fair review 
of the development and performance 
of the business and the position of the 
Group and the undertakings included 
in the consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties that 
they face; and
 > the annual report and financial statements, 
taken as a whole, are fair, balanced 
and understandable and provide the 
information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Group’s performance, 
business model and strategy.

 Shire Annual Report 2015 105 Opinion on the financial statements of Shire plc
In our opinion the consolidated financial statements of Shire plc 
and subsidiaries (together the “Group”):
 > give a true and fair view of the state of Shire plc and 
subsidiaries’ affairs (together the Group) as at December 31, 
2015 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
 > have been properly prepared in accordance with accounting 
principles generally accepted in the United States of America; 
and
 > have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies (Jersey) Law 1991.
The financial statements comprise the consolidated balance sheet, 
the consolidated statement of income, the consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes 
in equity, the consolidated statement of cash flows and the related 
Notes 1 to 31. The financial reporting framework that has been 
applied in the preparation of the Group financial statements is 
applicable law and accounting principles generally accepted in the 
United States of America.
Going concern and the Directors’ assessment of the principal 
risks that would threaten the solvency or liquidity of the Group
We have reviewed the Directors’ statement regarding the 
appropriateness of the going concern basis of accounting and the 
Directors’ statement on the longer-term viability of the Group 
contained within the Corporate Governance Report on page 64. 
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:
 > the Directors’ confirmation on page 105 that they have carried 
out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, 
including those that would threaten its business model, future 
performance, solvency or liquidity;
 > the disclosures on pages 36-47 that describe those risks and 
explain how they are being managed or mitigated;
 > the Directors’ statement in the Corporate Governance report 
about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the 
going concern basis of accounting in preparing them and their 
identification of any material uncertainties to the Group’s ability 
to continue to do so over a period of at least twelve months 
from the date of approval of the financial statements;
 > the Director’s explanation on page 69 as to how they have 
assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period 
they have done so and why they consider that period to be 
appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue 
in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the 
period of their assessment, including any related disclosures 
drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We agreed with the Directors’ adoption of the going concern basis 
of accounting and we did not identify any such material 
uncertainties. However, because not all future events or conditions 
can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the 
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Independence
We are required to comply with the Financial Reporting Council’s 
Ethical Standards for Auditors and we confirm that we are 
independent of the Group and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with those standards. We also 
confirm we have not provided any of the prohibited non-audit 
services referred to in those standards.
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are 
those that had the greatest effect on our audit strategy, the 
allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the 
engagement team. 
The risks identified relate to:
 > pricing and market assumptions for acquired products that 
affect the accounting for acquisition of NPS Pharmaceuticals Inc 
(“NPS”); 
 > the potential for invalid revenue to be recognized from sales to 
wholesalers in excess of market demand; and
 > the estimation of rebates against revenue as a result of 
contractual and regulatory requirements in the United States. 
The description of risks below should be read in conjunction with 
the significant issues considered by the Audit Committee 
discussed on pages 70 and 71. Our audit procedures relating to 
these matters were designed in the context of our audit of the 
financial statements as a whole, and not to express an opinion on 
individual accounts or disclosures. Our opinion on the financial 
statements is not modified with respect to any of the risks 
described below, and we do not express an opinion on these 
individual matters.
Independent auditor’s report to the members of Shire plc
106 Shire Annual Report 2015 Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Accounting for the acquisition of NPS Pharmaceuticals Inc (“NPS”)
The Director’s determination of the purchase price allocation for the acquisition 
of NPS is included at Note 4, and the critical accounting policy and estimate in 
relation to acquired intangible assets is set out at Note 3.
We identified a risk that the allocation of purchase price to acquired assets 
and liabilities in relation to the NPS acquisition, in particular the valuation of 
the intangible assets related to the currently marketed products GATTEX and 
NATPARA, are not appropriate. 
The underlying judgments made in arriving at fair value for GATTEX and 
NATPARA include key assumptions for pricing, disease prevalence rate and 
disease severity over the life cycle of these intangible assets.
This has been highlighted as a significant risk due to its size (consideration of 
$5,220 million, with intangible assets of $4,993 million recognized) and the 
complexity of judgments required.
In order to assess the allocation of the purchase price to acquired NPS assets 
and liabilities we have the tested the Group’s relevant controls and performed 
testing including the following specific procedures:
 > We assessed the competence of management’s market expert, and 
undertook a series of interviews with them to understand their work;
 > We obtained the revenue forecast model prepared by management’s 
market expert including the key assumptions for price rises, prevalence 
rate and severity mix; 
 > We inspected and challenged the underlying studies on which the 
assessment of the prevalence rate was based; and
 > We obtained an understanding of the primary information and opinions 
obtained from key opinion leaders (for example medical specialists) in 
order to challenge the severity mix and pricing assumptions. 
In addition, we independently tested Management’s controls in this area 
and increased the level of testing associated by re-performing the key 
control activities.
Revenue recognition
A description of the key accounting policy for revenue recognition is included at 
Note 2.
The Group sells the majority of its products to wholesalers who, in turn, supply 
retail, hospitals and other pharmacies.
We identified a risk relating to overstatement of US revenue for certain 
Neuroscience, GI and IM products due to the potential for Shire to use their 
commercial position to push sales to wholesalers which significantly exceeds 
market demand. 
We have highlighted this as a risk given the alleged incidences of invalid sales 
made by other companies in this market in the past two years.
We have considered the Group’s process for judgments in this area and overall 
revenue recognition policy. In particular, in relation to this risk, we have:
 > performed trend analysis over stocking levels (measured as gross revenues 
less demand) as compared to prior periods;
 > examined and assessed wholesaler compliance with certain stocking 
thresholds per agreed long-term contracts;
 > tested management’s monitoring process over stocking levels; and
 > audited the level of returns following the period end and compared to 
previous periods.
In addition, we independently tested management’s controls in this area for 
operating effectiveness.
US rebates and sales deductions
A description of the key accounting policy for sales deductions is included at 
Note 2(d).
The Directors are required to make certain judgments in respect of the level of 
rebates and other sales deductions that will be realised against the Group’s sales. 
The largest of these judgments relate to rebates for Medicaid and Managed Care 
programs, for which the Group held accrued rebates as at 31 December 2015 
of $982 million (2014: $882 million) in aggregate. The risk is primarily focussed 
on the Neuroscience, GI and IM products.
The key elements of the judgments relating to Medicaid and Managed Care 
rebates include:
 > the proportion of the inventory pipeline that will attract specific rebates; and
 > the future value of rebate per unit expected to be applicable.
We identified a risk that these judgments are not appropriate and, as a result, 
rebate liabilities and sales deductions are recorded at an incorrect level.
There is a significant track record of actual rebate levels which informs our 
assessment of the level of risk of material misstatement. Nevertheless due 
to manual nature and extent of the accounting process in this area it forms a 
significant part of our audit effort and requires a notable level of resource within 
the audit engagement.
We have considered the Group’s processes for making judgments in this area 
and performed the following procedures:
 > considered the appropriateness of the process and tested the controls 
adopted by management in determining the accounting for rebates and 
other sales deductions;
 > undertaken an analysis of the historical accuracy of judgments by 
reference to actual rebates paid in prior periods;
 > confirmed rebate levels accrued during the year against 
subsequent payments;
 > analysed and recalculated components of the year end liability based 
on contracted and statutory rebate rates; and
 > challenged the key elements of judgments that were made in the 
period in light of externally verifiable data, such as pipeline levels, and 
industry practice.
We also evaluated the presentation and disclosure of the transactions within 
the Group financial statements.
 Shire Annual Report 2015 107
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information The prior year reported risk related to the ViroPharma acquisition 
has not been separately reported on in the current year given the 
accounting for the acquisition completed in 2014 and there have 
been no significant changes in 2015. The risk related to complex 
tax judgments is not presented this year as we concluded on the 
most significant tax judgment, related to the tax treatment of the 
$1.6 billion received from AbbVie Inc, in the prior year and there 
have been no developments in relation to the treatment.
Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the 
financial statements that makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be 
changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the 
scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.
We determined materiality for the Group to be $100 million (2014: 
$70 million), which is below 5% (2014: 5%) of adjusted pre-tax 
profit, and below 2% (2014: 2%) of equity. Pre-tax profit has been 
adjusted by removing the impact of one off items such as 
impairments of intangible assets (see Note 13). In the prior year 
we also excluded from our materiality determination the $1.6 billion 
break fee received from AbbVie.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the 
Committee all audit differences in excess of $5 million (2014: 
$3 million), as well as differences below that threshold that, in our 
view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to 
the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when 
assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the 
Group and its environment, including Group-wide controls, and 
assessing the risks of material misstatement at the Group level. 
Based on that assessment, we focused our Group audit scope 
primarily on US, UK, Irish and Swiss entities. In addition we 
identified certain companies to perform an audit of specified 
account balances where considered significant. These locations 
represent the principal operations and together with the Group 
functions in scope account for 96% (2014: 99%) of the Group’s 
total assets, 79% (2014: 80%) of the Group’s revenue.

The locations were also selected to provide an appropriate basis 
for undertaking audit work to address the risks of material 
misstatement identified above. Our audit work at the individual 
locations was performed at component materiality levels which 
ranged from $30 million to $70 million, which were determined by 
reference to a proportion of Group materiality appropriate to the 
relative scale of the business concerned. 
At Group level we also audited the consolidation process and 
carried out analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion that 
there were no significant risks of material misstatement of the 
aggregated financial information of the remaining components not 
subject to full scope audit procedures.
The Group audit team directly undertakes the work performed 
across all of the full scope components and follows a program 
of planned site visits that is designed to ensure that the Senior 
Statutory Auditor spends appropriate time in each of the full scope 
locations throughout the year. In addition to this the Group audit 
team will visit other locations not in full scope on a rotational basis.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by our engagement letter
In our opinion:
 > the financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 that 
would have been applied were the Group incorporated in the 
United Kingdom;
 > the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited 
has been properly prepared in accordance with the provisions 
of the Companies Act 2006 that would have been applied were 
the Group incorporated in the United Kingdom; and
 > the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ 
Report for the financial year for which the financial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.

108 Shire Annual Report 2015 Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 we are required to report 
to you if, in our opinion:
 > we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit; or
 > proper accounting records have not been kept by the parent 
company, or proper returns adequate for our audit have not 
been received from branches not visited by us; or
 > the financial statements are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Corporate Governance Statement
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review part of 
the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the company’s 
compliance with certain provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. We have nothing to report arising from our review.
Our duty to read other information in the Annual Report
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we are 
required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the annual 
report is:
 > materially inconsistent with the information in the audited 
financial statements; or
 > apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group acquired 
in the course of performing our audit; or
 > otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have 
identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired 
during the audit and the Directors’ statement that they consider 
the annual report is fair, balanced and understandable and 
whether the annual report appropriately discloses those matters 
that we communicated to the audit committee which we consider 
should have been disclosed. We confirm that we have not 
identified any such inconsistencies or misleading statements.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion 
on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). We also 
comply with International Standard on Quality Control 1 (UK and 
Ireland). Our audit methodology and tools aim to ensure that our 
quality control procedures are effective, understood and applied. 
Our quality controls and systems include our dedicated professional 
standards review team and independent partner reviews.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with Article 113A of the Companies (Jersey) Law 
1991. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state 
to the company’s members those matters we are required to state 
to them in an Auditor’s report and/or those further matters we 
have expressly agreed to report to them on in our engagement 
letter and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by 
law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other 
than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our 
audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate 
to the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all 
the financial and non-financial information in the annual report 
to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial 
statements and to identify any information that is apparently 
materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the 
knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. 
If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

1. Description of operations
Shire plc and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as either 
“Shire”, or the “Company”) is a biotech Company, focusing on 
developing and marketing innovative medicines for patients with 
rare diseases and other select conditions.
The Company has grown both organically and through acquisition, 
completing a series of major transactions that have brought 
therapeutic, geographic and pipeline growth and diversification. 
The Company will continue to conduct its own R&D, focused on 
rare diseases, as well as evaluate companies, products and 
pipeline opportunities that offer a strategic fit and have the 
potential to deliver value to all of the Company’s stakeholders: 
patients, physicians, policy makers, payers, investors and 
employees.
2. Summary of significant accounting policies
(a) Basis of preparation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the 
accounts of Shire plc, all of its subsidiary undertakings and the 
Income Access Share trust, after elimination of inter-company 
accounts and transactions. They have been prepared in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the 
United States of America (“US GAAP”) and US Securities and 
Exchange Commission (“SEC”) regulations for annual reporting.
(b) Use of estimates in consolidated financial statements
The preparation of consolidated financial statements, in conformity 
with US GAAP and SEC regulations, requires management to 
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts 
of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and 
liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and 
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting 
period. Estimates and assumptions are primarily made in relation 
to the valuation of intangible assets, sales deductions, income 
taxes (including provisions for uncertain tax positions and the 
realization of deferred tax assets), provisions for litigation and legal 
proceedings, contingent consideration receivable from product 
divestments, contingent consideration payable in respect of 
business combinations and asset purchases and assets held 
for sale. If actual results differ from the Company’s estimates, or 
to the extent these estimates are adjusted in future periods, the 
Company’s results of operations could either benefit from, or be 
adversely affected by, any such change in estimate.
(c) Revenue recognition
The Company recognizes revenue when all of the following 
conditions are met:
 > there is persuasive evidence of an agreement or arrangement;
 > delivery of products has occurred or services have been rendered;
 > the seller’s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and
 > collectability is reasonably assured.
Where applicable, all revenues are stated net of value added and 
similar taxes, and trade discounts. No revenue is recognized for 
consideration, the value or receipt of which is dependent on future 
events or future performance.
The Company’s principal revenue streams and their respective 
accounting treatments are discussed below:
Product sales
Revenue for the sale of products is recognized when delivery has 
occurred and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership 
have been transferred to the customer. Provisions for rebates, 
product returns and discounts to customers are provided for as 
reductions to revenue in the same period as the related sales are 
recorded. The provisions made at the time of revenue recognition 
are based on historical experience and updated for changes in 
facts and circumstances including the impact of new legislation 
and loss of a product’s exclusivity. These provisions are 
recognized as a reduction to revenues.
Royalty income
Royalty income relating to licensed technology is recognized when 
the licensee sells the underlying product, with the amount of 
royalty income recorded based on sales information received from 
the relevant licensee. The Company estimates sales amounts and 
related royalty income based on the historical product information 
for any period that the sales information is not available from the 
relevant licensee.
Licensing revenues
Other revenue includes revenues derived from product out-
licensing arrangements, which typically consist of an initial up-front 
payment to Shire by the licensee on inception of the license and 
subsequent milestone payments to Shire by the licensee, contingent 
on the achievement of certain clinical and sales milestones. 
Product out-licensing arrangements often require the Company 
to provide multiple deliverables to the licensee.
Initial license fees received in connection with product out-
licensing agreements entered into prior to January 1, 2011 were 
deferred and are recognized over the period in which the Company 
has continuing substantive performance obligations, typically the 
period over which the Company participates in the development 
of the out-licensed product, even where such fees are non-
refundable and not creditable against future royalty payments.
For product out-licensing arrangements entered into, or subject 
to material modification, after January 1, 2011, consideration 
received is allocated between each of the separable elements 
in the arrangement using the relative selling price method. 
An element is considered separable if it has value to the customer 
on a stand-alone basis. The selling price used for each separable 
element will be based on vendor specific objective evidence 
(“VSOE”) if available, third party evidence if VSOE is not available, 
or estimated selling price if neither VSOE nor third party evidence 
is available. Revenue is then recognized as each of the separable 
elements to which the revenue has been allocated is delivered.
Milestone payments which are non-refundable, non-creditable and 
contingent on achieving certain clinical milestones are recognized 
as revenues either on achievement of such milestones if the 
milestones are considered substantive or over the period the 
Company has continuing substantive performance obligations, 
if the milestones are not considered substantive. If milestone 
payments are creditable against future royalty payments, the 
milestones are deferred and released over the period in which 
the royalties are anticipated to be paid.
(d) Sales deductions 
(i) Rebates
Rebates primarily consist of statutory rebates to state Medicaid 
agencies and contractual rebates with health-maintenance 
organizations. These rebates are based on price differentials 
between a base price and the selling price. As a result, rebates 
generally increase as a percentage of the selling price over the life 
of the product (as prices increase). Provisions for rebates are 
recorded as reductions to revenue in the same period as the 
116 Shire Annual Report 2015 related sales are recorded, with the amount of the rebate based on 
the Company’s best estimate if any uncertainty exists over the unit 
rebate amount, and with estimates of future utilization derived from 
historical trends.
(ii) Returns
The Company estimates the proportion of recorded revenue that 
will result in a return, based on historical trends and when applicable, 
specific factors affecting certain products at the balance sheet 
date. The accrual is recorded as a reduction to revenue in the 
same period as the related sales are recorded. 
(iii) Coupons 
The Company uses coupons as a form of sales incentive. An accrual 
is established based on the Company’s expectation of the level of 
coupon redemption, estimated using historical trends. The accrual 
is recorded as a reduction to revenue in the same period as 
the related sales are recorded or the date the coupon is offered, 
if later than the date the related sales are recorded.
(iv) Discounts
The Company offers cash discounts to customers for the early 
payment of receivables which are recorded as reductions to 
revenue and accounts receivable in the same period as the related 
sale is recorded.
(v) Wholesaler chargebacks
The Company has contractual agreements whereby it supplies 
certain products to third parties at predetermined prices. 
Wholesalers acting as intermediaries in these transactions are 
reimbursed by the Company if the predetermined prices are less 
than the prices paid by the wholesaler to the Company. Accruals 
for wholesaler chargebacks, which are based on historical trends, 
are recorded as reductions to revenue in the same period as the 
related sales are recorded.
(e) Collaborative arrangements
The Company enters into collaborative arrangements to develop 
and commercialize drug candidates. These collaborative 
arrangements often require up-front, milestone, royalty or profit 
share payments, or a combination of these, with payments often 
contingent upon the success of the related development and 
commercialization efforts. Collaboration agreements entered into 
by the Company may also include expense reimbursements or 
other such payments to the collaborating partner.
The Company reports costs incurred and revenue generated from 
transactions with third parties as well as payments between parties 
to collaborative arrangements either on a gross or net basis, 
depending on the characteristics of the collaborative relationship.
(f) Cost of product sales
Cost of product sales includes the cost of purchasing finished 
product for sale, the cost of raw materials and manufacturing for 
those products that are manufactured by the Company, shipping 
and handling costs, depreciation and amortization of intangible 
assets in respect of favorable manufacturing contracts. Royalties 
payable to third party intellectual property owners on sale of the 
Company’s products are also included in Cost of product sales.
(g) Leased assets
The costs of operating leases are charged to operations on a 
straight-line basis over the lease term, even if rental payments are 
not made on such a basis.
Assets acquired under capital leases are included in the 
consolidated balance sheet as property, plant and equipment 
and are depreciated over the shorter of the period of the lease 
or their useful lives. The capital element of future lease payments 
is recorded as a liability, while the interest element is charged to 
operations over the period of the lease to produce a level yield 
on the balance of the capital lease obligation.
(h) Advertising expense
The Company expenses the cost of advertising as incurred. 
Advertising costs amounted to $56.1 million and $56.4 million 
for the years to December 31, 2015 and 2014 respectively and 
were included within Selling, general and administrative 
(“SG&A”) expenses.
(i) Research and development (“R&D”) expense
R&D costs are expensed as incurred. Up-front and milestone 
payments made to third parties for in-licensed products that have 
not yet received marketing approval and for which no alternative 
future use has been identified are also expensed as incurred.
Milestone payments made to third parties on and subsequent 
to regulatory approval are capitalized as intangible assets, and 
amortized over the remaining useful life of the related product.
(j) Valuation and impairment of long-lived assets other than 
goodwill, indefinite lived intangible assets and investments
The Company evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets 
other than goodwill, indefinite lived intangible assets and 
investments for impairment whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the relevant 
assets may not be recoverable. When such a determination is 
made, management’s estimate of undiscounted cash flows to be 
generated by the use and ultimate disposition of these assets is 
compared to the carrying value of the assets to determine whether 
the carrying value is recoverable. If the carrying value is deemed 
not to be recoverable, the amount of the impairment recognized in 
the consolidated financial statements is determined by estimating 
the fair value of the relevant assets and recording an impairment 
loss for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the 
estimated fair value. This fair value is usually determined based 
on estimated discounted cash flows.
(k) Finance costs of debt
Finance costs relating to debt issued are recorded as a deferred 
charge and amortized to the consolidated statements of income 
over the period to the earliest redemption date of the debt, using 
the effective interest rate method. On extinguishment of the related 
debt, any unamortized deferred financing costs are written off and 
charged to interest expense in the consolidated statements of income.
(l) Foreign currency
Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated 
into the functional currency of the relevant subsidiary in which 
they arise at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. 
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the relevant 
functional currency at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the 
transaction. Transaction gains and losses, other than those related 
to current and deferred tax assets and liabilities, are recognized in 
arriving at income from operations before income taxes and equity 
in earnings of equity method investees. Transaction gains and 
losses arising on foreign currency denominated current and deferred 
tax assets and liabilities are included within income taxes in the 
consolidated statements of income.
 Shire Annual Report 2015 117
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
continued
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
The results of operations for subsidiaries, whose functional 
currency is not the US dollar, are translated into the US dollar 
at the average rates of exchange during the period, with the 
subsidiaries’ balance sheets translated at the rates ruling at the 
balance sheet date. The cumulative effect of exchange rate 
movements is included in a separate component of Other 
comprehensive loss.
Foreign currency exchange transaction losses included in 
consolidated statements of income in the years to December 31, 
2015 and 2014 amounted to $26.5 million and $15.6 million, 
respectively.
(m) Income taxes
Uncertain tax positions are recognized in the consolidated financial 
statements for positions which are considered more likely than not 
of being sustained, based on the technical merits of the position 
on audit by the tax authorities. The measurement of the tax benefit 
recognized in the consolidated financial statements is based upon 
the largest amount of tax benefit that, in management’s judgment, 
is greater than 50% likely of being realized based on a cumulative 
probability assessment of the possible outcomes. 
The Company recognizes interest and penalties relating to 
unrecognized tax benefits within income taxes. 
The Company recognizes interest and penalties relating to income 
taxes within income taxes. Interest income on cash required to be 
deposited with the tax authorities is recognized within interest income.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for differences 
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the 
consolidated financial statements and the tax bases of assets and 
liabilities that will result in future taxable or deductible amounts. 
The deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the 
enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the 
differences are expected to affect taxable income. 
Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, 
in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some 
portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
(n) Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is based upon net income attributable to 
the Company divided by the weighted average number of ordinary 
shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share 
is  based upon net income attributable to the Company adjusted 
for the impact of interest expense on convertible debt on an 
“if-converted” basis (when the effect is dilutive and prior to the 
actual conversion or redemption of such debt) divided by the 
weighted average number of ordinary share equivalents 
outstanding during the period, adjusted for the dilutive effect of all 
potential ordinary shares equivalents that were outstanding during 
the year. Such potentially dilutive shares are excluded when the 
effect would be to increase diluted earnings per share or reduce 
the diluted loss per share. 
(o) Share-based compensation
Share-based compensation represents the cost of share-based 
awards granted to employees. The Company measures share-
based compensation cost for awards classified as equity at the 
grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award. 
Predominantly all of the Company’s awards have service and/or 
performance conditions and the fair values of these awards are 
estimated using a Black-Scholes valuation model. 
For share-based compensation awards which cliff vest, the 
Company recognizes the cost of the relevant share-based 
payment award as an expense on a straight-line basis (net of 
estimated forfeitures) over the employee’s requisite service period. 
For those share-based compensation awards with a graded 
vesting schedule, the Company recognizes the cost of the relevant 
share-based payment award as an expense on a straight-line 
basis (net of estimated forfeitures) over the requisite service period 
for the entire award (that is, over the requisite service period for the 
last separately vesting portion of the award). The share-based 
compensation expense is recorded in Cost of product sales, R&D, 
SG&A and Reorganization costs in the consolidated statements of 
income based on the employees’ respective functions.
The Company records deferred tax assets for awards that result in 
deductions on the Company’s income tax returns, based on the 
amount of compensation cost recognized and the Company’s 
statutory tax rate in the jurisdiction in which it will receive a 
deduction. Differences between the deferred tax assets 
recognized for financial reporting purposes and the actual tax 
deduction reported on the Company’s income tax return are 
recorded in additional paid-in capital (if the tax deduction exceeds 
the deferred tax asset) or in the consolidated statements of income 
(if the deferred tax asset exceeds the tax deduction and no 
additional paid-in capital exists from previous awards).
The Company’s share-based compensation plans are described 
more fully in Note 29.
(p) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are defined as short-term highly liquid 
investments with original maturities of ninety days or less. 
(q) Financial instruments — derivatives 
The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage its 
exposure to foreign exchange risk principally associated with 
inter-company financing. These instruments consist of swap and 
forward foreign exchange contracts. The Company does not apply 
hedge accounting for these instruments. The fair values of these 
instruments are included on the balance sheet in current assets/
liabilities, with changes in the fair value recognized in the 
consolidated statements of income. The cash flows relating to 
these instruments are presented within net cash provided by 
operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows, 
unless the derivative instruments are economically hedging 
specific investing or financing activities.
(r) Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost incurred 
in bringing each product to its present location and condition is 
based on purchase costs calculated on a first-in, first-out basis, 
including transportation costs.
Inventories include costs relating to both marketed products and, 
for certain products, cost incurred prior to regulatory approval. 
Inventories are capitalized prior to regulatory approval if the 
Company considers that it is highly probable that the US Food and 
Drug Administration (“FDA”) or another regulatory body will grant 
commercial and manufacturing approval for the relevant product, 
and it is highly probable that the value of capitalized inventories will 
be recovered through commercial sale.
Inventories are written down for estimated obsolescence or 
unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost 
of inventory and estimated market value based upon assumptions 
about future demand and market conditions. If actual market 
conditions are less favorable than those anticipated, inventory 
adjustments may be required. 
118 Shire Annual Report 2015 (s) Assets held-for-sale
An asset or asset disposal group is classified as held-for-sale 
when, amongst other things, the Company has committed to a 
plan of disposition, the asset or asset disposal Group is available 
for immediate sale, and the plan is not expected to change 
significantly. Assets held-for-sale are carried at the lower of their 
carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.
The Company does not record depreciation or amortization on 
assets classified as held-for-sale.
(t) Investments
The Company has certain investments in pharmaceutical and 
biotechnology companies.
Investments are accounted for using the equity method of 
accounting if the investment gives the Company the ability to 
exercise significant influence, but not control over, the investee. 
Significant influence is generally deemed to exist if the Company 
has an ownership interest in the voting stock of the investee 
between 20% and 50%, although other factors such as representation 
on the investee’s Board of Directors and the nature of commercial 
arrangements, are considered in determining whether the equity 
method of accounting is appropriate. Under the equity method 
of accounting, the Company records its investments in equity-
method investees in the consolidated balance sheet under 
Investments and its share of the investees’ earnings or losses 
together with other-than-temporary impairments in value under 
equity in (losses)/earnings of equity method investees, net of 
taxes in the consolidated statements of income.
All other equity investments, which consist of investments for 
which the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant 
influence, are accounted for under the cost method or at fair 
value. Investments in private companies are carried at cost, less 
provisions for other-than-temporary impairment in value. For 
public companies that have readily determinable fair values, the 
Company classifies its equity investments as available-for-sale 
and, accordingly, records these investments at their fair values 
with unrealized holding gains and losses included in the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income, net of any 
related tax effect. Realized gains and losses, and declines in value 
of available-for-sale securities judged to be other-than-temporary, 
are included in other income, net in the consolidated statements 
of income. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific 
identification method. Interest on securities classified as available-
for-sale is included as interest income in the consolidated 
statements of income.
(u) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is shown at cost reduced for 
impairment losses, net of accumulated depreciation. The cost of 
significant assets includes capitalized interest incurred during the 
construction period. Depreciation is recorded on a straight-line 
basis at rates calculated to write off the cost less estimated 
residual value of each asset over its estimated useful life as follows:
Buildings 15 to 50 years
Office furniture, fittings and equipment 3 to 10 years
Warehouse, laboratory and manufacturing equipment 3 to 15 years
The cost of land is not depreciated. Assets under the course of 
construction are not depreciated until the relevant assets are 
available and ready for their intended use.
Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to the 
consolidated statements of income as incurred. The costs of major 
renewals and improvements are capitalized. At the time property, 
plant and equipment is retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost 
and accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the asset and 
accumulated depreciation accounts. The profit or loss on such 
disposition is reflected in operating income.
(v) Goodwill and other intangible assets
(i) Goodwill
In business combinations completed subsequent to January 1, 
2009, goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the 
consideration given and the fair value of any non-controlling 
interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the identifiable assets 
and liabilities acquired. For business combinations completed prior 
to January 1, 2009 goodwill represents the excess of the fair value 
of the consideration given over the fair value of the identifiable 
assets and liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is not amortized, but instead is reviewed for impairment, 
at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. For the 
purpose of assessing the carrying value of goodwill for impairment, 
goodwill is allocated at the Company’s reporting unit level. 
Events or changes in circumstances which could trigger an 
impairment review include but are not limited to: significant 
underperformance of a reporting unit relative to expected historical 
or projected future operating results; significant changes in the 
manner of the Company’s use of acquired assets or the strategy 
for the overall business; and significant negative industry trends.
The Company reviews goodwill for impairment by firstly assessing 
qualitative factors, including comparing the market capitalization 
of the Company to the carrying value of its assets, to determine 
whether events or circumstances exist which indicate that it is 
more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less 
than its carrying amount. The Company assesses the totality of 
events or circumstances and determines that it is more likely than 
not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value. 
If, after assessing these qualitative factors, it is deemed more likely 
than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its 
carrying value, a “two step” quantitative assessment is performed 
by comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit’s net assets 
(including allocated goodwill) to the fair value of the reporting unit. 
If the reporting unit’s carrying amount is greater than its fair value, 
a second step is performed whereby the portion of the reporting 
unit’s fair value relating to goodwill is compared to the carrying 
value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. The Company recognizes a 
goodwill impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying 
value of goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value.

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
continued
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
(ii) Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets principally comprise intellectual property 
rights for products with a defined revenue stream, acquired 
product technology and IPR&D. Intellectual property rights for 
currently marketed products and acquired product technology are 
recorded at fair value and amortized over the estimated useful 
life of the related product, which ranges from 4 to 24 years 
(weighted average 20 years). IPR&D acquired through a business 
combination is capitalized as an indefinite lived intangible asset 
until the completion or abandonment of the associated R&D 
efforts. IPR&D is reviewed for impairment using a “one-step” 
approach which compares the fair value of the IPR&D asset with 
its carrying amount. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent 
that the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the IPR&D asset. 
Once the R&D efforts are completed the useful life of the relevant 
assets will be determined, and the IPR&D asset amortized over 
this useful economic life. 
The following factors, where applicable, are considered in 
estimating the useful lives of Other intangible assets:
 > expected use of the asset;
 > regulatory, legal or contractual provisions, including the 
regulatory approval and review process, patent issues and 
actions by government agencies;
 > the effects of obsolescence, changes in demand, competing 
products and other economic factors, including the stability of 
the market, known technological advances, development of 
competing drugs that are more effective clinically or economically; 
 > actions of competitors, suppliers, regulatory agencies or others 
that may eliminate current competitive advantages; and
 > historical experience of renewing or extending similar arrangements.
When a number of factors apply to an intangible asset, these 
factors are considered in combination when determining the 
appropriate useful life for the relevant asset.
(w) Non-monetary transactions 
The Company enters into certain non-monetary transactions that 
involve either the granting of a license over the Company’s patents 
or the disposal of an asset or group of assets in exchange for a 
non–monetary asset, usually equity. The Company accounts for 
these transactions at fair value if the Company is able to determine 
the fair value within reasonable limits. To the extent the Company 
concludes that it is unable to determine the fair value of a 
transaction that transaction is accounted for at the recorded 
amounts of the assets exchanged. Management is required to 
exercise its judgment in determining whether or not the fair value 
of the asset received or given up can be determined.
(x) New accounting pronouncements
Adopted during the period
Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes
In November 2015 the Financial Accounting Standards Board 
(“FASB”) issued guidance to simplify the balance sheet 
presentation of deferred income taxes. The amendments in this 
update require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified 
as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position 
compared to the current practice of classifying deferred income 
tax liabilities and assets into both current and noncurrent amounts. 
The current requirement that deferred tax liabilities and assets of 
a tax-paying component of an entity be offset and presented as 
a single amount is not affected by the amendments in this update. 
The guidance is effective for financial statements issued for annual 
periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods 
within those annual periods. Earlier application is permitted for 
all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting 
period. The amendments in this update may be applied either 
prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or 
retrospectively to all periods presented. If an entity applies the 
guidance prospectively, the entity should disclose in the first 
interim and first annual period of change, the nature of and reason 
for the change in accounting principle and a statement that prior 
periods were not retrospectively adjusted. 
Shire adopted this guidance prospectively in the current period 
presented and the prior year balance sheet classification of 
deferred taxes has not been adjusted. The adoption of this 
guidance primarily resulted in a reclassification of net current 
deferred tax assets to net non-current deferred tax liabilities in 
the Consolidated Balance Sheet as at December 31, 2015. 
See Note 27 for details. 
Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals 
of  Components of an Entity
In April 2014 the FASB issued guidance on the reporting of 
discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of 
components of an entity. The amendments in this update revise 
the definition of discontinued operations by limiting discontinued 
operations reporting to disposals of components of an entity that 
represent strategic shifts that have (or will have) a major effect on 
an entity’s operations and financial results. The guidance requires 
expanded disclosures for discontinued operations which provide 
users of financial statements with more information about the 
assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses of discontinued 
operations. The guidance also requires an entity to disclose the 
pre-tax profit or loss of an individually significant component of an 
entity that does not qualify for discontinued operations reporting. 
Shire adopted this guidance in the period, which will be effective 
for discontinued operations occurring after January 1, 2015. 
The adoption of this guidance did not impact the Company’s 
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
To be adopted in future periods
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
In May 2014 the FASB and the International Accounting Standards 
Board (together the “Accounting Standards Boards”) issued a new 
accounting standard that is intended to clarify and converge the 
financial reporting requirements for revenue from contracts with 
customers. The core principle of the standard is that an “entity 
recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or 
services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration 
to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those 
goods or services”. To achieve that core principle the Accounting 
Standards Boards developed a five-step model (as presented 
below) and related application guidance, which will replace most 
existing revenue recognition guidance in US GAAP. 
Five-step model:
Step 1: Identify the contract(s) with a customer. 
Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract. 
Step 3: Determine the transaction price. 
Step 4:  Allocate the transaction price to the performance 
obligations in the contract. 
Step 5:  Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies 
a performance obligation.
120 Shire Annual Report 2015 The Accounting Standards Boards also issued new qualitative 
and quantitative disclosure requirements as part of the new 
accounting standard which aims to enable financial statement 
users to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty 
of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. 
In August 2015 the FASB decided to defer the effective date of 
the guidance by one year. Based on this deferral, public entities 
would need to apply the new guidance for annual reporting 
periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods 
therein. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of 
adopting this guidance.
Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis
In February 2015 the FASB issued guidance to respond to 
stakeholders’ concerns about the current accounting for consolidation 
of certain legal entities. Financial statement users asserted that 
in certain situations in which consolidation is ultimately required, 
deconsolidated financial statements are necessary to better 
analyze the reporting entity’s economic and operational results. 
Previously, the FASB issued an indefinite deferral for certain 
entities to partially address those concerns. However, the 
amendments in this guidance rescind that deferral and address 
those concerns by making changes to the consolidation guidance.
Under the amendments, all reporting entities are within the scope 
of Subtopic 810-10, Consolidation, including limited partnerships 
and similar legal entities, unless a scope exception applies. The 
presumption that a general partner controls a limited partnership 
has been eliminated. In addition, fees paid to decision makers 
that meet certain conditions no longer cause decision makers to 
consolidate a VIE in certain instances. The amendments place 
more emphasis in the consolidation evaluation on variable interests 
other than fee arrangements such as principal investment risk (for 
example, debt or equity interests), guarantees of the value of the 
assets or liabilities of the VIE, written put options on the assets of 
the VIE, or similar obligations, including some liquidity commitments 
or agreements (explicit or implicit). Additionally, the amendments 
reduce the extent to which related party arrangements cause an 
entity to be considered a primary beneficiary.
The amendments are effective for public business entities for fiscal 
years, and for interim periods therein, beginning after December 15, 
2015. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim 
period. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance 
to have a material effect on its consolidated financial position, 
results of operations and cash flows.
Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs
In April 2015 the FASB issued guidance to simplify the presentation 
of debt issuance costs. The guidance requires that debt issuance 
costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the 
balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of 
that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition 
and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not 
affected by the amendments in this update. 
In August 2015 the FASB issued further guidance to incorporate 
the SEC staff’s observation that, given the absence of authoritative 
guidance, the SEC staff would not object to an entity deferring 
and presenting debt issuance costs arising from line-of-credit 
arrangements as an asset and subsequently amortizing these 
costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, 
regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on 
the line-of-credit arrangement.
The amendments in these updates are effective for financial 
statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 
2015, and interim periods therein. Early adoption is permitted for 
financial statements that have not been previously issued. An entity 
should apply the new guidance on a retrospective basis, wherein 
the balance sheet of each individual period presented should be 
adjusted to reflect the period-specific effects of applying the new 
guidance. Upon transition, an entity is required to comply with the 
applicable disclosures for a change in an accounting principle. 
The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to 
have a material effect on its consolidated financial position, results 
of operations and cash flows.
Customer’s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud 
Computing Arrangement
In April 2015 the FASB issued guidance to simplify the customer’s 
accounting for fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement. 
The amendments provide guidance to customers about whether 
a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. 
If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, 
then the customer should account for the software license 
element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of 
other software licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does 
not include a software license, the customer should account for 
the arrangement as a service contract. The amendments will be 
effective for annual periods, including interim periods within 
those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2015. 
Early adoption is permitted for all entities. An entity can elect to 
adopt the guidance either a) prospectively to all arrangements 
entered into or materially modified after the effective date or 
b) retrospectively. The Company does not expect the adoption of 
this guidance to have a material effect on its consolidated financial 
position, results of operations and cash flows.
Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory
In July 2015 the FASB issued guidance to simplify the 
measurement of inventory which currently requires an entity to 
measure its inventory at the lower of cost or market, whereby 
market could be replacement cost, net realizable value, or net 
realizable value less an approximately normal profit margin. 
The amendment provides guidance that an entity should measure 
inventory within the scope of this update at the lower of cost and 
net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling 
price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable 
costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. Subsequent 
measurement is unchanged for inventory measured using last in 
first out or the retail inventory method. This amendment will be 
effective for annual periods, including interim periods within 
those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2016. 
Early adoption is permitted for all entities. The Company is 
currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance.
Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments
In September 2015 the FASB issued guidance to simplify the 
accounting for measurement-period adjustment. The amendments 
in this update require that an acquirer recognize adjustments to 
provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement 
period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts 
are determined. The guidance further requires that the acquirer 
record, in the same period’s financial statements, the effect on 
earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income 
effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, 
calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the 
acquisition date and present separately on the face of the income 
statement or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount

date. The guidance will be effective for fiscal year beginning after 
December 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal 
years. The guidance should be applied prospectively to adjustments 
to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date of this 
update with earlier application permitted for financial statements 
that have not been issued. The Company does not expect the 
adoption of this guidance to have a material effect on its 
consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows
Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and 
Financial Liabilities
In January 2016 the FASB issued guidance to address certain 
aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure 
of financial instruments. The amendments in this update revises 
the entity’s accounting related to the classification and measurement 
of investment in equity securities and the presentation of certain 
fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value. It 
also amends certain disclosure requirements associated with the 
fair value of financial instruments. The guidance will be effective for 
fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim 
periods within those fiscal years. Upon adoption, entities will be 
required to make a cumulative effect adjustment to the statement 
of financial position as of the beginning of the first reporting period 
in which the guidance is effective. The guidance on equity securities 
without readily determinable fair value will be applied prospectively 
to all equity instruments that exist as of the date of the adoption of 
this standard. The Company does not expect the adoption of this 
guidance to have a material effect on its consolidated financial 
position, results of operations and cash flows.
(y) Statutory accounts
The consolidated financial statements as at December 31, 2015 
and 2014, and for each of the three years in the period to 
December 31, 2015 do not comprise statutory accounts within the 
meaning of Section 434 of the UK Companies Act 2006 or Article 
104 of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991.
Statutory accounts of Shire, consisting of the solus accounts of 
Shire plc for the year to December 31, 2014 prepared under UK 
GAAP and in compliance with Jersey law have been delivered to 
the Registrar of Companies for Jersey. The consolidated accounts 
of the Company for the year to December 31, 2014 prepared in 
accordance with US GAAP, in fulfillment of the Company’s United 
Kingdom Listing Authority (“UKLA”) annual reporting requirements 
were filed with the UKLA. The auditor’s reports on these accounts 
were unqualified.
Statutory accounts of Shire, consisting of the solus accounts of 
Shire plc for the year to December 31, 2015 prepared under UK 
GAAP and in compliance with Jersey law will be delivered to the 
Registrar of Companies in Jersey in 2016. The Company further 
expects to file the consolidated accounts of the Company for the 
year to December 31, 2015, prepared in accordance with US 
GAAP, in fulfillment of the Company’s UKLA annual reporting 
requirements with the UKLA in 2016. 
3. Critical accounting estimates 
The preparation of consolidated financial statements, in conformity 
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States 
(“US GAAP”) and SEC regulations, requires management to make 
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of 
assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported 
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. 
Estimates and assumptions are primarily made in relation to 
the valuation of intangible assets (including goodwill), sales 
deductions, income taxes (including provisions for uncertain 
tax positions and the realization of deferred tax assets), provisions 
for litigation and legal proceedings, contingent consideration 
receivable from divestments of products or businesses and 
contingent consideration payable in respect of business 
combinations and asset purchases. If actual results differ from 
the Company’s estimates, or to the extent these estimates are 
adjusted in future periods, the Company’s results of operations 
could either benefit from, or be adversely affected by, any such 
change in estimate.
(i) Valuation of intangible assets
In accordance with US GAAP the Company classifies intangible 
assets into three categories: (1) finite lived intangible assets, which 
are amortized over their estimated useful lives; (2) intangible 
assets with indefinite lives, which are not subject to amortization; 
and (3) goodwill. 
At December 31, 2015 the carrying value of the Company’s 
finite lived intangible assets was $7,811.3 million (2014: 
$3,384 million), the carrying value of the Company’s indefinite 
lived intangible assets was $1,362.0 million (2014: $1,550 million), 
and the carrying value of the Company’s goodwill was 
$4,147.8 million (2014: $2,475 million). The Company’s indefinite 
lived intangible assets relate solely to IPR&D assets acquired 
through business combinations.
a. Initial valuation of intangible assets acquired through 
business combinations
The Company accounts for business combinations using the 
acquisition method of accounting, which requires that the assets 
acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of 
acquisition at their respective fair values. Any excess of the fair 
value of consideration given and the fair value of any noncontrolling 
interest over the fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities 
acquired is recorded as goodwill. The determination of the 
estimated fair values of acquired intangible assets, including 
determining the appropriate unit of account for each intangible 
asset, as well as the useful economic life ascribed to finite lived 
intangible assets, requires the use of significant judgment. The 
use of different estimates and assumptions to those used by the 
Company could result in a materially different valuation of acquired 
intangible assets, which could have a material effect on the 
Company’s results of operations. 
US GAAP provides acquirers with a reasonable time to obtain the 
information necessary to identify and measure the assets acquired 
and liabilities assumed in a business combination (a measurement 
period). The measurement period cannot exceed more than one 
year from the acquisition date. In accordance with US GAAP, if the 
initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the 
end of the reporting period in which the acquisition occurred, the 
Company reports in its financial statements preliminary amounts 
for those items for which the accounting is incomplete, which 
may include intangible assets acquired. During the measurement 
period, the Company considers all pertinent factors to determine 
whether new information obtained after the acquisition date 
regarding the values of intangible assets should result in an 
adjustment to the provisional amounts recognized or whether 
122 Shire Annual Report 2015 that new information results from events that occurred after 
the acquisition date and should result in an adjustment through 
current period earnings. Depending upon the nature of this new 
information, significant judgment may be required in determining 
whether the adjustment should be reflected as an adjustment to 
provisional amounts or adjusted through current period earnings. 
Application of a different judgment could materially impact the 
Company’s results of operations.
Initial valuation of finite lived intangible assets
At December 31, 2015 the carrying value of the Company’s finite 
lived intangible assets was $7,811 million. In the year to December 
31, 2015 the Company acquired finite lived intangible assets 
totaling $4,993 million, primarily relating to the intangible assets for 
currently marketed products and royalty right assets acquired with 
NPS Pharma. 
The fair values of all finite lived identifiable intangible assets, for 
commercialized products, developed product technologies and 
royalty right assets, acquired through business combinations 
have been determined using an income approach on a project-by-
project basis using the multi-period excess earnings method. The 
multi-period excess earnings method starts with a forecast of all 
expected future net cash flows which a market participant could 
have either generated or saved as a result of ownership of the 
intellectual property, customer relationships, product technologies 
and other intangible assets. These cash flows are then adjusted to 
present value by applying a market participant discount rate that 
reflects the risk factors that a market participant would associate 
with the cash flows (to the extent the underlying cash flows have 
not similarly been risk adjusted). Forecasting these future cash 
flows requires various assumptions to be made, including whether 
and to what extent future net cash flows are specific to Shire or 
could also be achieved by a market participant. These valuations 
are based on information that is known or reasonably knowable at 
the time of the acquisition of the identifiable intangible assets, and 
the expectations and assumptions that (i) have been deemed 
reasonable by the Company’s management and (ii) are based on 
information, expectations and assumptions that would be available 
to and made by a market participant. No assurance can be given, 
however, that the underlying assumptions or events associated 
with such valuations will occur as projected. For these reasons, 
among others, actual cash flows may differ from these 
forecasts and, dependent on the outcome of future events or 
circumstances, impairment losses (as outlined below) may result. 
The use of different estimates and assumptions to those used by 
the Company could result in a materially different valuation of 
finite lived intangible assets. However, as the valuation process for 
intangible assets involves a number of inter-related assumptions, 
the Company does not consider it meaningful to quantify the 
sensitivity of the valuation of intangible assets to changes in any 
individual assumption. 
Initial valuation of indefinite lived intangible assets (IPR&D)
IPR&D represents the fair value assigned to incomplete technologies 
and development projects that the Company has acquired 
through business combinations which, at the time the business 
combination closed, had not reached technological feasibility or 
which had no alternative future use. At December 31, 2015 the 
carrying value of the Company’s indefinite lived intangible assets 
(IPR&D) was $1,362 million. In the year to December 31, 2015 the 
Company acquired IPR&D assets totaling $475 million, primarily 
relating to the IPR&D assets acquired with Meritage and Foresight.
The fair value of IPR&D assets is determined using the income 
approach on a project-by-project basis using the multi-period 
excess earnings method. The fair value of the acquired IPR&D 
assets has been based on the present value of probability 
adjusted incremental cash flows which a market participant would 
expect the IPR&D projects to generate on a “highest and best use” 
basis, after the deduction of contributory asset charges for other 
assets employed in these projects. This method incorporates an 
evaluation of the probability of success of each development 
project, and the application of an appropriate market participant 
discount rate commensurate with the project’s stage of 
completion, the nature of the product, the scientific data 
associated with the technology, the current patent situation and 
market competition. 
The cash flows that will ultimately be generated by IPR&D projects 
are subject to major risks and uncertainties including whether 
the IPR&D projects will be completed in a timely manner, if at all, 
whether the necessary regulatory approvals will be obtained and 
how commercially successful the project will be subsequent to 
commercial launch. The Company is required to use estimates 
and assumptions in relation to these risks and uncertainties 
when valuing IPR&D projects. The use of different estimates and 
assumptions to those used by the Company could result in a 
materially different valuation of the related IPR&D. However, as the 
valuation process for IPR&D involves a number of inter-relating 
assumptions, the Company does not consider it meaningful to 
quantify the sensitivity of the valuation of IPR&D to changes in 
any individual assumption. 
The initial valuation of indefinite lived IPR&D is based on 
information that existed at the time of the acquisition of the relevant 
development project, and utilizes expectations and assumptions 
that (i) have been deemed reasonable by the Company’s 
management, and (ii) are based on information, expectations and 
assumptions that would be available to and made by a market 
participant. However, no assurance can be given that the 
underlying assumptions or estimates associated with the valuation 
of IPR&D will occur as projected. If IPR&D projects fail during 
development, are abandoned or subject to significant delay, or do 
not receive the relevant regulatory approvals, the Company may 
not realize the future cash flows that it has estimated nor recover 
the value of the R&D investment made subsequent to acquisition 
of the project. If such circumstances occur, the Company’s future 
operating results could be materially adversely impacted.
b. Subsequent measurement of intangible assets
Finite lived intangible assets — estimation of amortization charges 
and impairment losses
Management’s estimate of the useful life of its finite lived intangible 
assets considers, amongst other things, the following factors:
(i)  the expected use of the finite lived intangible asset by 
the Company;
(ii)  any legal, regulatory, or contractual provisions that may limit 
or extend the useful life;
(iii)  the effects of demand and competition, including the launch 
of generic products; and 
(iv)  other general economic and/or industry specific factors 
(such as the stability of the industry, known technological 
advances, legislative action that results in an uncertain or 
changing regulatory environment, and expected changes 
in distribution channels).
 Shire Annual Report 2015 123
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
continued
3. Critical accounting estimates continued
The Company reviews the useful life of its intangible assets subject 
to amortization at each reporting period, and revises its estimate of 
the useful life if warranted by events or circumstances. Any future 
changes to the useful life of the Company’s finite lived intangible 
assets could result in higher or lower amortization charges in 
future periods, which could materially affect the Company’s results 
from operations.
The Company reviews its finite lived intangible assets for 
impairment using a “two-step” approach, whenever events or 
circumstances suggest that the carrying value of its finite lived 
intangible assets may not be recoverable. Under step one, if the 
undiscounted cash flows resulting from the use and ultimate 
disposition of the finite lived intangible asset (based on entity 
specific assumptions) are less than its carrying value, the intangible 
asset is considered not to be recoverable. The impairment loss is 
determined under step two as the amount by which the carrying 
value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value (based on 
market participant assumptions, which may differ from entity 
specific assumptions). 
Events or circumstances that could suggest that the Company’s 
finite lived intangible assets may not be recoverable, and which 
would lead to an evaluation of the recoverability of the relevant 
asset, include but are not limited to, the following:
(i)  changes to a product’s commercialization strategy;
(ii)  the loss of patent protection, regulatory exclusivity or 
challenge or circumvention by competitors of the Company’s 
regulatory exclusivity patents;
(iii)  the development and marketing of competitive products, 
including generic entrants into the marketplace;
(iv)  changes to the product labels, or other regulatory intervention;
(v)  sustained government pressure on prices and, specifically, 
competitive pricing; 
(vi)  the occurrence of significant adverse events in respect to the 
Company’s products;
(vii)  a significant deterioration in a product’s operating 
performance compared to expectations; and
(viii)  an expectation that the intangible asset will be divested before 
the end of its previously estimated useful life.
The occurrence of any such events or circumstances may result in 
the Company reducing the estimated future net cash flows to be 
generated by, and the fair value of, its finite lived intangible assets 
and therefore give rise to an impairment loss. 
The Company has not recorded any impairment losses in respect 
of finite lived intangible assets in the year to December 31, 2015 
and 2014. 
Dependent on future events or circumstances, the Company’s 
operating results could be materially and adversely affected by 
future impairment losses relating to its finite lived intangible assets.
Indefinite lived intangible assets (IPR&D) — estimation of 
impairment losses
The Company reviews its indefinite lived intangible assets (which 
currently only relate to IPR&D assets) for impairment annually or 
more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that 
the asset might be impaired. Indefinite lived assets are reviewed 
for impairment by comparing the fair value of the indefinite lived 
asset (based on market participant assumptions, which may 
differ from entity specific assumptions) with its carrying amount. 
An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying 
value exceeds the estimated fair value of the relevant indefinite 
lived intangible asset. 
Events or circumstances that could suggest that the Company’s 
IPR&D assets may not be recoverable, and which would lead to 
an evaluation of the relevant asset for impairment, include those 
factors considered for finite lived intangible assets (outlined above) 
as well as any adverse changes to the technological or commercial 
viability of the IPR&D projects, which could include abandonment, 
or significant delays in progression, of the IPR&D project or a 
decline in its estimated commercial potential. The occurrence of 
any such events or circumstances could result in the Company 
reducing the estimated future net cash flows to be generated by, 
and the fair value of, its indefinite lived intangible assets and 
therefore give rise to an impairment loss.
After the identification of such events or circumstances, and 
the resultant impairment reviews, the Company recognized 
impairment losses of $643.7 million in the year to December 31, 
2015, to write-down its SHP625 and SHP608 IPR&D assets to 
their fair value (See Note 13, “Other intangible assets, net” to the 
consolidated financial statements set forth in this Annual Report). 
In 2014 the Company recorded impairment losses of 
$190.3 million. These impairments were recorded in advance of 
the annual testing date. Factors leading to these impairments were 
disclosed in detail as part of 2014 Annual Report. Dependent on 
future events or circumstances, the Company’s operating results 
could be materially and adversely affected by future impairment 
losses relating to its indefinite lived intangible assets.
Goodwill — estimation of impairment losses
The Company reviews goodwill for impairment at least annually, 
or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the carrying 
amount of goodwill may not be recoverable.
The Company reviews goodwill for impairment by firstly assessing 
qualitative factors, including comparing the market capitalization 
of the Company to the carrying value of its assets, to determine 
whether events or circumstances exist which indicate that it is 
more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less 
than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or 
circumstances, the Company determines that it is more likely than 
not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, 
then the goodwill is considered recoverable and no further testing 
is performed. If, after assessing these qualitative factors, it is 
deemed more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is 
less than its carrying value, a “two step” quantitative assessment 
is performed. This qualitative determination requires the use of 
judgment in concluding, based on the totality of events or 
circumstances, whether goodwill is considered recoverable or 
whether a further quantitative assessment is required to be performed.
124 Shire Annual Report 2015 Under this “two step” quantitative assessment, the Company firstly 
compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value. 
If the carrying value of a reporting unit is greater than its fair 
value, then goodwill is considered impaired and a further test is 
performed to determine the amount by which the carrying value 
of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its fair value, with an 
impairment loss recognized in an amount equal to that excess. 
The quantitative determination of fair value of a reporting unit 
requires the use of significant judgment and assumptions, which 
include, amongst other things, the estimation of future forecast 
cash flows and an appropriate discount rate used to determine 
the fair value.
The Company performed its annual goodwill impairment review 
as of October 1, 2015, which indicated, based on qualitative 
factors that the Company’s goodwill was recoverable and was 
not deemed to be at risk of impairment.
(ii) Sales Deductions 
Sales deductions consist primarily of statutory rebates to State 
Medicaid and other government agencies, Medicare Part D 
rebates, contractual rebates with Managed Care Organizations 
(“MCOs”), product returns, sales discounts (including trade 
discounts), distribution service fees, wholesaler chargebacks, and 
allowances for coupon and patient assistance programs. These 
deductions are recorded as reductions to revenue in the same 
period as the related sales are recognized. Estimates of future 
obligations are derived from historical experience adjusted to 
reflect known changes in the factors that impact such reserves. 
On the balance sheet the Company records wholesaler 
chargebacks and trade discounts as a reserve against accounts 
receivable, whereas all other sales deductions are recorded 
within current liabilities.
The Company has the following significant categories of sales 
deductions, all of which involve estimates and judgments which 
the Company considers to be critical accounting estimates, and 
require the Company to use information from external sources:
Medicaid and Managed Care Rebates
In the US, statutory and any supplemental rebates to State 
Medicaid agencies and contractual rebates to MCOs under 
managed care programs are based on statutory or negotiated 
discounts to the selling price. Medicaid rebates generally increase 
as a percentage of the selling price over the life of the product 
(if prices increase faster than general inflation).
It can take up to six months for information to reach the Company 
on actual usage of the Company’s products in managed care 
and Medicaid programs and on the total rebates to be reimbursed. 
Similarly, it can take some months before reimbursement claims 
are actually made by the Medicaid and Managed Care agencies. 
As a result the Company estimates the reserves required for 
amounts payable under these programs relating to sold products.
The amount of these reserves is based on historical experience of 
rebates, the timing of payments, the level of reimbursement claims, 
changes in prices (both normal selling prices and statutory or 
negotiated prices), changes in prescription demand patterns, 
projected product returns and the levels of inventory in the distribution 
channel. Adjustments are made for known changes in these 
factors, including changes in product lifecycle, on a quarterly basis.
Shire’s estimates of the level of inventory in the distribution channel 
are derived from product-by-product inventory data provided by 
wholesalers and results of independently commissioned retail 
inventory surveys. 
Revisions or clarification of guidelines from the CMS related to 
State Medicaid and other government program reimbursement 
practices with retroactive application can result in changes to 
management’s estimates of the rebates reported in prior periods.
The accrual estimation process for Medicaid and managed care 
rebates involves in each case a number of interrelating 
assumptions, which vary for each combination of product and 
Medicaid agency or MCO. Accordingly, it would not be meaningful 
to quantify the sensitivity to change for any individual assumption 
or uncertainty. However, Shire does not believe that the effect of 
these uncertainties, taken as a whole, significantly impacts the 
Company’s financial condition or results of operations. 
Aggregate accruals for Medicaid and MCO rebates at December 
31, 2015 and 2014 were $982 million and $882 million, or 16% and 
15%, respectively of net product sales. Historically, actual rebates 
have not varied significantly from the reserves provided.
Product Returns
The Company typically accepts customer product returns in the 
following circumstances: (a) expiration of shelf life; (b) product 
damaged while in Shire’s possession; (c) under sales terms that 
allow for unconditional return (guaranteed sales); or (d) following 
product recalls or product withdrawals. Generally, returns for 
expired product are accepted three months before and up to one 
year after expiration date of the relevant product and the returned 
product is destroyed. Depending on the product and the 
Company’s return policy with respect to that product, the 
Company may either refund the sales price paid by the customer 
by issuance of a credit, or exchange the returned product with 
replacement inventory. The Company typically does not provide 
cash refunds. 
Shire estimates the proportion of recorded revenue that will result 
in a return by considering relevant factors, including:
(i) past product returns activity;
(ii) the duration of time taken for products to be returned;
(iii) the estimated level of inventory in the distribution channel;
(iv) product recalls and discontinuances;
(v) the shelf life of products;
(vi) the launch of new drugs or new formulations; and
(vii) the loss of patent protection, exclusivity or new competition.
Shire’s estimates of the level of inventory in the distribution channel 
are based on product-by-product inventory data provided by 
wholesalers and results of independently commissioned third 
party retail inventory surveys.

3. Critical accounting estimates continued
Returns reserves for new products and for those products with 
generic (or authorized generic) competition generally require a 
higher level of estimation than those for established products 
without generic (or authorized generic) competition. 
For shipments made to support the commercial launch of a new 
product (which can include guaranteed sales), the Company’s 
policy is to defer recognition of the sales revenue until there is 
evidence of end-patient acceptance of the new product (primarily 
through third-party prescription data). For shipments after launch 
under standard terms (i.e. not guaranteed sales), the Company’s 
initial estimates of sales return accruals are primarily based on the 
historical sales returns experience of similar products shortly after 
launch. Once sufficient historical data on actual returns of the 
product are available, the returns provision is based on this data 
and any other relevant factors as noted above.
The Company estimates returns reserves for products with generic 
(or authorized generic) competition based on historical sales, the 
estimated level of inventory in the distribution channel, product 
utilization and rebate data, which are modified through the use 
of management judgment to take into account many factors, 
including, but not limited to, current market dynamics, changes 
in contract terms, changes in sales trends and product pricing. 
The accrual estimation process for product returns involves, in 
each case, a number of interrelating assumptions, which vary for 
each combination of product and customer. Accordingly, it would 
not be meaningful to quantify the sensitivity to change for any 
individual assumption or uncertainty. However, Shire does not 
believe that the effect of uncertainties, as a whole, significantly 
impacts the Company’s financial condition or results of operations. 
At December 31, 2015 and 2014, provisions for product returns 
were $128 million and $132 million or 2% and 2% respectively, 
of net product sales. Historically, actual returns have not varied 
significantly from the reserves provided.
(iii) Income Taxes
In accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, management is 
required to develop estimates as to whether a tax benefit should 
be recognized in the consolidated financial statements, based on 
whether it is more likely than not that the technical merits of the 
position will be sustained based on audit by the tax authorities. 
The measurement of the tax benefit recognized in the consolidated 
financial statements is based upon the largest amount of tax 
benefit that, in management’s judgment, is greater than 50% likely 
to be realized based on a cumulative probability assessment of the 
possible outcomes. In accounting for income tax uncertainties, 
management is required to make judgments in the determination 
of the unit of account, the evaluation of the facts, circumstances 
and information in respect of the tax position taken, together with 
the estimates of amounts that the Company may be required to 
pay in ultimate settlement with the tax authority.
Shire operates in numerous countries where its income tax returns 
are subject to audit and adjustment by local tax authorities. As Shire 
operates globally, the nature of the uncertain tax positions is often 
very complex and subject to change and the amounts at issue can 
be substantial. Shire develops its cumulative probability assessment 
to measure uncertain tax positions using internal expertise, 
experience and judgment, together with assistance from professional 
advisors. Original estimates are refined as additional information 
becomes known. For example, in the year to December 31, 2015 
the Company released certain provisions for uncertain tax 
positions totaling $36.2 million (2014: $221.1 million), primarily 
related to the conclusion of prior year audits in various territories.
These releases were partially offset by the recognition of 
additional provisions for uncertain tax positions of $48.8 million 
(2014: $84.5 million) in relation to ongoing compliance 
management for current and prior years. 
Any outcome upon settlement that differs from the recorded 
provision for uncertain tax positions may result in a materially 
higher or lower tax expense in future periods, which could 
significantly impact the Company’s results of operations or 
financial condition. However, the Company does not believe it is 
possible to reasonably estimate the potential impact of any such 
change in assumptions, estimates or judgments and the resultant 
change, if any, in the Company’s provision for uncertain tax 
positions, as any such change is dependent on factors such as 
future changes in tax law or administrative practice, the amount 
and nature of additional taxes which may be asserted by the 
taxation authorities, and the willingness of the relevant tax 
authorities to negotiate a settlement for any such position. 
At December 31, 2015 the Company recognized a liability 
of $216.3 million for total unrecognized tax benefits (2014: 
$207.8 million) and had accrued $26.5 million (2014: $25.8 million) 
for the payment of interest and penalties. The Company is 
required in certain tax jurisdictions to make advance deposits to 
tax authorities on receipt of a tax assessment. These payments 
are either offset against the income tax liability or establish an 
income tax receivable but do not reduce the provision for 
unrecognized tax benefits.
The Company has significant deferred tax assets due to various 
tax attributes, including net operating losses (“NOLs”) and tax 
credits from Research and Development principally in the Republic 
of Ireland, the US, Switzerland, Belgium, Germany and the UK. 
At December 31, 2015 the Company had gross deferred tax 
assets of $1,383.3 million (2014: $1,003.4 million), against which 
the Company had recorded valuation allowances of $416.1 million 
(2014: $324.7 million) and deferred tax liabilities of $3,052.1 million 
(2014: $1,432.5 million). 
The realization of these assets is not assured and is dependent on 
various factors. Management is required to exercise judgment in 
determining whether it is more likely than not that it would realize 
these deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation 
allowance, management weighs all available positive and negative 
evidence including cumulative losses in recent years, expectations 
of future taxable income, carry forward and carry back potential 
under relevant tax law, expiration period of tax attributes, taxable 
temporary differences, and prudent and feasible tax-planning 
strategies. A valuation allowance is established where there is 
an expectation that on the balance of probabilities management 
considers it is more likely than not that the relevant deferred tax 
assets will not be realized. If actual events differ from management’s 
estimates, or to the extent that these estimates are adjusted in the 
future, any changes to the valuation allowance could significantly 
impact the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.
(iv) Litigation and legal proceedings
The Company has a number of lawsuits pending. The Company’s 
principal pending legal and other proceedings are disclosed in 
Note 18, “Commitments and Contingencies, Legal and other 
proceedings” to the consolidated financial statements set forth in 
this Annual Report. The Company recognizes loss contingency 
provisions for probable losses when management is able to 
reasonably estimate the loss. When the estimated loss lies within 
a range, the Company records a loss contingency provision based 
on its best estimate of the probable loss. If no particular amount 
within that range is a better estimate than any other amount, 
the minimum amount is recorded. Estimates of losses may be 
126 Shire Annual Report 2015 developed substantially before the ultimate loss is known, and are 
therefore refined each accounting period as additional information 
becomes known. In instances where the Company is unable 
to develop a reasonable estimate of loss, no loss contingency 
provision is recorded at that time. As information becomes known 
a loss contingency provision is recorded when a reasonable 
estimate can be made. These estimates are reviewed quarterly 
and changed when expectations are revised. An outcome that 
deviates from the Company’s estimate may result in an additional 
expense (or credit) in a future accounting period. At December 31, 
2015 provisions for litigation losses, insurance claims and other 
disputes totaled $9.9 million (December 31, 2014: $16.9 million).
The outcomes of these proceedings are not always predictable 
and can be affected by various factors. For those legal and other 
proceedings for which it is considered at least reasonably possible 
that a loss has been incurred, the Company discloses the possible 
loss or range of possible loss in excess of the recorded loss 
contingency provision, if any, where such excess is both material 
and estimable. The estimation of the likelihood, amount and range 
of any loss arising from these proceedings requires significant 
judgment. Any revisions in the Company’s estimates, or outcomes 
upon settlement that deviate from the Company’s best estimate 
may result in an additional expense (or credit) in a future 
accounting period, which could materially impact the Company’s 
financial condition or results of operations. 
(v) Contingent consideration receivable from divestments of 
products or businesses
The Company is eligible to receive contingent consideration from 
Organogenesis and Noven in relation to the divestment of the 
Company’s DERMAGRAFT business and DAYTRANA product, 
respectively. At December 31, 2015 the Company has contingent 
consideration assets of $13.8 million (2014: $15.9 million). 
Consideration receivable by the Company on the divestment of 
product rights or businesses typically includes up-front receipts 
and/or milestones and royalties which are contingent on the 
outcome of future events (with such milestones and royalties 
being, for example, based upon the future sales performance 
of the divested product or business). Contingent consideration 
occasionally represents a significant proportion of the economic 
value receivable by the Company for a divested product or 
business. In these situations the Company initially recognizes this 
contingent consideration as an asset at its divestment date fair 
value, with re-measurement of this asset to its then current fair 
value at subsequent balance sheet dates.
The Company estimates the fair value of contingent consideration 
receivable using the income approach, based on a discounted 
cash flow method. This discounted cash flow approach uses 
significant unobservable Level 3 inputs (as defined in US GAAP) 
including: the probability weightings applied to different sales 
scenarios and related forecast future royalties receivable under 
scenarios developed by the Company; and the discount rate to 
be applied in calculating the present value of these forecast future 
cash flows. Significant judgment is employed by the Company 
in developing these estimates and assumptions. If actual events 
differ from management’s estimates, or to the extent that these 
estimates are adjusted in the future, the Company’s financial 
condition and results of operations could be affected in the 
period of any such change of estimate. 
(vi) Contingent consideration payable
The fair value of the Company’s contingent consideration payable 
at December 31, 2015 was $475.9 million (December 31, 2014: 
$629.9 million).
Contingent consideration payable represents (i) future milestones 
the Company may be required to pay in conjunction with various 
business combinations and (ii) future royalties payable as a result 
of certain business combinations and licenses. The amounts ultimately 
payable by Shire are dependent upon (i) the successful achievement 
of the relevant milestones and (ii) future net sales of the relevant 
products over the life of the milestone or royalty term respectively. 
The Company re-measures its contingent consideration payable 
to its then current fair value at each balance sheet date. Gains 
or losses arising on changes to the fair value of contingent 
consideration payable are recorded within Integration and acquisition 
costs in the Company’s consolidated statement of income. 
The Company estimates the fair value of contingent consideration 
payable using the income approach, based on a discounted cash 
flow method. The discounted cash flow method uses significant 
unobservable Level 3 inputs (as defined under US GAAP), including: 
the probability of, and period in which, the relevant milestone event 
is expected to be achieved; the amount of royalties that will be 
payable based on forecast net sales of the relevant products; and 
the discount rates to be applied in calculating the present values of 
the relevant milestone or royalty. Significant judgment is employed 
by the Company in developing these estimates and assumptions. 
If actual events differ from management’s estimates, or to the 
extent that these estimates are adjusted in the future, the 
Company’s financial condition and results of operations could be 
materially affected in the period of any such change of estimate.
(vii) Assets held for sale
Assets held for sale comprise noncurrent assets or disposal 
groups (together with any liabilities), the carrying amounts of which 
will be realized principally through a sale transaction expected to 
conclude within the next twelve months, rather than through 
continued use. 
At December 31, 2015 and 2014 the Company had no assets 
classified as held for sale. 
Significant judgment is employed by the Company in assessing: 
at what point all the held for sale presentation conditions are met 
for the disposal group; whether it is necessary to allocate goodwill 
to the disposal group; and estimating both the fair value of the 
disposal group and the incremental costs to transact a sale of 
the disposal group. If actual events differ from management’s 
estimates, or to the extent that estimates of selling price or costs 
to sell are adjusted in the future, the Company’s financial condition 
and results of operations could be affected in the period of any 
such change of estimate.

4. Business combinations
Proposed combination with Baxalta Incorporated (“Baxalta”)
On January 11, 2016 Shire announced that the Boards of Directors 
of Shire and Baxalta had agreed on the terms of a recommended 
combination of Shire with Baxalta. Under the terms of the agreement, 
Baxalta shareholders will receive $18.00 in cash and 0.1482 Shire 
ADSs per Baxalta share. Based on Shire’s closing ADS price on 
January 8, 2016, this implies a total value of $45.57 per Baxalta 
share, representing an aggregate consideration of approximately 
$32 billion. 
Baxalta is a global biopharmaceutical company that focuses on 
developing, manufacturing and commercializing therapies for 
orphan diseases and underserved conditions in hematology, 
oncology and immunology.
Closing of the transaction is subject to approval by Shire and 
Baxalta shareholders, certain regulatory approvals, redelivery 
of tax opinions initially delivered at signing and other customary 
closing conditions and representations. The transaction is a class 
1 transaction for Shire for the purposes of the UK Listing Rules 
and requires the approval of Shire shareholders. A shareholder 
circular, together with notice of the relevant shareholder meeting, 
will be distributed to Shire shareholders in due course. The parties 
expect the transaction to close mid-2016.
Acquisition of Dyax Corp. (“Dyax”)
On January 22, 2016 Shire acquired all of the outstanding share 
capital of Dyax for $37.30 per share in cash. Under the terms of 
the merger agreement Dyax shareholders may receive additional 
value through a non-tradable contingent value right worth $4.00 
per share, payable subject to FDA approval of DX-2930. 
Dyax was a publicly traded, Massachusetts-based rare disease 
biopharmaceutical company primarily focused on the development 
of plasma kallikrein (pKal) inhibitors for the treatment of HAE. 
Dyax’s most advanced clinical program is SHP643 (formerly 
DX-2930), a Phase 3 program with the potential for improved 
efficacy and convenience for HAE patients. SHP643 has received 
Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy, and Orphan Drug designations 
by the FDA and has also received Orphan Drug status in the EU. 
Dyax also brings the marketed product, KALBITOR, a plasma 
kallikrein inhibitor for the treatment of acute attacks of HAE in 
patients 12 years of age and older.
The acquisition of Dyax will be accounted for as a business 
combination using the acquisition method. The preliminary 
acquisition-date fair value consideration is $6,330.0 million, 
comprising cash paid on closing of $5,934.0 million and the 
preliminary fair value of the contingent value right of $396.0 million 
(maximum payable $646.0 million). The assets acquired and the 
liabilities assumed from Dyax will be recorded at the date of 
acquisition, at their fair value. Shire’s consolidated financial 
statements will reflect these fair values at, and the results of 
Dyax will be included in Shire’s consolidated statement of income 
from, January 22, 2016. As the initial accounting for the business 
combination has not yet been completed, further disclosure 
relating to this acquisition will be included in the Company’s 
Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2016.
In the year to December 31, 2015 the Company expensed costs of 
$13.2 million (2014: $nil) relating to the acquisition of Dyax, which 
have been recorded within integration and acquisition costs in the 
Company’s consolidated income statement.
Acquisition of NPS Pharma 
On February 21, 2015 Shire completed its acquisition of 100% of 
the outstanding share capital of NPS Pharma. The acquisition-date 
fair value of cash consideration paid on closing was $5,220 million. 
The acquisition of NPS Pharma added GATTEX/REVESTIVE, 
approved in the US and EU for the treatment of adults with Short 
Bowel Syndrome (“SBS”) who are dependent on parenteral 
support, a rare and potentially fatal gastrointestinal disorder and 
NATPARA/NATPAR approved in the US and indicated as an 
adjunct to calcium and vitamin D to control hypocalcemia in 
patients with HPT, a rare endocrine disease, to Shire’s portfolio 
of currently marketed products.
The acquisition of NPS Pharma has been accounted for as a 
business combination using the acquisition method. The assets 
acquired and the liabilities assumed from NPS Pharma have been 
recorded at their preliminary fair values at the date of acquisition, 
being February 21, 2015. The Company’s consolidated financial 
statements include the results of NPS Pharma from February 21, 2015. 
The amount of NPS Pharma’s post-acquisition revenues and 
pre-tax losses included in the Company’s consolidated statement 
of income for the year to December 31, 2015 were $285.9 million 
and $96.7 million respectively. The pre-tax loss includes charges 
relating to the unwind of inventory fair value adjustments of 
$29.8 million, intangible asset amortization of $260.3 million 
and integration costs of $90.1 million.
The purchase price allocation was finalized in the fourth quarter 
of 2015. The Company’s allocation of the purchase price to the 
fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including 
measurement period adjustments recorded during 2015, 
is outlined below:

128 Shire Annual Report 2015 (a) Other intangible assets — currently marketed products
Other intangible assets totaling $4,640.0 million relate to 
intellectual property rights acquired for NPS Pharma’s currently 
marketed products, primarily attributed to NATPARA/NATPAR 
and GATTEX/REVESTIVE. The fair value of the currently marketed 
products is and has been estimated using an income approach, 
based on the present value of incremental after tax cash flows 
attributable to each separately identifiable intangible asset.
The estimated useful lives of the NATPARA/NATPAR and GATTEX/
REVESTIVE intangible assets are 24 years, with amortization being 
recorded on a straight-line basis.
(b) Other intangible assets — Royalty rights
Other intangibles totaling $353.0 million relate to the royalty rights 
arising from the collaboration agreements with Amgen, Janssen 
and Kyowa Hakko Kirin. Amgen markets cinacalcet HCl as SENSIPAR 
in the US and as MIMPARA in the EU; Janssen Pharmaceuticals 
markets tapentadol as Nucynta in the US; and Kyowa Hakko Kirin 
markets cinacalcet HCI as REGPARA in Japan, Hong Kong, 
Malaysia, Macau, Singapore, and Taiwan. NPS Pharma is entitled 
to royalties from the relevant net sales of these products.
The fair value of these royalty rights has been estimated using an 
income approach, based on the present value of incremental after 
tax cash flows attributable to each royalty right.
The estimated useful lives of these royalty rights range from four 
to five years (weighted average four years), with amortization being 
recorded on a straight-line basis.
(c) Goodwill
Goodwill arising of $1,551.0 million, which is not deductible for tax 
purposes, includes the expected synergies that will result from 
combining the operations of NPS Pharma with the operations of 
Shire, particularly those synergies expected to be realized due to 
Shire’s structure; intangible assets that do not qualify for separate 
recognition at the time of the acquisition; and the value of the 
assembled workforce. 
In the year to December 31, 2015 the Company expensed costs 
of $144.5 million (2014: $nil) relating to the acquisition and 
post-acquisition integration of NPS Pharma, which have been 
recorded within Integration and acquisition costs in the Company’s 
consolidated statement of income.

amortization of the fair value of identifiable intangible assets 
acquired and the elimination of NPS Pharma’s historical 
intangible asset amortization expense.
The adjustments above are stated net of their tax effects, 
where applicable.
Acquisition of Foresight Biotherapeutics, Inc. (“Foresight”)
On July 30, 2015 Shire completed the acquisition of 100% of the 
outstanding share capital of Foresight, a privately owned company 
incorporated in New York. The acquisition-date fair value of cash 
consideration, which was paid on closing, was $298.8 million.
With this acquisition, Shire acquired the global rights to SHP640 
(formerly FST-100), a Phase-3 ready therapy for the treatment of 
infectious conjunctivitis, an ocular surface condition commonly 
referred to as pink eye. 
The acquisition of Foresight has been accounted for as a business 
combination using the acquisition method. The assets and 
liabilities acquired from Foresight have been recorded at their 
preliminary fair values at the date of acquisition, being July 30, 
2015. The Company’s consolidated financial statements include 
the results of Foresight from July 30, 2015.
The purchase price allocation is preliminary pending the 
determination of the fair values of certain assets and liabilities. 
The purchase price has been allocated on a preliminary basis to 
the SHP640 IPR&D intangible asset ($300.0 million), net current 
assets assumed ($3.0 million), net non-current liabilities assumed 
(including deferred tax liabilities) ($116.6 million) and goodwill 
($112.4 million). Goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.

Acquisition of Solpharm d.o.o (“Solpharm”)
On September 28, 2015 Shire completed the acquisition of 100% 
of the outstanding share capital of Solpharm, a privately-owned 
company incorporated in Croatia. The acquisition-date fair value of 
consideration was $5.2 million, comprising cash paid on closing of 
$4.5 million and the fair value of contingent consideration payable 
of $0.7 million (maximum payable $3.1 million dependent upon 
achievement of post-closing milestones). Shire has preliminarily 
allocated the purchase price to goodwill ($4.4 million) and other 
net assets ($0.8 million).
Unaudited pro forma financial information to present the combined 
results of operations of Shire and Solpharm is not provided as the 
impact of this acquisition is not material to the Company’s results 
of operations for any period presented.
Acquisition of Meritage Pharma Inc. (“Meritage”)
Prior to the acquisition of ViroPharma Incorporated (“ViroPharma”) 
by Shire (see below), ViroPharma had entered into an exclusive 
development and option agreement with Meritage, a privately 
owned US company focusing on developing oral budesonide 
suspension (“OBS”) as a treatment for eosinophilic esophagitis. 
Under the terms of this agreement Meritage controlled and 
conducted all related research up to achievement of pre-defined 
development success criteria at which point ViroPharma had the 
option to acquire Meritage. 
On February 18, 2015, following the exercise of the purchase 
option, Shire acquired all the outstanding equity of Meritage. 
The acquisition date fair value of the consideration totaled 
$166.9 million, comprising cash consideration paid on closing of 
$74.8 million and the fair value of contingent consideration payable 
of $92.1 million. The maximum amount of contingent cash 
consideration which may be payable by Shire in future periods 
is $175.0 million dependent upon achievement of certain clinical 
development and regulatory milestones. 
With the Meritage acquisition, Shire has acquired the global rights 
to Meritage’s Phase 3-ready compound, OBS (now SHP621), for 
the treatment of adolescents and adults with eosinophilic 
esophagitis.
The acquisition of Meritage has been accounted for as a business 
combination using the acquisition method. The assets and 
liabilities assumed from Meritage have been recorded at their fair 
values at the date of acquisition, being February 18, 2015. The 
Company’s consolidated financial statements and results of 
operations include the results of Meritage from February 18, 2015.
The purchase price allocation is final. The purchase price has 
been allocated to acquired SHP621 IPR&D intangible asset 
($175.0 million), net current assets assumed ($5.5 million), net 
non-current liabilities assumed (including deferred tax liabilities) 
($45.9 million) and goodwill ($32.3 million). Goodwill is not 
deductible for tax purposes. 
Unaudited pro forma financial information to present the combined 
results of operations of Shire and Meritage is not provided as the 
impact of this acquisition is not material to the Company’s results 
of operations for any period presented.
Acquisition of ViroPharma 
On January 24, 2014 Shire completed its acquisition of 100% of 
the outstanding share capital of ViroPharma. The acquisition-date 
fair value of cash consideration paid on closing was $3,997 million. 
The acquisition of ViroPharma added CINRYZE to Shire’s portfolio 
of currently marketed products. CINRYZE is a leading brand for 
the prophylactic treatment of Hereditary Angioedema (“HAE”) in 
adolescents and adults. 
The acquisition of ViroPharma has been accounted for as a 
business combination using the acquisition method. The assets 
acquired and the liabilities assumed from ViroPharma have been 
recorded at their fair values at the date of acquisition, being 
January 24, 2014. The Company’s consolidated financial statements 
include the results of ViroPharma from January 24, 2014. 
The purchase price allocation was finalized in the fourth quarter of 
2014. The Company’s allocation of the purchase price to the fair

130 Shire Annual Report 2015 (a) Other intangible assets — currently marketed products
Other intangible assets totaled $2,320.0 million at the date of 
acquisition, relating to intellectual property rights acquired for 
ViroPharma’s then currently marketed products, primarily 
attributed to CINRYZE, for the routine prophylaxis against HAE 
attacks in adolescent and adult patients. Shire also obtained 
intellectual property rights to three other commercialized products, 
PLENADREN, an orphan drug for the treatment of adrenal 
insufficiency in adults, BUCCOLAM, an oromucosal solution for 
the treatment of prolonged, acute, and convulsive seizures in 
infants, toddlers, children and adolescents and VANCOCIN, an 
oral capsule formulation for the treatment of C. difficile-associated 
diarrhea (“CDAD”), which was divested by Shire in the third quarter 
of 2014. The fair value of currently marketed products has been 
estimated using an income approach, based on the present value 
of incremental after tax cash flows attributable to each separately 
identifiable intangible asset.
The estimated useful lives of the CINRYZE, PLENADREN and 
BUCCOLAM intangible assets range from 10 to 23 years (weighted 
average 22 years), with amortization being recorded on a straight-
line basis.
(b) Other intangible assets — IPR&D
The IPR&D asset of $315.0 million relates to maribavir (now 
SHP620), an investigational antiviral product for cytomegalovirus. 
The fair value of this IPR&D asset was estimated based on an 
income approach, using the present value of incremental after tax 
cash flows expected to be generated by this development project 
after the deduction of contributory asset charges for other assets 
employed in this project. The estimated cash flows have been 
probability adjusted to take into account the stage of completion 
and the remaining risks and uncertainties surrounding the future 
development and commercialization. 
The major risks and uncertainties associated with the timely 
completion of the acquired IPR&D project include the ability to 
confirm the efficacy of the technology based on the data from 
clinical trials, and obtaining the relevant regulatory approvals as 
well as other risks as described in this Annual Report. The valuation 
of IPR&D has been based on information available at the time of 
the acquisition (and information obtained during the measurement 
period) and on expectations and assumptions that (i) have been 
deemed reasonable by the Company’s management and (ii) are 
based on information, expectations and assumptions that would 
be available to a market participant. However, no assurance can 
be given that the assumptions and events associated with such 
assets will occur as projected. For these reasons, the actual cash 
flows may vary from forecast future cash flows.
The estimated probability adjusted after tax cash flows used in 
fair valuing other intangible assets have been discounted at rates 
ranging from 9.5% to 10.0%.
(c) Goodwill
Goodwill arising of $1,655.5 million, which is not deductible for tax 
purposes, includes the expected operational synergies that will 
result from combining the commercial operations of ViroPharma 
with those of Shire; other synergies expected to be realized due to 
Shire’s structure; intangible assets that do not qualify for separate 
recognition at the time of the acquisition; and the value of the 
assembled workforce.
Acquisition of Lumena Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Lumena”)
On June 11, 2014 Shire completed the acquisition of 100% of 
the outstanding share capital of Lumena, a privately owned US 
incorporated biopharmaceutical company. The acquisition date fair 
value of the consideration totaled $464.3 million, comprising cash 
consideration paid on closing of $300.3 million and the fair value 
of  contingent consideration payable of $164 million. In the year to 
December 31, 2015 Shire settled all future contingent milestones 
payable for a one-time cash payment of $90 million. 
This acquisition brought two novel, orally active therapeutic 
compounds SHP625 (formerly LUM001) and SHP626 (formerly 
LUM002). Both compounds are inhibitors of the apical sodium-
dependent bile acid transport (“ASBT”), which is primarily 
responsible for recycling bile acids from the intestine to the liver. 
At acquisition date SHP625 was being investigated for the 
potential relief of the extreme itching associated with cholestatic 
liver disease and three other indications. In the year to December 
31, 2015 Shire fully impaired the SHP625 IPR&D intangible asset 
(see Note 13 for further details). SHP626 is in development for the 
treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.
The acquisition of Lumena has been accounted for as a business 
combination using the acquisition method. The assets and 
liabilities assumed from Lumena have been recorded at their fair 
values at the date of acquisition, being June 11, 2014. The 
Company’s consolidated financial statements and results of 
operations include the results of Lumena from June 11, 2014.
The purchase price has been allocated to acquired IPR&D 
($467 million), net current assets assumed ($52.6 million, including 
cash of $46.3 million), net non-current liabilities assumed (including 
deferred tax liabilities) ($169.9 million) and goodwill ($114.6 million). 
Goodwill arising of $114.6 million is not deductible for tax purposes. 
Acquisition of Fibrotech Therapeutics Pty Ltd. (“Fibrotech”)
On July 4, 2014 Shire completed its acquisition of Fibrotech, an 
Australian biopharmaceutical company developing a new class 
of orally available drugs with a novel mechanism of action which 
has the potential to address both the inflammatory and fibrotic 
components of disease processes. The acquisition of Fibrotech 
is expected to strengthen the Company’s growing and innovative 
portfolio targeting renal and fibrotic diseases, and leverage existing 
renal capabilities.
The acquisition date fair value of the consideration totaled 
$122.6 million, comprising cash consideration paid on closing 
of $75.6 million and the fair value of contingent consideration 
payable of $47 million. The maximum amount of contingent cash 
consideration which may be payable by Shire in future periods is 
$482.5 million dependent upon achievement of certain clinical 
development, regulatory and commercial milestones. 
The acquisition of Fibrotech has been accounted for as a business 
combination using the acquisition method. The assets and 
liabilities assumed from Fibrotech have been recorded at their 
fair values at the date of acquisition being July 4, 2014. The 
Company’s consolidated financial statements and results of 
operations include the results of Fibrotech from July 4, 2014.

4. Business combinations continued
The purchase price has been allocated to acquired IPR&D 
($11 million), net current assets ($1.4 million) and goodwill 
($110.2 million). Goodwill arising of $110.2 million is not deductible 
for tax purposes. Goodwill generated from the acquisition was 
primarily attributed to acquired scientific knowledge in fibrotic 
diseases and the potential to optimize the novel mechanism of 
action to other fibrotic conditions.
Other Acquisitions 
On July 9, 2014 Shire acquired BIKAM Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
(“BIKAM”), a US-based biopharmaceutical company with pre-
clinical compounds that could provide an innovative approach 
to treating autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP). In 
the third quarter of 2014 Shire also acquired certain assets and 
employees related to the production of BUCCOLAM from its 
previous contract manufacturer SCM Pharma Limited (“SCM”). 
The aggregate acquisition date fair value of the consideration for 
these two acquisitions was $17.9 million, comprising cash paid 
on closing of $12.1 million and the fair value of contingent 
consideration payable in respect of BIKAM of $5.8 million. In 
respect of BIKAM following achievement and payment of the first 
development milestone in the year ended December 31, 2015, 
the maximum contingent consideration which may now be payable 
by Shire in future periods is $89.5 million contingent upon the 
achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial 
milestones. 
In connection with these two acquisitions, Shire has recorded 
$1 million in current assets, $4.8 million in non-current assets and 
$12.1 million in goodwill. 
Acquisition of SARcode Bioscience Inc. (“SARcode”)
On April 17, 2013 Shire completed the acquisition of 100% of the 
outstanding share capital of SARcode. The acquisition date fair 
value of consideration totaled $368 million, comprising cash 
consideration paid on closing of $151 million and the acquisition 
date fair value of contingent consideration payable of $217 million. 
Following top-line Phase 3 study results in December 2013, the 
maximum amount of contingent cash consideration which may 
now be payable by Shire in future periods is $225 million 
dependent upon achievement of certain net sales milestones. 
This acquisition brought the global rights of lifitegrast (now 
SHP606) into Shire’s portfolio which, at acquisition date, was in 
Phase 3 development for the treatment of DED. 
Top-line results from OPUS-2, a Phase 3 efficacy and safety 
study of 5.0% SHP606 ophthalmic solution, were announced on 
December 6, 2013. On April 30, 2014 Shire announced top-line 
results from the prospective randomized, double-masked, 
placebo-controlled SONATA trial which indicated no ocular or 
drug-related serious adverse events. Following a meeting with the 
FDA, on May 16, 2014 Shire announced that it intended to submit 
an NDA for SHP606 in the first quarter of 2015 as a treatment for 
signs and symptoms for DED in adults. On April 9, 2015 Shire 
announced that the FDA had accepted the NDA and had granted 
the NDA Priority Review designation. The FDA set an action date 
of October 25, 2015, based on the Prescription Drug User Fee Act 
V (”PDUFA”).
On October 16, 2015 the FDA requested an additional clinical 
study as part of a complete response letter to the NDA. The FDA 
also requested more information related to product quality. On 
October 27, 2015, Shire announced positive topline results from 
the OPUS-3 trial. These data showed OPUS-3 met the primary 
endpoint of significantly improving patient-reported symptoms of 
DED from baseline to day 84 (p=0.0007). Additionally, OPUS-3 met 
the secondary endpoints of symptom improvement from baseline 
to days 14 and 42 (p<0.0001 for both endpoints). Shire used these 
data as part of the resubmission of the NDA on January 22, 2016. 
On February 4, 2016, Shire announced that the FDA had 
acknowledged receipt of the resubmission of the NDA. The FDA 
determined that the submission was a complete response and has 
assigned a 6-month review period for the NDA and a PDUFA date 
of July 22, 2016.
The acquisition of SARcode has been accounted for as a business 
combination using the acquisition method. The assets and 
liabilities assumed from SARcode have been recorded at their 
fair values at the date of acquisition, being April 17, 2013. The 
Company’s consolidated financial statements and results of 
operations include the results of SARcode from April 17, 2013. 
The purchase price has been allocated to acquired IPR&D in 
respect of SHP606 ($412 million), net current liabilities assumed 
($8.2 million), net non-current liabilities assumed, including 
deferred tax liabilities ($122.4 million) and goodwill ($86.6 million). 
This acquisition resulted in goodwill of $86.6 million, which is not 
deductible for tax purposes. Goodwill includes the value of the 
assembled workforce and the related scientific expertise in 
ophthalmology which allows for potential expansion into a new 
therapeutic area. 
Acquisition of Premacure AB (“Premacure”)
On March 8, 2013 Shire completed the acquisition of 100% of 
the outstanding share capital of Premacure, a privately-owned 
Swedish biotechnology company. The acquisition date fair value 
of the consideration totaled $140.2 million, comprising cash 
consideration paid on closing of $30.6 million, and the fair value of 
contingent consideration payable of $109.6 million. The maximum 
amount of contingent cash consideration which may be payable 
by Shire in future periods, dependent upon the successful 
completion of certain development and commercial milestones, 
is $169 million. Shire will also pay royalties on relevant net sales.
Premacure was developing a protein replacement therapy 
SHP607 (formerly referred to as “PREMIPLEX”) currently in Phase 2 
development, for the prevention of Retinopathy of Prematurity 
(“ROP”). ROP is a rare and potentially blinding eye disorder that 
primarily affects premature infants and is one of the most common 
causes of visual loss in childhood. Together, the acquisitions of 
SARcode and Premacure build Shire’s presence in the ophthalmic 
therapeutic area. In December 2014 Shire received notification that 
SHP607 was granted fast Track designation by the FDA. In 
addition, SHP607 has been granted orphan drug designation in 
both the US and EU. A Phase 2 clinical trial completed enrollment 
in December 2015.
The acquisition of Premacure has been accounted for as a 
business combination using the acquisition method. The assets 
and the liabilities assumed from Premacure have been recorded 
at their fair values at the date of acquisition, being March 8, 2013. 
The Company’s consolidated financial statements and results of 
operations include the results of Premacure from March 8, 2013.
132 Shire Annual Report 2015 The purchase price has been allocated to acquired IPR&D in 
respect of SHP607 ($151.8 million), net current liabilities assumed 
($11.7 million), net non-current liabilities assumed, including 
deferred tax liabilities ($29.5 million) and goodwill ($29.6 million). 
This acquisition resulted in goodwill of $29.6 million, which is not 
deductible for tax purposes. 
Acquisition of Lotus Tissue Repair, Inc. (“Lotus Tissue Repair”)
On February 12, 2013 Shire completed the acquisition of 100% of 
the outstanding share capital of Lotus Tissue Repair, a privately-
owned US biotechnology company. The acquisition date fair 
value of consideration totaled $174.2 million, comprising cash 
consideration paid on closing of $49.4 million, and the fair value of 
contingent consideration payable of $124.8 million. The maximum 
amount of contingent cash consideration which may be payable 
by Shire in future periods is $275 million. The amount of 
contingent cash consideration ultimately payable by Shire is 
dependent upon achievement of certain pre-clinical and clinical 
development milestones.
Lotus Tissue Repair was developing a proprietary recombinant 
form of human collagen Type VII (“rC7”) as the first and only 
intravenous protein replacement therapy currently being 
investigated for the treatment of Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa 
(“DEB”). DEB is a devastating orphan disease for which there is 
no currently approved treatment option other than palliative care. 
The acquisition added to Shire’s pipeline a late-stage pre-clinical 
product for the treatment of DEB with global rights. In the year 
to December 31, 2015 Shire fully impaired the SHP608 IPR&D 
intangible asset (see Note 13 for further details).
The acquisition of Lotus Tissue Repair has been accounted for 
as a business combination using the acquisition method. The 
assets and the liabilities assumed from Lotus Tissue Repair have 
been recorded at their fair values at the date of acquisition, 
being February 12, 2013. The Company’s consolidated financial 
statements and results of operations include the results of Lotus 
Tissue Repair from February 12, 2013. 
The purchase price has been allocated to acquired IPR&D in 
respect of rC7, now SHP608 ($176.7 million), net current assets 
assumed ($6.8 million), net non-current liabilities assumed, 
including deferred tax liabilities ($63.4 million) and goodwill 
($54.1 million). This acquisition resulted in goodwill of $54.1 million, 
which is not deductible for tax purposes.
5. Reorganization costs
One Shire business reorganization
On May 2, 2013, the Company initiated the reorganization of its 
business to integrate the three divisions into a simplified One Shire 
organization in order to drive future growth and innovation. 
In 2014 certain aspects of the One Shire program were temporarily 
put on hold due to AbbVie’s offer for Shire, which was terminated 
in October 2014. Subsequent to the termination of AbbVie’s offer, 
Shire announced on November 10, 2014 its plans to relocate over 
500 positions to Lexington, Massachusetts from its Chesterbrook, 
Pennsylvania, site and establish Lexington as the Company’s US 
operational headquarters in continuation of the One Shire 
efficiency program. This relocation will streamline business globally 
through two principal locations, Massachusetts and Switzerland, 
with support from regional and country-based offices around 
the world.
In the year to December 31, 2015 the Company incurred 
reorganization costs totaling $97.9 million respectively, relating to 
employee involuntary termination benefits and other reorganization 
costs. Reorganization costs of $343.4 million have been incurred 
since the reorganization began in May 2013. The One Shire 
reorganization is now substantially complete. The Company 
estimates that further costs in respect of the One Shire 
reorganization of approximately $50 million will be expensed 
as incurred during the first half of 2016.
The liability for reorganization costs arising from the One Shire 
business reorganization at December 31, 2015 is as follows:

At December 31, 2015 the closing reorganization cost liability was 
recorded within accounts payable and accrued expenses.
6. Integration and acquisition costs
For the year to December 31, 2015 Shire recorded net integration 
and acquisition costs of $39.8 million. The net integration and 
acquisition costs principally comprises costs related to the 
acquisition and integration of NPS Pharma, Viropharma, Dyax and 
the proposed combination with Baxalta ($189.7 million), offset by 
a net credit relating to the change in the fair value of contingent 
consideration liabilities ($149.9 million). This net credit principally 
relates to the acquisition of Lumena, reflecting the agreement in 
the third quarter of 2015 to settle all future contingent milestones 
payable to former Lumena shareholders for a one-time cash 
payment of $90 million and the acquisition of Lotus Tissue Repair, 
Inc. reflecting a lower probability of success for the SHP608 asset 
(for the treatment of Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (“DEB”)) 
as a result of certain preclinical toxicity findings (see note 13 for 
further details).
In the year to December 31, 2014 Shire recorded integration and 
acquisition costs of $158.8 million, comprised of $144.1 million 
relating to the acquisition and integration of ViroPharma and a 
net charge of $14.7 million relating to the change in fair value of 
contingent consideration liabilities (principally in relation to the 
acquisition of SARcode Bioscience Inc. (“SARcode”), reflecting 
Shire’s increased confidence in the SHP606 asset, offset by 
credits in relation to the acquisition of FerroKin BioSciences, Inc., 
reflecting the decision to place the Phase 2 clinical trial for SHP602 
on clinical hold).

Following the divestment of the Company’s DERMAGRAFT 
business in January 2014, the operating results associated with 
the DERMAGRAFT business have been classified as discontinued 
operations in the consolidated statements of income for all periods 
presented. In the year to December 31, 2015 the Company 
recorded a loss from discontinued operations of $34.1 million (net 
of tax of $18.9 million), primarily relating to a change in estimate in 
relation to reserves for onerous leases retained by the Company. 
In the year to December 31, 2014 the Company recorded a gain 
from discontinued operations of $122.7 million (net of tax of 
$211.3 million). The gain from discontinued operations in the year 
to December 31, 2014 includes a tax credit of $211.3 million 
primarily driven by a tax benefit arising following a reorganization 
of the former Regenerative Medicine business undertaken in the 
fourth quarter of 2014, associated with the divestment of the 
DERMAGRAFT business in the first quarter of 2014. This gain 
was partially offset by costs associated with the divestment of the 
DERMAGRAFT business, including a loss on re-measurement of 
contingent consideration receivable from Organogenesis to its 
fair value.

As at December 31, 9,173.3 4,934.4 
In the year to December 31, 2015 the Company acquired 
intangible assets totaling $5,475 million, primarily relating to the 
fair value of intangible assets for currently marketed products and 
royalty right assets acquired with NPS Pharma of $4,993 million 
and IPR&D assets of $475 million acquired with Meritage and 
Foresight (see Note 4 for further details).
The Company reviews its intangible assets for impairment 
whenever events or circumstances suggest that their carrying 
value may not be recoverable. In the year to December 31, 2015 
the Company identified indicators of impairment in respect of its 
SHP625 (for the treatment of cholestatic liver disease), and 
SHP608 (for the treatment of DEB) IPR&D assets. 
The indicators of impairment related to SHP625 in 2015 included 
the results of three Phase 2 studies, comprising a 13-week study 
of 20 paediatric patients with Alagille syndrome (“ALGS”), a 13 
week, double blind, placebo-controlled trial in combination with 
ursodeoxycholic acid (“UDCA”) for patients with Primary Biliary 
Cirrhosis (“PBC”), and preliminary results from a 72 week open 
label Phase 2 study in Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis 
(“PFIC”). Although both the ALGS and PBC trials indicated a 
reduction in bile serum acids in the SHP625 treated group, neither 
of these trials met their primary or secondary endpoints. The 
interim analysis in the PFIC trial was based on the first 12 subjects 
who completed 13 weeks of treatment per protocol. There was no 
statistically significant reduction in mean serum bile acid levels 
from baseline. Following receipt of these results, the Company 
also updated its revenue and profitability forecasts for ALGS 
and PFIC.
As a result of these impairment indicators, the Company reviewed 
the recoverability of its SHP625 IPR&D asset and recorded 
impairment charges totaling $467 million (within R&D expenses 
in the consolidated statement of income) in 2015, to record the 
SHP625 IPR&D asset to its revised fair value of $nil. This fair 
value was based on the revised discounted cash flow forecasts 
associated with SHP625, which included a reduced probability 
of achieving regulatory approval.
For SHP608, preclinical toxicity findings in the second quarter 
of 2015 have led to a significant reduction in the probability of 
achieving regulatory approval of this asset. As a result, the 
Company recorded an impairment charge of $176.7 million within 
R&D expenses in the consolidated statement of income to fully 
write off the SHP608 IPR&D asset.
The fair values of the related contingent consideration liabilities 
arising from the Lumena and Lotus Tissue Repair acquisitions 
(through which Shire acquired SHP625 and SHP608 respectively) 
have also been reduced, resulting in a credit of $203.2 million 
being recorded in Integration and acquisition costs for the year 
ended December 31, 2015.
In the year to December 31, 2014 the Company identified 
indicators of impairment in respect of its SHP602 (iron chelating 
agent for the treatment of iron overload secondary to chronic 
transfusion) and SHP613 (for the treatment of improvement in 
patency of arteriovenous access in hemodialysis patients) IPR&D 
assets. The Company therefore reviewed the recoverability of its 
SHP602 and SHP613 IPR&D assets and recorded an impairment 
charge of $166.0 million and $22.0 million, respectively, within R&D 
expenses in the consolidated statement of income to record the 
IPR&D assets to their revised fair value. 
Management estimates that the annual amortization charge in 
respect of intangible assets held at December 31, 2015 will be 
approximately $465 million for each of the five years to December 
31, 2020. Estimated amortization expense can be affected by 
various factors including future acquisitions, disposals of product 
rights, regulatory approval and subsequent amortization of acquired 
IPR&D projects, foreign exchange movements and the technological 
advancement and regulatory approval of competitor products.

Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement
On December 12, 2014, Shire entered into a $2,100 million 
revolving credit facilities agreement (the “RCF”) with a number of 
financial institutions, for which Abbey National Treasury Services 
PLC (trading as Santander Global Banking and Markets), Bank of 
America Merrill Lynch International Limited, Barclays Bank PLC, 
Citigroup Global Markets Limited, Lloyds Bank PLC, The Royal 
Bank of Scotland PLC and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation 
acted as mandated lead arrangers and bookrunners and DNB 
Bank ASA, The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., Credit Suisse 
AG, London Branch, Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A., Goldman 
Sachs Bank USA, Mizuho Bank, Ltd. and Morgan Stanley Bank 
International Limited acted as arrangers. Shire is an original 
borrower and original guarantor under the RCF. Shire has agreed 
to act as guarantor for any of its subsidiaries that become 
additional borrowers under the RCF. As at December 31, 2015 
the Company utilized $750 million of the RCF.
The RCF, which terminates on December 12, 2020, may be 
applied towards financing the general corporate purposes of Shire. 
The RCF incorporates a $250 million US dollar and euro swingline 
facility operating as a sub-limit thereof.
Interest on any loans made under the RCF is payable on the last 
day of each interest period, which may be one week or one, two, 
three or six months at the election of Shire, or as otherwise agreed 
with the lenders. The interest rate for the RCF is: LIBOR (or, in 
relation to any revolving loan in euro, EURIBOR); plus 0.30% per 
subject to change depending upon (i) the prevailing ratio of Net 
Debt to EBITDA (each as defined in the RCF) in respect of the 
most recently completed financial year or financial half year 
and (ii) the occurrence and continuation of an event of default 
in respect of the financial covenants or the failure to provide a 
compliance certificate.
Shire shall also pay (i) a commitment fee equal to 35% of the 
applicable margin on available commitments under the RCF for 
the availability period applicable thereto and (ii) a utilization fee 
equal to (a) 0.10% per year of the aggregate of all outstanding loans 
up to an aggregate base currency amount equal to $700 million, 
(b) 0.15% per year of the amount by which the aggregate base 
currency amount of all outstanding loans exceeds $700 million 
but is equal to or less than $1,400 million and (c) 0.30% per year 
of the amount by which the aggregate base currency amount of 
all outstanding loans exceeds $1,400 million.
The RCF includes customary representations and warranties, 
covenants and events of default, including requirements that 
Shire’s (i) ratio of Net Debt to EBITDA in respect of the most 
recently ended 12-month relevant period (each as defined in the 
RCF) must not, at any time, exceed 3.5:1 except that, following an 
acquisition fulfilling certain criteria, Shire may on a once only basis 
elect to increase this ratio to (a) 5.5:1 for the relevant period in 
which the acquisition was completed (b) 5.0:1 in respect of the 
first relevant period following the relevant period in which the 
acquisition was completed and (c) 4.5:1 in respect of the second 
relevant period following the relevant period in which the acquisition 
was completed, and (ii) ratio of EBITDA to Net Interest for the most 
recently ended 12-month relevant period (each as defined in the 
RCF) must not be less than 4.0:1.
The RCF restricts, subject to certain exceptions, Shire’s ability 
to incur additional financial indebtedness, grant security over 
its assets or provide loans/grant credit. Further, any lender may 
require mandatory prepayment of its participation if there is a 
change of control of Shire, subject to certain exceptions for 
schemes of arrangement and analogous schemes.
Events of default under the RCF include, subject to customary 
grace periods and materiality thresholds: (i) non-payment of any 
amounts due under the finance documents (as defined in the 
RCF), (ii) failure to satisfy any financial covenants, (iii) material 
misrepresentation in any of the finance documents, (iv) failure to 
pay, or certain other defaults, under other financial indebtedness, 
(v) certain insolvency events or proceedings, (vi) material adverse 
changes in the business, operations, assets or financial condition 
of Shire as a whole, (vii) if it becomes unlawful for Shire (or any 
successor parent company) or any of their respective subsidiaries 
that are parties to the RCF to perform their obligations thereunder 
or (viii) if Shire (or any successor parent company) or any 
subsidiary thereof which is a party to the RCF repudiates such 
agreement or other finance document, among others.
The RCF is governed by English law.

January 2015 Facility Agreement
On January 11, 2015, Shire entered into an $850 million term 
facility agreement with, among others, Citigroup Global Markets 
Limited (acting as mandated lead arranger and bookrunner) (the 
“January 2015 Facility Agreement”) with an original maturity date of 
January 10, 2016. The maturity date was subsequently extended 
to July 11, 2016 in line with the provisions within the January 2015 
Facility Agreement allowing the maturity date to be extended 
twice, at Shire’s option, by six months on each occasion. 
The January 2015 Facility Agreement was available to finance the 
purchase price payable in respect of Shire’s acquisition of NPS 
Pharma (including certain related costs). On September 28, 2015 
the Company reduced the January 2015 Facility Agreement by 
$100 million. As at December 31, 2015 the January 2015 Facility 
Agreement was fully utilized in the amount of $750 million. In 2016 
and at various points thereafter, the Company canceled parts of 
the January 2015 Facility Agreement. On February 22, 2016, the 
Company repaid in full the remaining balance of $100 million.
2013 Facilities Agreement
On November 11, 2013, Shire entered into a $2,600 million facilities 
agreement with, among others, Morgan Stanley Bank International 
Limited (acting as mandated lead arranger and bookrunner) 
(the “2013 Facilities Agreement”). The 2013 Facilities Agreement 
comprised two credit facilities: (i) a $1,750 million term loan facility 
and (ii) an $850 million term loan facility. 
On December 13, 2013 and at various points thereafter, the 
Company canceled parts of the 2013 Facilities Agreement. 
On September 28, 2015 the Company repaid in full the remaining 
balance of $350 million under the 2013 Facilities Agreement.
Secured Non-recourse Debts 
Prior to the acquisition by Shire, NPS Pharma had:
 > partially monetized rights to receive future royalty payments from 
Amgen’s sales of SENSIPAR and MIMPARA through the issuance 
of $145 million of non-recourse debt that was both serviced and 
secured by SENSIPAR and MIMPARA royalty revenue;
 > sold to DRI Capital Inc. (“DRI”) certain rights to receive up to 
$96 million of future royalty payments arising from Kyowa Hakko 
Kirin’s sales of REGPARA and granted DRI a security interest in 
the license agreement with Kyowa Hakko Kirin, certain patents 
and other intellectual property related to REGPARA which DRI 
would be entitled to enforce in the event of default by NPS 
Pharma; and
 > partially monetized PTH-184 (now marketed as NATPARA) 
through an agreement with an affiliate of DRI pursuant to which 
NPS Pharma, its licensees and its predecessors in interest, are 
obligated to pay up to $125 million royalties on sales of PTH-184. 
Additionally, NPS Pharma granted DRI a security interest in 
certain patents and other intellectual property related to PTH 
1-84 which DRI would be entitled to enforce in the event of 
default by NPS Pharma. 
Following the acquisition of NPS Pharma the Company has 
assumed these secured non-recourse debt obligations.
In May 2015 the Company notified Amgen that it intended to 
repay in full the remaining non-recourse debt owed to Amgen. 
The repayment was effected on May 15, 2015 by Amgen 
withholding certain royalties that were due to the Company from 
SENSIPAR and MIMPARA sales in the first quarter of 2015. 
As at December 31, 2015 $11.5 million has been included within 
Short-term borrowings, and $69.9 million has been included within 
Long-term borrowings in respect of the remaining obligations to DRI.
Short-term uncommitted lines of credit (“Credit lines”)
Shire has access to various Credit lines from a number of banks 
which provide flexibility to short-term cash management 
procedures. These Credit lines can be withdrawn by the banks 
at any time. The Credit lines are not relied upon for core liquidity. 
As at December 31, 2015 these Credit lines were not utilized.

agreement originally entered into in January 2012 to expedite the 
development of ZFP Therapeutics for hemophilia A and B and 
Huntington’s disease. Under the revised terms, Shire has returned 
to Sangamo the exclusive world-wide rights to gene targets for 
the development, clinical testing and commercialization of ZFP 
Therapeutics for hemophilia A and B, and has retained rights 
and will continue to develop ZFP Therapeutic clinical leads for 
Huntington’s disease and a ZFP Therapeutic for one additional 
gene target. Each company will be responsible for expenses 
associated with its own programs and will reimburse the other for 
any ongoing services provided. Sangamo has granted Shire a right 
of first negotiation to license the hemophilia A and B programs. 
No milestone payments will be made on any program and each 
company will pay certain royalties to the other on commercial 
sales up to a specified maximum cap.
As of December 31, 2015 Shire had entered into various other 
collaborative and out-licensing arrangements under which the 
Company has out-licensed certain product or intellectual property 
rights for consideration such as up-front payments, development 
milestones, sales milestones and/or royalty payments. In some 
of these arrangements Shire and the licensee are both actively 
involved in the development and commercialization of the licensed 
product and have exposure to risks and rewards dependent on 
its commercial success. Under the terms of these collaborative 
and out-licensing arrangements, the Company may receive 
development milestone payments up to an aggregate amount 
of $32 million and sales milestones up to an aggregate amount 
of $43 million. The receipt of these substantive milestones is 
uncertain and contingent on the achievement of certain development 
milestones or the achievement of a specified level of annual net 
sales by the licensee. In the year to December 31, 2015 Shire 
received cash in respect of up-front and milestone payments 
totaling $19.6 million (2014: $2.2 million). In the year to December 31, 
2015 Shire recognized milestone income of $8.9 million 
(2014: $16.7 million) in other revenues and $51.0 million 
(2014: $46.5 million) in product sales for shipment of product 
to the relevant licensee.
(d) Commitments
(i) Clinical testing 
At December 31, 2015 the Company had committed to pay 
approximately $490 million (December 31, 2014: $382 million) to 
contract vendors for administering and executing clinical trials. 
The timing of these payments is dependent upon actual services 
performed by the organizations as determined by patient 
enrollment levels and related activities.
(ii) Contract manufacturing
At December 31, 2015 the Company had committed to pay 
approximately $325 million (December 31, 2014: $384 million) in 
respect of contract manufacturing. The Company expects to pay 
$101 million of these commitments in 2016. 
(iii) Other purchasing commitments
At December 31, 2015 the Company had committed to pay 
approximately $485 million (December 31, 2014: $265 million) for 
future purchases of goods and services, predominantly relating to 
active pharmaceutical ingredients sourcing. The Company expects 
to pay $459 million of these commitments in 2016. 
(iv) Investment commitments
At December 31, 2015 the Company had outstanding commitments 
to subscribe for interests in companies and partnerships for amounts 
totaling $22 million (December 31, 2014: $67 million) which may 
all be payable in 2016, depending on the timing of capital calls. 
The investment commitments include additional funding to certain 
VIEs of which Shire is not the primary beneficiary. 
(v) Capital commitments
At December 31, 2015 the Company had committed to spend 
$60 million (December 31, 2014: $3 million) on capital projects.

18. Commitments and contingencies continued
(e) Legal and other proceedings
The Company expenses legal costs as they are incurred.
The Company recognizes loss contingency provisions for probable 
losses when management is able to reasonably estimate the loss. 
When the estimated loss lies within a range, the Company records 
a loss contingency provision based on its best estimate of the 
probable loss. If no particular amount within that range is a better 
estimate than any other amount, the minimum amount is recorded. 
Estimates of losses may be developed substantially before the 
ultimate loss is known, and are therefore refined each accounting 
period as additional information becomes known. In instances 
where the Company is unable to develop a reasonable estimate 
of loss, no loss contingency provision is recorded at that time. 
As information becomes known a loss contingency provision is 
recorded when a reasonable estimate can be made. The estimates 
are reviewed quarterly and the estimates are changed when 
expectations are revised. An outcome that deviates from the 
Company’s estimate may result in an additional expense or release 
in a future accounting period. At December 31, 2015, provisions 
for litigation losses, insurance claims and other disputes totaled 
$9.9 million (December 31, 2014: $16.9 million).
The Company’s principal pending legal and other proceedings 
are disclosed below. The outcomes of these proceedings are not 
always predictable and can be affected by various factors. For 
those legal and other proceedings for which it is considered at 
least reasonably possible that a loss has been incurred, the 
Company discloses the possible loss or range of possible loss in 
excess of the recorded loss contingency provision, if any, where 
such excess is both material and estimable.
VYVANSE
In May and June 2011, Shire was notified that six separate 
Abbreviated New Drug Applications (“ANDAs”) were submitted 
under the Hatch-Waxman Act seeking permission to market 
generic versions of all approved strengths of VYVANSE. The 
notices were from Sandoz, Inc. (“Sandoz”); Amneal Pharmaceuticals 
LLC (“Amneal”); Watson Laboratories, Inc. (“Watson”); Roxane 
Laboratories, Inc. (“Roxane”); Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
(“Mylan”); and Actavis Elizabeth LLC and Actavis Inc. (collectively, 
“Actavis”). Since filing suit against these ANDA filers, along with 
API suppliers Johnson Matthey Inc. and Johnson Matthey 
Pharmaceuticals Materials (collectively “Johnson Matthey”), Shire 
has been engaged in a consolidated patent infringement litigation 
in the US District Court for the District of New Jersey against the 
aforementioned parties (except Watson, who withdrew their ANDA).
On June 23, 2014, the US District Court for the District of New 
Jersey granted Shire’s summary judgment motion holding that 
18 claims of the patents-in-suit were both infringed and valid. 
On September 24, 2015, the US Court of Appeals of the Federal 
Circuit (“CAFC”) affirmed that ruling against all of the ANDA filers 
and the infringement ruling against Johnson Matthey.
LIALDA 
In May 2010, Shire was notified that Zydus Pharmaceuticals USA, 
Inc. (“Zydus”) had submitted an ANDA under the Hatch-Waxman 
Act seeking permission to market a generic version of LIALDA. 
Within the requisite 45 day period, Shire filed a lawsuit in the US 
District Court for the District of Delaware against Zydus and Cadila 
Healthcare Limited, doing business as Zydus Cadila. A Markman 
hearing took place on January 29, 2015 and a Markman ruling was 
issued on July 28, 2015. A trial is scheduled to take place starting 
on March 28, 2016. 
In February 2012, Shire was notified that Osmotica Pharmaceutical 
Corporation (“Osmotica”) had submitted an ANDA under the 
Hatch-Waxman Act seeking permission to market a generic 
version of LIALDA. Within the requisite 45 day period, Shire filed a 
lawsuit in the US District Court for the Northern District of Georgia 
against Osmotica. A Markman hearing took place on August 22, 
2013 and a Markman ruling was issued on September 25, 2014. 
The Court issued an Order on February 27, 2015 in which all dates 
in the scheduling order have been stayed. 
In March 2012, Shire was notified that Watson Laboratories 
Inc.-Florida had submitted an ANDA under the Hatch-Waxman 
Act seeking permission to market a generic version of LIALDA. 
Within the requisite 45 day period, Shire filed a lawsuit in the 
US District Court for the Southern District of Florida against 
Watson Laboratories Inc.-Florida and Watson Pharmaceuticals, 
Inc. Watson Pharma, Inc. and Watson Laboratories, Inc. were 
subsequently added as defendants. A trial took place in April, 2013 
and on May 9, 2013 the trial court issued a decision finding that 
the proposed generic product infringes the patent-in-suit and that 
the patent is not invalid. Watson appealed the trial court’s ruling 
to the CAFC and a hearing took place on December 2, 2013. 
The ruling of the CAFC was issued on March 28, 2014 overruling 
the trial court on the interpretation of two claim terms and remanding 
the case for further proceedings. Shire petitioned the Supreme 
Court for a writ of certiori, which was granted on January 26, 
2015. The Supreme Court also vacated the CAFC decision and 
remanded the case to the CAFC for further consideration in light of 
the Supreme Court’s decision in Teva v Sandoz. On June 3, 2015, 
the CAFC reaffirmed its previous decision to reverse the district 
court’s claims construction. The case has been remanded to the 
district court and a trial took place beginning on January 25, 2016. 
Closing arguments are scheduled to take place on March 11, 2016. 
The court has not issued its ruling on the trial.
In April 2012, Shire was notified that Mylan had submitted an 
ANDA under the Hatch-Waxman Act seeking permission to market 
a generic version of LIALDA. Within the requisite 45 day period, 
Shire filed a lawsuit in the US District Court for the Middle District 
of Florida against Mylan. A Markman hearing took place on 
December 22, 2014. A Markman ruling was issued on March 23, 
2015. The previously scheduled trial date has been vacated and 
the case has been stayed until May 31, 2016. 
In March 2015, Shire was notified that Amneal had submitted an 
ANDA under the Hatch-Waxman Act seeking permission to market 
a generic version of LIALDA. Within the requisite 45 day period, 
Shire filed a lawsuit in the US District Court for the District of New 
Jersey against Amneal, Amneal Pharmaceuticals of New York, 
LLC, Amneal Life Sciences Pvt. Ltd. and Amneal Pharmaceuticals 
Co. India Pvt. Ltd. No trial date has been set.
140 Shire Annual Report 2015 In September 2015, Shire was notified that Lupin Ltd. had 
submitted an ANDA under the Hatch-Waxman Act seeking 
permission to market a generic version of LIALDA. Within the 
requisite 45 day period, Shire filed a lawsuit in the US District 
Court for the District of Maryland against Lupin Ltd., Lupin 
Pharmaceuticals Inc., Lupin Inc. and Lupin Atlantis Holdings SA. 
A Markman hearing is scheduled to take place on August 22, 
2016. No trial date has been set.
On October 7, 2015 the Patent Trial and Appeals Board (“PTAB”) 
of the United States Patent Office instituted an inter parties review 
(“IPR”) of US Patent 6,773,720 which is the patent-in-suit in the 
litigations referred to above. The IPR process is designed to 
re-assess the patentability of the claims of the patent. A decision 
from the PTAB is expected in October 2016.
Investigation related to DERMAGRAFT
The Department of Justice, including the US Attorney’s Office 
for the Middle District of Florida, Tampa Division and the US 
Attorney’s Office for Washington, DC, is conducting civil and 
criminal investigations into the sales and marketing practices of 
Advanced BioHealing Inc. (“ABH”) relating to DERMAGRAFT. 
Following the disposal of the DERMAGRAFT business in January 
2014, Shire has retained certain legacy liabilities including any 
liability that may arise from this investigation. Shire is cooperating 
fully with these investigations. Shire is not in a position at this time 
to predict the scope, duration or outcome of these investigations.
Civil Investigative Demand relating to VANCOCIN
On April 6, 2012, ViroPharma received a notification that the 
United States Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) is conducting 
an investigation into whether ViroPharma had engaged in unfair 
methods of competition with respect to VANCOCIN. On August 3, 
2012, and September 8, 2014, ViroPharma and Shire respectively 
received Civil Investigative Demands from the FTC requesting 
additional information related to this matter. Shire has fully 
cooperated with the FTC’s investigation. At this time, Shire is 
unable to predict the outcome or duration of this investigation.
Lawsuit related to supply of ELAPRASE to certain patients in Brazil
On September 24, 2014 Shire’s Brazilian affiliate, Shire 
Farmaceutica Brasil Ltda, was served with a lawsuit brought by 
the State of Sao Paulo and in which the Brazilian Public Attorney’s 
office has intervened alleging that Shire is obligated to provide 
certain medical care including ELAPRASE for an indefinite period 
at no cost to patients who participated in ELAPRASE clinical trials 
in Brazil, and seeking recoupment to the Brazilian government for 
amounts paid for these patients to date, and moral damages 
associated with these claims. Shire intends to defend itself against 
these allegations but is not able to predict the outcome or duration 
of this case.

20. Financial instruments
Treasury policies and organization
The Company’s principal treasury operations are coordinated 
by its corporate treasury function. All treasury operations are 
conducted within a framework of policies and procedures 
approved annually by the Board of Directors. As a matter of policy, 
the Company does not undertake speculative transactions that 
would increase its credit, currency or interest rate exposure.
Interest rate risk
The Company is principally exposed to interest rate risk on any 
borrowings under the Company’s various debt facilities (see 
Liquidity and Capital Resources for details of each of the Company’s 
facilities). Interest on each of these facilities is set at floating rates, 
to the extent utilized. Shire’s exposure under these facilities is to 
US dollar interest rates. At December 31, 2015 the Company had 
fully utilized the January 2015 Facility Agreement and utilized 
$750 million of the RCF. Other facilities were not utilized at 
December 31, 2015. 
 Shire Annual Report 2015 141
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
continued
20. Financial instruments continued
The Company regularly evaluates the interest rate risk on its 
facilities. At December 31, 2015 the Company considered the risks 
associated with floating interest rates on borrowings under its 
facilities as appropriate. A hypothetical one percentage point 
increase or decrease in the interest rates applicable to drawings 
under the January 2015 Facility Agreement and the RCF at 
December 31, 2015 would increase interest expense by 
approximately $15 million per annum or would decrease the 
interest expense by approximately $7 million per annum. 
The Company is also exposed to interest rate risk on its restricted 
cash, cash and cash equivalents and on foreign exchange 
contracts on which interest is set at floating rates. This exposure 
is primarily limited to US dollar, Pounds sterling and Euro interest 
rates. As the Company maintains all of its cash, liquid investments 
and foreign exchange contracts on a short term basis for liquidity 
purposes, this risk is not actively managed. In the year to 
December 31, 2015 the average interest rate received on cash 
and liquid investments was less than 1% per annum. These cash 
and liquid investments were primarily invested in US dollar term 
deposits with banks and money market and liquidity funds. 
No derivative instruments were entered into during the year to 
December 31, 2015 to manage interest rate exposure. The Company 
continues to review its interest rate risk and the policies in place 
to manage the risk and may enter into derivative instruments to 
manage interest rate risk in the future. 
Credit risk 
Financial instruments that potentially expose Shire to 
concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of short-term cash 
investments, derivative contracts and trade accounts receivable 
(from product sales and from third parties from which the 
Company receives royalties). Cash is invested in short-term money 
market instruments, including money market and liquidity funds 
and bank term deposits. The money market and liquidity funds in 
which Shire invests are all triple A rated by both Standard and 
Poor’s and by Moody’s credit rating agencies.
The Company is exposed to the credit risk of the counterparties 
with which it enters into bank term deposit arrangements and 
derivative instruments. The Company limits this exposure through 
a system of internal credit limits which vary according to ratings 
assigned to the counterparties by the major rating agencies. 
The internal credit limits are approved by the Board and exposure 
against these limits is monitored by the corporate treasury 
function. The counterparties to these derivatives contracts are 
major international financial institutions. 
The Company’s revenues from product sales in the US are mainly 
governed by agreements with major pharmaceutical wholesalers 
and relationships with other pharmaceutical distributors and retail 
pharmacy chains. For the year to December 31, 2015 there were 
three customers in the US that accounted for 47% of the 
Company’s product sales. However, such customers typically have 
significant cash resources and as such the risk from concentration 
of credit is considered acceptable. The Company has taken 
positive steps to manage any credit risk associated with these 
transactions and operates clearly defined credit evaluation 
procedures. However, an inability of one or more of these 
wholesalers to honor their debts to the Company could have an 
adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results 
of operations. 
A substantial portion of the Company’s accounts receivable in 
countries outside of the United States is derived from product 
sales to government-owned or government-supported healthcare 
providers. The Company’s recovery of these accounts 
receivable is therefore dependent upon the financial stability and 
creditworthiness of the relevant governments. In recent years 
global and national economic conditions have negatively affected 
the growth, creditworthiness and general economic condition of 
certain markets in which the Company operates. As a result, in 
some countries outside of the US, specifically the Relevant 
Countries, the Company is experiencing delays in the remittance 
of receivables due from government-owned or government-
supported healthcare providers. The Company continued to 
receive remittances in relation to government-owned or 
government-supported healthcare providers in the Relevant 
Countries in the year to December 31, 2015, including receipts of 
$116.0 million and $100.0 million in respect of Spanish and Italian 
receivables, respectively. The Company’s exposure to Greece, 
both in terms of gross accounts receivable and annual revenues, 
is not material.
To date the Company has not incurred material losses on accounts 
receivable in the Relevant Countries, and continues to consider 
that such accounts receivable are recoverable. The Company 
will continue to evaluate all its accounts receivable for potential 
collection risks and has made provision for amounts where 
collection is considered to be doubtful. If the financial condition 
of the Relevant Countries or other Eurozone countries suffer 
significant deterioration, such that their ability to make payments 
becomes uncertain, or if one or more Eurozone member countries 
withdraws from the Euro, additional allowances for doubtful 
accounts may be required, and losses may be incurred, in future 
periods. Any such loss could have an adverse effect on the 
Company’s financial condition and results of operations.
Foreign exchange risk
The Company trades in numerous countries and as a consequence 
has transactional and translational foreign exchange exposures.
Transactional exposure arises where transactions occur in 
currencies different to the functional currency of the relevant 
subsidiary. The main trading currencies of the Company are the 
US dollar, Pounds Sterling, Swiss Franc, Canadian dollar and 
the Euro. It is the Company’s policy that these exposures are 
minimized to the extent practicable by denominating transactions 
in the subsidiary’s functional currency. 
Where significant exposures remain, the Company uses foreign 
exchange contracts (being spot, forward and swap contracts) to 
manage the exposure for balance sheet assets and liabilities that 
are denominated in currencies different to the functional currency 
of the relevant subsidiary. These assets and liabilities relate 
predominantly to inter-company financing. The foreign exchange 
contracts have not been designated as hedging instruments. Cash 
flows from derivative instruments are presented within net cash 
provided by operating activities in the consolidated cash flow 
statement, unless the derivative instruments are economically 
hedging specific investing or financing activities.
Translational foreign exchange exposure arises on the translation 
into US dollars of the financial statements of non-US dollar 
functional subsidiaries.
142 Shire Annual Report 2015 At December 31, 2015 the Company had 39 swap and forward 
foreign exchange contracts outstanding to manage currency 
risk. The swap and forward contracts mature within 90 days. 
The Company did not have credit risk related contingent features 
or collateral linked to the derivatives. The Company has master 
netting agreements with a number of counterparties to these 
foreign exchange contracts and on the occurrence of specified 
events, the Company has the ability to terminate contracts and 
settle them with a net payment by one party to the other. The 
Company has elected to present derivative assets and derivative 
liabilities on a gross basis in the consolidated balance sheet. 
As at December 31, 2015 the potential effect of rights of set-off 
associated with the foreign exchange contracts would be an 
offset to both assets and liabilities of $1.4 million, resulting in 
net derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $0.5 million and 
$10.1 million, respectively. Further details are included below:

Certain estimates and judgments were required to develop the 
fair value amounts. The fair value amounts shown above are not 
necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Company would 
realize upon disposition, nor do they indicate the Company’s intent 
or ability to dispose of the financial instrument.
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate 
the fair value of each material class of financial instrument:
 > Available-for-sale securities — the fair values of available-for-sale 
securities are estimated based on quoted market prices for 
those investments. 
 > Contingent consideration receivable — the fair value of the 
contingent consideration receivable has been estimated using 
the income approach (using a probability weighted discounted 
cash flow method). 
 > Foreign exchange contracts — the fair values of the swap and 
forward foreign exchange contracts have been determined using 
an income approach based on current market expectations 
about the future cash flows.
 > Contingent consideration payable — the fair value of the 
contingent consideration payable has been estimated using the 
income approach (using a probability weighted discounted cash 
flow method).

The Company re-measures the CCR (relating to contingent 
consideration due to the Company following divestment of certain 
of the Company’s products) at fair value at each balance sheet 
date, with the fair value measurement based on forecast cash 
flows, over a number of scenarios which vary depending on 
the expected performance outcome of the products following 
divestment. The forecast cash flows under each of these differing 
outcomes have been included in probability weighted estimates 
used by the Company in determining the fair value of the CCR.
144 Shire Annual Report 2015 Contingent consideration payable represents future milestones 
the  Company may be required to pay in conjunction with various 
business combinations and future royalties payable as a result 
of certain business combinations and licenses. The amount 
ultimately payable by Shire in relation to business combinations is 
dependent upon the achievement of specified future milestones, 
such as the achievement of certain future development, regulatory 
and sales milestones. The Company assesses the probability, 
and estimated timing, of these milestones being achieved and 
re-measures the related contingent consideration to fair value each 
balance sheet date. The amount of contingent consideration which 
may ultimately be payable by Shire in relation to future royalties 
is dependent upon future net sales of the relevant products over 
the life of the royalty term. The Company assesses the present 
value of forecast future net sales of the relevant products and 
re-measures the related contingent consideration to fair value 
each balance sheet date. 
The fair value of the Company’s contingent consideration 
receivable and payable could significantly increase or decrease 
due to changes in certain assumptions which underpin the fair 
value measurements. Each set of assumptions and milestones 
is specific to the individual contingent consideration receivable 
or payable. The assumptions include, among other things, the 
probability and expected timing of certain milestones being achieved, 
the forecast future net sales of the relevant products and related 
future royalties payable, the probability weightings applied to 
different sales scenarios of the Company’s divested products and 
forecast future royalties receivable under scenarios developed by 
the Company, and the discount rates used to determine the present 
value of contingent future cash flows. The Company regularly 
reviews these assumptions, and makes adjustments to the fair 
value measurements as required by facts and circumstances. 
Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis using 
Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3)
In the year to December 31, 2015 the Company reviewed its 
SHP625 and SHP608 IPR&D intangible assets for impairment 
and recognized an impairment charge of $643.7 million, recorded 
within R&D in the consolidated income statement, to write-down 
these IPR&D assets to their fair value. The fair value of these 
IPR&D assets was determined using the income approach, which 
used significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs. These unobservable 
inputs included, among other things, the probabilities of these 
IPR&D assets receiving regulatory approval, the timeframe for such 
approval, risk-adjusted forecast future cash flows to be generated 
by these IPR&D assets and the determination of an appropriate 
discount rate to be applied in calculating the present value of 
forecast future cash flows. The fair value of these IPR&D assets, 
determined at the time of the impairment review, was $nil.

22. Shareholders’ equity
Authorized common stock
The authorized stock of Shire plc as at December 31, 2015, was 
1,000,000,000 ordinary shares and 2 subscriber ordinary shares.
Dividends
Under Jersey law, Shire plc is entitled to fund payments of 
dividends from any source (other than capital redemption reserve 
or nominal capital account) subject to the Directors authorizing 
the distribution making a solvency statement in the prescribed 
statutory form. At December 31, 2015, Shire plc’s distributable 
reserves were approximately $12.1 billion.
Treasury stock 
The Company records the purchase of its own shares by the 
EBT and under the share buy-back program as a reduction of 
shareholders’ equity based on the price paid for the shares. 
At December 31, 2015, the EBT held 0.6 million ordinary shares 
(2014: 0.7 million; 2013: 2.4 million) and 0.2 million ADSs (2014: 
0.3 million; 2013: 0.4 million) and shares held under the share 
buy-back program were 8.5 million ordinary shares (2014: 
9.0 million; 2013: 9.8 million). During the year to December 31, 
2015 and 2014 the Company did not purchase any shares either 
through the EBT or under any share buy-back program. 
Income Access Share Arrangements 
Shire has put into place income access arrangements which 
enable ordinary shareholders, other than ADS holders, to choose 
whether they receive their dividends from Shire plc, a company 
tax resident in the Republic of Ireland, or from Shire 
Biopharmaceutical Holdings (“Old Shire”), a Shire Group 
company tax resident in the UK. 
Old Shire has issued one income access share to the Income 
Access Trust (the “IAS Trust”) which is held by the trustee of the 
IAS Trust (the “Trustee”). The mechanics of the arrangements are 
as follows:
 Shire Annual Report 2015 145
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
continued
22. Shareholders’ equity continued
i)  If a dividend is announced or declared by Shire plc on its 
ordinary shares, an amount is paid by Old Shire by way of a 
dividend on the income access share to the Trustee, and such 
amount is paid by the Trustee to ordinary shareholders who 
have elected to receive dividends under these arrangements. 
The dividend which would otherwise be payable by Shire plc 
to its ordinary shareholders will be reduced by an amount 
equal to the amount paid to its ordinary shareholders by 
the Trustee.
ii)  If the dividend paid on the income access share and on-paid 
by the Trustee to ordinary shareholders is less than the total 
amount of the dividend announced or declared by Shire plc 
on its ordinary shares, Shire plc will be obliged to pay a 
dividend on the relevant ordinary shares equivalent to the 
amount of the shortfall. In such a case, any dividend paid 
on the ordinary shares will generally be subject to Irish 
withholding tax at the rate of 20% or such lower rate as 
may be applicable under exemptions from withholding tax 
contained in Irish law.
iii)  An ordinary shareholder is entitled to make an income access 
share election such that he/she will receive his/her dividends 
(which would otherwise be payable by Shire Plc) under these 
arrangements from Old Shire. This can be done by submitting 
an income access share arrangement election from containing 
information on the participating shareholders as required by law.
The ADS Depositary has made an election on behalf of all holders 
of ADSs such that they will receive dividends from Old Shire under 
the income access share arrangements. Dividends paid by Old 
Shire under the income access share arrangements will not, under 
current legislation, be subject to any UK or Irish withholding taxes. 
If a holder of ADSs does not wish to receive dividends from Old 
Shire under the income access share arrangements, he/she must 
withdraw his/her ordinary shares from the ADS program prior to 
the dividend record date set by the ADS Depositary and request 
delivery of the Shire plc ordinary shares. This will enable him/her 
to receive dividends from Shire plc.
It is the expectation, although there can be no certainty, that Old 
Shire will distribute dividends on the income access share to the 
Trustee for the benefit of all ordinary shareholders who make an 
income access share election in an amount equal to what would 
have been such ordinary shareholders’ entitlement to dividends 
from Shire plc in the absence of the income access share election. 
If any dividend paid on the income access share and or paid to 
the ordinary shareholders is less than such ordinary shareholders’ 
entitlement to dividends from Shire plc in the absence of the 
income access share election, the dividend on the income access 
share will be allocated pro rata among the ordinary shareholders 
and Shire plc will pay the balance to these ordinary shareholders 
by way of dividend. In such circumstances, there will be no 
grossing up by Shire plc in respect of, and Old Shire and Shire plc 
will not compensate those ordinary shareholders for, any adverse 
consequences including any Irish withholding tax consequences. 
Shire will be able to suspend or terminate these arrangements 
at any time, in which case the full Shire plc dividend will be paid 
directly by Shire plc to those ordinary shareholders (including the 
Depositary) who have made an income access share election. In 
such circumstances, there will be no grossing up by Shire plc in 
respect of, and Old Shire and Shire plc will not compensate those 
ordinary shareholders for, any adverse consequences including 
any Irish withholding tax consequences.
In the year to December 31, 2015 Old Shire paid dividends totaling 
$127.7 million (2014: $112.8 million; 2013: $91.1 million) on the 
income access share to the Trustee in an amount equal to the 
dividend ordinary shareholders would have received from Shire plc.

146 Shire Annual Report 2015 24. Segmental reporting
Shire comprises a single operating and reportable segment 
engaged in the research, development, licensing, manufacturing, 
marketing, distribution and sale of innovative specialist medicines 
to meet significant unmet patient needs. 
This segment is supported by several key functions: a Pipeline 
group, consisting of R&D and Corporate Development, which 
prioritizes its activities towards late-stage development programs 
across a variety of therapeutic areas, while focusing its pre-clinical 
development activities primarily in Rare Diseases; a Technical 
Operations group responsible for the Company’s global supply 
chain; and an In-line marketed products group which focuses on 
commercialized products. The In-line marketed products group 
has commercial units that focus exclusively on the commercial 
execution of its marketed products including in the areas of HAE/
LSD, Neuroscience, and Gastrointestinal (“GI”) and Internal 
Medicine, and to support the development of our pipeline 
candidates, in Ophthalmics. This ensures that the Company 
provides innovative treatments, and services the needs of its 
customers and patients, as efficiently as possible. The business 
is also supported by a simplified, centralized corporate function 
group. None of these functional groups meets all of the criteria to 
be an operating segment.
This single operating and reportable segment is consistent with 
the financial information regularly reviewed by the Executive 
Committee (which is Shire’s chief operating decision maker) for 
the purposes of evaluating performance, allocating resources, 
and planning and forecasting future periods.

25. Receipt of break fee
On July 18, 2014, the Boards of AbbVie and Shire announced that 
they had agreed the terms of a recommended combination of 
Shire with AbbVie, subject to a number of conditions including 
approval by shareholders and regulators. On the same date Shire 
and AbbVie entered into a co-operation agreement in connection 
with the recommended combination. On October 16, 2014, the 
Board of AbbVie confirmed that it had withdrawn its 
recommendation of its offer for Shire as a result of the anticipated 
impact of a US Treasury Notice on the benefits that AbbVie 
expected from its offer. As AbbVie’s offer was conditional on the 
approval of its stockholders, and given their Board’s decision to 
change its recommendation and to advise AbbVie’s stockholders 
to vote against the offer, there was no realistic prospect of 
satisfying this condition. Accordingly, Shire’s Board agreed with 
AbbVie to terminate the cooperation agreement on October 20, 
2014. The Company entered into a termination agreement with 
AbbVie, pursuant to which AbbVie paid the break fee due under 
the cooperation agreement of approximately $1,635.4 million.

The Company has obtained advice that the break fee should not 
be taxable in Ireland. The Company has therefore concluded that 
no tax liability should arise and has not recognized a tax charge in 
the income statement in 2014. The relevant tax return was 
submitted on September 23, 2015.
26. Retirement benefits
The Company makes contributions to defined contribution 
retirement plans that together cover substantially all employees. 
The level of the Company’s contribution is fixed at a set 
percentage of each employee’s pay.
Company contributions to personal defined contribution pension 
plans totaled $52.3 million and $49.8 million for the years to 
December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and were charged to 
operations as they became payable.

The Group has determined the amount of income tax expense or 
benefit allocable to continuing operations using the incremental 
approach in accordance with ASC 740-20-45-8. The amount of 
income tax attributed to discontinued operations is disclosed in 
Note 9.
The operating results associated with the DERMAGRAFT 
business have been classified as discontinued operations 
for all periods presented. 
The reconciliation of income from continuing operations before

  In addition to being subject to the Irish corporation tax rate of 25%, in 2015 the 
Company is also subject to income tax in other territories in which the 
Company operates, including: Canada (15%); France (33.3%); Germany (15%); 
Italy (27.5%); Luxembourg (21.0%); the Netherlands (25%); Belgium (33.99%); 
Spain (28%); Sweden (22%); Switzerland (8.5%); United Kingdom (20%) and 
the US (35%). The rates quoted represent the statutory federal income tax 
rates in each territory, and do not include any state taxes or equivalents or 
surtaxes or other taxes charged in individual territories, and do not purport to 
represent the effective tax rate for the Company in each territory.

  Intra-group items principally relate to the effect of inter-company dividends 
and other intra-territory eliminations, the pre-tax effect of which has been 
eliminated in arriving at the Company’s consolidated income from continuing 
operations before income taxes, noncontrolling interests and equity in 
earnings/(losses) of equity method investees.
Provisions for uncertain tax positions
The Company files income tax returns in the Republic of Ireland, 
the US (both federal and state) and various other jurisdictions (see 
footnote (1) to the table above for major jurisdictions). With few 
exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to income tax 
examinations by tax authorities for years before 2008. Tax authorities 
in various jurisdictions are in the process of auditing the Company’s 
tax returns for fiscal periods from 2008, but primarily periods after 
2010; these tax audits cover primarily transfer pricing.
148 Shire Annual Report 2015 In respect of the receipt of the break fee from AbbVie in 2014, the 
Company has obtained advice that the break fee should not be 
taxable in Ireland. The Company has therefore concluded that no 
tax liability should arise and did not recognize a tax charge in the 
income statement in 2014. The relevant tax return was submitted 
on September 23, 2015.
While tax audits remain open, the Company also considers it 
reasonably possible that issues may be raised by tax authorities 
resulting in increases to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits, 
however, an estimate of such an increase cannot be made. 
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of 
unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

  Approximately $207 million (2014: $181 million) of which would affect the 
effective rate if recognized.
The Company considers it reasonably possible that certain audits 
currently being conducted could be concluded in the next 12 months, 
and as a result the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits 
recorded at December 31, 2015 could decrease by up to approximately 
$60 million. As at the balance sheet date, the Company believes 
that its reserves for uncertain tax positions are adequate to cover 
the resolution of these audits. However, the resolution of these 
audits could have a significant impact on the financial statements 
if the settlement differs from the amount reserved.
The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to 
unrecognized tax positions within income taxes. During the years 
ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company recognized a 
charge/(credit) to income taxes of $0.8 million and $(103.1) million 
in interest and penalties and the Company had a liability of 
$26.5 million and $25.8 million for the payment of interest and 
penalties accrued at December 31, 2015 and 2014 respectively.

jurisdictions (2015 $136.5 million; 2014: $109.7 million).
Management is required to exercise judgment in determining 
whether deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized. 
A valuation allowance is established where there is an expectation 
that on the balance of probabilities management considers it is 
more likely than not that the relevant deferred tax assets will not 
be realized. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, 
management weighs all available positive and negative evidence 
including cumulative losses in recent years, projections of future 
taxable income, carry forward and carry back potential under 
relevant tax law, expiration period of tax attributes, taxable temporary 
differences, and prudent and feasible tax-planning strategies.

27. Taxation continued
The net increase in valuation allowances of $91.4 million includes 
(i) increases of $180.4 million relating to operating losses and 
capital losses primarily acquired with NPS Pharma ($98.9 million) 
and losses in various jurisdictions ($81.5 million) for which 
management considers that there is insufficient positive evidence 
in respect of the factors described above to overcome negative 
evidence, such as cumulative losses and expiration periods and 
therefore it is more likely than not that the relevant deferred tax 
assets will not be realized in full, and ii) decreases of $89 million 
primarily in respect of Irish tax losses, which based on the 
assessment of factors described above now provides sufficient 
positive evidence to support the losses are more likely than not 
to be realized.
At December 31, 2015, based upon a consideration of the factors 
described above management believes it is more likely than not 
that the Company will realize the benefits of these deductible 
differences, net of the valuation allowances. However, the amount 
of the deferred tax asset considered realizable could be adjusted 
in the future if these factors are revised in future periods. 
During the period, the Company adopted ASU No.2015-17 which 
requires that all deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets 
be presented as non-current in the classified balance sheet 
(ASU 740-10-45-4) for the purpose of simplifying the balance 
sheet presentation. In accordance with the permitted transition 
guidance, this new guidance has been applied prospectively in 
2015 and the prior year balance sheet classification of deferred 
taxes has not been adjusted.
The approximate tax effect of net operating losses (“NOLs”), 
capital losses and tax credit carry-forwards as at December 31, 
are as follows:
2015 
$’M
2014 
$’M
US federal tax 149.3 38.7 
US state tax 77.2 82.8 
Republic of Ireland 61.2 75.2 
Foreign tax jurisdictions 434.9 351.8 
R&D and other tax credits 257.7 137.8 
980.3 686.3
The approximate gross value of NOLs and capital losses at 
December 31, 2015 is $5,562.3 million (2014: $3,313.0 million). 
The tax effected NOLs, capital losses and tax credit carry-
forwards shown above have the following expiration dates:
December 31,
2015 
$’M
Within 1 year 0.2 
Within 3 to 4 years 41.3 
Within 4 to 5 years 12.2 
Within 5 to 6 years 12.7 
After 6 years 521.8 
Indefinitely 392.1 
The Company does not provide for deferred taxes on the excess 
of the financial reporting over the tax basis in our investments in 
foreign subsidiaries that are essentially permanent in duration. 
At December 31, 2015, that excess totaled $11.3 billion (2014: 
$8.1 billion). The determination of the additional deferred taxes 
that have not been provided is not practicable.
28. Related parties
Shire considers that ArmaGen, Inc. (“ArmaGen”) is a related party 
by virtue of a combination of Shire’s equity stake in ArmaGen and 
the worldwide licensing and collaboration agreement between the 
two parties to develop and commercialize AGT-182. In the year 
to December 31, 2015 Shire paid $2.5 million in cash to ArmaGen 
in exchange for an additional equity stake in ArmaGen, following 
which Shire holds approximately 21% of ArmaGen’s issued equity. 
In addition, Shire recorded R&D costs arising from the licensing 
and collaboration arrangement of $7.8 million in the year to 
December 31, 2015, of which $0.5 million was accrued and 
unpaid as at December 31, 2015 (2014: $1.0 million).

There were no capitalized share-based compensation costs at 
December 31, 2015 and 2014.
At December 31, 2015, $115.3 million (2014: $83.1 million, 2013: 
$97.0 million) of total unrecognized compensation cost relating to 
non-vested awards is expected to be recognized over a period of 
three years.
At December 31, 2015, $82.0 million (2014: $71.2 million, 2013: 
$90.3 million) of total unrecognized compensation cost relating to 
non-vested in-the-money awards (based on the average share 
price during the year) is expected to be recognized over a weighted 
average period of 1.9 years (2014: 1.9 years, 2013: 1.7 years). 
On May 2, 2013, the Company initiated the reorganization of its 
business to integrate the three divisions into a simplified One Shire 
organization (see Note 5 for details). As a result of this 
reorganization the Company modified the terms of certain of its 
equity awards to employees and Directors impacted by the One 
Shire reorganization. Included in the stock compensation expense 
for the year to December 31, 2015, is $26.7 million (2014: 
$30.4 million, 2013: $3.3 million) of incremental stock 
compensation costs related to the modification of awards granted 
to those individuals impacted by the One Shire reorganization.
Share-based compensation plans
Prior to February 28, 2015 the Company granted stock-settled 
share appreciation rights (“SARs”) and performance share awards 
(“PSAs”) over ordinary shares and ADSs to Executive Directors 
and employees under the Shire Portfolio Share Plan (“PSP”) (Parts 
A and B). The SARs and PSAs granted under the PSP (Parts A & 
B) to Executive Directors are exercisable subject to performance 
and service criteria. Substantially all SARs and PSAs granted to 
employees are exercisable subject only to service criteria.
150 Shire Annual Report 2015 SARs granted to Executive Directors are exercisable subject to 
performance and service criteria. RSUs granted under the LTIP 
and SARs granted to all other employees are exercisable subject 
only to service criteria.
The principal terms and conditions of SARs, RSUs and PSUs 
granted under the LTIP are as follows: (i) the contractual life of 
SARs is seven years, (ii) the vesting period of SARs and RSUs 
granted to employees below the level of Executive Vice President 
allows for graded vesting, and (iii) all SARs granted to Executive 
Directors and employees at Executive Vice President level and all 
PSUs granted, cliff vest after three years, with the exceptions of 
SARs granted to employees at Executive Vice President level, 
contain performance conditions based on product sales and 
Non GAAP EBITDA targets. A Non GAAP Adjusted ROIC underpin 
is also used at the end of the three year performance period to 
assess the underlying performance of the Company before 
determining the final vesting levels for awards with performance 
conditions. In addition, a further two year holding period will 
apply to all awards granted to Executive Directors post vesting. 
The Company also operates a Global Employee Stock Purchase 
Plan and UK/Irish Sharesave Plans.
The principal terms and conditions of SARs and PSAs under the 
Shire Portfolio Share Plan (Parts A and B) are as follows: (i) the 
contractual life of SARs is seven years, (ii) the vesting period of 
SARs and PSAs granted to employees below the level of Executive 
Vice President allows for graded vesting over three years, and 
(iii) awards granted to the level of Executive Director and Vice 
President, cliff vest after three years and contain performance 
conditions based on growth in Non GAAP adjusted return on 
invested capital (“Adjusted ROIC”) and Non GAAP earnings 
before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortization (“Non 
GAAP EBITDA”). In 2014 the Company granted PSAs under the 
PSP to employees at Executive Vice President level and to a select 
Group of senior employees, which are exercisable subject to 
performance and service criteria. These PSAs cliff vest after three 
years and contain performance conditions as explained above.
Since February 28, 2015 the Company has granted awards under 
the Shire Long Term Incentive Plan 2015 (“LTIP”). Under the LTIP 
the Company grants stock-settled share appreciation rights 
(“SARs”), restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and performance share 
units (“PSUs”) over ordinary shares and ADSs to Executive 
Directors and employees. The PSUs granted under the LTIP and

Stock-settled SARs and stock options
(a) LTIP and PSP — Part A
Stock-settled share appreciation rights are exercisable subject to 
service and, for grants to Executive Directors only, performance criteria.
In respect of any award made to Executive Directors under the 
LTIP, performance criteria are based on product sales and Non 
GAAP EBITDA targets, with a Non GAAP Adjusted ROIC underpin. 
In respect of any award made to Executive Directors under the 
PSP (Part A), performance criteria are based on growth in Non 
GAAP Adjusted ROIC and Non GAAP EBITDA. These performance 
measures are an important measure of the Company’s ability to 
meet the strategic objective to grow value for all of its stakeholders. 
Awards granted to employees below Executive Director level are 
not subject to performance conditions and are only subject to 
service conditions. 
Once awards have vested, participants will have until the seventh 
anniversary of the date of grant to exercise their awards.
(b) UK/Irish Sharesave Plans (“Sharesave Plans”)
Options granted under the Sharesave Plans are granted with an 
exercise price equal to 80% and 75% of the mid-market price on 
the day before invitations are issued to UK and Ireland employees, 
respectively. Employees may enter into three or five year savings 
contracts. No performance conditions apply.
(c) Shire Global Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“Stock Purchase Plan”)
Under the Stock Purchase Plan, options are granted with an 
exercise price equal to 85% of the fair market value of a share 
on the enrollment date (the first day of the offering period) or the 
exercise date (the last day of the offering period), whichever is 
the lower. Employees agree to save for a period up to 12 months. 
No performance conditions apply.

Exercises of employee share-based awards
The total intrinsic values of share-based awards exercised for the 
years to December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were $198.8 million, 
$200.8 million and $298.3 million, respectively. The total cash 
received from employees as a result of employee share option 
exercises for the period to December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 
was approximately $16.6 million, $17.4 million and $17.2 million, 
respectively. In connection with these exercises, the tax benefit 
credited to additional paid-in capital for the years to December 31, 
2015, 2014 and 2013 was $31.6 million, $39.6 million and 
$11.9 million respectively.
The Company will settle future employee share award exercises 
with either newly listed ordinary shares or with shares held in the 
EBT. The number of shares to be purchased by the EBT in 2016 
will be dependent on the number of employee share awards 
granted and exercised during the year and Shire plc’s share price. 
At December 31, 2015 the EBT held 0.6 million ordinary shares 
and 0.2 million ADSs.
Valuation methodologies
The Company estimates the fair value of its share-based awards 
using a Black-Scholes valuation model. Key input assumptions 
used to estimate the fair value of share–based awards include the 
grant price of the award, the expected stock-based award term, 
volatility of the Company’s share price, the risk-free rate and the 
Company’s dividend yield. The Company believes that the 
valuation technique and the approach utilized to develop the 
underlying assumptions are appropriate in estimating the fair 
values of Shire’s stock-based awards. Estimates of fair value are 
not intended to predict actual future events or the value ultimately 
realized by employees who receive equity awards, and subsequent 
events are not indicative of the reasonableness of the original 
estimates of fair value made by the Company under guidance 
issued by the FASB on share-based payment transactions.
The fair value of share awards granted was estimated using the 
following assumptions:
Period ended December 31, 2015 2014 
Risk-free interest rate
1
 0.6-1.8% 0.3-1.8%
Expected dividend yield 0.2-0.4% 0.2-0.4%
Expected life 1-4 years 1-4 years
Volatility 23-26% 23-27%
Forfeiture rate 5-7% 5-7%

 Risk-free interest rate is for UK and US grants.

29. Share-based compensation plans continued
The following assumptions were used to value share-based awards:
 > risk-free interest rate — for awards granted over ADSs, the US 
Federal Reserve treasury constant maturities rate with a term 
consistent with the expected life of the award is used. For 
awards granted over ordinary shares, the yield on UK government 
bonds with a term consistent with the expected life of the award 
is used;
 > expected dividend yield — measured as the average annualized 
dividend estimated to be paid by the Company over the 
expected life of the award as a percentage of the share price 
at the grant date;
 > expected life — estimated based on the contractual term of the 
awards and the effects of employees’ expected exercise and 
post-vesting employment termination behavior; 
 > expected volatility — measured using historical daily price 
changes of the Company’s share price over the respective 
expected life of the share-based awards at the date of the 
award; and
 > the forfeiture rate is estimated using historical trends of the 
number of awards forfeited prior to vesting.
30. Auditor remuneration
The Audit, Compliance & Risk Committee reviews the scope and 
results of the audit and non-audit services, including tax advisory

158 Shire Annual Report 2015 Other financial information
Non GAAP measures
These Non GAAP financial measures are used by Shire’s 
management to make operating decisions because they facilitate 
internal comparisons of Shire’s performance to historical results 
and to competitors’ results. Shire’s Remuneration Committee uses 
certain key Non GAAP measures when assessing the performance 
and compensation of employees, including Shire’s directors.
The Non GAAP measures are presented in this Annual Report 
as Shire’s management believe that they will provide investors 
with a means of evaluating, and an understanding of how Shire’s 
management evaluates, Shire’s performance and results on a 
comparable basis that is not otherwise apparent on a US GAAP 
basis, since many non-recurring, infrequent or non-cash items 
that Shire’s management believe are not indicative of the core 
performance of the business may not be excluded when preparing 
financial measures under US GAAP. 
These Non GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation 
from, as substitutes for, or superior to financial measures prepared 
in accordance with US GAAP.
Where applicable the following items, including their tax effect, 
have been excluded when calculating Non GAAP earnings for 
both 2015 and 2014, and from our Outlook:
Amortization and asset impairments:
 > Intangible asset amortization and impairment charges; and
 > Other than temporary impairment of investments.
Acquisitions and integration activities:
 > Up-front payments and milestones in respect of in-licensed 
and acquired products;
 > Costs associated with acquisitions, including transaction 
costs, fair value adjustments on contingent consideration and 
acquired inventory; 
 > Costs associated with the integration of companies; and
 > Noncontrolling interests in consolidated variable interest entities.
Divestments, reorganizations and discontinued operations:
 > Gains and losses on the sale of non-core assets;
 > Costs associated with restructuring and reorganization activities;
 > Termination costs; and
 > Income/(losses) from discontinued operations.
Legal and litigation costs:
 > Net legal costs related to the settlement of litigation, 
government investigations and other disputes (excluding internal 
legal team costs).
Other:
 > Net income tax credit (being income tax, interest and estimated 
penalties) related to the settlement of certain tax positions with 
the Canadian revenue authorities;
 > Costs associated with AbbVie’s terminated offer for Shire, 
including costs of employee retention awards; and
 > Break fee received in relation to AbbVie’s terminated offer for Shire.
Depreciation, which is included in Cost of product sales, R&D 
and SG&A costs in our US GAAP results, has been separately 
disclosed for the presentation of 2015 and 2014 Non GAAP earnings. 
Cash generation represents net cash provided by operating 
activities, excluding up-front and milestone payments for in-
licensed and acquired products, tax and interest payments. 
In 2014 the receipt of the break fee in relation to AbbVie’s 
terminated offer for Shire was excluded from cash generation. 
Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating 
activities, excluding up-front and milestone payments for in-
licensed and acquired products, but including capital expenditure 
in the ordinary course of business. In 2014 the receipt of the break 
fee in relation to AbbVie’s terminated offer for Shire was excluded 
from free cash flow.
A reconciliation of Non GAAP financial measures to the most 
directly comparable measure under US GAAP is presented on 
pages 160 to 163.
Growth at CER, which is a Non GAAP measure, is computed by 
restating 2015 results using average 2014 foreign exchange rates 
for the relevant period.
Average exchange rates used by Shire for the year to December 
31, 2015 were $1.53:£1.00 and $1.11:€1.00 (2014: $1.65:£1.00 and 
$1.33:€1.00). Average exchange rates used by Shire for Q4 2015 
were $1.52:£1.00 and $1.09:€1.00 (2014: $1.60:£1.00 and 
$1.25:€1.00).
Non GAAP Adjusted ROIC reflects the definition used by the 
Company in its corporate scorecard. This definition aims to 
measure true underlying economicperformance of the Company, 
by making a number of adjustments to ROIC as derived from the 
Company’s Non GAAP financial results including:
 > Adding back to Non GAAP operating income all R&D expenses 
and operating lease costs incurred in the period;
 > Capitalizing on the Group’s balance sheet historical, cumulative 
R&D, in process R&D and intangible asset impairment charges 
and operating lease costs which previously have been 
expensed;
 > Deducting from Non GAAP operating income and amortization 
charge for the above capitalized costs based on the estimated 
commercial lives of the relevant products;
 > Excluding the income statement and balance sheet impact of 
non-operating assets (such as surplus cash and non-strategic 
investments); and
 > Taxing the resulting adjusted operating income at the underlying 
Non GAAP effective tax rate.
Non GAAP EBITDA represents Non GAAP EBITA before depreciation

Dividends
Shareholders are able to choose how they 
receive their dividends:
 > directly into their bank account*; or
 > by check.
* Shire preferred option.
The quickest and most efficient way to 
receive your dividends is to have them paid 
directly into your bank account. Those 
selecting this payment method receive a 
tax voucher with each payment. To change 
how you receive your dividends, either log 
on to www.shareview.co.uk or contact 
Equiniti.
Income Access Share (“IAS”) 
arrangements
Shareholders who elect to receive their 
dividends via the IAS arrangements will 
receive their dividends from a UK source 
(rather than directly from the Company 
which is an Irish tax resident company) for 
UK tax purposes. Unless shareholders 
have made an IAS Election dividends will 
be received from an Irish source and will be 
taxed accordingly.
An IAS dividend election form can be 
found on Shire’s website at:  
http://investors.shire.com/shareholder-
information/shareholder-forms.aspx

 Shire Annual Report 2015 165 Statements included herein that are not historical facts are 
forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements 
involve a number of risks and uncertainties and are subject to change 
at any time. In the event such risks or uncertainties materialize, 
Shire’s results could be materially adversely affected. The risks 
and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following:
 > the proposed combination with Baxalta may not be completed 
due to a failure to satisfy certain closing conditions, including 
any shareholder or regulatory approvals or the receipt of 
applicable tax opinions;
 > disruption from the proposed transaction with Baxalta may 
make it more difficult to conduct business as usual or maintain 
relationships with patients, physicians, employees or suppliers;
 > the combined company may not achieve some or all of the 
anticipated benefits of Baxalta’s spin-off from Baxter 
International, Inc. (“Baxter”) and the proposed transaction may 
have an adverse impact on Baxalta’s existing arrangements with 
Baxter, including those related to transition, manufacturing and 
supply services and tax matters;
 > the failure to achieve the strategic objectives with respect to the 
proposed combination with Baxalta may adversely affect the 
combined company’s financial condition and results of operations;
 > products and product candidates may not achieve 
commercial success; 
 > product sales from ADDERALL XR and INTUNIV are subject 
to generic competition; 
 > the failure to obtain and maintain reimbursement, or an adequate 
level of reimbursement, by third-party payers in a timely manner 
for the combined company’s products may affect future revenues, 
financial condition and results of operations, particularly if there 
is pressure on pricing of products to treat rare diseases;
 > supply chain or manufacturing disruptions may result in declines 
in revenue for affected products and commercial traction from 
competitors; regulatory actions associated with product 
approvals or changes to manufacturing sites, ingredients or 
manufacturing processes could lead to significant delays, an 
increase in operating costs, lost product sales, an interruption 
of research activities or the delay of new product launches; 
 > the successful development of products in various stages of 
research and development is highly uncertain and requires 
significant expenditures and time, and there is no guarantee 
that these products will receive regulatory approval;
 > the actions of certain customers could affect the combined 
company’s ability to sell or market products profitably, and 
fluctuations in buying or distribution patterns by such customers 
can adversely affect the combined company’s revenues, 
financial condition or results of operations;
 > investigations or enforcement action by regulatory authorities or 
law enforcement agencies relating to the combined company’s 
activities in the highly regulated markets in which it operates 
may result in significant legal costs and the payment of 
substantial compensation or fines;
Cautionary statements
 > adverse outcomes in legal matters and other disputes, including 
the combined company’s ability to enforce and defend patents 
and other intellectual property rights required for its business, 
could have a material adverse effect on the combined 
company’s revenues, financial condition or results of operations;
 > Shire is undergoing a corporate reorganization and was the 
subject of an unsuccessful acquisition proposal and the 
consequent uncertainty could adversely affect the combined 
company’s ability to attract and/or retain the highly skilled 
personnel needed to meet its strategic objectives; 
 > failure to achieve the strategic objectives with respect to Shire’s 
acquisition of NPS Pharmaceuticals Inc. or Dyax Corp. (“Dyax”) 
may adversely affect the combined company’s financial 
condition and results of operations;
 > the combined company will be dependent on information 
technology and its systems and infrastructure face certain 
risks, including from service disruptions, the loss of sensitive 
or confidential information, cyber-attacks and other security 
breaches or data leakages that could have a material adverse 
effect on the combined company’s revenues, financial condition 
or results of operations; 
 > the combined company may be unable to retain and hire key 
personnel and/or maintain its relationships with customers, 
suppliers and other business partners;
 > difficulties in integrating Dyax or Baxalta into Shire may lead to 
the combined company not being able to realize the expected 
operating efficiencies, cost savings, revenue enhancements, 
synergies or other benefits at the time anticipated or at all; and
other risks and uncertainties detailed from time to time in Shire’s, 
Dyax’s or Baxalta’s filings with the Securities and Exchange

The Directors present their annual report and the audited financial 
statements for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Principal activity and business review
Shire plc (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (collectively referred 
to as either “Shire”, or the “Group”) is a leading biotech company 
that focuses on developing and marketing innovative medicines 
for patients with rare diseases and other specialty conditions.
The Company is the ultimate parent of the Shire group of 
companies and its principal activity is that of a holding company.
The Group has grown both organically and through acquisition, 
completing a series of major transactions that have brought 
therapeutic, geographic and pipeline growth and diversification. 
The Group will continue to conduct its own research and 
development (“R&D”), focused on rare diseases, as well as 
evaluate companies, products and pipeline opportunities that offer 
a strategic fit and have the potential to deliver value to all of the 
Group’s stakeholders: patients, physicians, policy makers, payers, 
investors and employees.
The principal legislation under which the Company operates is 
Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 and regulations made thereunder. 
The Ordinary Shares of the Company are listed on the London 
Stock Exchange in the UK, and American Depositary Shares 
(‘ADS’), representing three Ordinary Shares of the Company, 
(evidenced by an American Depositary Receipt issued by Shire’s 
Depositary, Citibank, N.A.) are listed on the NASDAQ Global Select 
Market in the USA.
Business review
The Business review of the Group can be found in the consolidated 
financial statements and Annual Report and Accounts of the 
Company for the year to December 31, 2015, prepared in accordance 
with United Kingdom Listing Authority requirements (the “Shire 
Annual Report”); in the Chairman’s review on pages 4 and 5; the 
Chief Executive Officer’s review on pages 6 to 9; and the Review 
of our Business on pages 48 to 61. The Shire Annual Report also 
provides a description of the principal risks and uncertainties 
facing the Company and the Group as well as the Group’s risk 
management objectives and policies that are in place to assist 
in mitigating the potential impact. 
During the year the Company continued in its capacity as the 
parent company for the Group in the management of its 
subsidiaries.
The Company is tax resident in the Republic of Ireland.
Key performance indicators 
The Company’s key performance indicators are the same as the 
Group’s. For details of the Group’s key performance indicators see 
page 16 in the Shire Annual Report.
Income Access Share arrangements
In 2008 Shire put in place and continues to operate Income 
Access Share (“IAS”) arrangements enabling shareholders to 
choose whether they receive their dividends from a company tax 
resident in the Republic of Ireland or from a company tax resident 
in the UK. Further details in respect of the IAS arrangements can 
be found in Note 22 of the Shire Annual Report.
Results and dividends
A loss on ordinary activities before taxation of $91.5 million was 
recorded for the year ended December 31, 2015 (year ended 
December 31, 2014: profit before taxation of $1,479.9 million). 
The decrease was primarily as a result of the break fee received 
of $1,635.4 million following the termination of a cooperation 
agreement with AbbVie during 2014.
The net assets of the Company increased from $12,057.3 million 
for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $12,075.8 million for the 
year ended December 31, 2015, primarily as a result of credits 
to shareholders’ funds in respect of share based compensation 
awards held by employees in other Group companies partially 
offset by the loss recorded in the year. 
Dividends paid and dividend policy
The Company paid dividends amounting to $6.8 million in the year 
(2014: $8.9 million). In accordance with IAS arrangements, Shire 
Biopharmaceuticals Holdings paid dividends totaling $127.6 million 
(2014: $112.7 million) to those shareholders who choose to receive 
their dividends from a company tax resident in the UK.
A first interim dividend for the six months to June 30, 2015 of 4.21 
cents (2.69 pence) per Ordinary Share, equivalent to 12.63 cents 
per ADS, was paid in October 2015. The Board has resolved to 
pay a second interim dividend of 22.16 cents (15.56 pence) per 
Ordinary Share equivalent to 66.48 cents per ADS for the six 
months to December 31, 2015.
This is consistent with Shire’s stated policy of paying a dividend 
semi-annually, set in US cents per ordinary share. Typically, the 
first interim payment each year will be higher than the previous 
year’s first interim USD dividend. Dividend growth for the full year 
will be reviewed by the Board when the second interim dividend 
is determined.
Liquidity, cash flow and going concern
The Company and the Group’s business activities, together with 
the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and 
position are set out in the Chairman’s review, Chief Executive 
Officer’s review and Review of our Business. The financial position 
of the Company and the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position 
and borrowing facilities are described in the Liquidity and capital 
resources section of the Review of our Business of the Shire 
Annual Report and also see Note 17. The Review of our Business 
also includes information in respect of the Group’s objectives, 
policies and processes for managing capital; its financial risk 
management objectives; details of its hedging activity; and its 
exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk. Details of the Company’s 
financial instruments are disclosed in Note 13 on page 183 to 
these financial statements.
The Company’s funding requirements depend on a number of 
factors, including the timing and extent of its development 
programs; corporate, business and product acquisitions; the level 
of resources required for the expansion of certain manufacturing 
and marketing capabilities as the product base expands; increases 
in accounts receivable and inventory which may arise with any 
increase in product sales; competitive and technological 
developments; the timing and cost of obtaining required regulatory 
approvals for new products; the timing and quantum of milestone 
payments on business combinations, in-licenses and collaborative 
projects; the timing and quantum of tax and dividend payments; 
the timing and quantum of purchases by the Employee Benefit 
Trust of Shire shares in the market to satisfy awards granted under 
Shire’s employee share plans; and the amount of cash generated 
from sales of Shire’s products and royalty receipts.
An important part of Shire’s business strategy is to protect its 
products and technologies through the use of patents, proprietary 
technologies and trademarks, to the extent available. The Company 
intends to defend its intellectual property and as a result may need 
cash for funding the cost of litigation.
168 Shire Annual Report 2015 The Company finances its activities through cash generated from 
operating activities; credit facilities; private and public offerings of 
equity and debt securities; and the proceeds of asset or 
investment disposals. 
Shire’s balance sheet includes $135.5 million of cash and cash 
equivalents at December 31, 2015. 
Shire has a revolving credit facility of $2,100 million which matures 
in 2020, $750 million of which was utilized as December 31, 2015.
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company 
and the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly the Directors 
continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in 
preparing the financial statements. Further details regarding the 
adoption of the going concern basis can be found in the 
accounting policies in the notes to the financial statements.

Payment of creditors

Directors’ liability insurance and indemnification
In the year under review, the Group maintained an insurance policy 
for its Directors and Officers in respect of liabilities arising out of 
any act, error or omission whilst acting in their capacity as 
Directors or Officers. Qualifying third party indemnity provisions 
were also in place during the year under review for the benefit of 
Directors in relation to certain losses and liabilities which they may 
potentially incur to third-parties in the course of their duties. 
These remain in force at the date of this report.
Subsequent events
Shire provided funding for the acquisition of Dyax Corp. 
On January 20, 2016, Shire delivered a utilization request 
providing for the draw down of an amount equal to $5.6 billion 
under the November 2015 Facilities Agreement in respect of the 
purchase price payable in respect of the acquisition of Dyax Corp. 
In connection with the consummation of the Merger and for 
general corporate purposes, on January 20, 2016, Shire delivered 
a utilization request providing for the draw down of an amount 
equal to $100 million under the RCF. 
Shire will provide funding for the announced combination with 
Baxalta. On January 11, 2016, Shire entered into an $18 billion 
bridge Facilities Agreement with certain financial institutions related 
to the announced combination with Baxalta. As at February 23, 
2016, the bridge Facilities Agreement was undrawn.
Auditor
Each of the persons who is a Director at the date of approval of 
this report confirms that:
 > so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s auditor is unaware; and
 > the Director has taken all the steps that he/she ought to have 
taken as a Director in order to make himself/herself aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s 
auditor is aware of that information.
Deloitte LLP have expressed their willingness to continue in office 
as auditor and a resolution to reappoint them will be proposed at 
the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.

 Shire Annual Report 2015 169
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information Directors’ responsibilities statement
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and 
the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have elected to 
prepare the financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards and applicable law), including FRS102 “The Financial 
Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland”. 
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the company and of the profit or 
loss of the company for that period. In preparing these financial 
statements, the Directors are required to:
 > select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
 > make judgments and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
 > state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements;
 > prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will 
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the company and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements comply with the Companies (Jersey) 
Law 1991. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of 
the company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ 
from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement 
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
 > the financial statements, prepared in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, including 
FRS102 “The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK 
and Republic of Ireland”, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the company and 
the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; 
and
 > the annual report and financial statements, taken as a whole, 
are fair, balanced and understandable and provide the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
company’s performance, business model and strategy.

170 Shire Annual Report 2015 Independent auditor’s report to the members of Shire plc
Opinion on the financial statements of Shire plc
In our opinion the financial statements:
 > give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs as 
at December 31, 2015 and of its loss for the year then ended;
 > have been properly prepared in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, including 
FRS 102 “The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the 
UK and Republic of Ireland”; and
 > have been prepared in accordance with the Companies (Jersey) 
Law 1991.
The financial statements comprise the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income, Statement of Financial Position, 
Statement of Changes in Equity, Statement of Cash Flows and the 
related Notes A to P. The financial reporting framework that has 
been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice).
Going concern
We have reviewed the Directors’ statement regarding the 
appropriateness of the going concern basis of accounting contained 
within the Accounting Policies section of the financial statements.
We confirm that:
 > we have concluded that the Directors’ use of the going concern 
basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements 
is appropriate; and
 > we have not identified any material uncertainties that may cast 
significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern. 
However, because not all future events or conditions can be 
predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern.
Independence
We are required to comply with the Financial Reporting Council’s 
Ethical Standards for Auditors and we confirm that we are 
independent of the Group and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with those standards. We also 
confirm we have not provided any of the prohibited non-audit 
services referred to in those standards.
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are those that had the greatest effect on our audit strategy, the allocation 
of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team:
Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Investment in subsidiaries
There is a risk related to the size of the Company’s investments of 
$16.7 billion in Shire Pharmaceutical Holdings Ireland Limited and 
Shire Regenerative Medicine Inc. which are disclosed in Note 10.
We have challenged the Directors’ impairment analysis and have considered 
the valuation of the Company’s subsidiaries against other indicators of value, 
such as the overall market capitalization of the Shire Group.
The risk related to complex tax judgments is not presented this year as we concluded on the most significant tax judgment, related to 
the tax treatment of the $1.6 billion received from AbbVie Inc. was concluded in the prior year and there have been no developments in 
relation to the treatment.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, 
and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions 
of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work 
and in evaluating the results of our work.
We have reconsidered materiality in the current year, and have determined materiality for the Company to be $30 million (2014: 
$69 million). This represents 0.2% (2014: 0.6%) of the net assets of the Company. 
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of $1.5 million (2014: 
$3 million), as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the 
Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the entity and its environment, including internal control, and assessing the risks 
of material misstatement. Audit work to respond to the risks of material misstatement was performed directly by the audit engagement team.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 > we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
 > proper accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited 
by us; or
 > the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
 Shire Annual Report 2015 171
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information Our duty to read other information in the Annual Report
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we are 
required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the annual 
report is:
 > materially inconsistent with the information in the audited 
financial statements; or
 > apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Company acquired in 
the course of performing our audit; or
 > otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have 
identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired 
during the audit and the Directors’ statement that they consider 
the annual report is fair, balanced and understandable and 
whether the annual report appropriately discloses those matters 
that we communicated to the audit committee which we consider 
should have been disclosed. We confirm that we have not 
identified any such inconsistencies or misleading statements.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion 
on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). We also 
comply with International Standard on Quality Control 1 (UK and 
Ireland). Our audit methodology and tools aim to ensure that our 
quality control procedures are effective, understood and applied. 
Our quality controls and systems include our dedicated professional 
standards review team and independent partner reviews.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with Article 113A of the Companies (Jersey) Law 
1991. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state 
to the company’s members those matters we are required to state 
to them in an Auditor’s report and/or those further matters we 
expressly agreed to report to them on in our engagement letter 
and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, 
we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than 
the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit 
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to 
the Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the 
financial and non-financial information in the annual report to 
identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial 
statements and to identify any information that is apparently 
materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the 
knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If 
we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information General information
Shire plc (the “Company”) is a public limited company incorporated 
in Jersey and domiciled in Ireland.
The address of the Company’s registered office is 22 Grenville 
Street, St Helier, JE4 8PX, Jersey.
The address of the Company’s principal place of business is 
5 Riverwalk, Citywest Business Campus, Dublin 24, 
Republic of Ireland.
The Company is the ultimate parent of the Shire Group of 
companies and its principal activity is that of a holding company.
First time adoption of FRS 102
These financial statements are the first financial statements of 
Shire plc prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting 
Standard 102 ‘The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the 
UK and Republic of Ireland’ (“FRS 102”). The financial statements 
of Shire plc for the year ended December 31, 2014 were prepared 
in accordance with previous UK GAAP.
Some of the FRS 102 recognition, measurement, presentation and 
disclosure requirements and accounting policy choices differ from 
previous UK GAAP. Consequently, the Directors have amended 
certain accounting policies to comply with FRS 102. For further 
details refer to Note 22. The Directors have also taken advantage 
of certain exemptions from the requirements of FRS 102 permitted 
by FRS 102 Section 35 “Transition to this FRS”.
Comparative figures have been restated to reflect the adjustments 
made, except to the extent that the Directors have taken advantage 
of exemptions to retrospective application of FRS 102 permitted 
by FRS 102 Section 35 “Transition to this FRS”. Adjustments are 
recognized directly in retained earnings at the transition date.
Basis of accounting
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with FRS 102 “The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in 
the UK and Republic of Ireland” (“FRS 102”) and the requirements 
of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991, and under the historical 
cost convention.
Monetary amounts in these financial statements are rounded to 
the nearest whole $100,000, except where otherwise indicated.
Consolidated financial statements
Consolidated accounts prepared in conformity with accounting 
principles generally accepted in the United States of America 
(“US GAAP”), in which the financial results and cash flow 
statement of the Company and its subsidiaries are included, can 
be found in the Shire Annual Report. Consequently, these financial 
statements present the financial position and financial 
performance of the Company as a separate entity.
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the Company’s accounting policies described below, which 
have been applied consistently throughout the current and 
preceding year and have been approved by the Board.
The financial statements of the Company are consolidated in the 
financial statements of Shire plc. The consolidated financial 
statements of Shire plc are available from their registered office at 
22 Grenville Street, St Helier, JE4 8PX, Jersey or on their website, 
www.shire.com.
Going concern
The Group’s balance sheet includes $135.5 million of cash and 
cash equivalents at December 31, 2015.
The Company has a revolving credit facility of $2,100 million which 
matures in 2020, $750 million of which was utilized as December 
31, 2015. 
In connection with the acquisitions of NPS Pharma and Dyax and 
the proposed combination with Baxalta, Shire entered into a 
number of facility arrangements in the year to December 31, 2015 
and subsequently in 2016. 
The Group has access to certain short-term uncommitted lines 
of credit which it utilizes from time to time to provide short-term 
flexibility in cash management. At December 31, 2015, these 
facilities were not utilized.
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company 
has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for 
the foreseeable future. Accordingly the Directors continue to adopt 
the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the report and 
financial statements.
Functional and presentational currencies
The financial statements are presented in US Dollars which is also 
the functional currency of the Company.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency 
(foreign currencies) are initially recorded at the exchange rate ruling 
on the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the reporting date. 
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are translated at the rate ruling at the date of the 
transaction or, if the asset or liability is measured at fair value, 
the rate when that fair value was determined.
All translation differences are taken to profit or loss, except to 
the extent that they relate to gains or losses on non-monetary 
items recognized in other comprehensive income, when the 
related translation gain or loss is also recognized in other 
comprehensive income.
Other income
Interest income
Interest income is accrued on a time-apportioned basis, by reference 
to the principal outstanding at the effective interest rate.
Dividend income
Dividend income from investments in subsidiaries is recognized 
when the Company’s right to receive payment is established.
Borrowing costs
Finance costs relating to debt issued are recorded as a deferred 
charge and amortized to the statements of income over the period 
to the earliest redemption date of the debt, using the effective 
interest rate method. On extinguishment of the related debt, any 
unamortized deferred financing costs are written off and charged 
to interest expense in the consolidated statements of income.
Accounting policies 
for the year ended December 31, 2015
178 Shire Annual Report 2015 Fixed asset investments
Interests in subsidiaries, associates and jointly controlled entities 
are initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost 
less any accumulated impairment losses.
Interests in subsidiaries, associates and jointly controlled entities 
are assessed for impairment at each reporting date. Any impairment 
losses or reversals of impairment losses are recognized immediately 
in profit or loss.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the current tax expense 
and deferred tax expense. Current tax assets are recognized 
when tax paid exceeds the tax payable.
Current tax is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit 
differs from total comprehensive income because it excludes items 
of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other 
periods. Current tax assets and liabilities are measured using 
tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the 
reporting date.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to 
apply to the period when the asset is realized or the liability is 
settled based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax is not discounted.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognized in respect of all timing 
differences that exist at the reporting date. Timing differences 
are differences between taxable profits and total comprehensive 
income that arise from the inclusion of income and expenses in 
tax assessments in different periods from their recognition in the 
financial statements. Deferred tax assets are recognized only to 
the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered by the 
reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits.
Deferred tax is recognized on income or expenses from 
subsidiaries, associates, branches and interests in jointly 
controlled entities, that will be assessed to or allow for tax in a 
future period except where the Company is able to control the 
reversal of the timing difference and it is probable that the timing 
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Current and deferred tax is charged or credited in profit or loss, 
except when it relates to items charged or credited to other 
comprehensive income or equity, when the tax follows the 
transaction or event it relates to and is also charged or credited 
to other comprehensive income, or equity.
Current tax assets and current tax liabilities and deferred tax 
assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset, if and only if, there is 
a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and the entity 
intends either to settle on a net basis or to realize the asset and 
settle the liability simultaneously.
Employee benefits
The costs of short-term employee benefits are recognized as a 
liability and an expense.
Retirement benefits
The Company contributes to personal defined contribution 
pension plans of employees. Contributions are charged to the 
profit and loss account as they become payable. Differences 
between contributions payable in the year and contributions 
actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in 
the balance sheet.
Financial instruments
The Company has elected to apply the provisions of Section 11 
“Basic Financial Instruments” and Section 12 “Other Financial 
Instruments Issues” of FRS 102, in full, to all of its financial 
instruments.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognized when the 
Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the 
instrument, and are offset only when the Company currently has 
a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts and 
intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realize the asset and 
settle the liability simultaneously.
Financial assets
Trade debtors
Trade debtors which are receivable within one year and which do 
not constitute a financing transaction are initially measured at the 
transaction price. Trade debtors are subsequently measured at 
amortized cost, being the transaction price less any amounts 
settled and any impairment losses.
Where the arrangement with a trade debtor constitutes a financing 
transaction, the debtor is initially and subsequently measured at 
the present value of future payments discounted at a market rate 
of interest for a similar debt instrument.
A provision for impairment of trade debtors is established when 
there is objective evidence that the amounts due will not be 
collected according to the original terms of the contract. 
Impairment losses are recognized in profit or loss for the excess of 
the carrying value of the trade debtor over the present value of the 
future cash flows discounted using the original effective interest 
rate. Subsequent reversals of an impairment loss that objectively 
relate to an event occurring after the impairment loss was 
recognized, are recognized immediately in profit or loss.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial instruments are classified as liabilities and equity 
instruments according to the substance of the contractual 
arrangements entered into. An equity instrument is any contract 
that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Company 
after deducting all of its liabilities.
Equity instruments
Financial instruments classified as equity instruments are recorded 
at the fair value of the cash or other resources received or 
receivable, net of direct costs of issuing the equity instruments.
Own shares
The fair value of consideration given for shares repurchased by 
the Company is deducted from equity.
Trade creditors
Trade creditors payable within one year that do not constitute a 
financing transaction are initially measured at the transaction price 
and subsequently measured at amortized cost, being the 
transaction price less any amounts settled.
Where the arrangement with a trade creditor constitutes a 
financing transaction, the creditor is initially and subsequently 
measured at the present value of future payments discounted 
at a market rate of interest for a similar instrument.
 Shire Annual Report 2015 179
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information Borrowings
Borrowings are initially recognized at the transaction price, 
including transaction costs, and subsequently measured at 
amortized cost using the effective interest method. Interest 
expense is recognized on the basis of the effective interest method 
and is included in interest payable and other similar charges.
Commitments to receive a loan are measured at cost less impairment.
Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities
A financial asset is derecognized only when the contractual rights 
to cash flows expire or are settled, or substantially all the risks and 
rewards of ownership are transferred to another party, or if some 
significant risks and rewards of ownership are retained but control 
of the asset has transferred to another party that is able to sell the 
asset in its entirety to an unrelated third party. A financial liability 
(or part thereof) is derecognized when the obligation specified in 
the contract is discharged, canceled or expires.
Share based payments
The Company grants share options (“equity-settled share-based 
payments”) to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at 
the date of grant by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments 
granted. Options and performance share awards granted without 
market conditions are valued using the Black-Scholes option-
pricing model. Options and performance share awards granted 
with market conditions are valued using a binomial model.
The Company participates in a share-based payment arrangement 
granted to its employees and employees of its subsidiaries. 
The Company has elected to recognize and measure its share-
based payment expense on the basis of a reasonable allocation 
of the expense for the Group.
The cost for awards granted to the Company’s subsidiaries’ 
employees represents additional capital contributions by the 
Company in its subsidiaries. An additional investment in 
subsidiaries has been recorded in respect of those awards 
granted to the Company’s subsidiaries’ employees, with a 
corresponding increase in the Company’s shareholders’ equity. 
The additional capital contribution is based on the fair value at 
the grant date of the awards issued. This accounting treatment 
applies as the parent has granted the share option rather than 
being subsidiary granting an option in the parent’s equity.
Dividends
Dividends are recognized as liabilities once they are no longer 
at the discretion of the Company.

180 Shire Annual Report 2015 1 Critical accounting estimates and areas of judgment
Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based 
on historical experience and other factors, including expectations 
of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the 
circumstances.
Critical accounting estimates and areas of judgment
The Company makes estimates and assumptions concerning the 
future. The resulting accounting estimates and assumptions will, 
by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates 
and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material 
adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within 
the next financial year are discussed below:
The only critical accounting judgment which the Directors believe 
are relevant to these financial statements are those relating to the 
treatment of share based payments in the company. Please see 
the accounting policy above for treatment of the share based 
payments in these financial statements.

AbbVie break fee – 1,635.4 
On July 18, 2014 the Boards of AbbVie and Shire announced that 
they had agreed the terms of a recommended combination of 
Shire with AbbVie, subject to a number of conditions including 
approval by shareholders and regulators. On the same date Shire 
and AbbVie entered into a co-operation agreement in connection 
with the recommended combination. On October 16, 2014 the 
Board of AbbVie confirmed that it had withdrawn its 
recommendation of its offer for Shire as a result of the anticipated 
impact of the US Treasury Notice on the benefits that AbbVie 
expected from its offer. As AbbVie’s offer was conditional on the 
approval of its stockholders, and given their Board’s decision to 
change its recommendation and to advise AbbVie’s stockholders 
to vote against the offer, there was no realistic prospect of 
satisfying this condition. Accordingly, Shire’s Board agreed with 
AbbVie to terminate the cooperation agreement on October 20, 
2014. The Company entered into a termination agreement with 
AbbVie, pursuant to which AbbVie paid the break fee due under 
the cooperation agreement of approximately $1,635 million. 
The Company has obtained advice that the break fee should not 
be taxable in Ireland. The Company continues to consider that no 
tax liability should arise and did not recognize a tax charge in the 
income statement in 2014. The relevant tax return was submitted 
on September 23, 2015.

Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement
On December 12, 2014, Shire entered into a $2,100 million 
revolving credit facilities agreement (the “RCF”) with a number of 
financial institutions, for which Abbey National Treasury Services 
PLC (trading as Santander Global Banking and Markets), Bank of 
America Merrill Lynch International Limited, Barclays Bank PLC, 
Citigroup Global Markets Limited, Lloyds Bank PLC, The Royal 
Bank of Scotland PLC and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation

Bank ASA, The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., Credit Suisse 
AG, London Branch, Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A., Goldman 
Sachs Bank USA, Mizuho Bank, Ltd. and Morgan Stanley Bank 
International Limited acted as arrangers. Shire is an original 
borrower and original guarantor under the RCF. Shire has agreed 
to act as guarantor for any of its subsidiaries that become 
additional borrowers under the RCF. As at December 31, 2015 
the Company utilized $750 million of the RCF.
The RCF, which terminates on December 12, 2020, may be 
applied towards financing the general corporate purposes of Shire. 
The RCF incorporates a $250 million US dollar and euro swingline 
facility operating as a sub-limit thereof.
Interest on any loans made under the RCF is payable on the last 
day of each interest period, which may be one week or one, two, 
three or six months at the election of Shire, or as otherwise agreed 
with the lenders. The interest rate for the RCF is: LIBOR (or, in relation 
to any revolving loan in euro, EURIBOR); plus 0.30% per annum 
subject to change depending upon (i) the prevailing ratio of Net Debt 
to EBITDA (each as defined in the RCF) in respect of the most recently 
completed financial year or financial half year and (ii) the occurrence 
and continuation of an event of default in respect of the financial 
covenants or the failure to provide a compliance certificate.
Shire shall also pay (i) a commitment fee equal to 35% of the 
applicable margin on available commitments under the RCF for 
the availability period applicable thereto and (ii) a utilization fee 
equal to (a) 0.10% per year of the aggregate of all outstanding 
loans up to an aggregate base currency amount equal to 
$700 million, (b) 0.15% per year of the amount by which the 
aggregate base currency amount of all outstanding loans exceeds 
$700 million but is equal to or less than $1,400 million and 
(c) 0.30% per year of the amount by which the aggregate base 
currency amount of all outstanding loans exceeds $1,400 million.
The RCF includes customary representations and warranties, 
covenants and events of default, including requirements that 
Shire’s (i) ratio of Net Debt to EBITDA in respect of the most 
recently-ended 12-month relevant period (each as defined in the 
RCF) must not, at any time, exceed 3.5:1 except that, following 
an acquisition fulfilling certain criteria, Shire may on a once only 
basis elect to increase this ratio to (a) 5.5:1 for the relevant period 
in which the acquisition was completed (b) 5.0:1 in respect of the 
first relevant period following the relevant period in which the 
acquisition was completed and (c) 4.5:1 in respect of the second 
relevant period following the relevant period in which the 
acquisition was completed, and (ii) ratio of EBITDA to Net Interest 
for the most recently-ended 12-month relevant period (each as 
defined in the RCF) must not be less than 4.0:1.
The RCF restricts, subject to certain exceptions, Shire’s ability 
to incur additional financial indebtedness, grant security over its 
assets or provide loans/grant credit. Further, any lender may 
require mandatory prepayment of its participation if there is a 
change of control of Shire, subject to certain exceptions for 
schemes of arrangement and analogous schemes.
Events of default under the RCF include, subject to customary 
grace periods and materiality thresholds: (i) non-payment of any 
amounts due under the finance documents (as defined in the 
RCF), (ii) failure to satisfy any financial covenants, (iii) material 
misrepresentation in any of the finance documents, (iv) failure to 
pay, or certain other defaults, under other financial indebtedness, 
(v) certain insolvency events or proceedings, (vi) material adverse 
changes in the business, operations, assets or financial condition 
of Shire as a whole, (vii) if it becomes unlawful for Shire (or any 
successor parent company) or any of their respective subsidiaries 
that are parties to the RCF to perform their obligations thereunder 
or (viii) if Shire (or any successor parent company) or any 
subsidiary thereof which is a party to the RCF repudiates such 
agreement or other finance document, among others.

Agreement for the availability period applicable to each facility. 
With effect from first utilization, the commitment fee rate will be 
35 percent of the applicable margin. Before first utilization, the

indebtedness, grant security over its assets or provide loans/grant

The weighted average fair value of options granted in the year 
was determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. 
The Black-Scholes model is considered to apply the most 
appropriate valuation method due to the relatively short 
contractual lives of the options and the requirement to exercise 
within a short period after the employee becomes entitled to the 
shares (the “vesting date”).
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on 
management’s best estimate, for the effect of non-transferability, 
exercise restrictions, and behavioral considerations. 
Non-vesting conditions and market conditions are taken into 
account when estimating the fair value of the option at grant date. 
Service conditions and non-market performance conditions are 
taken into account by adjusting the number of options expected 
to vest at each reporting date.
As at December 31, 2015 there were no options to subscribe for 
Ordinary shares of 5p each, which remained exercisable.
20 Related party transactions
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in 
Section 33 of FRS 102 to disclose transactions with wholly 
owned Group companies.
The Directors consider that they are the only key management 
personnel of the company and details in respect of their 
remuneration is given in Note 7 to these financial statements.

22A Deferred finance charges
Under FRS102, deferred financing charges which relate to a facility 
which has had a substantial modification should be extinguished. 
The Revolving Credit Facility (RCF) of Shire was initiated in 2010 
and significantly modified in December 2014 when the terms of 
the facility were changed. 
At December 31, 2014 there were $1.6 million of fees which have 
been capitalized and were being amortized over the life of the facility. 
Under FRS102, these capitalized fees should be written off at the 
date of the significant modification of the facility. The comparative 
figures for the 2014 year end have therefore been updated to reflect 
the expense of these costs in the year ending December 31, 2014.

no longer a plastic and has 
become a material which is 
inherently biodegradable in

Chairman’s Statement 
Nirj Deva
2012 was disappointing in terms of 
ﬁnancial performance, but strong in 
terms of cash generation, and product and 
market development. There were delays 
in securing expected orders and the Group 
changed its trading polices in order to 
reduce foreign exchange and asset risks 
by improving the level of letter of credit 
or proforma based business. This led to a 
reduction in revenues for the year to £4.94 
million (2011: £8.54 million) and a loss before 
tax of £2.20 million (2011: proﬁt £0.42 million). 
The policies were, however, successful in 
contributing to the generation of £0.45 million 
of cash from operations (2011: cash 
consumed £0.19 million).
Underlying R & D expenditure increased in 
line with identiﬁed opportunities. Together 
with d
2
w controlled life products and 
applications, we invested further into our 
d
2
p (anti-microbial and anti-fungal) and d
2
t 
(anti-counterfeiting) products. The Group 
employs a highly qualiﬁed scientiﬁc team with 
a presence in four continents. Full “in-house” 
development facilities became operational 
during 2012.
Our recycling division, Symphony Recycling 
Technologies, continued its investment in 
tyre recycling technologies. The Government-
funded RuPERT project successfully concluded 
at the end of the year and we are investigating 
commercial opportunities going forward. 
“ The most signiﬁcant aspect 
over the last twelve months 
was the increasing momentum 
of legislative change in favour 
of d
2
w oxo-biodegradable 
type products.”
Signiﬁcantly, and separate to RuPERT, we 
launched in early 2013 the SymTyre-S300 
tyre “ﬂat-pack” machine in order to generate 
initial revenues and to establish an early 
market presence.
The most signiﬁcant aspect over the 
last twelve months was the increasing 
momentum of legislative change in favour 
of d
2
w oxo-biodegradable type products. The 
results of this are expected to show in 2013. 
Pakistan announced in February 2013 that 
it has legislated against plastic which is not 
oxo-biodegradable, and the United Arab 
Emirates extended its product range covered 
by similar legislation that came into effect 
in 2012. This extension to the product range 
adds items such as food packaging and 
stretch ﬁlms to the carrier bags and refuse 
sacks that are currently being enforced. 
Other countries are following their example.
Exciting opportunities have been developed 
for our d
2
p product range with end-user 
beneﬁts relating to food and non-food sectors 
with potential cost savings being identiﬁed for 
the industry and the consumer. This is being 
marketed through our existing distribution 
network together with d
2
t, which we believe 
is a unique and valuable offering to users with 
a highly valued brand or to protect high value 
goods from unauthorised copying.
I am pleased to report that revenues for 
January and February 2013 are 100% higher 
than in the same period last year.
I would like to thank our distributors, staff 
and the Board for their hard work over the 
last year and we look forward to the future 
with conﬁdence.

Chief Executive’s Review
The year under review can be divided into 
two parts, the ﬁrst being the ﬁnancial, and 
the second the commercial. As to the ﬁrst, 
a reduction in revenues together with a 
substantial trading loss was recorded. The cause 
for this exceptional result following a proﬁt trend 
was a delay in expected sales from markets 
where we could see a process of legislative 
change, albeit not implemented, and a change 
in operating policies. The change in operating 
policies led to a signiﬁcant reduction of 
receivables and also stocks held by the distributor 
network. This resulted in an improved working-
capital cycle and a reduced exposure to credit 
risk. The cash generated from this strategy was 
£0.45 million, and this was re-invested into 
product research and development. 
On the second part, the commercial, we 
achieved considerable success. The foundations 
were created to increase revenues and a move 
back into proﬁtability during 2013. In the period, 
new products, new markets and new territories 
were identiﬁed and established. Laboratory 
trials for new products in our d
2
w, d
2
p and d
2
t 
technologies showed encouraging results which 
led to several lengthy commercial trials with end 
user corporations which are still ongoing. 
The technical and marketing team were active 
throughout the year by focusing politicians’ and 
consumers’ attention to the beneﬁt of plastics 
with d
2
w inside. This activity was supported by 
the life-cycle-analysis that was commissioned 
by us and issued by Intertek in May 2012. We 
believe that the results of these actions will 
encourage countries to look at the d
2
w oxo-
biodegradable option rather than ban or restrict 
the use of plastics altogether. Pakistan and the 
UAE have changed legislation in favour of our 
type of oxo-biodegradable technology, and 
others have also followed this course. The 
Symphony technical team has been active in 
many ways, and in particular, are committee 
members in most of the main standards 
organisations such as ASTM, BSI, and ISO.

Trading results
Total Group revenues were lower at £4.94 million 
(2011: £8.54 million). Group gross proﬁt margins 
reduced from 54% to 44%. These factors 
resulted in a 53% decrease in the contribution 
from gross proﬁt from £4.59 million in 2011 
to £2.15 million in 2012. Gross margins were 
reduced due to the sales mix leaning towards 
the lower value areas while the higher value 
regions reduced their local stock levels.
Sales to the Americas reduced from £4.62 
million in 2011 to £2.11 million in 2012 and 
represented 43% of 2012 revenues (2011: 54%). 
This was the main area where stocks and 
receivables were high at the end of 2011 and so 
suffered as a result of the change in operating 
policies. Our primary markets in this sector 
are Mexico and Brazil. 
Sales to UK and Europe reduced from £1.97 
million in 2011 to £1.38 million in 2012 and 
represented 28% of 2012 revenues (2011: 23%). 
This includes sales to Italy which was strong in 
2011 but confused packaging legislation in the 
country led to reduced volumes in 2012. 
Sales to the Rest of the World reduced from 
£1.95 million in 2011 to £1.45 million in 2012 and 
represented 29% of 2012 revenues (2011: 23%). 
Territories include the UAE which also had high 
stocks at the end of 2011. 
Total expenses increased to £4.21 million (2011: 
£3.90 million) which included provisions against 
receivables of £0.39 million (2011: £nil). Total 
staff costs were marginally higher at £2.16 
million (2011: £2.02 million) and Directors’ 
emoluments reduced to £0.87 million in 2012 
from £0.89 million in 2011.
The Group made an operating loss of £2.18 
million compared with an operating proﬁt of 
£0.50 million in 2011, resulting in the Group’s 
loss before tax of £2.20 million compared with 
a proﬁt before tax of £0.42 million in 2011. 
Development costs of £0.36 million were 
capitalised in 2012 (2011: £0.24 million). The net 
book value of capitalised development costs at 
the end of the year amounted to £1.31 million. 
Further development expenditure of £0.32 
million (2011: £0.34 million) was charged directly 
to proﬁt and loss. Capitalised development costs 
represent 9% of expenses as detailed above. 
Within the total amount of £1.31 million 
capitalised to date are: £0.48 million relating to 
Symphony Recycling Technologies; £0.25 million 
relating to d
2
w products which have been 
developed and are being sold; and the balance 
of £0.58 million, relating to further environmental 
plastic applications still in development, and 
where we believe signiﬁcant revenues will be 
generated in the foreseeable future. Symphony Environmental

The Group reports a loss for the year of £2.22 
million with basic loss per share of 1.74 pence 
(2011: earnings per share 0.42 pence). 
The Group’s primary selling currency is the 
US Dollar. The Group hedges where possible 
by purchasing in US Dollars and has banking 
facilities in place in order to secure rates going 
forward. As at 31 December 2012 the Group 
had a net balance of US Dollar assets totalling 
$0.32 million (2011: $5.14 million). 
Segmental analysis
The Group operates two divisions which are 
classiﬁed as segments in the ﬁnancial report, 
being the Plastics division and the Recycling 
Technologies division. 
The Plastics division includes revenues 
associated with d
2
w, d
2
p and d
2
Detector, 
be they additives or ﬁnished products. The 
Plastics division, which currently makes up 
all Group revenues, saw d
2
w additive volumes 
decrease by 40% during the year with d
2
w 
revenues reducing to £4.94 million (2011: 
£8.54 million) due to delays in expected orders 
and changes in operating polices as stated 
above. This, together with the fall in gross 
margins and increased administrative 
expenses, resulted in an EBITDA loss of 
£1.75 million in 2012 compared to a proﬁt 
of £0.86 million in 2011. 
The Recycling Technologies division has no 
revenues to date and saw expenditure of 
£0.27 million for the year resulting in an 
EBITDA loss of the same amount (2011 
expenditure and EBITDA loss: £0.22 million).
Cashﬂow
The Group generated £0.45 million from 
operations (2011: cash consumed £0.19 
million). This was due to a change in operating 
policies which led to stricter stock and 
receivables controls within the distribution 
network. The Group has a £1 million trade 
ﬁnance facility with HSBC Bank plc which 
was drawn down to £0.22 million as at 
31 December 2012 (drawn down to £0.38 
million at 31 December 2011) which is used 
to manage Group working capital.
In addition to development costs detailed 
above, £0.04 million was invested in plant 
and equipment, representing continued 
investment in a development centre in Telford, 
UK, together with other laboratory equipment 
and facilities. A total of £0.06 million was 
spent on property, plant and equipment 
in 2012 (2011: £0.28 million).
Symphony Recycling Technologies 
The RuPERT tyre recycling project was 
successfully completed in December 2012. 
The Group continues to invest in and is 
actively pursuing commercial outlets. In early 
2013 we launched the SymTyre-S300 tyre 
reduction machine. We anticipate that this 
will generate revenues in the short term, 
and also open the way for commercialisation 
of future developments as and when they 
come on stream.
Outlook
2013 has started strongly with sales showing 
a 100% improvement from the same period 
last year. Our main established markets are 
reporting tight stock levels and steady to 
increasing sales momentum. The new 
markets for d
2
w have provided encouraging 
sales projections and marketing activity 
information. They have also started 
placing orders. 
The Pakistan legislation prohibiting plastics 
which are not oxo-biodegradable comes 
into effect in April 2013. This follows similar 
legislation previously passed in the United 
Arab Emirates and recently extended from 2 
products to 15. These changes to legislation 
are expected to be signiﬁcant, not only in 
terms of the local markets, which are

material, but also for imported items which 
are packed in plastics. Other countries have 
either legislated in a similar way or are 
contemplating what action should be taken. 
As an example, Italy has draft legislation for 
a hydro-biodegradable product that conforms 
with the composting standard EN 13432. 
However, this draft decree itself says that 
it is “subject to the information procedure 
under Directive 98/34/EC and shall enter into 
force from the date of completion, with a 
favourable outcome, of the procedure itself, 
the date of which shall be announced in 
the Ofﬁcial Gazette.” It is our view that it 
is unlikely that there will be a favourable 
outcome. The European Commission sent on 
24 October 2012 a formal notice to the Italian 
Republic, in the framework of infringement 
procedure 2011/4030. The European 
Commission have conﬁrmed that Italy is 
in breach of not only Article 16 of Directive 
94/62/EC and Article 8 of Directive 98/34/EC, 
but also Article 18 of Directive 94/62/EC. 
Italy continues to use a d
2
w type oxo-
biodegradable products but in low volumes 
at this point in time. 
France is preparing law favourable to 
oxo-biodegradable products for retail plastic 
bags which would come into force January 
2014. Other European countries are also 
considering legislation.
As a result of growing global activity, we 
believe the legislation momentum for d
2
w 
type oxo-biodegradable technologies will 
increase, and we are ﬁnding more and 
more customers wanting to use the d
2
w 
brand as an answer to meet legislation 
requirements or just good CSR or marketing 
practice. We offer a free d
2
Detector testing 
service which is unique and not provided 
by others in the industry.
The United States Federal Trade Commission 
recently issued a statement which questioned 
the validity of hydro-biodegradable plastics 
(i.e. those made from food crop), such that 
they were not suitable for composting; this 
being the primary reason why hydro-
biodegradable products are sold.
In May 2012, Intertek published a life cycle 
assessment which showed that d
2
w oxo-
biodegradable plastics are 75% better than 
normal plastic when it comes to litter. In 
respect to litter, Keep America Beautiful issued 
a report where it concluded that “litter remains 
a pervasive problem”. Oxo-biodegradables are 
designed primarily to deal with littering.
All in all, the above shows an increasingly 
aware global market which is leaning towards 
d
2
w type oxo-biodegradable products.
Complementing d
2
w, we believe that our 
d
2
Detector will be an important tool for users 
of this type of technology as the consumer 
has no other means of identifying if a product 
really has d
2
w inside or not as it is invisible to 
the human eye. The d
2
p anti-microbial and 
anti-microbial technologies will also have 
an impact in 2013 and we are currently in 
discussions with a number of blue-chip 
companies regarding the commercial use 
in their products. There are also similar 
situations with our d
2
t anti-counterfeiting 
technologies.
With the improved trading position at the start 
of 2013, the Group is conﬁdent of a stronger 
ﬁnancial performance going forward, and are 
encouraged by the growing positive sentiment 
towards our products and technologies.

w is Symphony’s core product, being 
successful in global markets for over 
15 years. It is a masterbatch which, when 
included at the manufacturing stage, turns 
ordinary plastic at the end of its useful life, 
in the presence of oxygen, into a material 
with a different molecular structure. At the 
end of that process it is no longer a plastic 
and has become a material which will 
biodegrade in the open environment 
in the same way as a leaf.
Recent developments
Over the years many governments have 
realised the potential of oxo-biodegradable 
materials and its beneﬁts for the environment. 
Every year we have positive outcomes, and 
more legislation comes into force to ban 
regular plastic and allow only 
oxo-biodegradable plastic to be used for 
shopping bags and other short-life plastic 
products. The UAE was the ﬁrst country to 
legislate and they have announced that as 
from 1 January 2014 they will extend the 
range of plastic products that must be 
oxo-biodegradable. Pakistan has announced 
similar legislation as from 1 April 2013. In the 
Balkans, Slovenia, Serbia, Montenegro and 
Albania have recognised the beneﬁts of 
oxo-biodegradable plastic, as have several 
countries in Africa. In 2012 Intertek published 
“A Life Cycle Assessment of Oxo-biodegrdable, 
Compostable and Conventional Bags”, which 
showed that the environmental credentials 
of d

w plastics are ahead of bio-based and 
conventional plastics.  Symphony Environmental

Symphony has identiﬁed the 
disposal of scrap tyres as a 
major issue both at home in 
the UK and all over the world. 
We are asked to provide solutions for the 
billions of scrap tyres dumped around the 
world. There are currently over 10 billion scrap 
tyres around the world. Dumping, and failing 
to dispose of, scrap tyres can lead to an 
elevated danger of ﬁre, rodent infestation, and 
ground-pollution. Mosquitoes breeding in the 
water inside scrap tyres will spread Malaria, 
Dengue Western Nile fever, Filariasis, and 
other diseases. It is estimated that another 
1.5 billion tyres become scrap every year. 
Scrap tyres also take up a vast amount of 
space in workshops, garages and in transit, 
and are an unsightly and unproductive use of 
land. They are often disposed of illegally and 
most of them cannot and should not be put 
into landﬁlls. A solution has to be found. 
SymTyre-S300
Symphony has announced the 
SymTyre-S300 – a machine that can reduce 
a scrap-tyre into ﬂat-pack components 
within 60 seconds. The machine is portable 
and could be placed in any garage, 
workshop, tyre dump or depot.
SymTyre-S300 is a ﬁrst step. Symphony 
Recycling Technologies has also been 
developing further value-added processes 
with Imperial College London, Cobham 
Microwave, Artis, ABB, and Hughes Pumps. 
The project was funded by the UK government 
to investigate ways of creating valuable 
products from scrap tyres. It was successfully 
completed at the end of 2012 and 
commercialisation is now in progress.

Corporate Social Responsibility
For Symphony, as an environmental technology 
company, sustainable development is an 
important matter. This means that we combine 
long-term economic objectives with social 
responsibility and environmental protection. 
Dealing with chemicals and masterbatches 
we are often questioned on how we meet this 
challenge. We have established our potential 
risks, and the challenge is in a continuous 
communication with our stakeholders. 
At Symphony we believe that our long-term 
future and proﬁtability depend on our 
environmental, technical and social 
performance. Excellence in operational 
performance generates ﬁnancial returns, 
while being a responsible global citizen earns 
the continued support of our customers, 
shareholders, communities and staff. 
We have established goals that the company 
and its people are trying to achieve daily. We 
understand that in today’s world it is difﬁcult 
to be a responsible individual, and even more 
difﬁcult to implement change towards 
a better future. It is essential to establish 
best practices, support individual ambitions, 
and strengthen the relationships with our 
communities around the world. 
Last year, we completed the long and rigorous 
process leading to Symphony’s accreditation 
to the environmental standard ISO 14001, 
which complements our existing accreditation 
to ISO 9001 for Quality Management. We 
made a commitment to low-energy lighting,

and equipping our ofﬁces and laboratories 
with environmentally-friendly supplies. We 
promote paperless administration and work 
on the best practice document-management 
systems. We are committed to recycling of 
materials following the “reduce, reuse and 
recycle” principles. In addition, we have 
engaged most of our businesses in ﬁnding 
solutions for the world’s environmental 
problems, making us a responsible citizen 
of the world. 
We provide a nurturing business environment 
which offers our employees and distributors 
the ability to continuously develop their 
competences. We believe that education is 
essential, no matter the age, and we work 
on educational development of our people 
and the people of the world. 
Partnering for change
Symphony is proud to be a leader in advanced 
technologies that add to sustainable future. 
We are open and we always welcome 
collaboration with our suppliers, customers, 
communities, governments and civil society. 
We build relations with academic institutions, 
governments, NGOs and industry associations. 
With our strong commitment to the quality 
of life of future generations, we have engaged, 
for example, with Environmental Engineering 
Group, an NGO based in Serbia. For the second 
year we continue our successful cooperation, 
with a focus on raising awareness about 
environmental issues of today. 
Case study
Youth Encounter 
on Sustainability – 
Symphony and EEG
In July Symphony participated in an 
educational workshop at the Youth 
Encounter on Sustainability (YES) 
course in Koštunići, Serbia.
The YES course is an international 
programme which has been organised 
yearly in different countries for 12 
consecutive years. The course is held 
thanks to the cooperation of MIT University 
from the USA, ETH University from Zurich, 
Chalmers University from Sweden and the 
University of Tokyo. This is the second time 
that the YES course has been held in Serbia 
– with the cooperation of Environmental 
Engineering Group from Serbia and ACTIS 
from Switzerland.
Young professionals from all over the 
world whose work is focused on development 
and sustainability attended classes and 
workshops and met with government 
ofﬁcials. There were 27 participants 
from 16 countries – Australia, Bangladesh, 
India, Pakistan, Serbia, France, Finland, USA, 
Colombia, Brazil, Switzerland, Germany, Iran, 
Moldavia, Vietnam and Jordan. Symphony led 
a seminar discussing environmental issues, 
focusing on oxo-biodegradable plastic as a 
way to reduce the problem of plastic litter 
which can accumulate in the environment for 
decades. The participants were very pleased 
to learn about this exciting technology and 
will contribute to developing environmental 
solutions for their own countries. Symphony Environmental

The Directors present their report and the audited ﬁnancial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2012. 
Principal activities and business review
The primary business activities of the Group are the development and supply of environmental plastic products to a global market, 
and the development of waste to value projects. The Group also supplies other ﬂexible polythene and related products.
A review of the business and future developments is given in the Chairman’s Statement and Chief Executive’s Review.
The loss for the year after taxation amounted to £2,224,000 (2011: proﬁt £520,000).
Results and dividends
The trading results for the year and the Group’s ﬁnancial position at the end of the year are shown in the attached ﬁnancial statements.
The Directors have not recommended a dividend.
Key performance indicators
The Directors have monitored the progress of the overall Group strategy by reference to certain ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial key 
performance indicators.

Research and development
The Group is involved in the research and development of environmental plastic products, and waste to value systems.
The Directors and their interests
The Directors who served during the year and their interests in the shares of the Company are shown in the Remuneration Report.
Policy on the payment of creditors
It is the Group’s policy to settle the terms of payment with suppliers when agreeing the terms of the transaction and to ensure that suppliers 
are aware of these terms and abide by them. Trade payables at the year end amount to 112 days (2011: 86) of average supplies for the year 
for the Group and 17 days (2011: 57) for the Company. 
Principal risks and uncertainties
The Directors have identiﬁed and continually monitor the principal risks and uncertainties of the Group. These may change over time as new 
risks emerge and others cease to be of concern. The principal risks of the Group are detailed below.
Foreign exchange risk
The Group sells products in many countries and so generates revenues in US Dollars and Euros. Foreign exchange rates ﬂuctuate and, 
as such, assets created in foreign currencies are liable to constant revaluations into their Sterling equivalent. The Group mitigates this 
risk by purchasing, where practicable, in currencies to match revenues. The Group also has exchange facilities with its bank to use as 
and when appropriate.
Competition risk
The Group faces competition from suppliers of similar products which could affect revenues and/or gross margins. The Group mitigates 
this risk by employing a large number of distributors globally who can concentrate on any competition issues within their market, 
and also by differentiating the Group’s products by branding and marketing activities.
Raw material pricing and availability
The Group uses commodity and speciality materials in the make-up of its products. There is a risk of price volatility and material availability. 
The Group mitigates this risk by using more than one supplier of its products and continually researching separate supply alternatives for 
the materials used.

Directors’ responsibilities statement
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Directors’ Report and the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare ﬁnancial statements for each ﬁnancial year. Under that law, the Directors have elected to 
prepare the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (IFRSs). 
The parent Company’s own ﬁnancial statements continue to be prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable laws). Under company law the Directors must not approve the ﬁnancial 
statements unless they are satisﬁed that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs and proﬁt or loss of the Company and Group 
for that period. In preparing these ﬁnancial statements, the Directors are required to:
 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
 state whether applicable IFRSs or UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the ﬁnancial statements; and
 prepare the ﬁnancial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufﬁcient to show and explain the Company’s transactions 
and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the ﬁnancial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the ﬁnancial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for 
taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors conﬁrm that: 
 so far as each Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditor is unaware; and
 the Directors have taken all steps that they ought to have taken as Directors in order to make themselves aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the auditor is aware of that information.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and ﬁnancial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of ﬁnancial statements may differ from legislation 
in other jurisdictions. 
Going concern
The Group incurred losses during the year and its cash reserves have fallen since the end of the previous year. During the year, the Group 
changed its operating procedures so as to accelerate cashﬂows generated from revenues by way of improving letter of credit or proforma 
based business. During the year £0.45 million was generated from operations. In addition, revenues were reduced in 2012 due to over-
stocking within the distribution network in the previous year. With stocks within the distribution network now much lower, revenues for 2013 
have started at a higher rate than they did in 2012. Taking into account the above, the cashﬂow forecast that management has prepared 
for the ensuing twelve months where a forecast increase in sales will lead to increased cash through the invoice discount facility, and the 
banking facilities in place, the Directors are of the opinion that it is appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing 
these ﬁnancial statements.
Corporate governance
The Group is committed to developing and adhering to high standards of corporate governance. As an AIM listed company it is not required 
to comply with the UK Corporate Governance Code as issued by the UK’s Listing Authority. However, it seeks to follow the principles of good 
governance as far as management believes it is practical for a Group of its size, nature and circumstances. 
Financial risk management policies
The Group’s ﬁnancial risk management policies are detailed in note 3 to the ﬁnancial statements.
Auditor
A resolution to appoint Grant Thornton UK LLP as auditor for the ensuing year will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.

on the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards 
require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the ﬁnancial statements
A description of the scope of an audit of ﬁnancial statements is provided on the APB’s website at www.frc.org.uk/apb/scope/private.cfm.
Opinion on ﬁnancial statements
In our opinion:
 the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2012 
and of the Group’s loss for the year then ended; 
 the Group ﬁnancial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
 the parent Company ﬁnancial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice; and
 the ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Separate opinion in relation to IFRSs as issued by the IASB
As explained in note 2 to the Group ﬁnancial statements, the Group, in addition to complying with its legal obligation to apply 
IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, has also applied IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
In our opinion the Group ﬁnancial statements comply with IFRSs as issued by the IASB.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report for the ﬁnancial year for which the ﬁnancial statements are prepared 
is consistent with the ﬁnancial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
 adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or
 the parent company ﬁnancial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
 certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration speciﬁed by law are not made; or
 we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

1 General information
Symphony Environmental Technologies plc (“the Company”) and subsidiaries (together “the Group”) develop and supply environmental 
plastic additives and products, and develop waste to value systems.
The Company, a public limited company, is the Group’s ultimate parent company. It is incorporated and domiciled in England (Company 
number 3676824). The address of its registered ofﬁce is 6 Elstree Gate, Elstree Way, Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, WD6 1JD, England. 
The Company’s shares are listed on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange and as a level 1 ADR in New York.
2 Summary of signiﬁcant accounting policies
These consolidated ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union, issued and effective or issued as at 31 December 2012, and also comply with IFRS 
as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). 
The accounting policies have remained unchanged from the previous year. 
Going concern 
The Group incurred losses during the year and its cash reserves have fallen since the end of the previous year. During the year, the Group 
changed its operating procedures so as to accelerate cashﬂows generated from revenues by way of improving letter of credit or proforma 
based business. During the year £0.45 million was generated from operations. In addition, revenues were reduced in 2012 due to 
over-stocking within the distribution network in the previous year. With stocks within the distribution network now much lower, revenues 
for 2013 have started at a higher rate than they did in 2012. Taking into account the above, the cashﬂow forecast that management has 
prepared for the ensuing twelve months where a forecast increase in sales will lead to increased cash through the invoice discount facility, 
and the banking facilities in place, the Directors are of the opinion that it is appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing these ﬁnancial statements.
Business combinations completed prior to date of transition to IFRS
The Group has not restated business combinations which took place prior to the date of transition to IFRS.
Accordingly, the classiﬁcation of the combination remains unchanged from that used under UK GAAP. The assets and liabilities 
are recognised at date of transition, and are measured using their United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (GAAP) 
carrying amount.
Business combinations exemption
The Group ﬁnancial statements consolidate the ﬁnancial statements of the Company and all subsidiary undertakings. 
The acquisition of Symphony Environmental Limited (formerly Symphony Plastics Limited) on 9 December 1999 was accounted for 
under merger accounting under UK GAAP and has been treated in this manner under IFRS as the business combination exemption has 
been adopted in these Annual Report and Accounts. The merger accounting method requires assets and liabilities to not be adjusted to 
fair value and the results of the subsidiary to be included as if it had always been part of the Group. Therefore, the results of the Group 
include both the results pre and post-acquisition. 
Segment reporting 
In identifying its operating segments, management generally follows the Group’s service lines which represent the main products and 
services provided by the Group.
There are currently two service lines, “Plastics” and “Recycling Technologies (Recycling Tech)”. The Plastics service line includes all activities 
in relation to the sale of plastic products and their associated items. This includes the sale of plastic degradable additives, ﬁnished goods, 
non-degradable products and d
2
Detectors. The Recycling Technologies segment includes all activities involved in the development of tyre 
and rubber recycling systems.
Each of the operating segments is managed separately as each of these service lines requires different technologies and other resources 
as well as marketing approaches. All inter-segments transfers are carried out at arm’s length prices.
The measurement policies the Group uses for segment reporting under IFRS 8 are the same as those used in its ﬁnancial statements, except 
that one-off costs such as post-employment beneﬁt expenses are not included in arriving at the operating proﬁt of the operating segments. 
In addition, corporate assets which are not directly attributable to the business activities of any operating segment are not allocated to 
a segment. In the ﬁnancial periods under review, this primarily applies to available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets held by the Group.
Segment information is presented in accordance with IFRS 8 for all periods presented. IFRS 8 only requires disclosure of segment information.

Revenue
Degradable and non-degradable goods, and associated products (plastics segment) 
Revenue is stated at the fair value of the consideration receivable and excludes VAT and trade discounts.
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when all of the following conditions have been satisﬁed:
a)  ownership of the signiﬁcant risks and rewards has been transferred to the buyer whereby the Group relies on INCOTERMs (a series 
of pre-deﬁned commercial terms published by the International Chamber of Commerce) to assess this;
b) the amount of revenue can be measured effectively whereby the Group sells goods after receipt of conﬁrmed orders;
c) it is probable that the economic beneﬁts associated with the transaction will ﬂow to the entity; and
d) the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably.
Intangible assets
Research and development costs
Expenditure on research (or the research phase of an internal project) is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred. 
Development costs incurred on speciﬁc projects are capitalised when all the following conditions are satisﬁed:
 completion of the intangible asset is technically feasible so that it will be available for use or sale;
 the Group intends to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it;
 the Group has the ability to use or sell the intangible asset;
 the intangible asset will generate probable future economic beneﬁts. Among other things, this requires that there is a market for the output 
from the intangible asset or for the intangible asset itself, or, if it is to be used internally, the asset will be used in generating such beneﬁts;
 there are adequate technical, ﬁnancial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible asset; and
 the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development can be measured reliably.
Development costs not meeting the criteria for capitalisation are expensed as incurred.
The cost of an internally generated intangible asset comprises all directly attributable costs necessary to create, produce, and prepare the 
asset to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. The nature of the Group’s activities in the ﬁeld of development 
work renders some internally generated intangible assets unable to meet the above criteria at present.
Amortisation commences upon completion of the asset and is shown within administrative expenses and is included at the following rate:
d
2
w and other additives – 15 years straight line 
Careful judgement by the Directors is applied when deciding whether the recognition requirements for development costs have been met. 
This is necessary as the economic success of any product development is uncertain and may be subject to future technical problems at the 
time of recognition. Judgements are based on the information available at each balance sheet date. 
Trademarks
Trademarks represent the cost of registration and are carried at cost less amortisation.
Amortisation is calculated so as to write off the cost of an asset, less its estimated residual value, over the useful economic life of that 
asset as follows:
Trademarks – 10 years straight line
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of an asset, less its estimated residual value, over the useful economic life of that 
asset as follows:
Plant and machinery – 20% reducing balance
Fixtures and ﬁttings – 25% reducing balance
Fixtures and ﬁttings Elstree Gate – 10% straight line
Motor vehicles – 20% reducing balance
Ofﬁce equipment – 25% straight line
The residual value and useful economic lives are reconsidered annually.
Impairment testing of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identiﬁable cash ﬂows 
(cash-generating units). As a result, some assets are tested individually for impairment and some are tested at cash-generating unit level. 
Those intangible assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment at least annually. All other individual assets or cash-generating 
units are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s or cash-generating unit’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable 
amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value, reﬂecting market conditions less costs to sell, and value in use based on an 
internal discounted cash ﬂow evaluation. All assets are subsequently reassessed for indications that an impairment loss previously 
recognised may no longer exist.

2 Summary of signiﬁcant accounting policies (continued)
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value, after making due allowance for obsolete and slow moving items. 
Cost is determined on the basis of purchase value on a ﬁrst-in ﬁrst-out basis.
Leased assets
In accordance with International Accounting Standard (IAS) 17, the economic ownership of a leased asset is transferred to the lessee if the 
lessee bears substantially all the risks and rewards related to the ownership of the leased asset. The related asset is recognised at the time 
of inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments plus incidental 
payments, if any, to be borne by the lessee. A corresponding amount is recognised as a ﬁnance leasing liability. The interest element of leasing 
payments represents a constant proportion of the capital balance outstanding and is charged to proﬁt or loss over the period of the lease.
All other leases are regarded as operating leases and the payments made under them are charged to proﬁt or loss on a straight line basis 
over the lease term. Lease incentives are spread over the term of the lease.
Pension costs
The Group operates a deﬁned contribution pension scheme for employees. The assets of the scheme are held separately from those 
of the Group. The pension costs charged against proﬁts are the contributions payable to the scheme in respect of the accounting period.
Taxation
Current tax is the tax currently payable based on taxable proﬁt for the year.
Deferred income taxes are calculated using the liability method on temporary differences. Deferred tax is generally provided on the 
difference between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Tax losses available to be carried forward as well 
as other income tax credits to the Group are assessed for recognition as deferred tax assets.
Deferred tax liabilities are provided in full, with no discounting. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that the 
underlying deductible temporary differences will be able to be offset against future taxable income. Current and deferred tax assets and 
liabilities are calculated at tax rates that are expected to apply to their respective period of realisation, provided they are enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Changes in deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognised as a component of tax expense in proﬁt or loss, except where they either relate 
to items that are charged or credited directly to equity in which case the related deferred tax is also charged or credited directly to equity, 
or where they relate to items charged or credited in other comprehensive income the deferred tax change is recognised in other 
comprehensive income.
Foreign currencies
Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. 
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Exchange 
differences are taken into account in arriving at the operating result.
Financial assets
Financial assets are divided into the following categories: loans and receivables, and available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets. Financial assets 
are assigned to the different categories by management on initial recognition, depending on the purpose for which they were acquired. 
All ﬁnancial assets are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial assets are 
initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs. 
The Group currently has the following ﬁnancial assets:
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are categorised as loans and receivables. Trade receivables are non-derivative ﬁnancial assets with ﬁxed or determinable 
payments that are not quoted in an active market. Trade receivables are measured subsequent to initial recognition at amortised cost using 
the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. Any change in their value through impairment or reversal of impairment is 
recognised in proﬁt or loss.
Provision against trade receivables is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due to it in 
accordance with the original terms of those receivables. The amount of the write-down is determined as the difference between the asset’s 
carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash ﬂows.
Available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets
Available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets are non-derivative ﬁnancial assets that are either designated to this category or do not qualify for 
inclusion in any of the other categories of ﬁnancial assets. The Group’s available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets are the equity investments 
in Bin Hilal LLC, American Plastic Technologies LLC and Oxobioplast Inc.
The equity investments in Bin Hilal LLC, American Plastic Technologies LLC and Oxobioplast Inc. are measured at cost less any impairment 
charges, as their fair values cannot currently be estimated reliably. Impairment charges are recognised in proﬁt or loss.
Notes to the Annual Report and Accounts (continued) Symphony Environmental  
Technologies plc
Annual Report and  
Accounts 2012
 33
An assessment for impairment is undertaken at least at each balance sheet date.
A ﬁnancial asset is derecognised only where the contractual rights to the cash ﬂows from the asset expire or the ﬁnancial asset is transferred 
and that transfer qualiﬁes for derecognition. A ﬁnancial asset is transferred if the contractual rights to receive the cash ﬂows of the asset 
have been transferred or the Group retains the contractual rights to receive the cash ﬂows of the asset but assumes a contractual obligation 
to pay the cash ﬂows to one or more recipients. A ﬁnancial asset that is transferred qualiﬁes for derecognition if the Group transfers 
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset, or if the Group neither retains nor transfers substantially all the risks 
and rewards of ownership but does transfer control of that asset.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and demand deposits, together with other short-term, highly liquid investments that 
are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insigniﬁcant risk of changes in value.
Finance lease receivables
Goods sold under ﬁnance leases are recognised as a sale on date of the ﬁnance lease agreement or if later, when substantially all the risks 
and rewards of ownership of the asset have passed to the lessee. The capital element of future lessee obligations is included in assets in the 
statement of ﬁnancial position.
The interest elements of the rental obligations are credited to proﬁt and loss over the periods of the leases and represent a constant 
proportion of the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
Rentals receivable under operating leases are credited to proﬁt and loss on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are obligations to pay cash or other ﬁnancial assets and are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument. 
The Group’s ﬁnancial liabilities include trade payables, other payables, bank overdraft, bank loans and other loans. These are classiﬁed 
as ﬁnancial liabilities measured at amortised cost.
Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost are initially recognised at fair values net of direct issue costs. 
Finance charges are charged to proﬁt and loss, where applicable, on an accruals basis using the effective interest method and are added 
to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent they are not settled in the period in which they arose.
A ﬁnancial liability is derecognised only when the obligation is extinguished, that is, when the obligation is discharged or cancelled or expires.
Equity settled share-based payments
All share-based payment arrangements granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested prior to 1 January 2007 are recognised in the 
ﬁnancial statements.
All goods and services received in exchange for the grant of any share-based payment are measured at their fair values. Where employees 
are rewarded using share-based payments, the fair values of the instrument granted are determined using the Black-Scholes model. This fair 
value is appraised at the grant date. The fair value is charged to proﬁt and loss between the date of issue and the date the share options vest 
with a corresponding credit taken to equity.
Equity
Equity comprises the following:
 “Share capital” represents the nominal value of equity shares;
 “Share premium” represents the excess over nominal value of the fair value of consideration received for equity shares, net of expenses 
of the share issue; and
 “Retained earnings” represents non distributed reserves.
Standards and interpretations not yet effective
At the date of authorisation of these ﬁnancial statements, certain new standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards 
have been published but are not yet effective, and have not been adopted early by the Group.
Management anticipates that all of the pronouncements will be adopted in the Group’s accounting policy for the ﬁrst period beginning after 
the effective date of the pronouncement. Information on new standards, amendments and interpretations that are expected to be relevant 
to the Group’s ﬁnancial statements is provided below. Certain other new standards and interpretations have been issued but are not 
expected to have a material impact on the Group’s ﬁnancial statements.

2 Summary of signiﬁcant accounting policies (continued)
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (effective from 1 January 2015)
The IASB aims to replace IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement in its entirety with the replacement standard to be 
effective for annual periods beginning 1 January 2015. IFRS 9 is the ﬁrst part of Phase 1 of this project. The main phases are:
Phase 1: Classiﬁcation and Measurement
Phase 2: Impairment methodology
Phase 3: Hedge accounting
In addition, a separate project is dealing with derecognition. Management have yet to assess the impact that this amendment is likely to 
have on the ﬁnancial statements of the Group. However, they do not expect to implement the amendments until all chapters of the IAS 39 
replacement have been published and they can comprehensively assess the impact of all changes.
Consolidation Standards 
A package of consolidation standards are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013. Information on these new 
standards is presented below. 
- IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements (IFRS 10) 
IFRS 10 supersedes IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements (IAS 27) and SIC 12 Consolidation – Special Purpose Entities. 
It revised the deﬁnition of control together with accompanying guidance to identify an interest in a subsidiary. However, the requirements 
and mechanics of consolidation and the accounting for any non-controlling interests and changes in control remain the same. 
- IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements (IFRS 11) 
IFRS 11 supersedes IAS 31 Interests in Joint Ventures (IAS 31). It aligns more closely the accounting by the investors with their rights and 
obligations relating to the joint arrangement. In addition, IAS 31’s option of using proportionate consolidation for joint ventures has been 
eliminated. IFRS 11 now requires the use of the equity accounting method, which is currently used for investments in associates. 
- IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities (IFRS 12) 
IFRS 12 integrates and makes consistent the disclosure requirements for various types of investments, including unconsolidated structured 
entities. It introduces new disclosure requirements about the risks to which an entity is exposed from its involvement with 
structured entities. 
- Consequential amendments to IAS 27 and IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures (IAS 28) 
IAS 27 now only deals with separate ﬁnancial statements. IAS 28 brings investments in joint ventures into its scope. However, IAS 28’s equity 
accounting methodology remains unchanged. 
IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement (IFRS 13) 
IFRS 13 does not affect which items are required to be fair-valued, but clariﬁes the deﬁnition of fair value and provides related guidance and 
enhanced disclosures about fair value measurements. It is applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013.
The Group’s management have yet to assess the impact of these new standards.
3 Financial risk management
The main risks arising from the Group’s ﬁnancial instruments are liquidity risk, interest rate risk, currency risk and credit risk. The Directors 
review and agree policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below. These policies have remained unchanged from 
previous years. 
The Group’s ﬁnancial assets and liabilities are summarised as follows:

Interest rate risk
The Group seeks to reduce its exposure to interest rate risk where possible, but this is offset by the availability of trade ﬁnance arrangements 
which are transaction speciﬁc to meet liquidity needs and so have variable interest rate terms. 
Sensitivities have been looked at in the range of an absolute rate increase of 5% or a decrease of 1% which enable an objective calculation 
to be made depending on any interest rate changes in the future. Any rate changes would be outside the control of the Company.

Currency risk 
The Group operates in overseas markets and is subject to currency exposure on transactions undertaken during the year. The Group hedges 
the transactions where possible by buying goods and selling them in the same currency. The Group also has bank facilities available for 
hedging purposes.

Credit risk
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying value of ﬁnancial assets at the balance sheet date, summarised as follows:
2012  
£’000
2011  
£’000
Loans and receivables:
 Trade receivables 545 3,524
 Finance lease receivables 42 38
 Cash and cash equivalents 336 291
923 3,853
The credit risk associated with the cash is limited as the counterparties have high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating 
agencies. The principal credit risk arises therefore from trade receivables. The seven largest customer balances at the end of the year make 
up 77% (2011: 82%) of the above trade receivables.
In order to manage credit risk the Directors set limits for customers based on a combination of payment history, third party credit references 
and use of credit insurance. These limits are reviewed regularly.

Annual Report and  
Accounts 2012

The maturity of overdue debts is set out in note 16. During the period debts totalling £88,000 (2011: £nil) were written off. 
Capital requirements
Interest bearing loans and borrowings are monitored regularly to ensure the Group has sufﬁcient liquidity and its exposure to interest 
rate risk is mitigated. Management consider the capital of the Group comprises the share capital and interest bearing loans and borrowings. 
The Company satisﬁes the Companies Act 2006 requirement to hold £50,000 issued and authorised share capital. The rule that 25% must 
be paid up is also satisﬁed, by reference to note 18.
4 Critical accounting estimates and judgements
Estimates and judgements are evaluated continually and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations 
of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Although these estimates are based on management’s 
best knowledge of current events and actions, actual results may ultimately differ from those actions.
In preparing these accounts the following areas were considered to involve signiﬁcant judgement:
Recoverability of capitalised development cost
Judgements relating to capitalised development costs are detailed in note 12.
Share option judgements
Judgements relating to share-based payment charges are detailed in note 18.
Going concern
Judgements relating to going concern are detailed in note 2.
In preparing these accounts the following areas were considered to involve signiﬁcant estimates:
Bad debts
Provisions for bad debts are shown in note 16. Bad debt provisions are made when there is objective evidence of impairment. Where there 
is no provision then it is due to adequate credit insurance being in place, or cash has been received since the end of the year, or adequate 
information exists to support the recoverability of the debt.
Recognition of deferred tax assets
Estimates relating to a deferred tax asset are detailed in note 9a.
5 Segmental information
Management currently identiﬁes the Group’s two service lines as operating segments as further described in note 2. These operating 
segments are monitored and strategic decisions are made on the basis of adjusted segment operating results including one-off items 
such as employee settlement costs.

Deferred income tax asset carried forward 1,216 1,277
The deferred tax asset relates to tax losses. There are tax losses of approximately £12,900,000 (2011: £11,381,000).
Of these tax losses, a negative deferred tax adjustment of £61,000 has been recognised in this year’s accounts (2011: positive £229,000) 
resulting in a total asset recognised of £1,216,000 (2011: £1,277,000). There is a total potential tax asset of £2,967,000 using a rate of 23%, 
being the corporation tax rate Parliament has set from 1 April 2013.
The recognition of the deferred tax asset is based on sensitised forecasts. Judgements have been made in respect to continuation of proﬁtability 
going forward, and estimates made in relation to the sensitivities of future sales and foreign exchange rates.
10 (Loss)/earnings per share and dividends
The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on the (loss)/proﬁt attributable to ordinary shareholders divided by the weighted average 
number of shares in issue during the year. The calculation of diluted earnings per share is based on the basic earnings per share, adjusted to 
allow for the issue of shares on the assumed conversion of all dilutive options and warrants.
Reconciliations of the proﬁt and weighted average numbers of shares used in the calculations are set out below:
Basic and diluted 2012 2011
(Loss)/proﬁt attributable to equity holders of the Company £(2,224,000) £520,000
Weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue 127,907,254 123,853,985
Basic (loss)/earnings per share (1.74) pence 0.42 pence
Dilutive effect of weighted average options – 15,441,979 
Total of weighted average shares together with dilutive effect of weighted options 127,907,954 139,295,964
Diluted (loss)/earnings per share (1.74) pence 0.37 pence
No dividends were paid for the year ended 31 December 2012 (2011: £nil). 
The effect of options in 2012 are anti-dilutive.
18,181,570 options were outstanding at the end of the year which may become dilutive in future years.

The Group relies on the continued development of its product range and in so doing is maintaining satisfactory goals in fulﬁlling its strategy 
(see Chairman’s Statement and Chief Executive’s Review). After taking this into account together with the considerations of liquidity risk, 
see note 3, the Directors do not believe that there are any indicators of impairment.
Development costs are capitalised in accordance with the policy set out in note 2. In capitalising these costs, judgements are made relating 
to ongoing feasibility and commerciality of products and systems being developed. In making these judgements, cashﬂow forecasts are 
used and these include signiﬁcant estimates in respect to sales forecasts and future foreign exchange rates.

The company holds 30% of the ordinary share capital of Symphony Bin Hilal Plastics LLC, a company incorporated in the United Arab 
Emirates. The Directors are of the opinion that this is an investment as the Directors do not have signiﬁcant inﬂuence because they 
have no ﬁnancial or management control. A full impairment has been made against this during the year due to limited availability 
of ﬁnancial information.
The company holds 10% of the ordinary share capital of American Plastic Technologies plc, a company incorporated in the United States 
of America. The Directors are of the opinion that this is an investment as the Directors do not have signiﬁcant inﬂuence because they have 
no ﬁnancial or management control. The investment in American Plastics Technologies plc is measured at cost less impairment charges 
as the fair value cannot be estimated readily. The cost of this investment was £nil.
The company holds c.5% of the ordinary share capital of Oxobioplast Inc, a company incorporated in the United States of America. 
The Directors are of the opinion that this is an investment as the Directors do not have signiﬁcant inﬂuence because they have no ﬁnancial

The cost of inventories recognised as an expense and included in “cost of sales” amounted to £3,001,000 (2011: £4,052,000). There is no 
provision for the impairment of inventories (2011: £nil).

The Directors consider that the carrying value of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair values. There is a provision of 
£349,000 for the impairment of receivables (2011: £nil). The maximum credit risk exposure at the balance sheet date equates to the 
fair value of trade receivables. Further disclosures are set out in note 3.
Included in trade receivables at 31 December 2012 are debtors which are past due but where no provision has been made as there has 
not been a change in the credit worthiness of these debtors and the amounts are considered recoverable. As of 31 December 2012 trade 
receivables of £134,000 (2011: £556,000) were past due and not impaired. The ageing analysis of these trade receivables is as follows:
2012

More than three months but less than six months 76 220
More than six months but not more than one year 58 –

Due to the different markets that the Group operates in, trade terms vary from cash on shipment of goods to payment under letter of credit 
due 150 days from shipment.
Trade receivables are secured against the facilities provided by the Group’s bankers.
Lease agreements in which the other party, as lessee, is to be regarded as the economic owner of the leased assets give rise to accounts 
receivable in the amount of the discounted future lease payments. These receivables amounted to £42,000 as of 31 December 2012 
(2011: £38,000).

IFRS2 expense
There is an IFRS share-based charge for the year of £17,000 (2011: £29,000).
Fair value of options granted 
The fair values of options granted were determined using the Black-Scholes pricing model that takes into account factors speciﬁc to the 
share incentive plans. The following principal assumptions were used in the valuation during 2011. No options were granted in 2012.
2011
Weighted average exercise price £0.11
Calculated volatility 12%
Expected life 2–6 years
Average risk-free rate 3.50%
Expected dividends 0%
The underlying expected volatility was determined by reference to historical data of the Group’s shares over a period of time since 2005, 
being the year the Group changed strategy from being a supplier of ﬁnished products to one of development and supply of additives. 
No special features inherent to the options granted were incorporated into measurement of fair value.

24 Capital management
The Group’s capital management objectives are:
 to ensure the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern; and
 to provide an adequate return to shareholders by pricing products and services commensurately with the level of risk.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of the carrying amount of equity less cash and cash equivalents as presented on the face of the 
statement of ﬁnancial position.
The Group’s goal in capital management is to maintain a capital-to-overall ﬁnancing ratio of 1:1 to 1:3. 
The Group sets the amount of capital in proportion to its overall ﬁnancing structure, i.e. equity and ﬁnancial liabilities. The Group manages 
the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying 
assets. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital 
to shareholders, issue new shares, or sell assets to reduce debt.
Capital for the reporting periods under review is summarised as follows: 
2012  
£’000
2011  
£’000
Total equity 3,133 5,336
Cash and cash equivalents (336) (291)
Capital 2,797 5,045
Total equity 3,133 5,336
Borrowings 529 549
Overall ﬁnancing 3,662 5,885
Capital-to-ﬁnancing ratio 0.76 0.86
The ratio-decrease during 2012 is a result of the loss for the year. The Group will aim to improve the capital-to-ﬁnance ratio during 2013 
by increasing sales where possible to new emerging markets, coupled with the strengthening of the product portfolio.
25 Capital commitments
The Group had capital commitments totalling £33,000 at the end of the year (2011: £20,000). 
The following pages contain the balance sheet and accompanying notes for the parent Company prepared under UK GAAP.

Company number 3676824 Symphony Environmental  
Technologies plc
Annual Report and  
Accounts 2012

26 Principal accounting policies
Basis of accounting
The Company ﬁnancial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (GAAP).
Fixed assets
Tangible ﬁxed assets are stated at cost, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of an asset, less its estimated residual value, over the useful economic life of that 
asset as follows:
Plant and machinery – 20% reducing balance.
Fixtures and ﬁttings – 25% reducing balance.
Motor vehicles – 20% reducing balance.
Ofﬁce equipment – 25% straight line.
Leasing and hire purchase commitments
Assets held under ﬁnance leases, which are leases where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset have passed to the 
Company, and hire purchase contracts, are capitalised in the balance sheet and are depreciated over their useful lives. The capital elements 
of future obligations under the leases and hire purchase contracts are included as liabilities in the balance sheet.
The interest elements of the rental obligations are charged in the proﬁt and loss account over the periods of the leases and hire purchase 
contracts and represent a constant proportion of the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged in the proﬁt and loss account on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Pension costs
Company pensions are operated within the Group pension scheme. The Group operates a deﬁned contribution pension scheme for 
employees. The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group. The annual contributions payable in respect to the 
Company are charged to the proﬁt and loss account.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where 
transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less or to receive more tax, 
with the following exception: deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the Directors consider that it is more likely than 
not that there will be suitable taxable proﬁts from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences 
reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Foreign currencies
Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. 
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Exchange 
differences are taken into account in arriving at the operating proﬁt.
Investments
Investments are included at cost less amounts written off.
Financial instruments
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classiﬁed according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity 
instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the entity after deducting all of its ﬁnancial liabilities.
Where the contractual obligations of the ﬁnancial instruments (including share capital) are equivalent to a similar debt instrument, those 
ﬁnancial instruments are classiﬁed as ﬁnancial liabilities. Financial liabilities are presented as such in the balance sheet. Finance costs are 
calculated so as to produce a constant rate of return on the outstanding liability.
Where the contractual terms of share capital do not have any terms meeting the deﬁnition of a ﬁnancial liability then this is classiﬁed 
as an equity instrument. Dividends and distributions relating to equity instruments are debited direct to equity.
Equity-settled share-based payments
All share-based payment arrangements granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested prior to 1 January 2007 are recognised in the 
ﬁnancial statements.
All goods and services received in exchange for the grant of any share-based payment are measured at their fair values. Where employees 
are rewarded using share-based payments, the fair values are determined by reference to the fair value of the instrument granted to the 
employee. This fair value is appraised at the grant date and excludes the impact of non-market vesting conditions. The fair value is charged 
to the proﬁt and loss account between the date of issue and the date the share options vest with a corresponding credit taken to 
shareholders’ funds.

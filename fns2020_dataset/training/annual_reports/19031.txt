 ANNUAL REPORT AND 
ACCOUNTS 2015
Smart materials just got smarter. Front cover:
Smart materials just got smarter 
Around 40% of future aircraft weight will come from 
composite materials. In 2015, Meggitt acquired two advanced 
composites businesses with innovative products and mastery 
of the processes needed to deliver them—moves that 
substantively strengthen Meggitt’s ability to compete for 
content on next generation aircraft.
Meggitt’s smart engineering for 
extreme environments has resulted 
in the Group securing strong 
positions on the latest wave of new 
aircraft platforms. 2015 has been a 
year of consolidating these positions 
by focusing relentlessly on the  
product development processes 
and manufacturing capability 
needed to industrialise the 
unprecedented number of parts 
and sub-systems won from the 
current development cycle.
New products are being introduced faster than ever 
to our manufacturing facilities, supported by the 
Meggitt Production System which has now been 
launched at all major facilities. This combination  
of established business improvement techniques, 
which can be tailored to accommodate the rich 
diversity of Meggitt capabilities and facilities, 
defines our internal processes and, increasingly, 
the experiences of our customers.
Growing composites capabilities
The 2014 strategy review identified the fast-growing advanced 
composites market for aerospace as a key priority for the Group. 
Following a year-long market review, the two acquisitions 
announced in 2015 position Meggitt strongly on the new 
generation of engines that are now entering service. 
(See page 18). 
Reclaiming our aftermarket
Responding to the needs of our customers is critical to our growth 
ambitions. The formation of our Customer Services & Support 
(CSS) organisation in 2015 will make Meggitt more agile and easier 
to do business with in the increasingly dynamic aftermarket 
business environment. Its focus is on creating superb service 
throughout the lifecycle of our products so that our airline 
customers look to us as the suppliers who can help run their 
operations as cost-effectively as possible. (See page 20).
Why our Bronze is their Gold
The first Meggitt operating facility to enter the fourth—Bronze—
stage of the Meggitt Production System is the Singapore-based hub 
of the Group’s new Customer Services & Support organisation. In 
addition to the requirement that customers be completely satisfied, 
this exacting Meggitt phase is the point at which we expect to start 
seeing meaningful financial benefits arising from enhanced 
operating efficiency. (See page 22).
Communicate, collaborate, create
The foundation of Meggitt’s performance culture is increasingly 
based on delegating decision-making as far down the hierarchy 
as possible where problems are resolved by the teams who 
understand them most. The technique of Daily Layered 
Accountability or ‘DLA’ and new ‘value streams’ are playing a role 
at all levels, enabling Meggitt to respond quickly to customer and 
market needs, while stimulating our employees’ careers through 
the promotion of early responsibility. (See page 24). Download the 2015 Meggitt PLC Annual Report

Meggitt’s 2015 results reflect the  
effects of significant volatility in the  
civil aerospace aftermarket and 
pressure from the low oil price on our 
energy businesses. However, we are a 
long-term business. Our installed base 
on over 64,000 aircraft worldwide, with 
a strong and growing presence on the 
wave of new aerospace platforms 
entering into service over the next few 
years, demonstrates the fundamental 
strength of our business model, and 
gives us confidence in making good 
progress in the years to come.

156768.01 Text 001-047-NEW-06.03.16.indd   4 07/03/2016   04:15 Chairman’s statement
Difficult trading conditions in several 
end-markets made 2015 a challenging 
year for Meggitt, with weakness in energy 
and slower than expected growth in civil 
aftermarket impacting results. However, 
the Group made good progress with a 
number of key strategic initiatives targeted 
at improving our operational efficiency and 
market access. 
The Meggitt Production System, our global 
approach to continuous improvement, has 
now been launched at virtually all Meggitt 
facilities. We are very pleased with the 
operational improvements we have seen 
so far, and the programme is gaining 
excellent traction both inside the Group 
and with our suppliers and customers. 
We formed a new aftermarket organisation 
to respond better to the requirements of 
our customers, who are looking for 
long-term partnerships and strategies to 
improve airline economics. We also 
strengthened our capability in aerospace 
composites with two high-quality 
acquisitions, both of which will deliver 
good growth on new platforms entering 
into service over the coming years. 
Results
In 2015, Group revenue increased by 6% to 
£1,647.2 million, driven largely by foreign 
currency translation, with organic revenue 
flat. Underlying operating profit decreased 
by 6% to £325.5 million and underlying 
earnings per share by 2% to 31.6 pence. 
While this was a solid performance given 
difficult trading conditions, it was below our 
expectations and those of our stakeholders. 
The cash-generative nature of the Group’s 
activities remained unchanged, however, 
and 2015 saw a good improvement in free 
cash flow to £199.0 million, even with the 
continuing high levels of investment in the 
business arising from an unprecedented 
level of new business won during the 
recent bid cycle. 
Dividend 
The Board is proposing a final dividend of 
9.80 pence per share (2014: 9.50 pence 
per share), taking the full-year dividend to 
14.40 pence per share (2014: 13.75 pence 
per share). This is a 5% increase for the 
year, reflecting the Board’s progressive 
dividend policy and continuing confidence 
in the Group’s medium-term growth and 
cash generation prospects. 
Investing for growth
Our continued investment in technology 
will ensure the future growth of the 
business. In 2015, research and 
development expenditure comprised  
9.6% of revenue or £158.7 million (2014: 
£148.3 million), of which £26.8 million  
was funded by customers. The vast 
majority of this investment supports 
positions secured on future aerospace 
platforms and will continue at an elevated 
level during 2016 before declining as the 
wave of programmes in development 
starts to enter commercial service.  
These investments have a very attractive 
payback and will support revenue growth 
for many years.
Corporate governance and  
the Board 
The Board recognises that good corporate 
governance is a major contributor to the 
delivery of strong Group performance, 
and is therefore committed to maintaining 
the highest standards at Board level. As 
part of the normal evolution of the Board, 
there were a few changes since the last 
annual report. In April 2015, Sir Colin 
Terry retired after 12 years on the Board 
and I succeeded him as Chairman. In 
October, we welcomed Colin Day to the 
Board as non-executive director and 
Chairman of the Audit Committee. After 
over nine years as non-executive director, 
most recently as senior independent 
director, David Williams retired at the  
end of the year and Paul Heiden was 
appointed senior independent director 
with effect from January 2016. I would 
like to take this opportunity to thank  
Sir Colin and David for their significant 
contributions to the business and wish 
them well for the future. 
Our people
People are central to the success of any 
business. All deserve to work in safe 
environments and reach their full 
potential. Meggitt’s safety record at every 
facility has benefited in recent years from 
the establishment of global standards, 
measurement and direction, and in 2015, 
for instance, we saw a 20% decrease in 
lost-time incidents in the workplace. The 
Meggitt Production System’s success is 
predicated on harnessing talent at every 
level in the organisation. We continue to 
invest in the delivery of superior graduate 
training, with an international rotation 
programme attracting high-calibre 
individuals from leading engineering 
faculties worldwide. After launching it 
three years ago, our first cohort 
graduated in October 2015 after making 
significant contributions to technology 
development, engineering programmes 
and a range of projects in their non-
engineering rotation. Given the wide-
ranging nature of our production system 
implementation, we have extended the 
programme with the addition of an 
operations excellence stream, now in its 
second year of admissions. 
I would like to take this opportunity to 
extend my warm thanks to all employees 
for their outstanding commitment during 
the Group’s challenging year.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE REPORTS STRATEGIC REPORT 5 End market weakness 
presents challenges in 
any business. Our 
focus on superior 
performance, defined 
by quality, cost and 
on-time delivery, will 
help us grow faster 
than the markets in

Group strategy
Meggitt is a leading provider of smart 
engineering for extreme environments. 
Our strategy involves investing in 
technologies and capabilities targeted at 
high-growth, complex and highly 
regulated markets, underpinned by 
market-leading levels of operational 
excellence. Our aim is to deliver financial 
performance exceeding that of our target 
markets, enabling us to reinvest for 
future growth while generating attractive 
returns for shareholders.
Technology 
The technology component of our strategy 
is designed to drive organic growth 
through targeted investment in key 
products and manufacturing capabilities 
aligned with our customers’ technology 
roadmaps. We invest where we have 
pedigree and where we can add most 
value to customers and shareholders.   
We aim to supplement organic growth 
with targeted acquisitions that enhance 
our capabilities and routes to market. 
A year of record spend on research and 
development in 2015 ensured we are set 
to support the entry into service of many 
new platforms including the re-engined 
narrowbody aircraft from Boeing and 
Airbus, the Bombardier C-Series and a 
wide range of business jets. 
Meggitt’s applied research and 
technology activity, conducted at a 
divisional level, supports product 
development for new and existing 
applications. This has been supplemented 
with dedicated central funding for the 
development of cutting-edge technologies 
for next-generation platforms, which we 
have been successful in augmenting 
through grants from governments and 
industry. This funding source has enabled 
us to boost our progress in projects such 
as additive layer manufacturing, a 
technology which is now used in our 
production facilities. Under the EU Clean 
Sky initiative, we are a core partner, 
leading a consortium of parties 
developing Green Airframe Icing Novel 
Systems (GAINS) for energy-efficient 
anti-ice technology for next-generation 
aircraft. We continued to invest in Meggitt 
Modular Modifiable Manufacturing (M

), 
our pioneering approach to the factories 
of the future. M

 is designed to enable 
operators to manufacture a broader 
range of low-volume, highly complex 
components to a consistently high 
standard. It deploys smart tools and big 
data for real-time monitoring of key 
parameters such as product weight and 
touch-time. The resulting optimisation of 
all aspects of the manufacturing process 
from machining and assembly to machine 
utilisation and traceability is hugely 
beneficial, particularly in an aerospace 
environment. M
4
 projects have already 
been seeded in several Meggitt factories 
in the UK with many more to come in 
future years.   
Investing in these and other new 
technologies is becoming an increasingly 
important activity for aerospace 
equipment suppliers, as customers 
require ever greater levels of technology 
readiness prior to awarding work on new 
aircraft platforms. 
Our acquisitions of the composites 
businesses of EDAC and Cobham plc 
exemplify targeted, value-added portfolio 
enhancement. These two transactions, 
both of which completed in the fourth 
quarter of 2015, build on our existing 
composite component technology, 
broadening our reach beyond airframe and 
anti-ice products into high-growth, higher 
temperature engine products. They have 
established positions on a range of 
significant new platforms including the 
PurePower, F135 and LeapX engines. The 
integration of these businesses into the 
Group is just starting, but we are 
encouraged by what we have seen to date 
and delighted to welcome 1,148 new 
employees to the Meggitt family.
Operations excellence
Superior performance, defined by quality, 
cost and on-time delivery, is another key 
to realising our growth potential and we 
are determined to make operations 
excellence a core competitive strength. 
The Meggitt Production System – our 
global approach to continuous 
improvement – has progressed well since 
its inception in 2013, with the initial 
launch now complete at all main 
manufacturing facilities. We have seen 
meaningful improvements in operating 
performance such as Defective Parts Per 
Million down 87% and on-time delivery up 
14%. Two sites have now successfully 
exited the third phase of the six-phase 
programme, which extends the system 
beyond the factory floor, supply chain and 
programme management, and into 
functions and leadership. We expect 
further progress toward this level of 
maturity during 2016. This is the stage 
at which we expect to start seeing 
meaningful financial benefits arising  
from enhanced operating efficiency.  
Chief Executive’s review
6 MEGGITT PLC          REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015
156768.01 Text 001-047-NEW-06.03.16.indd   6 07/03/2016   04:15 We have continued to invest in low-cost 
manufacturing centres in China and 
Mexico. In 2015, we acquired a new site 
next to our existing Vietnam factory 
enabling us to increase capacity 
significantly. The operational focus for 
the next two years is to ensure we are 
equipped to accelerate production to 
support the rapid growth of new aircraft 
programmes, following which we will 
accelerate our work on footprint 
optimisation.
Renewing our customer focus
Making ourselves easy to do business 
with is central to our business philosophy. 
During 2015, we dedicated a senior 
executive to the requirements of our 
original equipment customers and 
another to the aftermarket. 
Original equipment manufacturers are 
seeing a renewed focus on their priorities. 
Transactional relationships with 
procurement teams at key engine and 
airframers in Europe, the US and China are 
giving way to the collaborative, technology-
led discussions needed to deliver positions 
on next generation platforms. At the same 
time, refined key account strategies are 
enabling us to bring together cross-group 
product packages that simplify their supply 
chains today.    
We established a Customer Services & 
Support (CSS) organisation designed to 
strengthen revenue growth through 
better customer support and satisfaction 
in the aftermarket, which is central to the 
Meggitt aerospace business model. CSS 
will centralise much of our customer-
facing aftermarket resource and will 
enhance our relationships with 
customers. CSS is also working on a 
range of initiatives including building a 
greater presence in the market for 
maintaining, repairing and overhauling 
our own components, consolidating our 
global distribution network and engaging 
directly in the surplus parts market via 
strategic partnerships. As these activities 
will enable us to build greater knowledge 
of changing market behaviour and the 
in-service performance of our products, 
we will be able to maximise Meggitt 
revenue across the product lifecycle by 
focusing on profitable modification and 
retrofit opportunities. 
Performance in 2015
Our end markets experienced a 
challenging year in 2015. Growth in civil 
aerospace was lower than expected, with 
organic civil OE revenue growth of 4% 
reflecting lower growth in deliveries of 
new aircraft, and 3% organic growth in 
aftermarket demonstrating weakness in 
large jet spares from increased surplus 
market activity, more than offset by good 
growth in business jet aftermarket. 
Military revenues saw a good recovery in 
the first half from a weak 2014. However, 
the second half was hampered by the 
Continuing Resolution put in place in 
September in the US ahead of the 
agreement of the full-year 2016 budget, 
resulting in a flat year overall. As 
anticipated, energy revenues saw a 
further decline, with the offshore oil and 
gas-focused Heatric business having a 
particularly challenging year as continued 
oil price weakness impacted its 
customers’ appetites for investment. The 
power generation part of our energy 
business saw good growth in the first half 
but the second half was weaker, driven by 
reduced investment by our customers, 
primarily utility companies. 
Against this background, organic revenue 
was flat. Underlying earnings per share 
decreased by 0.8p to 31.6p reflecting 
adverse business mix in the year from the 
weaker than expected aftermarket 
performance, particularly in the higher 
margin old aircraft spares, partially offset 
by the benefits from foreign exchange and 
the share buyback. Contribution from the 
acquisitions completed late in the year 
was not significant at the earnings level. 
Net debt to EBITDA at the end of the year 
was 2.3x (2014: 1.2x). The increase from 
last year reflects the effect of the 
aggregate £509m spend on acquisitions 
and the share buyback, and lower profit. 
Outlook
The outlook for our civil markets is 
encouraging. Production of large jets is 
expected to continue to grow in the 
medium term, and the high and growing 
shipset values we enjoy on the latest 
generation of large jets support organic 
civil OE revenue growth over the medium 
term ahead of the overall market growth. 
In 2016, we expect civil OE to grow 
organically in the low- to mid-single-digit 
percentage range, and for the composites 
acquisitions to add a further 20%.
Available seat kilometres, an important 
driver of our large and regional jet 
aftermarket, are growing at above the 
long-term trend. In combination with the 
expected output from the CSS 
organisation, which will enable us to 
address some of the areas of weakness 
we have seen in recent years, we expect 
to be able to outgrow the market for civil 
spares in the medium term. Shorter term, 
however, we anticipate a continued impact 
from the availability of surplus parts. This 
is expected to limit organic aftermarket 
growth in 2016 to low- to mid-single 
digits, with a further modest negative 
impact from revenue mix.
In military markets, we look to be 
entering a more benign phase with 
military budgets returning to growth for 
the first time in a number of years. We 
believe our strong technology offering 
and broad platform and customer 
exposure will enable us to outgrow the 
overall military market over the medium 
term, but we maintain a relatively 
cautious stance for 2016 reflecting 
weaker orders in 2015 and our view that it 
will take some time for cash to flow on the 
back of the recently agreed 2016 budget in 
the US. We therefore anticipate organic 
growth in the low-single-digit percentage 
range, with a further 10% from the 
composites acquisitions.
Our energy businesses have been 
impacted by the global slowdown in 
investment following the decline in the oil 
price, and we expect that this weakness 
will continue through 2016 resulting in 
further organic revenue decline, although 
the cost reduction activities we have 
initiated, and recently intensified, will 
partially mitigate the financial impact of 
this decline. Medium term, however, the 
strong technology franchise in Heatric 
and growth opportunities in energy 
condition monitoring give us confidence 
that our energy revenues will resume 
their growth trajectory.  
On the basis of the above, the Group 
expects organic revenue growth in 2016 of 
low-single-digit percentage points, in line 
with the guidance given in December, with 
revenue phasing expected to return to 
normal levels. The headcount reduction 
programme will offset the negative mix 
impact in the civil aftermarket. The

Business model
We deliver strong and sustainable 
shareholder returns over the long term 
through leading positions in aerospace, 
defence and energy markets, secured on 
the basis of our intellectual property and 
proprietary manufacturing capabilities.
We develop and manufacture components 
and sub-systems to enhance the 
performance of airframes, engines and 
other high value industrial plant. Revenue 
comes from successfully executing original 
equipment programmes (often sole-source) 
and maximising revenue from the 
aftermarket opportunities that flow from 
the wear and tear associated with the harsh 
environments in which our products 
operate. High quality services and support 
and close relationships with operators 
deliver the field performance data needed to 
improve existing products and create next 
generation technologies.

We develop technology for applications with product life-cycles 
measured in decades. Products must perform without fail in 
environmental extremes, requiring replacement or overhaul, 
generating strong returns from our initial investment over 
many years.
Our business model requires significant cash investment in the 
development phase of programmes. For our wheels and brakes 
business, we often supply equipment free of charge to the 
original equipment manufacturer. We deliver strong positive 
cashflow within our civil aerospace and military end-markets 
during the in-service phase, resulting in a cumulative cash 
break-even period between years 11 and 18 typically, with a 
shorter cash break-even in the energy market where up front 
investments are lower.
As our products are developed in line with our customers’ 
technology goals, we have performed strongly in recent bid 
cycles, securing positions on key platforms and refreshing the 
long-term aftermarket pipeline. In the near-term, our business 
is focused on the delivery of new development programmes and 
the transition of new products to full run-rate manufacturing, 
the source of sustainable growth over the long term.

Market review
Meggitt’s core civil aerospace, military 
and energy markets share a common 
requirement for smart engineering for 
extreme environments: mission- and 
safety-critical components and sub-
systems that operate flawlessly for many 
years in highly demanding operating 
conditions, from a supplier capable of 
meeting rigorous certification 
requirements. The extreme environments 
in which many of our products operate 
results in high levels of wear and tear, 
which drives aftermarket revenues 
stretching out for many decades from 
initial product delivery.
Civil aerospace 
Civil aerospace accounts for 49% of Group 
revenue, with products and sub-systems 
installed on almost every jet airliner, 
regional aircraft and business jet in 
service. The global fleet of aircraft has 
grown significantly in recent years, 
totalling over 44,000 aircraft today versus 
32,000 a decade ago. New aircraft 
deliveries drive sales of original 
equipment and aircraft utilisation 
generates demand for spare parts and 
repairs over many decades, so the growth 
of our fleet is a strong indication of future 
aftermarket revenue growth. 
Original equipment 
We classify civil aircraft by seat capacity: 
large jets (>100 seats), regional aircraft 
(<100 seats) and business jets. 
Large jet deliveries in 2015 stood at a 
record 1,389, 1% higher than in 2014. 
Future growth estimated at an average of 
5-6% per annum is underpinned by the 
order books of Boeing and Airbus, the two 
major civil aircraft manufacturers, which 
extend to eight years at current production 
levels, with other manufacturers investing 
in the large jet market including 
Bombardier, Sukhoi and COMAC. The  
high level of demand for new aircraft, 
deliveries of which have grown at an 
average of over 8% during the last five 
years, has been driven in part by high oil 
prices, the relatively low cost of debt and 
the wave of newer, more fuel-efficient 
aircraft coming to market including 
Boeing’s 737MAX, Airbus’ A320neo and 
the CSeries from Bombardier. Despite the 
recent decrease in oil prices, the strong 
order backlogs mean that no significant 
reduction in new aircraft demand is 
expected in the short term. 
Regional aircraft deliveries of 297 in 2015 
represented a 10% increase on 2014, with 
an increasing proportion of these being 
70-plus seat aircraft where we have a 
particularly strong market share. 
Deliveries look set to continue at this level 
over the medium term. Regional fleets 
outside North America account for over 
50% of the global fleet, up from 10% a 
decade ago. 
Business jet deliveries totalled 717, a 6% 
increase on 2014, although considerably 
below the peak in 2008. Inventories of 
used aircraft are continuing to decline, 
although falling commodity prices are 
likely to reduce demand in the near term. 
As with regional aircraft, the fleet is 
becoming increasingly global—customers 
in the Americas currently comprise 75% 
of the global business jet fleet but order 
trends suggest this will move to around 
60% over the next decade. Ten years ago, 
the Americas represented 84% of the 
global fleet. Over the medium term, we 
see deliveries continuing to recover, 
driven by increasing globalisation and an 
improving economic growth outlook in 
developed economies, enhanced by the 
large number of new aircraft models due 
to enter into service in the coming years. 
Meggitt performance
Meggitt’s civil original equipment (OE) 
revenue grew organically by 4% in 2015, 
with good growth in 737 and A320 families 
of aircraft and initial OE revenue from the 
A350XWB offsetting modest reductions in 
A330 and A380 platforms. Large jet 
deliveries drive the majority of our OE 
revenues, involving the supply of products 
and sub-systems on engines and 
airframes covering thermal management 
and fluid control, fire protection, 
condition-monitoring and high-integrity 
electronics. Our largest exposure to 
regional aircraft and business jets is 
through our wheels and brakes business, 
which provides most original equipment 
Market matrix
Meggitt benefits from a balanced portfolio. Capability-based business units deploy 
technological know-how and intellectual property across all our markets so we are not 
dependent on single customers, individual programmes or market segments.

subsequent harvesting of serviceable 
components from these aircraft. The 
impact of spare parts harvesting, or 
surplus parts, has intensified in recent 
years, driven by increased availability of 
parked aircraft which can be broken up 
and heightened sophistication in third 
party repair and distribution capability, 
which has caused a greater than expected 
dislocation between aircraft utilisation 
and aftermarket demand. Recent 
organisational changes have been made 
in the Group with the formation of CSS, 
which will leave us better equipped to 
directly address the surplus parts issue. 
Meggitt performance
Meggitt’s organic aftermarket revenue 
was up 3% for the year, with 5% growth in 
the first half decelerating to 2% growth in 
the second. Air traffic was good given the 
previously referenced 5.8% ASK growth. 
However, aftermarket revenue growth 
overall was held back by the parting out 
of old aircraft resulting from the high 
delivery rates of new, more fuel-efficient 
aircraft. Large jet aftermarket, where the 
effect of parting out is most pronounced, 
particularly in components with 
long lifecycles, saw flat revenue on 
an organic basis.
Regional aircraft and business jets are 
important contributors to the Group’s 
aftermarket revenue. The continued 
increase in fleet size and recovery in 
regional aircraft utilisation in 2015 
boosted overall aftermarket growth.

Source: Meggitt management estimates
free of charge to civil aircraft 
manufacturers. Strong OE performance 
is also driven by shipset values on new 
aircraft which exceed those of their 
predecessors. Order books and delivery 
forecasts remain robust and lend 
confidence in organic growth prospects 
ahead of the market growth rate over the 
medium term. 
Aftermarket
The civil aerospace aftermarket is driven 
primarily by aircraft utilisation which,  
for large jets and regional aircraft, is 
measured using available seat kilometres 
(ASKs). We use take-offs and landings as 
a proxy for business jet utilisation. 
ASKs in the commercial aircraft fleet 
grew 5.8% in 2015, above the 5% long-
term average. The Middle East and Asia 
saw particularly strong growth, with the 
US market showing a steady recovery. 
Regional aircraft utilisation picked up 
noticeably, driven by the recovery in North 
America. Business jet utilisation in the US 
and Europe continued to exhibit the 
gradual improvement seen for the last 
two years, with take-offs and landings in 
2015 up by over 2% versus 2014. We would 
normally expect our aftermarket 
revenues to follow these leading 
indicators after a lag of a few months. 
However, revenue can be impacted by 
short-term perturbations including 
destocking or restocking cycles, 
increased pooling of spares between 
airlines and MRO providers and excess 
spare part inventory arising from the

Our regional aircraft aftermarket  
revenue grew organically by 4% in the 
year, with business jet aircraft revenue  
up 11% organically.
Aircraft utilisation remains very 
encouraging, with ASKs now tracking 
comfortably above the long-term average. 
The reduction we have seen in aircraft 
retirements over the last twelve months 
is an encouraging indicator that the 
headwind we have been experiencing 
from the parting out of older aircraft may 
subside over time, although we expect the 
negative impact of parting out to persist 
through 2016. Over the medium term, 
however, we maintain confidence in our 
ability to grow aftermarket revenue  
above the broader civil spares market. 
Military 
Military accounts for 35% of Group 
revenue. Meggitt has equipment on around 
21,000 aircraft and a variety of ground 
vehicles, naval vessels and training 
installations worldwide. During 2015, 58% 
of our military revenue came from US 
customers, with 26% from Europe and  
16% from the rest of the world. 
Defence budgets in some key markets 
remained under pressure in 2015, notably 
in the US where the effect of recent 
budget cuts and the Continuing Resolution 
in the latter part of the year impacted the 
timing and size of orders. Declining 
commodity prices have also had an impact 
on budgets in the Middle East, although 
European markets remained stable. The 
overall outlook for defence spending, 
however, is more positive than it has been 
for a number of years, with a recently 
agreed budget increase in the US budget 
spread over 2016 and 2017 and modest 
increases in European budgets in 
response to greater perceived threat 
levels resulting in a more benign 
budgetary environment than has been 
seen since the financial crisis in 2008/9. 
While we do not expect an immediate 
rebound in military expenditure, driven in 
part by weaker orders in 2015 and the 
anticipated lag between budget approval 
and cash deployment, opportunities 
remain for the reset and upgrade of 
repatriated equipment and the supply  
of new products as a significant tranche  
of military assets reach the end of their 
service lives. 
Meggitt performance 
Meggitt’s military revenue was flat on an 
organic basis in 2015, with good growth  
in the first half being offset by a weaker 
second half. The second half weakness 
reflected tougher comparators, the timing 
of programme deliveries and the US DoD 
entering a period of Continuing Resolution.
Our exposure to a broad range of fixed and 
rotary wing aircraft, ground vehicles, 
training facilities and naval vessels across 
original equipment and aftermarket spares 
and repairs has enabled us to demonstrate 
resilience in a challenging environment 
over the last few years. Military markets 
look to be entering a more benign 
environment now, with budgets in many 
regions expected to return to growth for 
the first time in a number of years. This  
will present opportunities through the 
expansion of the fleet of programmes on 
which we have good content, such as the 
F-35 and Rafale, as well as retrofit work 
arising following the repatriation of 
equipment from the recent conflict in 
Afghanistan, and the reinvestment in 
military training systems for a number  
of armed forces, where we have seen 
considerable contract success in recent 
years. Accordingly, we are targeting 
organic revenue growth in the low-single-
digit percentage range in the medium term. 
Energy 
Our energy business accounted for 9% of 
Group revenue in 2015. We target power 
generation and oil and gas markets with 
condition-monitoring hardware and 
software, control valves for aero-derivative 
gas turbines and microturbines, and printed 
circuit heat exchanger technology. 
The overall energy market was very 
challenging in 2015. Lower demand for 
new equipment and deferrals of capital 
projects in oil and gas markets reflected 
the impact of lower commodity prices on 
the investment appetite of exploration  
and production companies. The market 
has also seen reduced demand for gas 
turbines used in power generation,  
driven by reduced investment by utilities.
Longer term, however, the power 
generation market remains very 
attractive, with increasing global demand 
for power driven by population growth 
and increasing levels of industrialisation 
in emerging economies. Meanwhile, the 
structural demand drivers for the oil  
and gas market remain strong. Gas, 
particularly is a relatively low-cost 
high-efficiency energy source, and our 
Heatric product fulfils a core 
technological requirement of this market. 
There are also significant opportunities 
for Heatric, our printed circuit heat 
exchanger business, outside of its core  
oil and gas market, including in power 
generation where a contract for the 
provision of heat exchangers for an 
innovative power station design is 
currently being fulfilled. 
Meggitt performance 
Meggitt’s energy revenue declined 20% 
on an organic basis in 2015. Sales to 
power generation customers increased 
modestly, with a good recovery from a 
weak 2014 in the first half of the year 
tailing off through the second half as 
investment budgets became more 
constrained. Revenue at Heatric, which 
accounts for 35% of our overall energy 
revenue, declined by 40% as the 
investment projects of our oil and gas 
customers were deferred following the 
reduction in the oil price. 
Heightened demand for our printed circuit 
heat exchangers driven by a strong 
project pipeline and increasing market 
share in condition-monitoring equipment 
should continue to deliver strong revenue 
growth over the medium term. In the 
short term, however, we anticipate 
modest growth in energy control valves 
and condition monitoring to be more than 
offset by further weakness at Heatric, 
where further project deferrals are 
anticipated as capital expenditure 
budgets continue to be pared back.

LEAP forward in operating economics
Eight Meggitt extreme environment sensors, 
measuring vibration, speed, temperature and fluid 
level, are being integrated inside the LEAP, the 
fastest-selling aero-engine in aviation history. These 
measurements detect nascent engine conditions and 
prevent catastrophic failures. However, as core 
health monitoring tools, our sensors also boost 
day-to-day operating economics. Maintenance can  
be planned cost-effectively based on component 
condition, maximising product life on wing. And fuel 
burn deterioration rates can be extrapolated. This 
enables airlines to rotate aircraft around their 
networks, ensuring newly refurbished engines that 
consume less fuel are scheduled for routes where 
efficiency really counts. 
Capabilities
• High-performance sensing in extreme environments
•  Condition and health monitoring for air and land-based machinery
• Power generation, conversion and storage
•  Aircraft surveillance and security systems
• Aircraft ground manoeuvring collision prevention
•  Wireless emergency systems
• Standby flight displays and air data systems
Growth strategy
•  Develop leading-edge sensing and condition-monitoring 
technologies to minimise emissions, conserve fuel, optimise 
engine performance and manage maintenance efficiently 
•  Use our aerospace experience to offer innovative new products  
to the energy and industrial sectors whilst expanding our sales 
and aftermarket services in high-growth markets

Meggitt Training Systems looks beyond the defence 
arena to drive innovation into its virtual small arms 
training systems, adopting gaming industry engines 
for the ultimate in realistic training scenarios. Known 
for the unsettling realism of combat scenarios in 
far-flung territories, it also creates virtual worlds 
nearer home, simulating the live-fire ranges of 
specific US military bases. There are economic and 
environmental imperatives. Ammunition is expensive 
and polluting. After using a Meggitt virtual training 
system, soldiers progress to live-fire ranges, 
qualifying faster, using fewer bullets. Our newest 
small arms trainer is the system-of-record for the 
US Army, US Marine Corps and the defence 
ministries of the UK, Canada and Australia.

156768.01 Text 001-047-NEW-06.03.16.indd   17 07/03/2016   04:15 At the close of 2015, Meggitt acquired two new 
businesses in one of the fastest growing sectors  
of aerospace—advanced carbon fibre composites. 
This exemplifies a sharp focus on strategic investment 
in higher growth market segments with attractive 
fundamentals and the potential to lead the market 
through differentiated technology and advanced 
manufacturing processes.  
P
rotecting helicopter engine air  
inlets and mission-critical flight 
components from the effects of ice 
build-up is the geometric and thermal 
challenge in which Meggitt Polymers & 
Composites has excelled for 50 years. 
With its complete understanding of 
thermosetting composite materials—
which it also applies to structures and 
specialist assemblies resistant to 
corrosion, lightning strikes and fatigue—
the division remains the industry’s 
leading supplier.   
This is the core of expertise Meggitt has 
extended through the acquisition of the 
advanced composites businesses of 
Cobham plc (Advanced Composites) and 
EDAC. The two deals concluded a 
year-long review of assets in this market 
after the Group’s 2014 strategy review 
identified engine composites, in 
particular, as a fast-growing market 
opportunity on which Meggitt was 
well-placed to capitalise.   
Meggitt Polymers & Composites had a 
long-held strategy to focus on complex 
secondary structures that are of less 
interest to the manufacturers of primary 
wings and fuselages. David Horner 
explains “These Tier 1 producers like  
very large structures made from fibre 
that can be placed along a consistent arc 
by machine, not man. It’s very capital 
intensive. We, on the other hand, like hand 
lay-up, complex secondary structures, 
difficult geometries and tight tolerances. 
And that’s exactly the type of work we are 
going to build on with our new businesses.”  
The market for complex secondary 
structures is very fragmented. Very small 
producers take simple, low-value 
components and build them to the 
designers’ specifications. “Aerospace 
customers want suppliers with greater 
expertise and scale. They want mature 
manufacturing processes that reduce 
risk,” continues Horner.

ith Meggitt Polymers & 
Composites’ new scale, now  
1.5 million square feet of 
manufacturing space in Europe and the 
Americas, comes an extension of the 
Group’s intellectual property. 
The acquisitions extend Meggitt’s smart 
engineering for extreme environments 
further into manufacturing processes. 
“For radomes and electro-thermal ice 
protection, the smart engineering with 
which Meggitt has been so traditionally 
associated is still very necessary,” says 
Horner, “but the essential qualifier for 
engine composites and secondary 
structures is manufacturing process IP  
for extreme environments.” 
In the world of composites, customers 
provide the engineering drawing for a 
given component and the composite 
supplier is responsible for addressing the 
geometric challenge. To develop optimal 
solutions, those suppliers need to deploy  
a range of tools and materials. “Our new 
composites businesses may have 
competitors for individual processes but 
there are none offering the required 
diversity,” says Horner.  
The list of Meggitt Polymers & Composites’ 
capabilities includes resin and vacuum- 
assisted resin transfer moulding, 
compression moulding—up to six-axis—
hand lay-up and fibre-wind. Horner 
explains: “I had a discussion with a 
customer recently about how we might 
replace an aluminium part with composite.   
If we had been just EDAC, we would have 
had two ways to do it. If we were just talking 
Advanced Composites—also two ways. As 
Meggitt, with our established integration 
expertise and capabilities, we now have six 
ways to do it. And that’s what counts if you 
want to provide a solution that is not only 
great technically but makes sense 
commercially.”
Composites deliver in-service weight 
efficiencies plus design flexibility, lower 
costs and shorter cycle times—providing 
they are manufactured by experienced 
providers. High tech equipment isn’t worth 
much in isolation. “It’s our formula—our 
process IP—that controls heat and pressure 
at six different angles and enables us to 
make the highly complex parts that 
virtually no-one else in the world can,” 
says Horner.        
 
Engine of growth 
He had ambitious growth plans for Meggitt 
Polymers & Composites’ existing 
composites businesses. These acquisitions 
take that ambition very much further. 
Meggitt now has first-class customer 
relationships in Europe and North America 
on the high growth engine programmes, 
and premier positions in the growing 
inflight wifi market and in structural 
components.
EDAC’s engine composites order pipeline is 
worth over USD600 million for the next four 
years. Meggitt is now on every major 
commercial aerospace platform worldwide, 
including the fastest growing engines:  
LEAP, the PW1000G, the GEnX and the GE90. 
“Meggitt is well-placed to capitalise on many 
more opportunities to replace metal with 
composite as customers work their way 
through the engine, converting as much as 
they can based on available technologies,” 
adds Horner.   
While EDAC was a predominantly civil 
business whose capability grew with 
progressive civil engine manufacturers, 
Advanced Composites evolved by 
responding to demanding military 
requirements. Weight and cost savings 
aside, they are in demand for stealth and 
low radar observability and high degrees  
of engine performance and extreme 
aerodynamics.    
Its engine components, which encompass 
flight critical products such as spinners and 
stators, exhaust flaps and internal multi-
stage components, are present on high-
volume, high-growth platforms like the Joint 
Strike Fighter. There are now 100 Meggitt 
composite parts on the F135 engine for the  
F35, one of the US Department of Defense’s 
most significant programmes.  
Advanced Composites had also secured 
good commercial business, enhancing 
Meggitt’s positions on the A320neo, 
C-Series, MRJ, 777X, 787, A380 and  
the G650.    
One of the most exciting growth 
opportunities relates to the highly 
specified radomes it already produces in 
repeatable high quality volumes for major 
fighter jets, maritime aircraft and 
electronic warfare platforms, including 
the P8 Poseidon, Eurofighter Typhoon,  
F16 and F18 variants and the Apache 
Attack Helicopter.  
Gogo, a leading internet service provider 
on commercial and business aircraft, 
recorded a transmission peak of 3.1 
million bits per second in 2010 and 
forecast a peak of 70 million this year.  
Its new system has a higher transmission 
capability by some order of magnitude, all 
of which will go through Meggitt radomes.  
The business is taking this capability into 
the global inflight connectivity market, 
which is experiencing very high and 
accelerating growth. With production  
on both sides of the Atlantic, Meggitt  
is positioned well to surf this wave, 
partnering with Gogo, the global leader  
in inflight connectivity.
Meggitt Polymers & Composites ticks 
many of the technology boxes that will 
secure positions on next generation 
aircraft—composite engine components, 
secondary structures, radomes and ice 
protection. These are the foundation on 
which Meggitt will build its scale 
composites business, one that is 
diversified across military and civil 
markets and one that has the capacity  
to satisfy the demanding production 
requirements of the impending ramp-up 
in production of new models.  ■

156768.01 Text 001-047-NEW-06.03.16.indd   19 07/03/2016   04:15 In May 2015, Meggitt launched the first phase of its centralised 
Customer Services & Support (CSS) organisation, streamlining the 
Group’s interface with aftermarket customers. The global operating 
model, launched in January 2016, is designed to develop the agility 
Meggitt needs to compete in the increasingly dynamic market for 
spares and repairs. Its success is one of the Group’s strategic 
priorities. “We will succeed by delivering superb service throughout 
the product lifecycle and, ultimately, helping our airline customers 
run their operations as cost-effectively as possible,” says  
Lorraine Rienecker, the new organisation’s President.
T
he civil aftermarket is changing.  
While traffic growth, the underlying 
driver of aftermarket demand, 
remains strong, we need to respond to a 
maturing market and increased 
competition. Better data is resulting in 
delayed and extended maintenance 
intervals, while bigger, stronger 
integrators are offering larger 
maintenance packages and capturing a 
greater share of the aftermarket as airlines 
continue to outsource maintenance repair 
and overhaul (MRO) services.
The Group has been disproportionately 
impacted by cyclical threats in recent 
times, cutting demand for its highest 
margin spares. Aircraft from the cycle of 
the late 1980s to early 1990s are reaching 
their natural retirement age and are 
increasing the supply of surplus parts.  
However, says Lorraine Rienecker, “we 
must assume this will continue for some 
time, and adjust accordingly.”  
The aim of the new organisation is to 
simplify the interface between Meggitt 
and its aftermarket customers.“ We need 
to coordinate the efforts of sales and 
customer support personnel more 
effectively and build partnerships for 
growth.” Common metrics will be 
established for all Meggitt aftermarket 
operations to ensure that every team rises 
to the cost, quality and delivery standards 
set by the best. CSS will facilitate a more 
efficient feedback loop between 
customers and Meggitt engineering 
teams, delivering the data needed to 
design product upgrades to improve 
in-service operation.  
The launch of CSS during 2015 was the first 
step on the road to reclaiming Meggitt’s 
aftermarket in a dynamic market 
environment with many cross-currents. 
Phase one saw the establishment of a 
management team to centralise 
customer-facing teams. The sales effort 
has been organised regionally and by key 
account to offer a greatly simplified 
interface to customers—one single source 
of service rather than multiple points of 
contact across capabilities and regions.   
The feedback from customers has been 
universally positive. “Our customers are 
starting to see the number of Meggitt 
phone numbers in their address books 
cut and their understanding of Meggitt’s 
full range of capabilities rise,“ says 
Rienecker.
CSS’s initial operational responsibility 
centred on existing dedicated aftermarket 
facilities in Singapore, UK, Germany and 
the United States. At the beginning of 
2016, it assumed responsibility for key 
commercial and military aerospace 
spares distribution and the MRO 
operations of two divisions—Meggitt 
Control Systems and Meggitt Sensing 
Systems—plus those of Meggitt Aircraft 
Braking Systems’ UK facility in Coventry. 
As CSS develops and matures, it will take 
responsibility for more of Meggitt’s 
aftermarket operations. While complete 
control over operational performance will 
lead to systemic improvement and 
best-practice sharing, Rienecker wants to 
optimise the opportunity to meet 
customers’ requirements for the long 
term. “A fully mature CSS organisation will 
enable us properly align all elements of 
our aftermarket services across the 
product lifecycle.”  
CSS is not a discrete organisation within 
the Group. “To guarantee CSS success, we 
are remaining fully integrated with our 
original equipment businesses and will 
retain strong interfaces at all levels,” says 
Rienecker. Clearly, this is critical if CSS is 
to maintain high ratings on its customers’ 
delivery scorecards. However, CSS wants 
to communicate a greater understanding 
of operators’ needs and in-service product 
performance to Meggitt’s original 
equipment engineering teams. “It’s all 
about maximising Meggitt revenue across

loop,” she explains. “The opportunities to 
boost Meggitt’s product pipelines with 
upgrades and next generation products 
are significant.”    
To ensure that the new organisation is 
equipped to exploit retrofit, modification 
and upgrade opportunities, CSS technical 
teams are now focusing on developing 
more in-depth reliability and maintenance 
data for all Meggitt products. Over the 
past 18 months Meggitt Control Systems 
(MCS) has systematised electronic MRO 
data capture to better understand product 
performance in the field. This meets the 
aviation industry’s Spec2000 requirement 
for industry partners to exchange detailed 
information easily and cost-effectively.  
Having successfully deployed Spec2000 
on MCS legacy product lines, CSS will 
now drive a global project to deploy this 
data-recording methodology across all 
Meggitt facilities performing MRO 
services. “Capturing data is only the 
start,“ Rienecker emphasises. “Having 
the processes to accurately assess and 
interpret the data and to act on the 
findings are critical. This is why designing 
them will be a priority for CSS and Group 
engineering over the next 12 months.” 
The goal is to provide mid-life, product 
refreshment opportunities, boosting the 
operating economics of the airlines.
As the original equipment manufacturer, 
Rienecker believes Meggitt has intrinsic 
competitive advantage. “Our customers 
want to keep their parts on wing for as 
long as possible. With more data and 
trend analysis behind it, our team of 
outstanding product designers will be 
extremely well-placed to redesign 
longer-life products for retrofit.”
F
or the moment, Meggitt has an 
immediate requirement to start 
thinking like an aftermarket trader.  
The surplus market has expanded with 
parts from retired fuel-inefficient aircraft, 
and Meggitt is now participating through  
a partnership with a leading provider of 
aviation services and logistics to repair 
and resell ‘as removed’ parts. Rienecker  
is confident: “The OEM tag remains 
important and provides our customers 
with the assurance that their products 
have been repaired by those who know 
them best—the Meggitt designer and 
manufacturer. The partnership will  
also provide better insights into real- 
time market value and demand for  
Meggitt product.”    
From a commercial perspective, with its 
developing understanding of in-service 
revenues and opportunities, CSS will 
enable more precision in Meggitt’s 
contract arrangements with customers 
for new and existing products across all 
stages of their lifecycles.
CSS is also reviewing its distributor 
network. It is fragmented, complex  
and costly to manage. Over the next few  
years, that network will be rationalised 
and strengthened, with communication 
channels improved through one  
CSS interface.  
After putting a centralised aircraft-on-
ground (AOG) emergency call centre in 
place last year, CSS is developing it 
further to meet its obligations for new 
aircraft entering service. “We want to 
make it more efficient for the operators 
and more cost-effective for the Group so 
24/7 support will be delivered with fewer 
points of contact and optimised inventory 
management,” says Rienecker.
CSS operations will be underpinned by 
the Meggitt Production System. This will 
make fast, efficient service as much a 
competitive advantage in aftermarket 
centres as it is for those facilities 
concerned with the industrialisation  
of product for original equipment 
manufacturers. “There are many 
outstanding aftermarket teams at Meggitt 
but the competition is becoming stronger 
and airlines are having a greater 
influence over their supply chain.  
Meggitt’s original equipment customers 
—the airframers and engine-makers—
want to partner with suppliers who can 
deliver for their customers. MPS will 
ensure CSS provides that assurance.”
After spending close to a decade as 
Meggitt’s Executive Vice President of 
Strategy, Sales & Marketing, Rienecker  
is enjoying the opportunity to specialise  
in one business, albeit a multi-faceted 
one. “In the OE market, programmes can 
be very long. The aftermarket is much 
more dynamic and service-driven. I am, 
however, delighted to be working within 
the entrepreneurial service culture of  
the aftermarket trade, backed by our OE 
businesses—after all, they are the best 
manufacturers of our products and the 
best engineers.” ■

156768.01 Text 001-047-NEW-06.03.16.indd   21 07/03/2016   04:15 The first Meggitt operating facility to enter the fourth 
Bronze stage of the Meggitt Production System  
looks like a business that is on the home straight  
to operations excellence. However , it could take  
the group’s Customer Services & Support hub  
in Singapore between one and two years of hard 
yards to make the exacting Meggitt grade, which 
includes rigorous financial targets.  
T
he Meggitt Production System (MPS) 
is a six-stage operating system 
designed to make operations 
excellence a core competitive strength. 
The early stages focus on tools and 
techniques that enable products to be 
delivered, consistently, on time and to the 
required specification. The continuous 
elimination of waste is intrinsic to the 
system. Practised at the highest level, 
MPS aims to deliver superior incremental 
growth and performance as leadership, 
liberated by smoothly-running operations, 
can focus more on maximising returns 
from trading assets and long-term 
business strategy. 
S
ince its launch in 2013, all Meggitt’s 
main facilities, apart from the recent 
composites acquisitions, have 
entered the first Red phase with many 
moving into the second, Yellow, and third, 
Green, phases. The initial goal is tactical 
quality and delivery improvement and the 
establishment of a sustainable continuous 
improvement culture. Facilities will not be 
able to graduate from the next three 
phases, however, without meeting rigorous 
financial targets. 
James Mariadass, whose facility is now in 
the fourth ‘Bronze’ Meggitt Production 
System phase, explains how it works. As a 
starting point, MPS is not a rigidly applied 
set of tools and structures but a 
framework that local leaders and 
employees can adopt and adapt to realities 
on the ground. “Implementing it like a 
check list doesn’t work. Full involvement 
of everyone is essential, backed by good 
cross-functional collaboration.”  
And the phases? “Red sets the foundation. 
That’s when we set up our visual factory 
boards, define our metrics, look at 
organisation and structure and start to 
work with basic Lean and related 
continuous improvement (CI) tools. It’s 
very much about problem-solving and 
removing barriers to success.
“Yellow is about culture change. Daily 
Layered Accountability (DLA) meetings get 
maximum involvement from everyone—
technicians all the way to the site leader. 
At the beginning, employees would be a 
little uncomfortable, thinking they were 
being blamed for non-delivery. Now 
employees understand that DLA is not 
about targeting individuals but issues and 
how we, as a team, go about resolving them. 
UIltimately, this leads to happy employees 
as they have an avenue to resolve difficult 
issues, up the line, on a daily basis.
“Green fans MPS into the functions that 
feed the factory floor and focuses on 
material and inventory management, sales 
inventory and order processing, supplier 
selection and management. It is really 
about further developing an open cross-
functional network to resolve issues and 
performance. Ultimately, it tests the 
resilience of our approach.” 
Mariadass has joked with his people 
about going back to the ‘old days’. The 
response was universal: “We couldn’t go 
back to phone calls and emails and 
departmental meetings. We’d be lost.” 
Singapore’s staff retention figures prove 
the point, contributing to a reduction in 
the Group’s overall personnel turnover 
by 50% in 2015.

tarting with Bronze, precious  
metals denote operations excellence 
at a Meggitt facility as a core 
competitive strength. 
“Customers of a Bronze Meggitt factory 
are very happy indeed,” Amir Allahverdi, 
Meggitt Group Operations Director, 
explains, ”Our Bronze rating maps well  
to customers’ own ‘Gold’ standards.” So 
what’s the point of our Silver and Gold? 
“At these levels of operations excellence, 
factories run like clockwork. 
Management can lift its gaze away from 
internal problem-solving to growth—
filling our factory pipelines with new 
business. Silver and Gold operations 
anticipate customer demands and market 
forces, rather than being driven only by 
immediate requirements. It is the point  
at which operational advantage must turn 
to real strategic and financial advantage.“  
Mariadass is already starting to ease into 
the new way of thinking. “Instead of being 
pushed by sales guys to fulfill orders, I 
am finding myself pushing the sales guys 
to top up my production pipeline.”
He is particularly excited about the 
Singapore operation becoming part of the 
new Customer Services & Support (CSS) 
organisation. It is now responsible for 
most of Meggitt’s spares distribution and 
MRO operations in Asia and he is keen for 
his new sister facilities to catch up. His 
Singapore-based facility is at the sharp 
end of the aftermarket where a Mach 3 
approach to service is a basic 
requirement. He knows that there can be 
no weak links in the chain of CSS 
excellence. Bronze for Mariadass, 
therefore, points the way to a proactive 
approach to building the strong network 
needed to build even stronger 
aftermarket service and improved 
financial performance.  
And there are plenty of tools to assist.  
Now that MPS’s global “SIOP”—sales 
inventory order processing—process has 
matured, the scope for advanced planning 
and forecasting is greater in the 
expanding CSS organisation. “SIOP is 
firmly established in Singapore and if we 
share this best practice, we can really 
start to make efficiency gains, 
consolidating spares inventory in fewer 
sites,” he says. If the interface between 
CSS facilities is critical, CSS must also 
create effective links into Meggitt’s 
original equipment engineering teams to 
deliver the field performance data needed 
for profitable mid-life product refresh 
opportunities.  
And this, emphasises Allahverdi, is where 
a world-class Meggitt operating model 
shows its worth. “While reliable 
processes and open, regular 
communication have boosted employee 
morale on the production floor, MPS also 
equips functions, businesses and 
divisions to work together at the macro 
level. The languages of problem-solving 
and continuous improvement are the 
same.” Meggitt’s progress in operating 
efficiency in just three years has been 
exceptional. In aggregate, the Group’s 
on-time delivery (OTD) has risen by 14% 
and quality is up by 87%. 
And customers have noticed. MPS 
‘immersion’ attracted one of our power 
product businesses’ largest orders. After 
a supplier assessment, Meggitt was 
lauded as the only one to have 
demonstrated deep understanding across 
multiple facilities of Lean deployment and 
standardised improvement processes. 
Another chose Meggitt to pilot the next 
revision to its supplier health 
assessment. Endorsed by customers, 
several Meggitt businesses are using 
MPS to map out realisable paths to 
‘supplier Gold’ in 2016—a critical 
accreditation for quality and on-time 
delivery that is the price of entry for next 
generation aircraft programme bids. A 
top original equipment customer was so 
impressed by progress at one facility, he 
demanded “more, more quickly”. 
Allahverdi and team have already been 
orchestrating change on a grander scale 
in 2015. MPS was launched at divisional 
level, leading to Meggitt Sensing Systems’ 
new ‘value stream’ structure (see People 
and culture, page 24) and a clearly-
defined approach to leadership 
development. A Group programme 
management council was established to 
fully deploy Meggitt’s highly developed 
programme life cycle management 
processes. A functional launch was 
undertaken by the Group’s HR operations 
team. Meggitt’s supply chain was 
risk-assessed prior to starting a 
programme of relationship development 
and MPS integration. 
In 2016, Allahverdi will turn up the 
temperature again at facility level to 
deliver ”more, more quickly”. Now MPS 
principles and practice are embedded 
across Meggitt, the MPS cadre will focus 
on 12 Meggitt sites to accelerate 
breakthrough improvements in the year. 
These include three of the eight 
businesses acquired by Meggitt Polymers 
& Composites at the end of 2015 (see 
Technology, page 18). He reflects on 
future progress. “Meggitt has a wider 
vision of excellence and the potential of an 
entire organisation equipped to execute 
strategy smoothly and run on world-class 
processes—processes that maximise the 
return on trading assets and link us 
inextricably to customers, suppliers and 
each other. “For now, Allahverdi is 
impressed by what he describes as a 
critical identity level achievement for the 
Group. “MPS is part of who we are at 
Meggitt and there’s no going back.” ■
While reliable processes and open, regular 
communication have boosted employee morale  
on the production floor , MPS equips functions, 
businesses and divisions to work together at the 
macro level. The languages of problem-solving 
and continuous improvement are the same

156768.01 Text 001-047-NEW-06.03.16.indd   23 07/03/2016   04:15 Meggitt’s performance culture is based on delegating decision-making 
as far down the hierarchy as possible where problems can be resolved 
by the teams who understand them most. That is Meggitt Production 
System basic equipment, facilitated through the technique of Daily 
Layered Accountability or ‘DLA’. New ‘value streams’ are playing  
a role at divisional level too, devolving responsibility to where it is  
best discharged, MPS-style. The focus on international networking 
continues through the international graduate programme, the executive 
leadership programme with Oxford University and the launch in 2016  
of the Group’s first global intranet. 
W
hen Group Organisation 
Development Director, Robin 
Young, joined Meggitt, the Group 
was half the size, a conglomerate of small 
to medium-sized enterprises. “It was good 
for innovation and speed but we needed  
to leverage our scale to really count in our 
markets for the long term.” And that’s 
what Meggitt did in 2009, organising its 
businesses around core capabilities into 
integrated divisions. Meggitt is changing, 
subtly, again. “The divisional structure 
remains firmly in place but as our 
business has become more international 
and more intricate, the way we think about 
some of these divisions at an identity level 
is evolving again.” Young is referring to 
the new “value streams” created by 
Meggitt’s Sensing Systems and Polymers 
& Composites divisions to provide 
customers with the best solutions and 
improved support.  
One man’s industrial paradise 
Paul Devaux heads up Meggitt Sensing 
Systems’ Power & Motion value stream.  
An operations expert and French national 
based in Meggitt’s power management 
facility in Avrillé, France, he has spent his 
career working for international 
companies. From Morocco to France and 
the UAE to Indonesia, he has experienced 
the extremes of disaffecting “command 
and control” processes to what he 
describes as the “industrial paradise of 
engagement”. However, the impact of the 
Meggitt Production System could not  
have been greater when he joined  
Meggitt in 2015. 
“This operating system is done in a very 
smart way. It is not beside the business. It 
is inside the business. It is fully 
integrated. That is unusual.” The most 
palpable expression of integration for 
Devaux is DLA (see box right). “It’s what 
you do every day at Meggitt. It is not ‘in 
addition to’ anything else. You just do that. 
And it works.”
To some, the daily monitoring and 
problem-solving system seems too simple.  
Devaux asserts: “Some organisations have 
forgotten the world we are living in.  
Complex systems can be very satisfying 
intellectually but they are not always 
efficient. We are engineers and 
manufacturers. We are not making 
philosophy. We are trying to make 
profitable parts that satisfy our customers. 
Simplification in our world has to be one  
of the greatest virtues.”    
And this touches on a fundamental of 
Meggitt culture—common sense. At the 
helm of an outward-looking value stream, 
Devaux knows he will not be taken aside as 
he once was by a customer who told him:

interested in your culture than your 
customers!”
D
evaux knows about the effectiveness 
of the value stream approach to 
delivering growth from product lines 
within individual factories. Now Meggitt is 
innovating, applying a common sense 
principle to aggregate businesses at an 
international level. Devaux is very 
comfortable with this.   
With his team, he is combining the 
capabilities of five specialist centres  
in France, the United States and Vietnam 
into a rich seam of power generation, 
conversion, storage and management 
technologies, providing customers with 
the best solutions and improved support.   
It takes Devaux back to his “industrial 
paradise” in which control is given to 
businesses rather than functions. For 
Devaux, being part of the Meggitt group 
means access to investment, functional 
expertise and world-class systems like 
MPS. As owner of a value stream, he can 
benefit from the parent but have the 
freedom to make decisions relating to 
customers and markets with which he 
and his team are in step. That is exactly 
where he wants to be in professional 
terms. He is equally ambitious for his 
people. The opportunities to showcase 
best practice from one facility to another 
are significant. The engineering 
challenges will grow in complexity and 
deliver greater professional satisfaction. 
“The Power & Motion teams are straining 
at the leash to reach out to each other and 
explore the possibilities,” he says.  
 
Graduate programme cohort 
expands into operations
Meggitt’s international graduate 
programme is in its fourth year and the 
first cohort to finish its three-year rotation 
is starting full-time roles across the 
Group. Predominantly engineering-
focused, the programme piloted 
operational streams last year, which has 
led to a 50% increase in intake in 2015 
including the Meggitt Production System 
leaders of the future. Surprises unfold 
from the programme, including changes of 
career aspiration and what Young calls the 
effect of ‘random nodes’, where 
technologies and markets find new 
intersections.    
 
From nanotechnology to 
industrial psychology 
Karl Elkjaer exemplifies this idea. With 
his Masters in physics and nanotechnology 
he might have been expected to take a 
route to a Meggitt Technical Fellowship. 
Instead, he has discovered the satisfying 
immediacy of solving problems in 
operations. His chosen permanent role is 
as Meggitt Production System leader at 
the Group’s specialist piezoceramics 
facility in Denmark. The problems are 
equally as complex in operations, to which 
the new discipline of ‘psychology’ can be 
added, he explains. “You can take the  
best person and drop them into a poor 
process and they will fail. My role is about 
creating the right conditions for people to 
succeed and enabling them to work better 
in teams.” 
 
Eureka moments 
Elkjaer’s graduate programme rotation 
started in Denmark, followed by nine-
month cycles in the US and UK. He is 
sensitised to different national 
management styles and has had 
significant exposure to Meggitt’s 
international customer base. As he 
changed his perspectives so, he believes, 
his hosts changed theirs, if only to learn 
about other businesses in the Meggitt 
group. The effect of Young’s desired 
‘random intersection’ occurred when he 
rotated from a sensing business in 
Denmark, where he had been looking at a 
paint form of piezoceramic sensor, to a 
composites business in the UK looking for 
actuating technologies for anti-ice 
systems. An ultra-low power solution 
deploying this technology contributed to 
Meggitt Polymers & Composites 
(Loughborough) beating the industry’s 
odds-on favourites in a competition to lead 
a state-of-the-art anti-ice systems 
research project with EUR 6.2 million 
European Union funding.    
 
Networking 
Meggitt employees with senior leadership 
potential continue to enjoy the networking 
value of the biannual executive training 
programme with Oxford University’s Said 
business school. Its fourth cohort is now 
benefiting from the one-year bespoke 
programme. Diverse talents, from new 
joiners to old hands, work on special 
projects to develop systems thinking 
beyond their functional areas. Several 
alumni now serve on Meggitt’s executive 
management team.
And there’s a new information democracy 
to come. In 2016, Meggitt will launch its 
first global intranet. Any employee, 
worldwide, will be able to tap into the 
richness of what Meggitt has to offer and 
act on the information through the 
intranet’s latest communication and 
collaboration tools. Young concludes: “A 
new level of creativity will be enabled as 
these tools become available for use in 
day-to-day activities. All this contributes to 
a fertile environment for sharing and 
developing ideas that lead to revenue-
generating new products and technologies. 
Meggitt is a treasure trove of capability 
and talent that deserves to be shared 
widely, inside the business and, ultimately, 
with our customers. Our new intranet is 
central to providing that narrative.” ■

156768.01 Text 001-047-NEW-06.03.16.indd   25 07/03/2016   04:15 Meggitt seeks to operate within a low risk appetite 
range overall. Effective risk management is 
required to deliver to this appetite while 
supporting the achievement of the Group’s 
strategy and business objectives. Our risk 
management framework is based on ISO 31000 
and includes a formal process for identifying, 
assessing and responding to risk.
During 2015, we continued to refine our approach. 
The Board approved an updated Group risk 
appetite statement with associated risk tolerances 
to ensure that identified risks are managed 
within acceptable limits. These risk tolerance 
levels are flowed down to the divisions and 
functions. The likely timeframe within which 
the impact of risks might be felt and how we 
prioritise risk is considered as part of our risk 
management strategy.
Governance
The responsibility for risk management 
operates at all levels throughout Meggitt:
• The Board – The Board takes overall 
responsibility, determining the nature and 
extent of the principal risks it is willing to 
take in achieving Meggitt’s strategic 
objectives; and overseeing the Group’s 
risk governance structure and internal 
control framework. During 2015, the 
Board has carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing 
the Group, including those that would 
threaten its business model, future 
performance, solvency or liquidity. This 
report describes those risks and how  
they are being managed or mitigated.
• The Audit Committee – The Board has 
delegated responsibility for reviewing  
and ensuring the effectiveness of the  
risk management process to the  
Audit Committee.
• Other Board and Management 
committees – Divisional and functional 
leadership are responsible for the 
management of risk and for compiling and 
maintaining their own risk registers, 
which outline risks at business unit and 
programme levels. The Group Executive 
Committee as a whole regularly reviews 
the Group’s principal risks, while 
individual members own specific risks. 
Our risk management process requires 
identified risks throughout the Group to be 
owned by a named individual. They must 
review them regularly and consider related 
new risks. Risk identification is embedded  
in other processes, including project and 
programme management, bid approvals  
and other operational activities.
After they have been identified, risks are 
reviewed at facility level and aggregated for 
review at divisional and functional levels  
and during the Group’s regular business 
review process.
The Group Risk Register is then subject to a 
detailed review and discussion at the Group 
Executive Committee which includes 
discussion of risks which may not have been 
identified through the normal channels. The 
Board reviews the output of this process.
Meggitt’s corporate strategy is designed to 
optimise our business model and take risk, 
with the required controls, on an informed 
basis. To enable value to be created for  
our shareholders, we set varying risk 
tolerances and associated criteria. We 
accept risk and manage our risk universe  
on the following basis:
• Strategic – medium to low tolerance for 
risks arising from poor business 
decisions or sub-standard execution of 
business objectives.
• Operational – low to near-zero tolerance 
for risks arising from business processes 
including the technical, quality, and 
project management or organisational 
risk associated with programmes and 
products.
• Corporate – low to near-zero tolerance 
for compliance and reputational risks 
including those related to the law, health, 
safety and the environment.
• Financial – medium to low tolerance for 
financial risks including failure to provide 
adequate liquidity to meet our obligations 
and manage currency, interest rate and 
credit risks.

Principal risks and uncertainties 
In accordance with the Group’s risk 
management procedures, we have evaluated 
our risk disclosure and focused this report on 
the most significant risks. Financial risks 
associated with a multinational business, 
including foreign exchange are disclosed in 
the Chief Financial Officer’s review on pages 
34 to 40.
The risks outlined below, which are not 
presented in order of priority, are those the 
Group believes are the principal ones it 
currently faces. However, additional risks,  
of which the Group is unaware, or risks the 
Group currently considers to be less 
significant, could have an adverse impact.

internal control
The Board is responsible for risk 
management and internal control and for 
maintaining and reviewing its financial and 
operational effectiveness. The Board has 
taken into account the guidance provided by 
the FRC on Risk Management and Internal 
Control in carrying out their duties. The 
system of internal control is designed to 
manage, but not to eliminate, the risk of 
failure to achieve business objectives and  
to provide reasonable, but not absolute, 
assurance against material misstatement 
or loss.
The Group’s functions are responsible for 
determining Group policies and processes. 
The businesses are responsible for 
implementing them, with internal and/or 
external audits to confirm business unit 
compliance. The key features of the risk 
management and internal control system 
are described below, including those 
relating to the financial reporting process, 
as required under the Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules:
• Group policies—key policies are approved 
by the Board and other policies are 
approved by Group functions;
• Process controls—for example financial 
controls including the Group Financial 
Policies and Procedures Manual, the bid 
approval process, programme 
management and execution, IT security 
and risk management. The risk 
management process, which enables the 
Group to identify, evaluate and manage 
the Group’s principal risks was in place 
for 2015 and up to the date of approval of 
the Annual Report and has been regularly 
reviewed by the Audit Committee and 
approved by the Board; and
• The forecasting, budget and strategic  
plan processes.
The Group’s programmes for insurance  
and business continuity form part of our  
risk management and internal control 
framework. 
The following features allow the Group  
to monitor the effective implementation  
of policies and process controls by  
business units:
• A business performance review process 
(including financial, operational and 
compliance performance);
• Annual business unit and divisional 
sign-off of compliance with Group policies 
and processes;
• Compliance programmes and external 
audits (including trade compliance, ethics, 
anti-corruption, health, safety and 
environmental);
• An effective internal audit function which, 
primarily, performs business unit reviews 
by rotation (including finance, IT, HR, 
ethics and the bid process); and
• A whistleblowing line to enable 
employees to raise concerns.
To review the effectiveness of the system  
of internal controls, the Board and Audit 
Committee applied the following processes 
and activities in 2015 and up to the date of 
approval of the Annual Report:
• Reviews of the risk management process, 
risk register and risk appetite;
• Written and verbal reports to the Audit 
Committee from internal and external 
audit on progress with internal control 
activities, including:
 – Reviews of business processes and 
activities, including action plans to 
address any identified control 
weaknesses and recommendations for 
improvements to controls or 
processes;
 – The results of internal audits;
 – Internal control recommendations 
made by the external auditors; and
 – Follow-up actions from previous 
internal control recommendations;
• Regular compliance reports from the 
Executive Director, Commercial and 
Corporate Affairs; Regular reports on the 
state of the business from the Chief 
Executive and Chief Financial Officer;
• A presentation on IT security activities 
and plans;
• Strategy reviews, review of the ten year 
financial plan and review and approval of 
the 2016 budget;
• Written report to the Ethics and Trade 
Compliance Committee on the 
effectiveness of whistleblowing 
procedures; and
• Reports on insurance coverage and 
uninsured risks.
The risk management and internal control 
systems have been in place for the year 
under review and up to the date of approval 
of the Annual Report, and are regularly 
reviewed by the Board. The Board monitors 
executive management’s action plans to 
implement improvements in internal 
controls that have been identified following 
the above-mentioned reviews and reports. 
The Board confirms that it has not identified 
any significant failings or weaknesses in the 
Group’s systems of risk management or 
internal control as a result of information 
provided to the Board and resulting 
discussions.
Viability statement
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the 
2014 Code, the directors have assessed the 
prospects of the Group over a period of five 
years from the balance sheet date (the 
Board having determined five years as the 
appropriate period for the reasons stated 
below), taking account of its current position 
and the potential impact of the principal 
risks set out above.
The Board selected the period of five years 
for the following reasons:
i) The Group’s strategic plan covers an initial 
five-year period, with subsequent years 
modelled by extrapolating the trend in  
years three to five and thus inevitably are 
more uncertain.
ii) The investment cycle for a typical 
engineering development programme is up 
to five years.
iii) Although individual platforms operate for 
periods of 30 years or more, our five-year 
viability period aligns with the typical 
aerospace cycle; and
iv) The five-year viability period is consistent 
with the period over which we consider risks 
covered by the Group Risk Register.
In making this statement, the Board has 
reviewed and discussed the overall process 
undertaken by management and has:
• Considered the Group’s current   
position and future prospects, the  
Group’s strategy and principal risks   
and how these are managed as   
detailed in the Strategic Report;
• Discussed and agreed key assumptions  
in the stress testing model used by 
management;
• Assessed the likelihood of bank and   
other debt facilities continuing to be   
available to the Group as existing   
facilities mature over the next five years;  
and
• Assessed the outcome of the stress-  
testing, carried out using the Group’s  
five-year strategic plan as the base   
case. The Group Risk Register was   
considered to determine those risks   
which could potentially pose the most  
significant threat to viability across the  
Group over this period and which   
should be modelled, including:
 – A significant market downturn, of 
greater magnitude than both the after 
effects of 9/11 and the global recession 
in 2008. The downturn was assumed to 
last for the full stress testing period, 
impacting both civil aerospace and 
energy, with military being unaffected 
(as history has shown);
 – A decline commensurate with losing 
one of our most significant customers, 
leading to a sharp loss of revenue 
across the full stress test period; and
 – A combination of these two scenarios  
to provide an indication of a plausible 
“worst case”.
Based on the results of its review, the 
directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they fall 
due over the five-year period of their 
assessment.

Organic revenue growth Definition and basis of calculation 
Revenue growth calculated by measuring current and prior year revenue at constant 
currency, excluding revenue from any businesses acquired or disposed of in those 
periods. To measure revenue at constant currency, current year revenue is restated 
using translation and transaction exchange rates prevailing in the prior year. 
See page 35 for a reconciliation of organic revenue to statutory revenue. 
Target 
Low single digit in 2016. Ahead of end-market growth rates over the medium term. 
Result 
2015: 0.2% (2014: 0.0%). Compound annual growth rate (CAGR) achieved over last five 
years: 3.8%. See page 34 for details.
Directors’ incentive plans 
Organic revenue growth is a performance measure for the 2015 and 2016 Long Term 
Incentive Plan (LTIP). See pages 73 and 76 for details.
 
  
Underlying operating profit Definition and basis of calculation 
Underlying operating profit is defined and reconciled to statutory measures in note 10 
to the Group consolidated financial statements on page 110. 
Target 
We do not publish profit targets. 
Result 
2015: £325.5 million (2014: £346.0 million). See page 35 for details.
Directors’ incentive plans 
Underlying operating profit is a performance measure in the 2015 and 2016 STIP.  
For the purpose of these plans, actual and target underlying operating profit figures  
are measured at constant currency. See pages 71 and 76 for details.  
The Group uses a mix of financial and non-financial key 
performance indicators (KPIs) to measure execution against  
its strategic objectives. To ensure we deliver value to our 
shareholders over the cycle, financial KPIs balance short-term 
measures (underlying operating profit and free cash flow in the 
year) with longer-term measures (organic revenue growth, 
return on trading assets and underlying EPS growth). Non-
financial KPIs focus on investment in R&D to drive future 
revenues, the health and safety of our employees and raising 
standards of operational performance to satisfy our customers. 
As previously announced, and to align with the new profit 
measure used in the 2015 Short Term Incentive Plan (STIP), an 
underlying profit KPI has been introduced for 2015. It replaces 
the previously reported underlying profit before tax KPI. There 
have been no other changes to the KPIs used in the year or to 
how they are calculated.

Return on trading assets Definition and basis of calculation
Underlying operating profit after tax expressed as a percentage of average trading 
assets. Underlying operating profit is defined and reconciled to statutory measures 
in note 10 to the Group consolidated financial statements on page 110. Underlying 
operating profit after tax applies the Group’s underlying tax rate to underlying 
operating profit.
Trading assets are defined as net assets adjusted to exclude goodwill, other intangible 
assets arising on the acquisition of businesses, net debt, share buyback commitment, 
retirement benefit obligations, derivative financial instruments and deferred tax. 
Average trading assets are calculated as the average of trading assets at the start 
and end of the year. 
Return on trading assets measures performance by linking operating performance 
to the amount of operating capital deployed.
Target
To achieve an average return on trading assets of 20.9% over the next three years.  
The target recognises the need to continue to invest in trading assets during this 
elevated investment period in the aerospace cycle. 
Result
2015: 21.7% (2014: 26.5%). Average achieved over last five years: 32.9%. See page 35 
for details of the Group’s operating profit performance in the year. See page 37 for 
details of the current high levels of investment to support future growth.
Directors’ incentive plans
Return on trading assets is a performance measure for the 2015 and 2016 LTIP. For the 
purpose of these plans, underlying operating profit after tax and trading assets are 
measured at constant currency. See pages 73 and 76 for details. 
  
Underlying EPS growth Definition and basis of calculation
The percentage change in underlying earnings per share (EPS) from the previous year. 
Underlying EPS is defined and reconciled to statutory measures in note 15 to the Group 
consolidated financial statements on page 113. 
Target
We do not publish profit targets. However, the proposed 2016 LTIP includes EPS targets 
equivalent to growth ranging from 4.0% to 9.0% per annum over the next three years.
Result
2015: -2.5% (2014: -13.6%). CAGR achieved over last five years: 2.0%. See page 36  
for details. 
Directors’ incentive plans
Underlying EPS is a performance measure for the 2015 and 2016 LTIP. For the purpose 
of these plans, underlying EPS is adjusted to exclude an element of the benefit arising 
from any share buyback. See pages 73 and 76 for details.

Free cash flow Definition and basis of calculation 
Cash generated excluding amounts in respect of acquisition of businesses, disposal 
of businesses and payments to shareholders. Free cash flow is reconciled to statutory 
measures in note 40 to the Group consolidated financial statements on page 136.
Target 
We do not publish free cash flow targets. 
Result 
2015: £199.0 million (2014: £146.8 million). See page 38 for details.
Directors’ incentive plans 
Free cash flow is a performance measure in the 2015 and 2016 STIP. For the purpose of 
these plans, actual and target free cash flow figures are measured at constant currency 
and exclude interest and tax. See pages 71 and 76 for details. 
  
R&D investment Definition and basis of calculation 
Investment in research and development (R&D) expressed as a percentage of revenue. 
Investment is measured as total expenditure in the year and is not adjusted for amounts 
capitalised, amortised or incurred on contracts funded by customers.  
Target 
Investment of 6 to 8% per annum. This range reflects typical investment fluctuation 
within the industry cycle.
Result 
2015: 9.6% (2014: 9.5%). Average achieved over last five years: 8.5% reflecting high 
levels of investment in the last two years following the Group’s high win rate on new 
aerospace platforms during a period of elevated growth for the industry. See page 37 
for details.
Directors’ incentive plans 
R&D investment is not a specific measure used in directors’ incentive plans. 
However, the 2015 and 2016 LTIP include measures focused on delivery of R&D 
programmes. See pages 73 and 76 for details.
  
Accident/incident rate Definition and basis of calculation
The number of injuries reportable under local laws and regulations multiplied 
by 100,000 and then divided by the average employee headcount during the year. 
Target
Year-on-year improvement with an ultimate goal of nil. 
Result
2015: 369 (2014: 337). See page 44 for details.
Directors’ incentive plans
Health and safety performance is not a specific measure used in directors’ incentive 
plans. However, during 2015 health and safety has been integrated into the Meggitt 
Production System (“MPS”) and the 2015 and 2016 LTIP include measures focused  
on execution of MPS. See pages 73 and 76 for details.

Reduction in defective  
parts per million (DPPM)
Definition and basis of calculation
DPPM for the year expressed as a percentage improvement from that achieved at  
31 December 2011, the date at which the Meggitt Production System introduced this 
consistent method of measurement. DPPM is defined as the number of defective parts 
returned by customers in the year multiplied by one million and then divided by the 
total number of parts delivered. 
Figures include the results of disposed businesses up to the date of sale and the 
results of acquired businesses from the later of the start of the financial year following 
acquisition and the date the information is first available.
This KPI monitors the success of the Meggitt Production System.
Target
To achieve the levels of performance excellence (e.g. sometimes referred to as 
‘Supplier Gold’) expected by our customers. We use simple on-time delivery and 
DPPM measures, aggregated at a Group level, to track overall progress towards these 
objectives. Given the complexity and variety of customer metrics, driven by the large 
number of customers we serve, we also track performance as reported by our 
customers through their own supplier scorecards.
Result
Cumulative improvement since 31 December 2011: 87% (2014: 84%). See page 37  
for details. 
Directors’ incentive plans
DPPM is a performance measure for the 2015 and 2016 LTIP. For the purpose of these 
plans, it is measured by reference to the number of sites achieving individual targeted 
reductions in DPPM. See pages 73 and 76 for details. 
    
On-time delivery  
improvement
Definition and basis of calculation
Average on-time delivery achieved in the year expressed as a percentage improvement 
from that achieved at 31 December 2011, the date at which the Meggitt Production 
System introduced this consistent method of measurement. It is calculated as the 
12-month average of the number of parts delivered on delivery dates agreed with 
customers, divided by the total number of parts delivered. 
Figures include the results of disposed businesses up to the date of sale and the 
results of acquired businesses from the later of the start of the financial year following 
acquisition and the date the information is first available.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE REPORTS STRATEGIC REPORT 33 Overall performance
Organic revenue was flat in 2015, with the impact 
of 4% growth in civil original equipment (OE) and 
3% growth in civil aftermarket (AM) being 
tempered by flat military revenue and a 20% 
decline in energy resulting from ongoing 
weakness in commodity prices. Underlying profit 
before tax decreased by 9% organically, with a 2% 
decrease in underlying EPS reflecting the benefit 
of the share buyback programme.

Organic growth excludes the impact of M&A and currency. See Table 3 for 
further details.  
Revenue 
Reported revenue increased by 6% to 
£1,647.2 million. Table 2 details the 
revenue performance by end market.
As expected, revenue benefited from 
foreign exchange and acquisitions during 
the year. Currency movements, reflecting 
the movement of Sterling against the 
Group’s major operating currencies, 
contributed £68.9 million to reported 
revenue, represented by a £79.3 million 
increase from the strengthening US 
Dollar and Swiss Franc, partly offset by a 
weakening Euro. Acquisitions contributed 
a further £20.9 million to reported 
revenue. Organic revenue growth of 4% in 
civil aerospace and a flat performance in 
military, was offset by a decline in energy.
Total civil aerospace revenue grew 4% on 
an organic basis. Large jet OE, the most 
significant driver of our OE revenue, grew 
4% driven principally by growth in 
narrow-body and A350XWB revenue, with 
regional aircraft up 5% and business jets 
up 11%. The aftermarket recovery seen 
during 2014 and the first half of 2015 
slowed to 2% organic growth during the 
second half of 2015. Overall performance 
for the year, however, remained positive, 
with flat large jet aftermarket revenue, 
4% growth in regional aircraft and 11% 
growth in business jets. The parting out of 
older aircraft, fuelled by a high retirement 
rate in recent years, has continued to 
impact our large jet aftermarket 
business, although actions currently 
being taken within the newly formed 
Customer Service & Support (CSS) 
organisation, including direct 
participation in the surplus parts market 
and seeking a greater share of 
maintenance, repair and overhaul work 
on our components, will partially mitigate 
the impact in future years. 
Military revenue was flat on an organic 
basis, with strong growth in the first half 
of the year being offset by tougher 
comparators and the effects of Continuing 
Resolution in the US in the second half. 
Energy revenue declined by 20% on an 
organic basis, driven principally by a 40% 
organic decline in Heatric, our printed 
circuit heat exchanger business, 
reflecting challenges in the global oil and 
gas market following the significant 
decline in the oil price over the last 18 
months. Our energy condition monitoring 
revenues were broadly flat on an organic 
basis, while revenues in our MCS energy 
business grew organically by 18% 
reflecting strong demand for silicon-
dioxide cables which facilitate signal 
transmission in safety-critical power 
applications. This growth was bolstered 
by the £15.1 million full-year revenue 
contribution from PECC, acquired in 
December 2014. We continue to expect 
headwinds in the energy businesses in 
the short term, largely driven by the 
decline in the oil price which is causing a 
number of our customers to delay capital 
expenditure on new gas projects. Some 
contracts we expected to be awarded in 
2016 have been deferred, and it is likely 
that we will see further deferrals in the 
near future. We have taken significant 
action on costs within Heatric, while 
retaining the long-term capability of the 
business to respond when the market turns.
Meggitt’s other specialist markets saw 
organic revenue growth of 6%, with 
growth in automotive and medical 
products offsetting a decline in ground 
fuelling system revenue.
34 MEGGITT PLC          REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 Profit 
The Board’s preferred measure of the 
Group’s trading performance is 
underlying profit. Underlying operating 
profit for the year was £325.5 million 
(2014: £346.0 million), representing a 
margin of 19.8% (2014: 22.3%). The 
principal drivers of the margin decline 
included our Heatric business moving 
from a profit in 2014 to a small loss in 
2015, adverse mix, primarily within civil, 
and continued expenditure on new 
product introduction. Within civil, organic 
OE growth outpaced that of AM, with 
particular weakness being seen in AM 
revenue associated with older aircraft 
where margins tend to be higher.
Underlying net finance costs decreased to 
£15.2 million (2014: £17.3 million) with the 
benefit of lower interest rates and the 
non-recurrence of a £1.8 million 
refinancing charge in 2014, partly offset 
by higher average debt due to the share 
buyback programme and acquisitions. 
The full year impact of both the buyback 
and the acquisitions will increase finance 
costs in 2016. 
Underlying profit before tax was 
£310.3 million (2014: £328.7 million).
The underlying tax rate was 20% 
(2014: 21%), benefiting from a lower UK 
corporation tax rate and the release of 
provisions against historical tax 
uncertainties. The underlying tax rate is 
expected to increase to 23% from 2016, 
reflecting a growing proportion of

following the two recent acquisitions. 
Underlying earnings per share was 
31.6 pence (2014: 32.4 pence).
On a statutory basis, profit before tax was 
£210.2 million (2014: £208.9 million), 
reflecting the favourable year-on-year 
impact of the marking to market of 
financial instruments (£24.4 million) 
offsetting lower underlying profitability. 
Earnings per share increased by 5% to

effect of the share buyback and the lower 
tax rate accounting for most of the 
improvement.
Operational performance
Meggitt Aircraft Braking Systems 
(MABS) provides wheels, brakes and 
brake control systems for around  
34,000 in-service aircraft. It continues  
to develop innovative technology for new 
programmes enabling the business to 
retain its leading position in its target 
markets, underscored by the strong 
market share gains in recent years, 
notably on super mid-size and long- 
range business jets. The division  
targets sole-source programmes and  
is particularly strong in regional  
aircraft, large business jets and military 
aircraft. The division represents 21%  
of Group revenue, generating 86%  
of its revenue from the aftermarket  
and 14% from OE sales.
MABS’ revenue grew by 2% on an organic 
basis, with good growth in civil, both OE 
and AM, being partially offset by a 16% 
decline in military following the 
previously reported completion of the US 
B-1B and Taiwanese Air Force retrofit 
programmes. Regional aftermarket grew 
5% driven by increases in fleet size and 
utilisation, and business jet aftermarket 
grew by 18%, with a particularly strong 
first half. Large jet aftermarket saw 
growth of 6% with strong DC10 spares 
revenue more than offsetting modest 
declines in MD80 and MD90. Operating 
margins declined from 39.0% to 37.3%, 
with unfavourable mix and the non-
recurrence of the US retiree medical 
benefit in 2014 the principal contributors.
Meggitt Control Systems (MCS) designs 
and manufactures products which 
manage the flow of liquids and gases 
around aero and industrial turbines, and 
control the temperature of oil, fuel and  
air in aircraft engines. The division, which 
also provides fire protection equipment  
to engines and airframes, represents 24% 
of Group revenue, generating 48% of its 
revenue from OE and 52% from the 
aftermarket. 
For MCS, revenue was up by 3% on an 
organic basis. Civil aerospace declined  
by 1% overall, with 4% growth in OE being 
more than offset by a 4% decline in 
aftermarket, driven by weakness in large 
jets caused by the availability of surplus 
parts. Military revenue grew by 14%, 
primarily aftermarket, following a 
particularly weak 2014. Operating 
margins decreased from 26.3% to 24.4% 
driven by the mix effect of civil OE growth 
and civil aftermarket decline.
Meggitt Polymers & Composites (MPC) 
has a bias towards military, representing 
56% of its revenue in 2015. It supplies 
flexible bladder fuel tanks, ice protection 
products and composite assemblies for  
a range of fixed wing and rotorcraft 
platforms and complex seals packages 
for civil and military platforms. These 
products are linked by their dependence 
on similar materials technology and 
manufacturing processes. It supplies 
over 80% of the US military requirements 
for fuel bladders and ballistically-
resistant and crashworthy fuel tanks. 
MPC represents 11% of Group revenue 
and generated 57% of its revenue from  
OE and 43% from the aftermarket. The 
recent acquisitions of the composites 
businesses of EDAC and Cobham plc  
are reported as part of MPC.

Organic growth excludes the impact of M&A and currency and is reconciled in Table 3.        
MPC revenue declined by 1% on an 
organic basis, with unchanged military 
revenues and weakness in civil 
aftermarket offsetting growth in civil OE. 
Operating margins declined from 12.4% to 
8.7% due to high levels of up-front new 
product introduction expenditure ahead of 
production ramp-up on upcoming aircraft 
programmes over the next few years, and 
a weaker product mix.
Meggitt Sensing Systems (MSS) designs 
and manufactures highly engineered 
sensors to measure a variety of 
parameters such as vibration, 
temperature, pressure, fluid level and 
flow as well as power storage, conversion 
and distribution systems and avionics 
suites for aerospace applications. Its 
products are designed to operate 
effectively in the extreme conditions of 
temperature, vibration and contamination 
that exist in an aircraft or ground-based 
turbine engine. Sensors are combined 
into broader electronics packages, 
providing condition data to operators and 
maintainers of engines, contributing to 
improved safety and lower operating 
costs. MSS has migrated these products 
into other specialist markets requiring 
similar capabilities, such as test and 
measurement, automotive crash test and 
medical. Combining its capabilities with 
MABS, it has a number of civil aerospace 
tyre pressure monitoring systems already 
in service and further systems under 
development, having secured positions 
for this technology on ten aircraft 
platforms. MSS represents 29% of Group 
revenue and generated 76% of its revenue 
from OE and 24% from the aftermarket. 
MSS revenue grew 3% on an organic 
basis, with a modest decline in military 
and broadly flat energy revenue being 
more than offset by 3% growth in civil, 
largely OE, and strong growth in other 
markets including medical and 
automotive. Operating margins decreased 
from 16.8% to 15.2% reflecting adverse 
mix in the lower margin civil OE revenue 
stream and the non-recurrence of the 
favourable renegotiation of a loss-making 
contract in 2014. 
Meggitt Equipment Group (MEG) 
comprises principally our non-engine 
actuation, dedicated military businesses 
and Heatric. The division represents  
15% of Group revenue and generates  
84% of its revenue from OE and 16%  
from the aftermarket. 
Revenue in MEG declined by 10% on an 
organic basis. 5% growth in military 
revenue, driven by a strong performance 
in the training businesses, was more  
than offset by a 40% decline in Heatric 
resulting from reduced expenditure by oil 
and gas customers following the decline 
in the oil price. Operating margins 
decreased from 11.6% to 3.7% driven 
principally by the weakness in Heatric, 
which made a small loss in the year.
Taxation
Meggitt’s underlying tax rate reduced to 
20% (2014: 21%) as a result of the release 
of provisions against prior period tax 
uncertainties and reduction in the UK 
corporation tax rate. Our guidance is 
increased to 23% (2014: 22%), based on 
our current business mix and barring  
any material changes in the tax legislation 
in the main countries in which we operate. 
Cash tax paid as a percentage of 
underlying profit was 5% (2014: 6%). The 
rate of cash tax paid is typically lower 
than our underlying tax rate due to tax 
deductible items which do not affect 
underlying profit, including goodwill 
amortisation and tax relief on retirement 
benefit deficit reduction payments. 
Our statutory tax rate, which includes 
items reported below underlying profit 
before tax, was 13% (2014: 15%). Cash tax 
paid as a percentage of statutory profit 
was 7% (2014: 9%). 
The Group is committed to complying fully 
with the laws in the countries in which it 
operates. It seeks to achieve a 
competitive tax rate by maintaining 
appropriate levels of debt in high tax 
jurisdictions, claiming available tax 
credits and incentives and utilising 
common financing structures where 
appropriate. We are rated as low risk by 
HM Revenue and Customs and our tax 
policy seeks to retain this low risk rating. 
As for all companies, the Group is 
exposed to changing tax legislation in the 
territories in which we operate and, being 
multinational, also to international 
initiatives such as the current OECD Base 
Erosion and Profit Shifting project (“BEPS 
project”). The BEPS project published its 
recommendations at the end of 2015. Out 
of the 15 strands covered by the project, 
at least three could impact the Group 
depending on how territories take 
forward the BEPS recommendations and 
the final form of any legislation. These 
three strands are those covering hybrid 
mismatch arrangements, interest 
deductibility and transfer pricing/country 
by country reporting. The Group is 
currently monitoring these developments, 
participating in public consultations 
where appropriate, reviewing data 
collection systems and developing 
contingencies to mitigate the impact, 
should our existing arrangements be 
made ineffective. 
Earnings per share (EPS)
Underlying EPS declined by 2% to 31.6 
pence (2014: 32.4 pence). The EPS decline 
was lower than the reduction in 
underlying profit before tax due to the 
accretive nature of the share buyback 
programme and the reduction in 
underlying tax rate. 
Statutory EPS increased by 5% to 23.2 
pence (2014: 22.0 pence). The increase is 
higher than in statutory profit before tax

capital as a result of the buyback 
programme and the reduction in the 
statutory tax rate.
Dividends
The Group’s policy is to grow dividends 
broadly in line with underlying EPS over 
the cycle. The Board has recommended  
a final dividend of 9.80 pence (2014: 9.50 
pence) which would result in a 5% 
increase in the full-year dividend to  
14.40 pence (2014: 13.75 pence).
The Company has a balance on its profit 
and loss reserve at 31 December 2015 of 
£1.0 billion (2014: £1.1 billion), the 
substantial majority of which relates to 
reserves which can be distributed as a 
dividend or used for share buybacks, and 
accordingly we have a comfortable level 
of headroom. 
The dividend reinvestment plan, 
introduced in 2015, will be continued in 
2016. It provides an efficient reinvestment 
option for shareholders, without the  
need for new shares to be issued by  
the Company.
Investing for the future
Targeted investment in technology 
development remains critical to our 
long-term organic growth. Total R&D 
expenditure in 2015 of £158.7 million was 
9.6% of revenues (2014: £148.3 million, 
9.5%), of which 17% (2014: 19%) was 
funded by customers. The charge to net 
operating costs including amortisation 
and impairment increased by 1% on an 
organic basis to £61.4 million (2014: £58.5 
million).
Growth in R&D largely reflects our 
impressive win rate on new programmes 
during the last bid cycle, and the ongoing 
investment in new technology aligned to 
our customers’ future technology 
requirements. A third of the expenditure 
was on new wheels and brakes 
programmes and over 40% focused on 
products for engines and engine 
accessories. These two categories 
support future revenue exceeding £10 
billion. The balance was spread across  
a range of civil, military and energy 
programmes including a step-up in 
development costs in our training 
businesses in response to recent contract 
successes, which will start to have a 
meaningful impact on revenue from the 
end of 2016. R&D is expected to remain at 
elevated levels during 2016, supporting 
our medium-term revenue growth 
assumptions and increasing revenue 
security, particularly as the majority of 
the investment is on platforms where we 
have won sole-source positions. As the 
large number of aircraft programmes 
currently in development start to enter 
into service, we expect R&D investment 
as a percentage of revenue to start to 
decline. New product introduction 
expenditure associated with these 
platforms, which is expensed as incurred,  
will remain elevated for a period of time, 
which is good for future revenues but 
impacts profitability in the short term.
Our investment in programme 
participation costs including the supply of 
equipment free of charge to new aircraft, 
mostly in MABS, decreased by 11% 
organically reflecting completion of the 
B-1B retrofit programme in 2014. Growth 
is expected to resume in 2016 and beyond 
as deliveries of aircraft equipped with our 
wheels and brakes increase, which in 
turn will drive aftermarket revenue 
stretching out for decades. Our market 
share of wheels and brakes on the fleet  
of super mid-size and large business jets 
in 2015 was 65%, supportive of our 
expectation that we will have a market 
share on the overall fleet in excess of  
70% by 2020.
Capital expenditure on property, plant 
and equipment and intangible assets was 
£55.4 million (2014: £42.2 million). This 
includes investments in additional 
furnace capacity in MABS and capacity 
increases in the MCS North Hollywood 
and MPC Rockmart facilities. While 
significant, the 27% organic increase in 
capital expenditure was off a very low 
base from 2014 and was less than 
originally expected, reflecting the 
cancellation of investment in additional 
capacity at Heatric and the cash impact of 
some capital commitments slipping into 
2016. Capital expenditure will accelerate 
in 2016, including the impact of deferrals 
from 2015 and additional capacity 
requirements at the recently acquired 
composites businesses ahead of delivery 
growth of some key platforms including 
A320neo and 737MAX.
Driving organic growth through 
operational excellence
The Meggitt Production System (MPS), 
our single, global approach to continuous 
improvement, was launched during 2013. 
MPS will create the sustainable quality 
and delivery culture that confers 
competitive advantage beyond our 
technical expertise, enabling the Group to 
deliver a higher rate of organic growth 
over the long term. It will also enable us 
to become more cost competitive through 
the reduction of working capital and the 
elimination of the cost of poor quality. 
MPS, a six-phase programme which will 
take five to seven years to become fully 
embedded, has now been launched at all 
of our major manufacturing sites, and will 
be rolled out across the additional 
composites sites acquired during 2015 as 
part of the integration activities. As at the 
end of 2015, two sites have exited the 
third stage - the point at which we expect 
to start to see meaningful improvements 
in financial performance – and we expect 
further maturity of the programme during 
2016. Meanwhile, the functional roll-out 
of the programme beyond operations is 
well under way. 
We have already seen some significant 
improvements in quality and delivery 
since inception, with defective parts per 
million down 87% and on-time delivery  
up by 14%. This sustained improvement  
is recognised and appreciated by our 
customers, and has been instrumental  
in the Group having received 12 supplier 
awards from a number of different 
customers during the year. Given the 
demonstrable success we have seen 
internally, we have accelerated the 
planned deployment of the key tools and

Cash flow and borrowings
Free cash flow of £199.0 million (2014: 
£146.8 million) represents a 36% year-on-
year improvement despite the reduction 
in profit and continued high levels of 
investment to support future growth. This 
was driven by strong working capital 
management, enhanced by higher cash 
receipts at Heatric as projects were 
completed.
The net cash outflow of £431.4 million 
(2014: inflow of £21.1 million) reflects 
M&A activity totalling £363.2 million, 
principally the acquisitions of two 
composites businesses, and the share 
buyback totalling £146.4 million (2014: 
£33.7 million). The cash dividend payment 
also increased to £111.1 million (2014: 
£51.4 million) following the withdrawal of 
the scrip dividend option. 
Debt structure and financing
The Group’s borrowings comprise a 
combination of US private placement debt 
and syndicated and bilateral bank credit 
facilities. During the year, and as provided 
under the facility agreement, the Group 
requested a one year extension of its 
USD900 million committed revolving 
credit facility. This request was approved 
by all of the participating banks and 
accordingly the facility now matures in 
September 2020. There is one further 
option year under the facility agreement, 
which the Group would expect to exercise, 
subject to bank approval.
To fund the acquisition of the composites 
businesses of Cobham plc and EDAC, the 
Group agreed two new two-year USD300 
million bilateral credit facilities with each 
of Bank of America and HSBC, maturing 
in September 2017. The terms of these 
facilities are substantially similar to the 
existing USD900 million revolving credit 
facility with the exception of margins, fees 
and duration which are more typical of 
bridge finance arrangements. We will be 
assessing the capital markets in 2016 
with a view to refinancing the bilateral 
facilities on a longer term basis.
There were no other changes in facilities 
available to the Group in the year. 
At 31 December 2015, the Group had 
undrawn committed credit facilities of 
£372 million after taking account of 
surplus cash (2014: £431 million). 
Facility Headroom (Table 6)
Share buyback programme
The Group has a strong track record of 
cash generation and net debt reduction, 
even in periods of the aerospace cycle, as 
we are currently experiencing, that drive 
elevated organic investment. In addition 
to supporting our regular dividend, we 
seek to deploy this cash by investing 
organically to accelerate the Group’s 
growth and investing in the acquisition of 
complementary businesses that will 
enhance our offering to customers and 
deliver enhanced returns to 
shareholders.
The Board believes that in maintaining an 
efficient balance sheet with appropriate 
covenant headroom and investment 
capacity, a net debt/EBITDA ratio, as 
measured on a bank covenant basis, of 
between 1.5x and 2.5x is appropriate, 
whilst retaining the flexibility to move 
outside the range if appropriate. 
In November 2014, with a net debt/
EBITDA ratio of 1.3x and a relative lack of 
sizeable acquisition opportunities 
meeting our strict investment criteria, 
the Group commenced a share buyback 
programme. Following the announcement 
of the acquisitions of the two composites 
businesses, the Group suspended the 
share buyback programme in September 
2015. At 31 December 2015, the Group had 
a net debt/EBITDA ratio of 2.3x.
During 2015, the Group purchased 28.3 
million shares at an average share price 
of 512.90 pence and a cost of £146.4 
million under the buyback programme. 
With the exception of 1.5 million shares 
retained in treasury, shares purchased 
under the programme in the year were 
cancelled. The total number of shares 
purchased under the buyback 
programme, from its commencement in 
November 2014 to its suspension, was 
35.2 million at an average share price of 
508.54 pence, with a total of £180.1 million 
of capital returned to shareholders.
Debt financing risks
The Group seeks to minimise debt 
financing risk as follows:
a. Concentration of risk
We raise funds through private placement 
issuances and committed bank facilities 
to reduce reliance on any one market. 
Bank financing is sourced from 13 
international institutions spread across 
North America, Europe and Asia. No 
single bank accounts for more than 18% 
of the Group’s total credit facilities and 
the credit rating of lenders is monitored 
by our treasury department. Our largest 
lenders are Bank of America, HSBC, Bank 
Chief Financial Officer’s review continued

Industriel et Commercial, JP Morgan, 
Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi and Sumitomo 
Mitsui Banking Corporation. We seek to 
maintain at least £100 million of undrawn 
committed facilities, net of cash, as a 
buffer.
b. Set-off arrangements
The Group utilises set-off and netting 
arrangements where possible to reduce 
the potential effect of counterparty 
defaults. All treasury transactions are 
settled on a net basis where possible and 
surplus cash is generally deposited with 
our lenders up to the level of their current 
exposure to us.
c. Refinancing risk
We seek to ensure the maturity of our 
facilities is staggered and any refinancing 
is concluded in good time, typically more 
than 12 months before expiry.
d. Currency risk
To ensure we mitigate headroom erosion 
due to currency movements, our credit 
facilities are denominated in US Dollars, 
the currency in which most of our 
borrowings are held.

Net debt 1,053.1 575.5
e. Covenant risk 
Our committed credit facilities contain 
two financial ratio covenants - interest 
cover and net debt to EBITDA. The 
covenant calculations are drafted to 
protect us from potential volatility caused 
by accounting standard changes, sudden 
movements in exchange rates and 
exceptional items. This is achieved by 
measuring EBITDA on a frozen GAAP 
basis, retranslating net debt and EBITDA 
at similar average exchange rates for the 
year and excluding exceptional items from 
the definition of EBITDA. We continue to 
have considerable headroom on both key 
financial covenant measures.

Interest cover ≥3.0x 21.4x 20.8x

A ratio of 4.0x applies in the two six month reporting 
periods following a significant acquisition.
Interest risk
The Group seeks to reduce the volatility 
caused by interest rate fluctuations on net 
debt. Our US private placements are 
subject to fixed interest rates, whereas 
borrowings under our syndicated and 
bilateral bank credit facilities are at 
floating rates. To manage interest rate 
volatility, we use interest rate derivatives 
to either convert floating rate interest into 
fixed rate or vice versa. Our policy is to 
generally maintain at least 25% of net 
debt at fixed rates with a weighted 
average maturity of two years or more. At 
31 December 2015, the percentage of net 
debt at fixed rates was 23% (2014: 48%) 
and the weighted average period to 
maturity was 2.9 years (2014: 4.5 years for 
the first 25%). The floating rate bilateral 
bank credit facilities taken out to fund the 
acquisitions in the year, resulted in a 
reduction in the proportion of net debt at 
fixed rates to below 25%. It is the intention 
to seek to refinance this floating rate  
debt with fixed rate debt. At the same  
time as the new bilateral facilities were 
taken out, the Group entered a USD200 
million treasury lock to secure current 
market interest rates for future fixed  
rate financing.
Foreign exchange risk
The Group is exposed to both translation 
and transaction risk due to changes in 
foreign exchange rates. These risks 
principally relate to the US Dollar/
Sterling rate, although exposure also 
exists in relation to other currency pairs 
including translation risk for the Sterling/
Euro and Sterling/Swiss Franc and 
transaction risk for the US Dollar/Euro 
and US Dollar/Swiss Franc.

The results of overseas businesses are

2014, the Group’s underlying profit before 
tax for the year benefited by £12.6 million 
from currency translation including a 
favourable impact of £13.6 million 
relating to US Dollar denominated profits 
partly offset by an adverse impact on 
other currencies.

As measured against the 2015 average translation

Transaction risk arises where revenues 
and/or costs of our businesses are 
denominated in a currency other than 
their own. We hedge known and some 
anticipated transaction currency 
exposures based on historical experience 
and projections. Our policy is to hedge at 
least 70% of the next 12 months’ 
anticipated exposure and to permit the 
placing of cover up to five years ahead. 
Compared to 2014, the Group’s underlying 
profit before tax for the year was 
adversely impacted by £2.1 million from 
currency transaction movements, 
including an adverse impact of £1.2 
million relating to US Dollar/Sterling 
exposure. Each ten cent movement in the 
US Dollar against the average hedge 
rates achieved in 2015 would affect 
underlying profit before tax by 
approximately £8.0 million in respect of 
US Dollar/Sterling exposure, £3.0 million 
in respect of US Dollar/Euro exposure 
and £4.0 million in respect of US Dollar/
Swiss Franc exposure.

156768.01 Text 001-047-NEW-06.03.16.indd   39 07/03/2016   04:15 Post-retirement benefit schemes
The Group’s principal defined benefit 
pension schemes are in the UK and  
US and are closed to new members. 
Total pension scheme deficits reduced 
to £239.1 million (2014: £271.0 million). 
Drivers of the movement in net  
deficit included:
• A reduction of £32.6 million (2014: 
Increase of £124.6 million) due to 
remeasurement gains on scheme 
liabilities. The main cause of the 
increase was an increase in the rates 
used to discount scheme liabilities in 
the UK and US. Accounting standards 
require these liabilities to be 
discounted using the yields on high 
quality AA corporate bonds, with a 
maturity that reflects the duration of 
the scheme liabilities. These yields 
increased by 25 basis points in the UK 
and 35 basis points in the US from the 
10 year low yields at the end of 2014. 
There has also been a modest 
reduction in UK liabilities from 
experience gains arising from the 2015 
actuarial valuation. These gains were 
partly offset by reduction in the rate 
used to discount Swiss liabilities.
• An increase of £7.2 million (2014: 
reduction of £30.9 million) due to 
remeasurement losses on scheme 
assets, principally driven by volatility 
in equity markets.
• An increase of £9.5 million (2014: £7.8 
million) arising from net interest 
expense on the deficit.
• Net deficit reduction payments of 
£22.4 million (2014: £27.8 million). 
Regulations in the UK and US require 
repayment of deficits over time. In the 
UK, the Group is currently making 
deficit payments in accordance with an 
agreement reached with the trustees 
following the last actuarial valuation in 
2012. This agreement provides for 
payments to gradually increase over 
the period to 2024. In the US, the level 
of deficit payments is principally driven 
by regulations. Amounts required to be 
paid in the US reduced in the year, as 
expected, reflecting the impact of new 
legislation implemented in the latter 
part of 2014 and are expected to fall 
further in 2016, before increasing 
from 2017. 
  Overall, the Group would have 
expected deficit contributions to 
reduce to £20.8 million in 2016 based 
on the existing 2012 deficit reduction 
agreement with the UK trustees and 
absent further regulatory changes in 
the US. The April 2015 UK triennial 
valuation is however, approaching 
completion and discussions have 
commenced with the trustees over a 
revised recovery plan to address the 
increase in deficit of approximately 
£70.0 million since the previous 
valuation. Additional payments to 
address this deficit will likely start in 
quarter 2 of 2016, once the recovery 
plan is agreed with the trustees.
Meggitt has two other principal post-
retirement benefit schemes providing 
medical and life assurance benefits to 
certain US employees. The Group’s 
exposure to increases in future medical 
costs provided under these plans is 
capped. Both schemes are unfunded and 
have a combined deficit of £45.4 million 
(2014: £46.8 million). Deficit payments 
during the year were £2.0 million 
(2014: £1.5 million).

Governance and compliance
In 2015, the Board approved a revised 
Corporate Responsibility Policy to align it 
further with ISO 26000 and to confirm our 
commitment to uphold our employees’ 
human rights and our support for the Ten 
Principles outlined in the United Nations 
Global Compact. The revised policy 
highlighted our commitment to working 
with and supporting local schools, colleges, 
universities and other education initiatives. 
The updated policy is published on our 
website, together with Board-approved 
policies on health and safety, environment, 
ethics and business conduct, anti-
corruption and trade compliance. 
The Board is responsible for 
implementation and performance of the 
Corporate Responsibility Policy. On a 
day-to-day basis, the Executive Director, 
Commercial and Corporate Affairs has 
functional responsibility for corporate 
responsibility (CR) matters on behalf of the 
Chief Executive, including ethics and 
business conduct, trade compliance and 
charity and community activity. The Group 
Operations Director has functional 
responsibility for health, safety and 
environment on behalf of the Chief 
Executive. Divisional presidents and site 
directors are responsible for implementing 
our policies and procedures locally. The 
Group is committed to providing the support 
needed to ensure our facilities can fulfill the 
requirements outlined in our policies. 
Activity in 2015 
Environment
Meggitt continues to target high levels of 
environmental performance throughout 
our businesses based on global standards 
and procedures. To achieve the goals of 
our Environmental Policy, Meggitt’s 
environmental management programme 
includes setting environmental targets, 
communicating regulatory developments, 
training and information-sharing, data 
analysis and internal and external audits 
of environmental management 
systems and practices. 
Our global environmental audit 
programme, supported by external 
consultants, includes a comprehensive 
review of applicable regulatory 
requirements. In 2015, our environmental 
audit programme, supported by external 
consultants, was integrated with our 
health and safety audit programme and 
the audits included a comprehensive 
review of applicable regulatory 
requirements as well as site compliance 
against industry best practice standards. 
In total, ten sites were audited in 2015. 
All our manufacturing facilities are 
required to obtain the ISO 14001 
standard. At the end of 2015, all had 
achieved certification, except our new 
acquisitions which are currently setting 
out their plans to achieve certification. 
Performance
Table 1 shows our performance for key 
environmental metrics and Table 2 
shows our progress on achieving 
internally set targets. 
Our overall performance in 2015 reflects 
the challenges we face reducing 
Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHGs) arising 
from the significant energy consumption 
demands associated with our carbon 
brake manufacturing processes at 
Meggitt Aircraft Braking Systems (MABS).  
The carbon densification process requires 
large amounts of electricity and natural 
gas due to high processing temperatures 
over lengthy cycle times. Primarily due to 
a significant increase in carbon production 
in 2015, our GHG emissions remained 
relatively flat as shown in Table 1 below.  
This is also reflected in our performance 
against the five-year targets for electricity 
and natural gas consumption (Table 2). It 
will be challenging for us to achieve the 
targets by the end of 2016.
Excluding MABS, the Group would have 
achieved a 4% reduction in GHG emissions 
on an absolute basis and a 6% reduction  
in GHG emissions normalised to revenue. 
We are evaluating new strategies and 
technologies which should enable us to 
reduce absolute GHG emissions from 
MABS, including the use of cogeneration 
and new renewable energy technologies 
such as fuel cells.  
In 2015, we announced new targets for the 
reduction of GHG emissions across the 
Group. Excluding MABS, we have set an 
aggressive target to reduce our GHG 
emissions by 25% relative to revenue over 
a ten-year period using 2015 as the 
baseline year. For MABS, we have set a 
separate 2016 GHG ceiling efficiency 
target of 138 kilogrammes of GHGs 
emitted per kilogramme of carbon 
produced. This separate target is 
necessary due to the difficulties in 
reducing electricity and natural gas 
consumed during the carbon brake 
manufacturing process. The ceiling target 
is based on analysis of data gathered over 
prior years that shows this to be the 
maximum amount of carbon brake 
material that could be produced when the 
carbon furnaces run at peak efficiency.

Meggitt recycles an estimated average 
100,000 cubic metres of water each year 
through closed-loop water recycling 
systems installed at several facilities. 
Other water conservation measures 
include installation of thermostatically-
controlled water circulation systems on 
process tanks reducing evaporative 
losses. As a result of these efforts in 2015, 
we continued to decrease our water 
consumption despite increased water 
used at the MABS UK facility during the 
carbon manufacturing process and 
significant leaks which were resolved in 
the water supply at one site. Decreased 
production demands at some UK facilities 
and water restrictions implemented in 
response to drought conditions in 
California contributed to the overall 
decrease in water consumption in 2015. 
We are on track to meet our five-year 
target for reduction in water usage.
We continued to decrease the amount of 
waste generated in 2015 with the 
conclusion of consolidation, demolition 
and construction projects that began in 
2014. Our facilities continued to improve 
their recycling efforts in 2015 by 
identifying waste recycling vendors for 
items such as cardboard and waste 
carbon material. As a result, we increased 
our waste recycled by 13% and decreased 
our waste to landfill by 9% in 2015 
compared to 2014. We are on track to 
meet our five-year target for increases  
in recycled waste and reduction of waste 
to landfill.

Career-long learning
Encouraging employees to take on new challenges is a key principle 
across the Group. There are numerous initiatives but one of the most 
successful is the tuition reimbursement programme at Meggitt 
Aircraft Braking Systems (MABS). 
It grew more than 50% in 2015, with USD200,000 paid in fees for 32 
employees studying postgraduate qualifications in areas such as 
law, engineering, project management and business. 
Doug Moseley, VP of Applied Research and Technology, used the 
scheme 20 years ago to complete a Masters in engineering and is 
now using it to help finance a law degree. 
“I was spending more and more time dealing with intellectual 
property in my role and found the legal aspects fascinating. The 
degree is demanding—20-30 hours a week—but it’s food for the mind 
and it’s very useful in my work. Patents can cost USD150,000 during 
their lifespan so the question of whether to file is not taken lightly.” 
“The R&D—in areas like quiet carbon braking—is also expensive but 
it could give us a strong competitive edge. The more I understand 
the legal issues, the better I can steer our decision making. And once 
I’m fully qualified, there are opportunities at division and Group level 
to get more involved with legal. I’m very excited about this next stage 
in my career.”
The programme has also proved a good recruiting tool. One of the 
reasons Programme Manager Jennifer Flowers joined MABS was  
to study for a Masters in engineering management.
“The scheme covered 70% of the fees and my manager was very 
supportive throughout. It’s broadened my horizons and opened a lot 
of doors for me.”
“The degree was very much rooted in aerospace so my industry 
knowledge expanded rapidly. And there were classes in finance, 
project management and systems engineering alongside the main 
management component.” 
“It qualified me to take a certificate in project management too 
which, in turn, led to a promotion. I’ve put a lot of my learning into 
practice since, developing templates and tools to streamline 
processes at MABS within programme management.”

We had a slight increase in our absolute 
GHG emissions in 2015 and our GHG 
emissions relative to revenue remained 
relatively static due to the increases in 
electricity and natural gas consumed at 
MABS facilities. The rest of the Group 
achieved a reduction in absolute GHG 
emissions through site consolidations and 
relocation to newer, more energy efficient 
properties.
Saving energy 
In 2015, our facilities continued to focus 
energy reduction initiatives on improving 
facility lighting, replacing older, inefficient 
equipment and upgrading building 
insulation. Improvements included: 
•  O n g o i n g l i g h t i n g u p g r a d e p r o j e c t s a t 
many facilities resulting in reductions 
of approximately 55% of the energy 
used in previous lighting;
• Installation of variable speed drive 
compressors resulting in 10% 
electricity consumption savings;
• The carbon refurbishment programme 
at MABS continues to expand with over 
6,000 carbon discs reused and 
refurbished in 2015. The reduction in 
process time saved 3,486 tonnes of 
CO 2 that otherwise would have been 
emitted (representing approximately 
5% of MABS overall CO 2 emissions); 
and
• Recladding of building insulation at  
a UK facility resulting in increased 
heating and cooling efficiencies.
In 2015, Meggitt UK facilities representing 
90% of our UK energy consumption 
conducted energy efficiency audits under 
the Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme 
(ESOS) requirements. Recommendations 
were made from the audits and our 
facilities are assessing their feasibility. 
Many of the recommendations are being 
shared beyond the UK in similar 
operations, providing further opportunities 
for energy reduction initiatives.
We continue to actively investigate cleaner 
energy technologies including fuel cell 
power generation systems and solar 
energy throughout the Group.
REACH
Compliance with the European Community 
regulation on Registration, Evaluation, 
Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals 
(REACH) is managed by the Group’s REACH 
Steering Committee which continues to 
address the risks associated with the 
potential obsolescence of chemicals used 
by aerospace manufacturers. We 
continuously track substances regulated 
under REACH and work closely with our 
chemical suppliers to ensure substances 
are registered and will be approved for 
continued use, or identify suitable 
alternatives. We participate in aerospace 
industry trade groups in the United States  
and Europe involved in researching 
replacements for hexavalent chromium 
used in common aerospace manufacturing 
applications.  
Obsolescence
Our Obsolescence Review Board continued 
to identify and define a coordinated 
response to issues potentially affecting 
our business including conflict minerals, 
counterfeit and fraudulent materials and 
chemical obsolescence. Working with our 
customers and suppliers, we continue to 
strive for the reduction and substitution of 
materials and substances impacted by 
regulatory developments, performing 
material assessments, surveying our 
suppliers and undertaking reliability and 
qualification testing of alternatives. 
Health and safety
As a Group, we strive to ensure our 
employees can work safely and live healthy, 
productive lives by actively promoting 
policies and programmes that help 
individuals safeguard themselves, their 
co-workers and visitors. We have integrated 
health and safety into our Meggitt 
Production System (MPS) by driving 
standard safe work in every facility, product 
line and operation plan. Our safety first 
culture is reinforced in safety reviews of 
every production cell as part of the MPS 
daily layered accountability (DLA) daily 
management cycle (see People and Culture, 
page 24). Our guiding philosophy is that 
since all accidents and injuries are 
preventable, our ultimate goal can be zero 
accidents and injuries. In 2015, we continued 
to implement measures to improve safety in 
the workplace, including:  
• Regular external health and safety 
audits, which monitor site compliance 
with laws. These audits were integrated 
with our environmental audits from 
2015;
• A revised scoping of internal 
compliance audits to include a review of 
site adherence to Meggitt Health and 
Safety Procedure (MHSP) and process 
documents incorporating the best 
industry-recognised safety practices;
• Group-wide online health and safety 
awareness training for all employees;
• Implementation of a behavioural health 
and safety programme at four facilities 
in 2015, with the requirement for 
facilities to build such programmes 
into the MPS process;
• Health and safety provisions built into 
the MPS process, allowing facilities to 
continuously improve on their health 
and safety performance;
• Continued dissemination of 
information and best practice through 
intra-Group health, safety and 
environment (HSE) conferences, health 
and safety alerts and all-employee 
safety bulletins;
• Roll-out of a MHSP for safe industrial 
lift truck operation and process 
documents for safety when working 
with hexavalent chromium or 
hydrofluoric acid across the Group; 
and
• Roll-out of a HSE topic of the week for 
discussion at the DLA reviews held in 
every production cell. 
As a result of these measures great 
progress was made on our safety metrics 
across the Group, with a 20% decrease in 
days lost due to injury and lost time cases 
reported. We achieved a 37% decrease in 
the Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration (OSHA) recordable incident 
rate across our US sites. Since 2009 we 
have achieved a 72% decrease in the OSHA 
recordable incident rate at our US facilities. 
Although we made progress in 2015, our 
total reportable incidents and associated 
incident rate increased (see Table 4). The 
increase is due primarily to incidents that 
occurred at three of our overseas facilities 
accounting for 65% of all reportable 
incidents. Some of those incidents involved 
first aid only which did not result in any 
lost time from work, and some, although 
not work related, were required to be 
reported to the local government

Training the next generation
When 22-year-old Benjamin Broch from our Fribourg facility came 
to Meggitt’s UK Data Centre to train the IT team on a new set of tools, 
they were surprised at his age. Once the session was over, they were 
even more surprised at how much he knew.
“I did start working at Meggitt when I was 15,” he smiles.  
“Apprentices get a good head start.”
Ensuring there are enough skilled young people who have had the 
chance to develop their practical talents is as important for Meggitt’s 
future as it is for society in general.
Each year about ten teenagers join Meggitt Sensing Systems’ 
apprenticeship scheme in Switzerland, specialising in one of five 
areas: electrical or mechanical engineering, IT, commercial and 
logistics. The three or four-year programme combines rigorous on 
and off-the-job training at Meggitt with as many as eight academic 
subjects at school.
Second-year apprentice Daniel Fonseca is rotating through the key 
engineering departments this year and will specialise over the next 
two years. Having moved from Portugal only three years ago, he 
spent an additional year at school to build up his language skills and 
get to grips with the Swiss curriculum. 
This year, in addition to spending time in production, quality control, 
maintenance and prototyping to learn the basics, he has had the 
opportunity to design and build assembly stands for his colleagues 
in operations. 
“I chose Meggitt because it’s global and it’s a technology leader.  
That means I can practice my languages here and I get to train on 
machines that many of my classmates don’t get access to. There’s  
a lot of opportunity but that means expectations are high too. You’ve 
got to get the work done.”
Combining theory and practise in a commercial setting from a young 
age not only helps apprentices get a head start. Once they’re 
finished, they’re also ready and willing to train the next in-take.
“My time is now split 80/20 between Group and Fribourg projects,” 
says Benjamin. “I was an apprentice not long ago so when it comes 
to training, I know what’s helpful to pass on and when.”
authorities under applicable laws and 
regulations. We have implemented 
measures including behaviour-based 
safety training at these sites as part of 
our goal to achieve zero incidents, 
including reportable cases at any site.   
In 2015, we modified the criteria used in our 
Meggitt Safety Star award programme to 
include accident prevention measures 
through leading indicators as a measure of 
improved health and safety performance.  
During the year, 91% of our manufacturing 
facilities achieved at least a Meggitt Gold 
Safety Star award. Of those, 18 facilities 
achieved a Platinum Safety Star, the 
highest level of achievement that can be 
awarded within the programme.
Ethics and business conduct  
and trade compliance
Our ethics and business conduct 
programme commits us to conducting 
business fairly, impartially and in 
compliance with laws and regulations 
and acting with integrity and honesty 
in our business relationships. 
In 2015, we provided training across the 
Group on the following topics: ‘Crack the 
Code: Maintaining Integrity;’ ‘Anti-Bribery 
Principles;’ and ‘Professional Behaviour: 
Mutual Respect.’ We held two in-house 
ethics conferences in the UK and US, 
where facility-based ethics coordinators 
participated in live training on new 
directions for the business and reinforced 
the importance of the Ethics 
Programme. During the year, we 
published and distributed our new Ethics 
Guide in seven languages to all 
employees and directors. The Guide is 
available on our website. We also 
launched a Gifts Register to track gifts 
and hospitality given and received.
We have a highly-developed trade 
compliance programme, based on 
guidelines issued by the regulatory 
authorities and the Nunn-Wolfowitz Task 
Force Report of 2000 (the influential 
report on export compliance best 
practice). During 2015, we continued to 
implement our global trade management 
software solution to enhance our trade 
compliance programme and continued 
implementation of our enhanced import 
compliance programme at facilities in the 
US and the UK.
Local communities and 
charitable donations
Meggitt has a policy which underpins our 
approach to charitable giving and 
charitable sponsorship which was 
approved in 2014. We are committed to 
being good corporate citizens, and 
continue to support the communities in 
which we operate. Yearly reports reveal 
the exceptional generosity of many 
employees who give time and money to a 
wide range of national and local 
initiatives. Activity in 2015 included:
•  M e g g i t t U S b u s i n e s s e s a n d e m p l o y e e s have donated over USD 1 million in the 
past five years to the United Way, a 
US-based non-profit organisation 
focusing on resolving local community 
issues through partnerships with local 
schools, government agencies and 
voluntary and neighbourhood 
associations. Several Meggitt US 
businesses hold annual United Way 
drives to encourage employee

engagement in local community 
activities and initiatives designed to 
improve education, financial stability 
and health care for local families. In 
2015 our businesses raised over 
USD200,000. 
• For more than a decade, our MPC 
facility in Rockmart, Georgia has held 
an annual toy donation drive for needy 
children in local communities. Through 
these donations, hundreds of children 
have received toys during the holiday 
season. Similar “Toys for Tots” drives 
have been held annually at several of 
our other US facilities.
• MABS Akron US Women in Leadership 
group won the Corporate Service 
Award “Champions for Children” given 
by the local county children’s services 
organisation for their leadership and 
participation in community charitable 
events during the year including raising 
funds for over 200 Easter baskets for 
under-privileged children in the last five 
years.
• Our Piher facility in Spain held two fund 
raising events involving employees 
which resulted in 2,000 Euros being 
donated to a local food bank. Some 
6,000 Euros were donated to the School 
CPI-ETI to equip a new technology 
classroom with new computers in 
recognition of its collaboration with 
Piher over several years to provide 
engineering and technical education.
• Meggitt PLC has for many years funded 
annual excellence awards for staff at 
the local Poole Hospital NHS 
Foundation Trust and during 2015 our 
Executive Director, Commercial & 
Corporate Affairs joined its Board. 
Meggitt PLC regularly supports the 
Dorset Community Foundation, a 
provider of donor advisory and grant 
services which acts as an advocate at 
national and regional level for Dorset’s 
voluntary sector, and Julia’s House, a 
children’s hospice charity in Dorset 
dedicated to helping life-limited 
children and their families across 
Dorset and Wiltshire.
Although our Policy allows a broader 
range of charitable activity, the Group’s 
priority is to support charities or 
community organisations which focus on 
education initiatives. The Arkwright 
Scholarships and Akron bursary 
apprentice programmes are highlighted 
elsewhere in this report. Other activities 
include:
•  The Royal High School in California has 
an arrangement with our corporate 
office in Simi Valley to provide interns 
in support of the Regional Occupational 
Program. Each year, at least one 
student from that secondary school 
spends eight hours a week at the 
Meggitt-USA office, learning about 
business and undertaking specific 
projects that earn academic credits 
towards graduation. 
• Our facility in McMinnville, Oregon, 
driven by a shortage of skilled 
manufacturing labour in the 
community and surrounding area,

set up a manufacturing training 
programme at the local high school, 
engaging with local business, 
community leaders and the McMinnville 
Economic Development Partnership. 
Meggitt devised a training syllabus with 
the school, donated equipment for 
student training and trained the high 
school manufacturing shop teacher. 
Our employees
Equal opportunities  
The Group supports equal employment 
opportunities and opposes all forms 
of unlawful or unfair discrimination. 
It is Group policy to give full and fair 
consideration to job applications from 
disabled people, to provide opportunities 
for their training, career development 
and promotion and to continue 
wherever possible to employ staff 
who become disabled. 
We require all Meggitt employees, 
reinforced through our ethics training 
programme and its values, to treat all 
colleagues fairly and with respect. We 
recognise the value of diversity amongst 
our employees. Table 6 shows the number 
of women employed at all levels of the 
workforce. The Board’s approach to 
diversity is discussed in the Nominations 
Committee report (see page 59).

Inspiring young engineers
Engineering has a long, proud history in the UK but with energy, 
aerospace, manufacturing and the technology sectors all playing a 
key role in the economy, the demand for young engineers outweighs 
the supply.
To help turn the tables, Meggitt joined leaders such as Thales, 
Korean firm Doosan and Lockheed Martin to mentor young 
engineers in partnership with the Arkwright Scholarships Trust, one 
of the UK’s leading engineering education organisations. It works 
with more than 800 schools across the country to identify and inspire 
the next generation of engineers.
In 2014, graduate engineer Tom Newman started mentoring Calum 
Mills, one of three Arkwright teenagers Meggitt has worked with 
over the past two years. 
“We spoke regularly on the phone and I helped organise work 
experience at Meggitt Aircraft Braking Systems. We set what I 
thought was a tough assignment to design a landing gear shock 
absorber. But they really applied themselves and completed it in just 
a few days.”
“I’m very grateful,” says Calum, who recently earned a place at 
Loughborough University, a leading UK engineering school. “The 
work experience really helped me make my mind up about my future 
career. And Tom was very helpful in advising me on a design project I 
undertook, looking at the design and build of a drone for surveying 
disaster areas and delivering emergency supplies.” 
Students on the scheme also benefit from advice on university 
selection and application. Mentors are generally recent graduates 
who draw on their own experience to advise on the respective 
strengths of leading engineering universities and suggest  
extracurricular activities to strengthen applications. 
“Mentoring is an important part of my own professional  
development as I work towards becoming a Chartered Engineer,” 
says Tom. “But it’s been very rewarding on a personal level, too.  
It’s great to have an opportunity to give back to the engineering 
industry even though I’m only just getting started myself.”
Human rights
We confirm our commitment to the 
human rights of our employees in our 
Corporate Responsibility Policy, which 
we apply across all our businesses. 
Our updated Policy included a new 
commitment to uphold our employees’ 
human rights and support the Ten 
Principles outlined in the United Nations 
Global Compact, relating to human  
rights, labour, the environment and 
anti-corruption. We are reviewing our 
processes as a result of the recent 
modern slavery legislation enacted  
in the UK and expect to make the  
required statement in 2017 for the  
2016 financial year. 
Employee consultation 
The Group regards employee 
communication as a vital business 
function. Communication and consultation 
is carried out at facilities by operations 
directors and other line managers using 
a variety of formats including daily 
meetings on shop floors, monthly 
all-employee ‘Town Hall’ meetings, team 
briefings and works councils. We respect 
all employee relations regulations. 
Corporate communications take a variety 
of forms, including presentations from 
the Chief Executive via audio-visual 
media, global web-enabled conferences, 
top-down strategy dissemination from the 
Chief Executive, publications such as the 
Meggitt Review and a variety of 
electronically-distributed newsletters. 
Results presentations are disseminated 
across the Group, which enhance our 
employees’ understanding of the financial 
and economic factors affecting its 
performance. 
The directors encourage employees to 
become shareholders to improve active 
participation in, and commitment to, the 
Group’s success. This policy has been 
pursued for all UK employees through  
the Share Incentive Plan and the 
Sharesave Scheme.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE REPORTS STRATEGIC REPORT 49
Chairman’s introduction
Throughout the financial year ended 31 December 2015 and to 
the date of this report, we have complied with the provisions set 
out in the UK Corporate Governance Code 2014 (the Code) 
published by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC). This 
excludes Code Provision B.6.2, which is the requirement for the 
board evaluations of FTSE 350 companies to be facilitated 
externally at least every three years. Our last externally 
facilitated evaluation was in 2012. The Board decided in 2015  
that because of the timing of my appointment as Chairman in 
April 2015, there would be more value in having an externally 
facilitated evaluation in 2016. The Group has applied all other 
main and supporting principles set out in the Code and 
explanations are included in this report and in the Audit 
Committee, Nominations Committee and the Directors’ 
remuneration reports. The information required under 
Disclosure and Transparency Rule 7.2.6 is located in the 
Directors’ report.
The Board is committed to maintaining the high standards of 
corporate governance, which are fundamental to discharging  
our responsibilities. It is my responsibility to ensure that Meggitt 
is governed and managed in the best interests of shareholders 
and wider stakeholders. This includes encouraging open 
discussion and constructive challenge. In this report, we set out 
our governance framework and explain how sound and effective 
corporate governance practices support our strategy to create 
sustainable shareholder value over the long term.
Leadership
As part of the planned and continued evolution of the Board, 
there have been a number of Board changes in 2015. Phil Cox 
retired on 31 January 2015 to take up the Chairmanship of 
Drax Group plc. I joined the Board on 1 March 2015, replacing 
Sir Colin Terry as Chairman at the end of the annual general 
meeting (AGM). On 1 October, Colin Day joined the Board as 
a non-executive director and assumed responsibility for the 
Chairmanship of the Audit Committee from David Williams who, 
after over nine years as a non-executive director, retired from the 
Board on 31 December 2015. Paul Heiden took over from David 
as Senior Independent Director from 1 January 2016. 
On behalf of the Board I would like to thank Sir Colin, Phil and 
David  for their significant contributions to the Board and to wish 
them well for the future, and to welcome Colin Day as a non-
executive director. 
Effectiveness
In 2015, Board processes were improved as a result of the 2014 
evaluation and the Board agreed to defer our externally 
facilitated evaluation to 2016. 
The main findings from our 2015 internal evaluation related 
to administrative board processes and improvements in risk 
management and succession planning. More details on the 
evaluation process and findings are later in this report.
Accountability
In 2015, the Audit Committee discussed and agreed the process 
we needed to undertake to enable the Board to make the viability 
statement as required under the Code. A description of the 
process and the resulting statement is set out in the Risk 
management report (page 29). The report also includes our 
annual confirmations on risk management and internal control 
that were previously included in this Corporate governance 
report. The risk management process has been further 
enhanced in 2015. The process continues to evolve through the 
Group Risk Register, risk assurance map and revised risk 
appetite statement. During the year, the Board provided authority 
to the Audit Committee to oversee the risk management process. 
The Board has confirmed that this Annual Report is fair, 
balanced and understandable. You can find an explanation of the 
process we have used to make this determination on page 56.
Remuneration
At our AGM in 2015, shareholders overwhelmingly approved our 
Directors’ remuneration report. The 2015 report (pages 60 to 80) 
provides a detailed review of the Remuneration Committee’s 
2015 activities and bonus and share scheme performance in 
2015. For ease of reference, we have also included the 
Remuneration Policy approved at our AGM in 2014 (valid until the 
2017 AGM). The 2014 Code introduced new requirements relating 
to remuneration, including inserting clawback/malus into 
remuneration schemes. Our remuneration package and policy 
approved in 2014 is compliant with those requirements.

(ii) ensuring that adequate time is available for discussion of 
agenda items including strategic issues; (iii) leading the Board; 
and (iv) ensuring its effectiveness.

directors and oversees the relationship between them and the 
executive directors. The Chairman holds meetings with 
non-executive directors without executive directors present.
• the Chairman is responsible for ensuring directors receive 
accurate, timely and clear information and is satisfied that 
effective communication, principally by the Chief Executive  
and Chief Financial Officer, is undertaken with shareholders. 
• the Chairman agrees a personalised approach to the training 
and development of each director and reviews this regularly.
Senior Independent Director
The role of Mr Heiden, as Senior Independent Director, is to:
• make himself available to shareholders if they have concerns 
that cannot be resolved through normal channels;
• chair the Nominations Committee when it is considering 
the Chairman of the Board’s succession; and
• meet with the non-executive directors at least once a year  
to appraise the Chairman’s performance.
Non-executive directors
 The non-executive directors:
• play a full part by challenging executive management and 
contributing to the development of the Group’s strategy;
• scrutinise the performance of executive management and 
monitor the reporting of the Group’s performance, the integrity 
of financial information and the effectiveness of financial 
controls and risk management systems;

remuneration for executive directors and participating in the 
selection and recruitment of new directors and succession 
planning; and
• have terms and conditions of appointment which are available

Company Secretary
The appointment and removal of the Company Secretary is 
a matter for the Board. 
The work of the Board in 2015
The Board visited several facilities and received regular reports 
from executive management on strategy and business performance, 
financial performance (including treasury activity) and corporate 
affairs (including risk, legal and compliance). The Board approved 
the appointment of Colin Day as a non-executive director.
The Board covered the following specific items during 2015:
• there was a Board session dedicated to a detailed review 
and discussion of the Group’s strategy. The Group’s strategy 
process was significantly enhanced in 2015; and
• there was greater focus on risk, including a session to review 
and approve the Group’s risk appetite and a formal delegation 
of authority to the Audit Committee to oversee the risk 
management process.
The role of the Board 
The Board retains full and effective control of the Group and  
is collectively responsible for its success. It sets the Group’s 
strategy, ensures appropriate resources are in place to achieve 
the Group’s objectives and reviews performance regularly.
The Board is responsible for setting the Group’s values and 
standards and for ensuring obligations to shareholders, 
employees and other stakeholders are met. 
A Schedule of Matters Reserved for the Board (updated in 2015) 
sets out the matters on which the Board must make the final 
decisions. These include setting the Group’s strategy and 
approving the annual budget, changing the Group’s capital 
structure and capital allocation policy, approving acquisitions 
and disposals above a certain threshold and agreeing approval 
of results announcements, annual reports and dividends. 
If a decision is not reserved for the Board, authority lies, in 
accordance with authorisation policies and terms of reference, 
with a Board committee, a management committee, the Chief 
Executive or other executive director, Chief Operating Officer, 
divisional president or site director.

Corporate governance report continued
Annual Report. Further details of the composition and operation 
of these Committees are set out in the Audit Committee, 
Nominations Committee and Directors’ remuneration reports. 
Appointments to the Board
There is a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure for the 
appointment of new directors. Full details of the process for 
appointments made during the year are available in the 
Nominations Committee report set out on page 59.
Commitment
The letters of appointment for the Chairman and non-executive 
directors set out the time they are expected to commit. 
These can be inspected during normal business hours at the 
Company’s registered office and at the AGM. Other significant 
commitments of the Chairman and non-executive directors 
are disclosed on appointment and require approval thereafter. 
Details of significant appointments for all of the Board members 
are provided on pages 50 to 51.
Development
The Board is supplied with the information it needs to discharge 
its duties. 
Since Sir Nigel Rudd joined the Board, he has been through 
a comprehensive formal induction programme, including 
meetings with other directors, senior management, investors, 
auditors, brokers and other professional advisors, as well as site 
visits in the UK and US and a detailed induction pack. Mr Colin 
Day started a similar induction process in October 2015 following 
his appointment to the Board. The Company Secretary, who 
facilitates the induction of new directors and assists with 
professional development where required, will continue to 
enhance the induction process following feedback from directors. 
Directors are encouraged to update their skills regularly and 
their training needs are assessed as part of the Board evaluation 
process. Their knowledge and familiarity with the Group is 
facilitated by access to senior management, reports on the 
business and site visits. Resources are available to all directors 
to develop and update their knowledge and capabilities.
Information and support
The Chairman is responsible for ensuring directors receive 
accurate, timely and clear information. The Company Secretary 
is responsible for ensuring good information flows within the 
Board and Committees and between senior management and 
non-executive directors. The Board members have regular 
discussions about their information and support requirements, 
and are involved in setting the annual Board schedule.
The Board and its Committees have been provided with sufficient 
resources to undertake their duties. All directors have had 
access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary  
who is responsible to the Board for advising on all governance 
matters. The Board allows all directors to take external 
independent professional advice at the Group’s expense.
Board performance evaluation
The Board recognised that compliance with the UK Code on 
Corporate Governance would require an externally facilitated 
review in 2015. However, following the appointment of Sir Nigel 
Rudd as Chairman in April 2015, the Board considered this 
matter and concluded that conducting an external review in 2016 
would be more valuable and effective than an external evaluation 
carried out in 2015 when the Chairman had only recently 
assumed his role. 
The Board received and discussed:
• divisional and functional updates and presentations 
on operational performance, Customer Services & Support 
(aftermarket), M&A, engineering and technology, senior 
executive succession, operations, IT and investor relations;
• the Group’s strategic plan;
• reports on internal control, risk management and 
going concern; and
• reports on the activities of its committees.

Effectiveness
Composition
The Board considers it has a good balance of executive and 
non-executive directors, is of an appropriate size and has the 
independence, skills, experience and knowledge to enable the 
directors to discharge their respective duties and responsibilities 
effectively. All non-executive directors are considered 
independent under the Code.
All non-executive directors (other than the Chairman) are 
members of the Audit and Remuneration Committees on 
appointment. All non-executive directors are asked to join the 
Nominations Committee on appointment. Chairmanship of 
Committees is considered during discussions on composition 
and succession. No one other than Committee chairmen and 
members are entitled to attend the meetings, although others can 
be invited. Committee chairmen, members and regular meeting 
invitees are noted in the respective Committee reports below. 
Each of these Committees’ written terms of reference were 
reviewed and updated in 2014 by the Board and are available on 
our website. All Committee chairmen report orally on the 
proceedings of their Committees at the next meeting of the 
Board. Where appropriate, the Committee chairmen make 
recommendations to the Board on appropriate matters, for 
example, the fairness, balance and understandability of the 
156768.01 Text 052-059_NEW-06.03.16.indd   54 07/03/2016   04:26 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE REPORTS STRATEGIC REPORT 55
in 2015. The Chairman met a number of investors at their request 
after the trading update issued in October 2015.
Directors’ understanding of major shareholders’ views is 
enhanced by reports from the Head of Investor Relations, our 
brokers and attending analysts’ briefings. Analysts’ notes on the 
Group are made available to all directors.
We provide annual reports and other documents to shareholders 
in their elected format under the electronic communications 
provisions approved by shareholders at our AGM in 2007. 
Electronic copies of this Annual Report and Accounts 2015 and 
the Notice of AGM will be posted on our website, with 
announcements, press releases and other investor information, 
including an analysis of ordinary shareholders by size of holdings 
and shareholder type.
Constructive use of the Annual General Meeting
The Board uses the AGM to communicate with its shareholders.
Proxy appointment forms for each resolution provide 
shareholders with the option to direct their proxy to vote on 
resolutions or to withhold their vote. All proxy votes for, against 
and withheld are counted by the Company’s Registrars and the 
level of voting for, against and withheld on each resolution is 
made available after the meeting and on the Group’s website.  
The proxy form and the voting results announcement make it 
clear that a vote withheld is not a vote in law and will not be 
counted in the calculation of the proportion of votes for and 
against the resolution.
Separate resolutions are proposed at the AGM on substantially 
separate issues and there is a resolution relating to the financial 
statements. The Notice of AGM and related papers are sent to 
shareholders at least 20 working days before the meeting.
Meggitt encourages shareholders to vote at the AGM and 
provides a facility for electronic proxy voting. Shareholders who 
are not CREST members can vote online on resolutions proposed 
at the AGM via our website, after voting has opened. Proxy cards 
contain further details on how and when to vote and further 
information for CREST members. 
The respective Chairmen of the Audit, Remuneration and 
Nominations committees are available at the AGM to respond  
to questions. It is customary for all other directors to attend.
At the AGM to be held on 21 April 2016, in addition to the routine 
business, shareholder consent will be sought on the authority to 
convene general meetings on 14 clear days’ notice in accordance 
with the Articles (on the terms set out in the Notice of Meeting).
All directors are subject to election by shareholders at the first 
AGM after their appointment and are subject after that to 
re-election annually to comply with the Code. All directors in 
office at the date of the AGM will be subject to election or 
re-election. 
By order of the Board
M L Thomas
Company Secretary
22 February 2016
Accordingly, starting in December 2015 the Chairman led an 
internal performance evaluation and appraisal process for the 
Board, its members and its main Committees. The effectiveness 
review, carried out using questionnaires and group and individual 
discussions, covered strategy, risk management, the annual 
Board schedule, composition, succession, the appointment 
process, diversity, remuneration, audit and open channels 
of communication. 
The Board continues to be thoroughly engaged with the review 
process. A report summarising the findings of the evaluation 
was discussed by the Board and Committees at their meetings 
in February 2016. The main findings and recommendations of 
the 2015 evaluation were: (i) continuing to improve the Board’s 
involvement in the strategy process, which was already 
enhanced in 2015 with the introduction of a detailed Board 
strategy session; (ii) conducting more site visits in 2016 (as some 
had been postponed in 2015 owing to the appointment of the 
new Chairman) and increasing contact with senior executives 
other than those on the Board; (iii) continuing to enhance and 
embed the risk management process; and (iv) enhancing the 
succession process.
Accountability
Financial and business reporting
The financial statements contain an explanation of the directors’ 
responsibilities in preparing the Annual Report and the financial 
statements (pages 83 to 84) and a statement by the auditors 
concerning their responsibilities (page 91). The directors also 
report that the business is a going concern (page 84) and detail 
how the Group generates and preserves value over the longer 
term (the business model) and the Group’s strategy for delivering 
its objectives in the Strategic report (pages 1 to 47). The directors 
have also made a statement about the long-term viability of the 
Group, as required under the Code (page 29).
Remuneration
The Directors’ remuneration report is on pages 60 to 80. It sets 
out the activities of the Committee and provides details of the 
remuneration policy which was approved at our AGM in 2014, 
and how it has been implemented in 2015.
Relations with shareholders
The Group values its dialogue with institutional and 
private investors. 
The Board communicates with private investors via direct 
communication with our Head of Investor Relations and the 
Company Secretary and content distributed or made available 
on the investor relations section of our website and at the AGM 
(see below).
Effective communication with fund managers, institutional 
investors and analysts about the Group’s strategy, performance 
and policies is promoted by meetings involving, principally, the 
Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer. The Board receives  
and discusses reports from the Chief Executive and Chief 
Financial Officer and the Head of Investor Relations on the views 
of shareholders, which are discussed.
The Chairman and other non-executive directors are available  
to attend meetings with shareholders. A specific letter was 
issued to major shareholders after the AGM in 2015, offering 
a meeting with the Chairman and Senior Independent Director. 
Several such meetings on corporate governance took place 
156768.01 Text 052-059_NEW-06.03.16.indd   55 07/03/2016   04:26 56 MEGGITT PLC          REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015
Audit Committee report
Terms of Reference
The Committee operates within agreed terms of reference, which 
outline the key responsibilities of the Committee, were last 
updated in 2014 and are available on our website.
Work of the committee
In 2015, the Audit Committee:
• reviewed the financial information contained in the 2014 
Annual Report and 2014 full-year and 2015 interim results 
announcements and recommended them to the Board for 
approval;
• reviewed the 2015 external audit fees, and recommended 
them to the Board for approval;
• discussed the external audit strategy memorandum and 
interim audit clearance report for 2015;
• reviewed the independence and effectiveness of the external 
auditors, agreed their terms of engagement and fees; 
• received reports from internal audit at each meeting, 
discussed significant items and the effectiveness of internal 
audit, and approved the internal audit plan for 2016;
• received an IT audit update from Grant Thornton LLP;
• received a tax update from the Head of Tax and Treasury;
• received technical accounting and governance updates 
provided by the Group Financial Controller, Company 
Secretary and the external auditors;
• reviewed the adequacy and effectiveness of the systems of 
internal control;
• took responsibility for oversight of the risk management 
process, a duty which was delegated to the Committee by the 
Board in 2015;
• took responsibility for the oversight of the process executive 
management used to enable the Board to make the viability 
statement; and
• reviewed the effectiveness of the Committee and internal 
audit using the process described on page 55. There were no 
significant findings and the Committee confirmed it was 
satisfied with the outcome of the evaluation.
Since the year end, the Committee has approved the 2015 Annual 
Report and Accounts and full-year results announcement and 
recommended them to the Board for approval and provided advice 
to the Board that the 2015 Annual Report and Accounts, taken as 
a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable. The Committee 
provided this advice having verified and confirmed the 
managements’ process and its output, and provided confirmation to 
the Board that this process was effective. The Committee also 
recommended that the Board approve the viability statement, 
having overseen the viability statement process throughout the year 
(as described on page 29) and confirmed their agreement to 
propose the reappointment of the external auditors to 
shareholders for the 2016 financial year.
Chairman’s introduction
I am pleased to present the report of the Audit Committee for 2015. 
I chair the Audit Committee and as a Fellow of the Association of 
Chartered Certified Accountants, current Chief Executive Officer 
of Essentra plc, and previously Chief Financial Officer of Reckitt 
Benckiser Group plc, I can confirm that I bring recent and 
relevant financial experience to the Committee. I took over the 
Chairmanship of the Committee from David Williams on my 
appointment on 1 October 2015 and chaired my first meeting in 
December 2015. 
Committee members throughout 2015 were Guy Berruyer, Alison 
Goligher, Paul Heiden and Brenda Reichelderfer. Phil Cox and 
David Williams were also on the Committee, retiring on 
31 January 2015 and 31 December 2015 respectively. The 
Committee would like to thank Phil Cox and David Williams, 
particularly for the significant contribution made by David in his 
role as Chairman of the Committee. 
By invitation, there were a number of other regular attendees 
including the Chief Financial Officer, the Group Financial Controller 
and the internal and external auditors. The Chairman of the Board, 
the Chief Executive and the Executive Director, Commercial & 
Corporate Affairs also attended each meeting by invitation. 
The Audit Committee’s key role is to engender confidence in the 
integrity of our processes and procedures relating to internal 
financial control and corporate reporting. The Board relies on 
the Committee to review financial reporting and to appoint and 
oversee the work of the internal and external auditors. 
The work of the Committee in 2015 is described below in detail. 
It included advising the Board on whether these accounts are 
fair, balanced and understandable, review of the work carried out 
by executive management on the viability statement and taking 
on responsibility for oversight of the risk management process 
from the Board.

Significant judgements relating to the financial statements
The table below summarises the significant judgements reviewed by the Committee in respect of the Group’s financial statements. 
There were no new areas of significant judgement in 2015.
Significant judgements Action
Goodwill and other  
intangible assets arising  
on an acquisition
The principal judgements are management’s determination of the level at which impairment testing 
should be performed, the achievability of CGU business plans (and therefore future cash flows), 
growth rates beyond the period covered by the five-year business plans and the appropriateness of 
the discount rates applied to future cash flows. The Committee addressed this through consideration 
of a report from management setting out the basis for the assumptions, confirmation that the cash 
flows used were derived from the 2016 budget and strategic plan (which in their role as members of 
the Board, committee members had previously reviewed), a sensitivity analysis on key assumptions 
and an analysis of the headroom for each CGU. The Committee noted the increased level of sensitivity 
analysis undertaken in view of the increased market volatility and its impact on the Group’s results 
for 2015. The Committee agreed the assumptions made by management were appropriate and that no 
impairment was required. The Committee agreed with management that due to the proximity of the 
two acquisitions of businesses in 2015 to the balance sheet date, the fair value of net assets acquired 
would be finalised in 2016.
Development costs  
and programme  
participation costs
The Committee considered the method of testing for potential impairment used by management and 
the aggregation of related intangible assets at an aircraft platform level. The Committee addressed 
this through consideration of a report from management covering these areas, exposure to different 
platforms and a sensitivity analysis on specific programmes. The Committee concluded that 
assumptions made by management were reasonable and the carrying value and estimated useful 
lives of the assets were appropriate.
Provision for environmental  
matters relating to 
historic sites and related 
insurance receivables
The Committee considered a report from management setting out the basis for the judgements 
made and the extent to which these were supported by third party specialist advice. The Committee 
discussed with management the sensitivity of amounts recorded to increases in cost estimates, 
including the impact on insurance policy limits, and to changes in discount rates applied to future 
cash flows. The Committee agreed with the judgements made by management. 
Provision for onerous  
contracts and other matters
The key areas reviewed by the Committee were the provision held for the supply from a vendor of non-
conforming raw material identified in 2013 and the impact of Heatric’s local content provider in Brazil 
having received Court approval for its restructuring plan. The Committee considered a report from 
management setting out the bases for the judgements made on each of these items. The Committee 
agreed with the accounting treatment adopted. 
Retirement benefit  
obligations
Assumptions on mortality, inflation and the rates at which scheme liabilities are discounted can 
have a significant impact on the value at which retirement benefit obligations are included in the 
financial statements. The Committee considered a report from management setting out the basis 
on which the 2015 assumptions had been determined and how the Group’s assumptions used in its 
2014 financial statements benchmarked against those disclosed by other large corporate entities. 
The Committee concluded that the assumptions used, which were supported by third party actuarial 
advice, were appropriate.
Income taxes Judgements have to be made by management on the tax treatment of a number of transactions in 
advance of the ultimate tax determination being known. In determining the appropriateness of the 
estimates made, the Committee considered a report from management setting out the basis for 
the judgements including the release of provisions held against prior period tax uncertainties. The 
Committee concluded that the position taken was appropriate.
Treatment of items excluded 
from underlying profit 
measures
The Committee discussed the treatment and disclosure of costs and income included within 
exceptional operating items and merger and acquisition (M&A) related items, together with the 
exclusion from underlying profit of gains made from remeasurement of the share buyback close 
period commitment and the Group’s new cross currency and treasury lock derivatives. The Committee 
noted items were treated appropriately and, where applicable, consistently year on year. 
The Committee also discussed each of the above judgements with the external auditors before reaching their conclusions.
156768.01 Text 052-059_NEW-06.03.16.indd   57 07/03/2016   04:26 58 MEGGITT PLC          REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015
Audit Committee report continued
The Committee is satisfied that the overall levels of audit-related 
and non-audit fees are not material relative to the income of the 
office of PwC conducting the audit or PwC as a whole and 
therefore the objectivity and independence of the external 
auditors was not compromised.
Internal audit
The Committee agrees the annual internal audit plan which is 
developed according to a risk assessment process and ensures 
that adequate resources are available to execute the plan. The 
risk assessment process divides our business units into three 
tiers determined by financial measures, but subject to 
a discretionary risk based adjustment if there are circumstances 
which suggest a site should have an audit accelerated. Tier 1 
businesses are visited annually, with Tier 2 businesses visited 
every other year and Tier 3 businesses every third year. 
At each meeting, the Committee receives a status update on the 
audit programme and discusses and challenges any significant 
issues arising and monitors implementation by the businesses of 
any recommendations made. In 2015, internal audits were 
carried out at over 25 Group sites, including the finance shared 
service centres, as part of the 3 year rotational audit cycle.
Internal audit’s remit was expanded in 2014 to include IT, using 
the services of Grant Thornton UK LLP. The 2015 IT audit scope 
included reviews of IT security and our SAP (enterprise resource 
planning) and HR systems.
The Committee routinely meets internal audit without executive 
management present. No concerns have been raised and it was 
confirmed that the internal auditors had been able to carry out 
their work and offer constructive challenge to executive 
management during the year. The Committee considered the 
effectiveness of internal audit and confirmed that they 
were satisfied. 
Whistleblowing
The Ethics and Trade Compliance Committee is responsible 
for reviewing the process for handling allegations from 
whistleblowers. In February 2016, the Ethics and Trade 
Compliance Committee confirmed that it was satisfied with the 
Group’s process for handling whistleblowing allegations. 
Whistleblowing is included in our Ethics and Business Conduct 
Policy and Code of Conduct, which are available on our website. 
The Group sponsors an independently operated and monitored 
Ethics Line, enabling employees to report concerns about 
possible misconduct, with proportionate and independent 
investigation and appropriate follow-up action. Whistleblowing 
reports are received regularly by the Ethics and Trade 
Compliance Committee as part of the report from the Executive 
Director, Commercial and Corporate Affairs. 
Compliance with audit services order
We comply with the Competition and Market Authority Order 2014 
relating to the audit tendering and the provision of non-audit 
services, as discussed further above.
On behalf of the Audit Committee
Colin Day
Chairman of the Audit Committee
22 February 2016
Key areas of oversight
External audit
The external auditors are PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) 
who were appointed as Group auditors for the financial year 
commencing 1 January 2003 on 2 October 2003 after 
a competitive tender. There are no contractual obligations 
restricting the Committee’s choice of external auditors.
The lead audit partner is Mr Andrew Paynter whose appointment 
in this role commenced with the audit for the financial year ended 
31 December 2013. Mr Paynter has had no previous involvement 
with the Group in any capacity.
The Committee assessed the effectiveness of PwC and the 
external audit process using a questionnaire and a Committee 
discussion on the responses to the questionnaire. The Committee 
was satisfied with PwC’s performance and the external audit 
process and that they had employed an appropriate level of 
professional challenge in fulfilling their role and there were no 
significant findings from the evaluation process. The Committee 
has determined, on the basis of the satisfactory outcome of the 
evaluation, that the external audit will not be subject to tender  
in 2016. It has recommended that the Board submit the re-
appointment of PwC to shareholders for approval at the  
AGM in 2016. 
The Committee reviewed recent tendering and rotation provisions 
from the EU and Competition and Markets Authority, and has also 
taken into account the length of appointment of the incumbent 
auditors but balanced against their continued effectiveness. The 
Committee intends to put the external audit for the financial year 
ending 31 December 2018 out to tender and to commence that 
process in 2017. This is in the best interests of the Company as it 
ensures continuity of audit services until the end of the current 
audit partner rotation period. This plan is subject to any other 
changes to the regulatory regime and the Committee continuing 
to be satisfied with the effectiveness of the auditors, which is 
evaluated annually.
The Committee routinely meets PwC without executive management 
present and no concerns have been raised. It was confirmed that the 
external auditors had been able to offer rigorous and constructive 
challenge to executive management during the year.
Non-audit services
The Group places great importance on the independence of its 
external auditors and is careful to ensure their objectivity is not 
compromised. The Committee agrees the fees paid to external 
auditors for their services as auditors and is required to approve, in 
advance, any fees to the external auditors for non-audit services in 
excess of £0.1 million. 
Details of the fees paid for audit services, audit-related services  
and non-audit services can be found in note 7 to the consolidated 
financial statements. The fees paid for non-audit services in 2015 
were less than £0.1 million (1% of the total audit fee) and the average 
fees paid for non-audit services for the last three years to 2015 were 
£Nil million (2% of the total audit fee over that period). Fees paid for 
non-audit services related to services allowed to be provided by PwC 
under the Group’s policy on non-audit services. 
The Group’s policy on non-audit services covers the services that 
can be provided and which generally cannot be provided (for 
example internal audit services and tax planning). The full policy 
is disclosed on our website (under Audit Committee in the 
Governance section).

Nominations Committee report
Board diversity
The Board confirms a strong commitment to diversity (including, 
but not limited to, gender diversity) at all levels of the Group. The 
Board’s policy on diversity commits Meggitt to:
• ensuring the selection and appointment process for 
employees and directors includes a diverse range of 
candidates;
• disclosing statistics on gender diversity in every Annual 
Report (see page 46); and
• reviewing this policy from time to time and continuing to 
disclose this policy in the Annual Report.
Based on the current size and composition of the Board and 
taking into account current succession plans, the Board has 
determined that there should be a minimum of two female 
directors, which is currently the case. The Board remains 
committed to ensuring that the directors bring a wide range of 
skills, knowledge, experience, backgrounds and perspectives. 
Our directors are from the UK, US and France, and have a range 
of different skills and experience. 
Succession
The Group operates a succession planning process which 
enables the identification and development of employees with the 
potential to fill key business leadership positions in the Group. 
In 2015, the Board reviewed detailed executive succession plans 
for each division and function with the Group Organisational 
Development Director, including plans for the executive directors 
and each member of the Group Executive Committee. Each 
individual on the succession plan has regular performance 
reviews and individual development plans.
Board composition and succession for the Chairman and 
non-executive directors is regularly discussed by the 
Nominations Committee. 
Evaluation
The Committee performed an internal evaluation using the 
process described on page 55. The results of the evaluation were 
generally positive. Although the succession planning process 
had been enhanced in 2015, the need for continued improvement 
was noted during the Board evaluation. 
External search consultancies
During 2015, the Committee used The Zygos Partnership to 
assist in the search for a non-executive director. The Zygos 
Partnership has no other connection with the Group. 
On behalf of the Nominations Committee
Sir Nigel Rudd
Chairman of the Nominations Committee 
22 February 2016
Chairman’s introduction
The Nominations Committee plays a leading role in assessing 
the balance of skills and experience on the Board and the 
Group’s principal committees. The Committee identifies the 
roles and capabilities required to meet the demands of the 
business and ensures that a succession plan is in place. 
Candidates continue to be considered on merit against specific 
criteria determined by the Committee.
Following a rigorous search process using executive search firm 
The Zygos Partnership, Mr Colin Day was appointed as non-
executive director on 1 October 2015. Mr Day is a chartered 
accountant and is currently Chief Executive at Essentra PLC and 
non-executive director at Amec Foster Wheeler plc and FM 
Global. Mr Day’s extensive experience in senior financial roles 
across a range of sectors including aerospace, engineering and 
technology, oil and gas and pharmaceuticals make him an 
excellent addition to the Board. There were other Board changes 
in 2015 as described on page 82.
In 2016, the Committee will continue to review the composition of 
the Board and succession plans for executive and non-executive 
directors, taking into account diversity and the skills, knowledge 
and experience that will be of benefit to the Board in the future.

156768.01 Text 052-059_NEW-06.03.16.indd   59 07/03/2016   04:26 Directors’ remuneration report
60 MEGGITT PLC          REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015
Chairman’s introduction and annual statement
It is my pleasure to present the Directors’ remuneration report for the year ended 
31 December 2015. 
Pay philosophy
Executive remuneration packages at Meggitt are designed to attract, motivate and retain 
directors of a high calibre, to recognise the international nature of the Group’s business 
and to reward the directors for delivering value to shareholders. The package targets fixed 
pay at market competitive levels to companies of a similar size and with similar operating 
characteristics, supplemented by performance-related annual bonuses and an equity-based 
long term incentive plan designed to reward and incentivise growth, and provide a strong link 
to Group and individual performance. 
2015 activity
Having approved and implemented our new remuneration policy and package in 2014, 
2015 was a year of little change for our remuneration plans. The 2014 Directors’ remuneration 
report was submitted to shareholders for approval at our 2015 AGM, gaining an approval rating 
of 99.77%. During the year, the Committee considered whether the recently implemented Long 
Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) and Short Term Incentive Plan (STIP) were providing fair outcomes 
taking into account Group performance, and determined that they were. The Committee also 
reviewed various governance updates relating to remuneration, including feedback from the 
Department for Business, Innovation & Skills on remuneration reports and the Investment 
Association’s updated Principles of Remuneration. 
We approved awards under the LTIP and confirmed the vesting outcomes under the STIP 
awards made in 2014 and awards made in 2012 under our legacy share plans (the Executive 
Share Option Scheme (ESOS) and Equity Participation Plan (EPP)). Since the year end, we have 
approved performance targets for the STIP and LTIP for 2016 awards which are detailed in 
this report, agreed the salaries for the executive directors and confirmed the vesting outcome 
of the 2015 STIP and awards made under the legacy ESOS and EPP share plans in 2013, 
as outlined below. 
We also finalised the effectiveness review of the Committee and Kepler, our advisers, which 
was carried out using questionnaires and Committee discussion. Overall the ratings for the 
Committee and Kepler were satisfactory; there was a valuable discussion about effectiveness 
but no significant areas were highlighted for improvement.
The intended remuneration arrangements for 2016, outlined in this report, are in line with 
the Policy approved by shareholders at our 2014 annual general meeting (AGM).
2015 performance
Group revenue was flat year on year on an organic basis, with 4% organic growth in 
civil aerospace and flat military revenue being offset by a 20% organic decline in energy 
as customers cut back on capital expenditure in response to lower commodity prices. 
Underlying profit before tax declined organically by 9% reflecting adverse product mix, 
particularly in civil aftermarket. Underlying earnings per share (EPS) declined by 2%.
The EPS, cash and total shareholder return elements of the awards granted in 2013 under 
the ESOS and EPP have failed to meet their performance conditions. For awards made under 
the STIP in 2015, the profit element did not reach threshold, the free cash flow element 
vested at 83% of target and the personal objective element of the award vested to the extent 
indicated on page 71 for each director. This outcome would have resulted in STIP payouts of 
61%-71%  of salary for the executive directors. However, in recognition of the fact that Group 
profit performance was below threshold in 2015, the executive directors agreed with the 
Committee that the STIP outcome for executive directors should be reduced by 25%. 
This Directors’ remuneration report has been prepared in accordance with the provisions 
of the Companies Act 2006 and Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium sized Companies and 
Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013. The report also meets the 
requirements of the UK Listing Authority’s Listing Rules and the Disclosure and Transparency 
Rules. In this report we describe how the principles relating to directors’ remuneration, 
as set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code 2014 (the Code), are applied in practice.

The Policy report
This section of the report sets out the Policy for the directors, which shareholders approved at the 2014 AGM and is effective for 
a period of three years from the date of the 2014 AGM. The only amendment to the Policy from the version approved by shareholders 
in 2014 is to update the data used in the pay-for-performance scenario analysis to provide figures for 2016.
Executive Director Remuneration Policy Table
Base salary
Function To attract and retain talent by ensuring base salaries are competitive in the relevant talent market.
Operation Salary will be reviewed by the Committee annually, in February, with changes effective from 1 April of that year. 
Salaries for the year under review are disclosed in the annual report on remuneration.
In deciding salary levels, the Committee considers personal performance including how the individual has helped 
to support the strategic objectives of the Group. The Committee will also consider employment conditions and 
salary levels across the Group, and prevailing market conditions.
Salaries are paid to existing directors in GBP; however the Committee reserves the right to pay future and 
existing directors in any other currency (converted at the prevailing market rate when a change is agreed). 
Opportunity It is not anticipated that percentage salary increases for executive directors will exceed those of the wider 
workforce over the period this Policy will apply. Where increases are awarded in excess of the wider employee 
population, for example if there is a material change in the responsibility, size or complexity of the role, the 
Committee will provide the rationale in the relevant year’s annual report on remuneration.
Performance 
metrics
None explicitly, but salaries are independently benchmarked periodically against FTSE companies in similar 
industries and those with similar market capitalisation. Personal performance is also taken into account when 
considering salary increases.
 
Pension
Function To provide post-retirement benefits for executive directors in a cost-efficient manner.
Operation The pension plans operated by the Group which executive directors are, or could be, members of are: 
—Meggitt Pension Plan (defined benefit pension plan, closed to new members). 
—Meggitt Workplace Savings Plan (defined contribution personal pension scheme, open to new members). 
Salary is the only element of remuneration that is pensionable. There are no unfunded pension promises 
or similar arrangements for directors.
Opportunity From 2013, it has been our Policy that new executive director external appointments are eligible for a pension 
allowance of 25% of salary, payable either as pension contribution up to any limit set in current regulations or, 
above such limits, in cash. Where agreements have been made prior to the approval of this Policy which entitle an 
executive to receive a pension allowance higher than 25% of salary, pension allowances up to a maximum of 50% of 
salary, will be paid; Mr Young and Mr Green had agreements prior to the approval of this Policy which entitle them to 
receive a pension allowance of 50% of salary and this arrangement will continue for these directors.
Performance 
metrics
None.

62 MEGGITT PLC          REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015
Benefits
Function To provide non-cash benefits which are competitive in the market in which the executive director is employed. 
Operation The Group may provide benefits including, but not limited to, a company car or car allowance, private medical 
insurance, permanent health insurance, life assurance, a fuel allowance, a mobile phone, relocation costs and 
any other future benefits made available either to all employees globally or all employees in the region in which 
the executive director is employed. 
Opportunity Benefits vary by role and individual circumstances; eligibility and cost is reviewed periodically. Benefits in respect 
of the year under review are disclosed in the annual report on remuneration. It is not anticipated that the costs of 
benefits provided will increase significantly in the financial years over which this Policy will apply, although the 
Committee retains discretion to approve a higher cost in exceptional circumstances (e.g. to facilitate recruitment, 
relocation, expatriation etc.,) or in circumstances where factors outside the Group’s control have changed 
materially (e.g. market increases in insurance costs).
Performance 
metrics
None.
Annual bonus (Short Term Incentive Plan—STIP)
Function To incentivise executive directors on delivering annual financial and personal targets.
Operation Performance measures, targets and weightings are set at the start of the year.
The performance period of the STIP is a financial year. After the end of the financial year, to the extent that the 
performance criteria have been met, 75% of the STIP award is paid in cash to the director. The remaining 25% 
of the award will be deferred into shares and released (with no further performance conditions attached, and 
no matching shares provided) after a further period of two years.
Under the STIP 2014 rules as approved by the Committee, the Committee may decide to apply malus and/or 
clawback to STIP awards and deferred STIP awards to reduce the vesting of awards and/or require repayment 
of awards in the event of a review of the conduct, capability or performance of the director where there has been 
misconduct by the director or material misstatement of the Company’s or a Group member’s financial results 
for any period. 
Deferred STIP awards may lapse in certain leaver circumstances (see page 67).
Opportunity The STIP provides for a maximum award opportunity of up to 150% of salary in normal circumstances with an 
on-target opportunity of 100% of salary and an opportunity of 50% of salary at threshold. 
The Committee has discretion to make a STIP award of up to 200% of salary in exceptional circumstances 
(e.g. a substantial contract win which has a significant positive financial impact in the long term but which has no, 
or negative, short term financial impact). Dividends accrue on unvested deferred STIP awards over the vesting 
period and are released on the vesting date.
Performance 
metrics
STIP awards are based on the achievement of financial and personal performance targets. For the executive 
directors, two-thirds of the STIP will be weighted to financial performance, with the remainder subject to 
personal performance. The relative weightings of the financial and personal elements for any STIP period, 
and the measures used to assess financial and non-financial performance, will be set by the Committee in its 
absolute discretion to align with the Group’s operating and strategic priorities for that year.
The award for performance under each element of the STIP will be calculated independently. The Committee 
will have discretion to review the consistency of the pay-out of the financial and personal elements and adjust 
the total up or down (within the levels specified above) if it does not consider this to be a fair reflection of the 
underlying performance of the Group or the individual. 
The personal performance element will typically be based on three to five objectives relevant to the executive’s role.
Details of the measures, weightings and targets applicable to the STIP for each year, including a description 
of how they were chosen and whether they were met, will be disclosed retrospectively in the annual report on 
remuneration for the following year (subject to commercial sensitivity).
156768.01 Text 060-080_NEW-06.03.16.indd   62 07/03/2016   04:28 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE REPORTS STRATEGIC REPORT 63
Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
Function To align the interests of executive directors with shareholders in growing the value of the Group over the long 
term.
Operation The LTIP replaced the ESOS and EPP in 2014. Under the LTIP, executive directors are eligible to receive annual 
awards over Meggitt shares vesting after three years, subject to the achievement of stretching performance targets. 
Whilst it is the current intention that LTIP awards will be in the form of nil cost options, the LTIP provides, 
at the absolute discretion of the Committee, for awards over conditional shares, market value share options 
and phantom awards.
Under the LTIP 2014 rules as approved by shareholders at the AGM in 2014, the Committee may decide to apply 
malus and/or clawback to awards to reduce the vesting of awards and/or require repayment of awards in the 
event of a review of the conduct, capability or performance of the director where there has been misconduct by 
the director or material misstatement of the Company’s or a Group member’s financial results for any period.
Opportunity Executive directors will normally be eligible for annual LTIP awards of 220% of salary. Awards up to a maximum 
of 300% of salary may be granted in exceptional circumstances (e.g. to support the recruitment of a key executive 
or to recognise exceptional individual performance).
30% of an award will vest if performance against each performance condition is at threshold and 100% if it is at 
maximum, with straight line vesting in between.
Dividends accrue on unvested LTIP awards over the vesting period and are released, to the extent the LTIP award 
vests, on the vesting/exercise date.
Performance 
metrics
Vesting of LTIP awards is subject to continued employment and performance against three measures, which are 
intended to be as follows:
• Earnings per Share (EPS);
• Return on Trading Assets (ROTA), which is underlying operating profit after tax divided by net trading assets, 
measured at constant currency. Net trading assets are adjusted to exclude goodwill and other intangible assets 
arising on the acquisition of a business, derivative financial instruments, retirement benefit obligations, 
deferred tax and net debt; and
• Strategic goals (typically to be based on three strategic priorities around execution, growth and innovation).
The way these measures link to our KPIs can be seen on pages 30 to 33. It is the current intention that the 
weighting of the measures will be equal (i.e. one third each) but that the Committee will consider, and adjust if 
deemed appropriate, the weighting at the start of each LTIP cycle. Any commercially-sensitive information on 
measures, targets and performance will be disclosed retrospectively.
Awards made under the LTIP will have a performance period of three financial years, starting from 1 January 
of the year in which the award is made and ending on 31 December of the third year. If no entitlement has been 
earned at the end of the relevant performance period, awards will lapse. 
Vesting of the strategic element will also be subject to a discretionary assessment by the Committee of the extent 
to which achievement of the strategic objectives is consistent with the underlying financial performance over the 
three-year period. 
The measures and targets in operation for grants made under the LTIP in the current year, and which are not 
deemed commercially sensitive are disclosed in the annual report on remuneration.
Sharesave Scheme and Share Incentive Plan (SIP)
Function To align the interests of employees and shareholders by encouraging all employees to own Meggitt shares.
Operation Sharesave Scheme—All employee scheme under which all UK employees (including executive directors) may 
save up to the maximum monthly savings limit (as determined by legislation) over a period of three or five years. 
Options under the Sharesave Scheme are granted at a discount of up to 20% to the market value of shares at the 
date of grant.
SIP—All employee scheme under which (i) all UK employees (including executive directors) may contribute up to 
the monthly maximum (as determined by legislation) to purchase shares monthly from pre-tax pay; and (ii) all UK 
employees (including executive directors) may receive free shares up to the annual maximum value (as 
determined by legislation).
Opportunity Savings, contributions and free shares are capped at the prevailing legislative limit at the time UK employees are 
invited to participate.

64 MEGGITT PLC          REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015
Notes to the Policy table
The Committee is satisfied that the above Policy is in the best interests of shareholders and does not promote excessive risk-taking. 
The Committee retains discretion to make minor, non-significant changes to the Policy without reverting to shareholders.
Payments from outstanding awards
Outstanding awards are currently held by the directors under the EPP and the ESOS, the Group’s long term incentives operated  
prior to the introduction of the LTIP in 2014. These awards will continue to vest (subject to performance conditions being met) and  
be capable of exercise during the period over which this Policy applies. The tables on pages 79 to 80 highlight outstanding and  
vested awards.
Approach to target setting and performance measure selection
Targets applying to the STIP and LTIP are reviewed annually, based on a number of internal and external reference points, including 
the Group’s strategic plan, analyst forecasts for Meggitt and its sector comparators, historical growth achieved by Meggitt and its 
sector comparators and external expectations for growth in Meggitt’s markets. 
STIP
The performance measures used under the STIP reflect financial targets for the year and non-financial performance objectives. 
The Policy provides the Committee with flexibility to select appropriate measures on an annual basis.
STIP performance targets are set to be stretching but achievable, with regard to the particular personal performance objectives and 
the economic environment in a given year. For financial measures, ‘target’ is based around the annual budget approved by the Board. 
Prior to the start of the financial year, the Committee sets an appropriate performance range around target, which it considers 
provides an appropriate degree of ‘stretch’ challenge and an incentive to outperform.
LTIP
The vesting of LTIP awards is linked to EPS, ROTA and the achievement of long-term strategic goals.
EPS is considered by the Board to be the most important measure of Meggitt’s financial performance. It is highly visible internally,  
is regularly monitored and reported, and is strongly motivational for participants. EPS targets will continue to be set on a nominal 
cumulative (pence) basis to incentivise consistent performance and reflect the fact that Meggitt’s profits are generated to a large 
degree outside the UK and not significantly influenced by UK retail price inflation.
ROTA helps to balance the achievement of growth and returns. The Committee believes ROTA is a good internal proxy for total 
shareholder return (TSR) which focuses executives on managing the balance sheet and Meggitt’s operational performance, whilst 
also being less remote for participants below Board level. The definition of net trading assets for ROTA excludes goodwill and 
other intangible assets arising when a business is acquired, to reflect that acquisitions are not within the control of the majority of 
participants. In order to safeguard against poor acquisitions, the Committee has overall discretion to reduce the outcome under the 
ROTA element if in its opinion the outcome does not reflect the underlying financial performance of the Group. The performance of 
acquisitions against Board approved targets is also monitored separately.  
The Committee believes that the strategic goals component will help reinforce the realisation of Group strategy and the achievement 
of key non-financial and strategic goals over long product cycles which drive long-term value at Meggitt. The element will typically 
comprise a scorecard of three-year targets across a maximum of three core strategic areas for the Group. The Committee believes 
that this approach will enable it to reflect the Group’s long-term nature and shifting strategic priorities in the LTIP to ensure 
executives’ interests remain closely aligned with those of our shareholders over time. Specific measures and targets for each area 
will be developed and clearly defined at the start of each three-year cycle to balance leading and lagging indicators of performance. 
Vesting of this element is subject to a discretionary assessment by the Committee of the extent to which achievement of the strategic 
objectives is consistent with Meggitt’s underlying financial performance over the performance period.
Remuneration policy for other employees
The remuneration policy for other employees is based on broadly consistent principles as that for executive directors. Annual salary 
reviews take into account Group performance, local pay and market conditions, and salary levels for similar roles in comparable 
companies. Some employees below executive level are eligible to participate in annual bonus schemes; opportunities and performance 
measures vary by organisational level, geographical region and an individual’s role. Senior executives are eligible for LTIP on similar 
terms as the executive directors, although award opportunities are lower and vary by organisational level. All UK employees are 
eligible to participate in the Sharesave Scheme and SIP on identical terms.
Share ownership guidelines
In 2013, the Committee increased the minimum shareholding guidelines for executive directors from 100% to 300% of base salary for 
the Chief Executive and from 100% to 200% of base salary for each of the other executive directors. There is no set time frame within 
which directors have to meet the guideline, however until they meet the guideline they are not permitted to sell more than 50% of the 
after-tax value of a vested share award. The shareholding requirement ceases when a director leaves the Group. Further information 
on the shareholding requirement is in the annual report on remuneration (see page 78).

Potential reward opportunities are based on the Policy, applied to 2016 base salaries and 2016 incentive opportunities. Note that the 
LTIP awards granted in a year will not normally vest until the third anniversary of the date of grant, and the projected value excludes 
the impact of share price movement or dividend accrual.
The ‘Maximum’ scenario reflects fixed remuneration (salary and benefits and pension), plus maximum payout under all incentives 
(150% of salary under the STIP, and full vesting of LTIP awards).
The ‘On-target’ scenario reflects fixed remuneration as above, plus target STIP (based on two-thirds of maximum opportunity) and 
LTIP threshold vesting (30% vesting). 
The ‘Minimum’ scenario reflects fixed remuneration only, being the only element of the executive directors’ remuneration package 
not linked to performance.
Non-Executive Directors’—Remuneration Policy Table
Non-executive directors are submitted for re-election annually, do not have a contract of service and are not eligible to join the 
Group’s pension or share schemes. Details of the Policy on fees paid to our non-executive directors are set out in the table below:
Fees
Function To attract and retain non-executive directors of the highest calibre with broad commercial and other experience 
relevant to the Group.
Operation Fee levels are reviewed annually, with any adjustments effective 1 April each year. The fees paid to the Chairman 
of the Board are determined by the Committee, while the fees for all other non-executive directors are reviewed 
by a committee of the Board formed of executive directors. Fees for the year under review and for the current 
year are disclosed in the annual report on remuneration.
Additional fees are paid to the chairmen of the Remuneration and Audit Committee and to the Senior Independent 
Director, to reflect the additional time commitment of these roles.
In deciding fee increases, the committees consider employment conditions and salary increases across the 
Group, and prevailing market conditions.
Currently, all fees are paid in GBP, however the committees reserve the right to pay future and existing non-
executive directors in any other currency (converted at the prevailing market rate when a change is agreed) .
Opportunity Fee increases will be applied taking into account the outcome of the annual review. The maximum aggregate 
annual fee for all non-executive directors (including the Chairman) as provided in the Company’s Articles of 
Association is £1,000,000.

Recruitment
External appointments
In cases of hiring or appointing a new executive director from outside the Group, the Committee may make use of all existing 
components of remuneration, as follows:
Component Approach
Maximum annual 
grant value
Base salary The base salaries of new appointees will be determined based on the experience and 
skills of the individual, internal comparisons, employment conditions and salary levels 
across the Group, and prevailing market conditions. Initial salaries may be set below 
market and consideration given to phasing any increases over two or three years subject 
to development in the role.
N/A
Pension In line with the Policy, new appointees will be entitled to become members of the Meggitt 
Workplace Savings Plan (defined contribution plan) or receive a cash pension allowance 
of 25% of salary in lieu.
N/A
Benefits/
Sharesave/SIP
New appointees will be eligible to receive benefits in line with the Policy, but only 
UK employees will be eligible to participate in all-employee share schemes. 
N/A
STIP The structure described in the Policy table will apply to new appointees with the relevant 
maximum being pro-rated to reflect the proportion of employment over the year. 
Targets for the personal element will be tailored to the appointee.
150% of salary  
(200% in exceptional 
circumstances)
LTIP New appointees will be granted awards under the LTIP on similar terms as other 
executive directors, as described in the Policy table.
220% of salary 
(300% in exceptional 
circumstances)
In determining the appropriate remuneration structure and levels, the Committee will take into consideration all relevant factors to 
ensure that arrangements are in the best interests of Meggitt and its shareholders. The Committee may make an award in respect 
of a new appointment to ‘buy out’ incentive arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer, i.e. over and above the approach 
outlined in the table above. Any such compensatory awards will be made under existing share schemes, where appropriate, and will 
be subject to the normal performance conditions of those schemes. 
The Committee may also consider it appropriate to structure ‘buy-out’ awards differently to the structure described in the Policy 
table, exercising the discretion available under UKLA Listing Rule 9.4.2 R where necessary to make a one-off award to an executive 
director in the context of recruitment. In doing so, the Committee will consider relevant factors including any performance conditions 
attached to these awards, the likelihood of those conditions being met and the proportion of the vesting period remaining. The value 
of any such ‘buy-out’ will be fully disclosed.
Internal promotion
Where a new executive director is appointed by way of internal promotion, the Policy will be consistent with that for external 
appointees, as detailed above. Any commitments made prior to an individual’s promotion will continue to be honoured even if they 
would not otherwise be consistent with the Policy prevailing when the commitment is fulfilled, although the Group may, where 
appropriate, seek to revise an individual’s existing service contract on promotion to ensure it aligns with other executive directors 
and prevailing market best practice.
Disclosure on the remuneration structure of any new executive director, including details of any exceptional payments, will be 
disclosed in the RIS notification made at the time of appointment and in the annual report on remuneration for the year in which 
the recruitment occurred.
Non-executive directors
In recruiting a new non-executive director, the Committee will use the Policy as set out in the table on page 65.
156768.01 Text 060-080_NEW-06.03.16.indd   66 07/03/2016   04:28 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE REPORTS STRATEGIC REPORT 67
Service contracts and exit payment policy
Executive director service contracts, including arrangements for early termination, are carefully considered by the Committee 
and are designed to recruit, retain and motivate directors of the quality required to manage the Group.
The Committee’s Policy is that executive directors’ service contracts should be terminable on no more than 12 months’ notice. 
The Committee’s approach to payments in the event of termination of employment of an executive director is to take account of 
the particular circumstances, including the reasons for termination, individual performance, contractual obligations and the rules 
of the Group’s applicable incentive plans which apply to share awards held by the executive directors:
•  Compensation for loss of office in service contracts 
Except as set out in the table on page 68, under the terms of their service contracts, the executive directors may be required to 
work during their notice period or may, if the Group decides, be paid in lieu of notice if not required to work the full notice period. 
Payment in lieu of notice will be equal to base salary plus the cost to the Group of providing the contractual benefits (pensions 
allowance, health insurance and company car or car allowance) that would otherwise have been paid or provided during the notice 
period. Payments will be in equal monthly instalments and will be subject to mitigation such that payments will either reduce, or stop 
completely, if the executive director obtains alternative employment. 
  An executive director’s employment can be terminated by the Company without notice or payment in lieu of notice in specific 
circumstances including summary dismissal, bankruptcy or resignation. 
•  Treatment of STIP 
Executive directors have no automatic entitlement to any bonus on termination of employment under the STIP, but the Committee 
may use its discretion to award a bonus (normally pro-rated). 
  Where any bonus is deferred into shares, the award will normally lapse if an executive director’s employment terminates unless 
the executive director leaves for specified ‘good leaver’ reasons. The ‘good leaver’ reasons are death, redundancy, retirement, 
injury, disability, the business or company which employs the executive director ceasing to be part of the Group, any other 
circumstances in which the Committee exercises discretion to treat the executive director as a ‘good leaver’ or on a change of 
control. If the executive director is a ‘good leaver’ their award will vest on the normal vesting date, or earlier on a change of control, 
and would not be subject to pro-rating.
•  Treatment of long term incentive plan awards 
The treatment of awards under the ESOS, EPP and LTIP is governed by the rules of the plans which have been approved by 
shareholders and is described below.
  Awards will normally lapse if an executive director’s employment terminates unless the executive director leaves for specified 
‘good leaver’ reasons. The ‘good leaver’ reasons are the same as described above. If the executive director is a ‘good leaver’, 
awards will vest to the extent that the attached performance conditions are met, but on a time pro-rated basis, with Committee 
discretion to allow early vesting. Under the EPP and ESOS, awards vest as soon as practicable after an employee has left. Under 
the LTIP, awards vest on the normal vesting date.

12 months 6 months Mr Green’s service contract was entered into before 
27 June 2012 and has not been modified or renewed after 
that date. As such, remuneration or payments for loss of 
office that are required to be made under Mr Green’s service

Payments to Mr Green under his service contract differ 
from the Policy in the following respects: 
On termination of employment, Mr Green is entitled to 
a liquidated damages payment equal to his salary and the 
value of his contractual benefits (bonus, pension allowance, 
insurance and company car or car allowance) at the date of 
termination, pro-rated to the remaining notice period less an 
amount equal to 5% of the aggregate sum and the Committee 
shall exercise its discretion under the Group’s share plans 
to treat Mr Green as a ‘good leaver’. 
On change of control, Mr Green may give notice to terminate 
his employment within six months of the event and upon 
such termination he shall become entitled to the liquidated 
damages payment summarised above. 
External appointments held by executive directors
The Board believes that the Group can benefit from experience gained when executive directors hold external non-executive 
directorships. Executive directors are allowed to hold external appointments and to receive payment provided such appointments are 
agreed by the Board or Committee in advance, there are no conflicts of interests and the appointment does not lead to deterioration 
in the individual’s performance. Details of external appointments and the associated fees received are included in the annual report 
on remuneration on page 77.
Consideration of conditions elsewhere in the Company 
The Committee does not consult with employees specifically on executive remuneration policy and framework but does seek to 
promote and maintain good relations with employee representative bodies—including trade unions and works councils—as part of 
its broader employee engagement strategy and consults on matters affecting employees and business performance as required in 
each case by law and regulation in the jurisdictions in which the Group operates. Salary increases made elsewhere in the Group are 
amongst the data that the Committee considers in determining salaries for executive directors. 
Consideration of shareholder views 
The Committee considers shareholder views received during the year and at the AGM each year, as well as guidance from 
shareholder representative bodies more broadly. The majority of shareholders continue to express support of remuneration 
arrangements at Meggitt.

There was one meeting between the end of the financial year and the date of signing of this report, which all current members of 
the Committee attended. The Committee operates within agreed Terms of Reference, which are available on our website and were 
updated in 2014. The Committee is responsible for determining the remuneration policy and packages for all executive directors 
and direct reports to the Chief Executive (covering five of the next most senior executives across the Group) and for agreeing the 
fees for the Chairman. The Chairman, Chief Executive and Organisational Development Director attend meetings of the Committee 
by invitation; they are absent when their own remuneration is under consideration.
None of the non-executive directors has, or has had, any personal financial interests or conflicts of interest arising from 
cross-directorships or day-to-day involvement in running the business. 
Advisors to the Committee
During the year, the Committee’s independent remuneration advisors were Kepler who were appointed in 2010 after a competitive 
tender process was run by the Committee. During 2015, Kepler were acquired by Mercer. The Committee considered this 
development in light of the existing business relationship between the Company and Mercer, as Mercer act as the Company’s primary 
advisors on UK pensions and benefits. However the Committee determined that this did not impact Kepler’s independence and that 
they were satisfied that Kepler could continue to act as advisors to the Committee. The Committee evaluates the support provided 
by Kepler annually and is comfortable that they provide effective and independent remuneration advice to the Committee. Kepler 
provide guidance on remuneration matters at Board level and below. Kepler do not have any other connection with the Group. Kepler 
are a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and adhere to its code of conduct (www.remunerationconsultantsgroup.com). 
Their total fees in 2015 were £41,000 (2014: £88,000).

 EPP is calculated as the number of shares vesting based on certain performance measures and valued at the market value of the shares. For 2015, the 
figure represents the actual vesting outcome of the 2013 award, for which the performance measures were based on EPS, total shareholder return and 
cash conversion. Based on performance to 31 December 2015, the 2013 EPP award will lapse and therefore no value is ascribed to this award in this 
table. Further details on performance criteria, achievement and resulting vesting levels can be found on page 72.

 ESOS is calculated as the number of shares vesting based on certain performance measures and valued at the difference between the market 
value of the shares and the exercise price of the award. For 2015, the figure represents the actual vesting outcome of the 2013 award, for which the 
performance measure was based on EPS. Based on performance to 31 December 2015, the 2013 ESOS award will lapse and therefore no value is 
ascribed to this award in this table. Further details on performance criteria, achievement and resulting vesting levels can be found on page 72.

Incentive outcomes for the year ended 31 December 2015
STIP in respect of 2015 performance
The Board set stretching financial and strategic targets for the STIP at the start of the 2015 financial year. These targets, and our 
performance against these, are summarised in the table below.

  Individual personal performance is measured on a scale of 1 to 5. The average of all ratings drives the STIP outcome, where 2 indicates expectations 
are partially met, 3 is fully met and 4 exceeds expectations. Details of the personal performance measures are provided below. 
A full listing of 2015 personal performance objectives has not been provided owing to commercial sensitivity, however, the following is 
a summary of the conditions which applied in 2015 to each executive director. 
Mr S G Young: Driving effectiveness in all functions (e.g. agreeing effective aftermarket functional strategy, cost reduction from functions),  
increasing the pace of change in execution (e.g. through continued implementation of the Meggitt Production System and maintaining 
customer relationships during successful programme ramp up phase), maintaining investment balance (e.g. hitting milestones on 
central AR&T programmes), maintaining FTSE 100 governance standards (e.g. sites reaching targets on health, safety and environment 
continuous improvement schedule). 
Mr D R Webb: Delivery of a cyber security risk reduction programme, strategic development of the IT function and execution of key 
projects, delivery of ongoing cost reductions, driving the M&A programme forward through portfolio analysis and strong processes and 
procedures on implementing transactions, deliver on key tax and treasury initiatives, implement key financial reporting requirements 
such as the viability statement.
Mr P E Green: Enhancing the legal and compliance audit programme, improving the process for consulting external law firms, enhancing 
the efficiency and effectiveness of the Group trade compliance programme, continued implementation of the US Department of State’s 
Consent Agreement and assuming responsibility for the Group Commercial function.
For awards made under the STIP in 2015, the profit element did not reach threshold, the free cash flow element vested at 83% of target and 
the personal objective element of the award vested to the extent indicated above for each director. This outcome would have resulted in STIP 
payouts of 61%-71% of salary for the executive directors. However, in recognition of the fact that Group profit performance was below threshold 
in 2015, the executive directors agreed with the Committee that the STIP outcome for executive directors should be reduced by 25%.
The following STIP awards were received by directors in respect of 2015 performance:
% salary £’000
Mr S G Young 46.0 312
Mr D R Webb 46.6 209
Mr P E Green 53.2 192
 
STIP—deferral into shares
As a result of the 2015 STIP vesting outcome described above, 25% of the STIP bonus will be deferred into shares and released 
(with no further performance conditions attached) after a further period of two years, in line with the Policy.
In 2015, as a result of the 2014 STIP vesting, the following share awards were made under the Deferred Share Bonus Plan:

As disclosed in the 2014 remuneration report, the Committee determined that the 50% of the 2012 EPP award subject to the three-year 
cumulative underlying EPS performance condition and the 25% subject to the cash conversion performance condition did not vest based 
on performance to 31 December 2014. The remaining 25% of the award was dependent on the Group’s TSR performance compared 
to a group of international aerospace and defence companies over the three-year period to 22 August 2015. TSR for all comparator 
companies is measured on a common currency basis.

Total pension entitlements (audited)  
The table below sets out details of the pension entitlements under the Meggitt Pension Plan (MPP) for Mr Young and Mr Green. 
Under the MPP, Mr Young and Mr Green accrued defined benefits at 3% of salary per annum up to the Scheme Cap and were entitled 
to a cash supplement equivalent to 50% of salary above the Scheme Cap. Since reaching the government’s Lifetime Allowance in April 
2012, Mr Young and Mr Green ceased accruing further benefit under the MPP and receive a 50% pension allowance on their full salary. 
Mr Young and Mr Green’s dependants remain eligible for dependants’ pensions and the payment of a lump sum on death in service.
Mr Webb receives a pension allowance of 25% of base salary, but is not a member of any defined benefit or defined contribution 
pension scheme operated by the Group. 
The pension allowance payments made in 2015 are included in the single total figure of remuneration table.

Percentage change in CEO cash remuneration  
The table below shows the percentage change in CEO remuneration from the prior year compared to the average percentage change 
in remuneration for all executive employees. We have selected our executive population (around 300 people) for this comparison 
because it is considered to be the most relevant, due to the structure of total remuneration; most of our senior executives receive 
benefits under the same STIP and LTIP structure as our CEO.

The CEO’s remuneration includes base salary, taxable benefits and STIP. 
2
 The base salary for executive employees is calculated using the increase in the earnings of full-time executive employees using the same employee 
data set in 2014 and 2015. Approximately 50% of the executive employees had pay rises of 2% or less, 20% had pay rises of between 2 and 5% and the 
remainder had pay rises of over 5%. Pay rises above 2% are awarded on merit, for increased responsibilities or to bring salaries in line with benchmark. 
3
 For benefits, this information is not collected for the executive employee population and is therefore estimated from a sample of executive employees, 
using a consistent set of employees.
4
 For STIP, the increase is estimated as at 15 February 2016 as the validation processes for personal performance ratings for executive employees below 
the level of the Board/Group Executive Committee is not yet complete. To the extent there is a significant variation between the actual outcome and the 
estimate, this will be declared in the 2016 Directors’ remuneration report.

Exit payments made in the year
No exit payments have been made in 2015. 
Payments to past directors (audited)
There were no payments to past directors in 2015. A de minimis of £10,000 applies to all disclosures under this note.
Review of past performance
The remuneration package is structured to help ensure alignment with shareholders. There is no direct correlation between share 
price movement and the change in the value of the pay package in any one year (as the remuneration package comprises several 
components, some fixed, and others based on non-financial measures). The graph and table below show how the CEO’s pay has been 
sensitive to the share price over the last seven years. 
This graph illustrates the Group’s performance compared to the FTSE 100 Index, which is considered the most appropriate broad 
equity market index against which the Group’s performance should be measured. Performance, as required by legislation, is 
measured by TSR over the seven-year period from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2015:

2016 STIP measures
STIP measures for 2016 are based on underlying operating profit (one third), free cash flow (one third) and personal performance 
(one third). The STIP targets for 2016, together with details of whether they have been met, will be disclosed (subject to commercial 
sensitivity) in the 2016 Directors’ remuneration report. The opportunity is in line with the Policy disclosed on page 62.
2016 LTIP measures
The executive directors will be granted awards under the LTIP, the vesting of which will be subject to the measures shown below. 
The Committee sets performance measures for underlying EPS, ROTA and organic revenue growth annually using a consistent 
method, with reference to performance in the prior year (2015) and the Group’s budget for 2016. For EPS, the Committee also takes 
into account other external benchmarks such as analyst consensus EPS, and EPS ranges for comparator companies. The organic 
growth range also takes into account external market trends. The targets for the 2016 LTIP award have been set in relation to these 
reference points and the 2015 outturn (which was lower than for 2014) and are considered by the Committee to be appropriately 
stretching for the three-year cycle. 
A number of the strategic measures have agreed annual schedules and, to ensure that the LTIP targets for these measures remain 
relevant and stretching over the entire three-year performance period, targets for these measures will be set as three sets of annual 
targets (i.e. at the start of each year and measured over a 12-month period). Therefore, the quality and delivery targets shown below 
are effective for year 1 of the 2016 LTIP award, year 2 of the 2015 LTIP award and year 3 of the 2014 LTIP award. In determining the 
final vesting outcome at the end of each LTIP cycle, the Committee will consider performance over the three-year performance 
period for each strategic measure. Vesting of the LTIP awards will be subject to the following measures and targets:
Weighting Measure Threshold Mid-point Stretch
33.3% Underlying EPS (pence) three-year aggregate (equivalent to CAGR range of 4% to 9%) 103 108 113

No political donations were made during the year (2014: None).
Share capital and control 
As at 31 December 2015, the Company held 350,966 treasury 
shares with a nominal value of 5p each, and the Company’s 
issued share capital (excluding shares held as treasury shares) 
consisted of 775,167,523 shares with a nominal value of 5p each. 
As at 15 February 2016, the Company held 332,722 treasury 
shares with a nominal value of 5p each, and the Company’s 
issued share capital (excluding shares held as treasury shares) 
consisted of 775,185,767 shares with a nominal value of 5p each. 
The issued share capital of the Company at 31 December 2015 
and details of shares issued and cancelled during the financial 
year are shown in note 34 to the Group’s consolidated 
financial statements. 
The Company operated a share buyback programme during the 
year until 4 September 2015, and details of the shares bought 
back in 2015 under that programme are contained in the Chief 
Financial Officer’s Review on page 38. 
The ordinary shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange. 
The rights and obligations attaching to the Company’s ordinary 
shares are set out in the Articles. A copy of the Articles is 
available for inspection at the registered office. The holders of 
ordinary shares are entitled to receive the Company’s report  
and accounts, to attend and speak at general meetings of the 
Company, to appoint proxies to exercise full voting rights and  
to participate in any distribution of income or capital.
There are no restrictions on transfer, or limitations on holding 
ordinary shares and no requirements for prior approval of any 
transfers. There are no known arrangements under which 
financial rights are held by persons other than holders of the 
shares and no known agreements or restrictions on share 
transfers or on voting rights. Shares acquired through Company 
share plans rank pari passu (on an equal footing) with the 
shares in issue and have no special rights. 
Rules about the appointment and replacement of Company 
directors are contained in the Articles which provide that  
a director may be appointed by ordinary resolution of the 
shareholders or by the existing directors, either to fill a vacancy  
or as an additional director. Changes to the Articles must be 
submitted to the shareholders for approval by way of special 
resolution. The directors may exercise all the powers of the 
Company subject to the provisions of relevant legislation, 
the Articles and any directions given by the Company in 
general meeting. 
The powers of the directors include those in relation to the 
issue and buyback of shares. At each AGM, the shareholders are 
requested to renew the directors’ powers to allot securities in 
the Company up to the value specified in the Notice of Meeting 
and to renew the directors’ powers to allot securities, without 
the application of pre-emption rights, up to the value specified 
in the Notice of Meeting in accordance with the Articles. The 
Company also seeks authority at each AGM from shareholders 
to purchase its own shares up to the limits set out in the 
Notice of Meeting.
Dividends
The directors recommend the payment of a final dividend of 9.80p 
net per ordinary 5p share (2014: 9.50p), to be paid on 6 May 2016 
to those members on the register at close of business on  
29 March 2016. An interim dividend of 4.60p (2014: 4.25p) was 
paid on 2 October 2015. If the final dividend as recommended  
is approved the total ordinary dividend for the year will amount  
to 14.40p net per ordinary 5p share (2014: 13.75p).
Dividends are paid to shareholders net of a non-refundable tax 
credit of 10%. Shareholders liable to higher rates of income tax 
will have additional tax to pay. 
Dividend reinvestment plan
The Company operates a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP) 
which enables shareholders to buy the Company’s shares on 
the London Stock Exchange with their cash dividend. Further 
information about the DRIP is available from Computershare, 
the Company’s registrars. 
During 2015, the Company made the DRIP available to 
shareholders for the dividends paid in May 2015 and October 
2015. The Board currently intends to continue to make the DRIP 
available to shareholders in 2016, and the date by which relevant 
DRIP elections must be received is disclosed on the financial 
calendar page on our website.

Statement of directors’ responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, 
the Directors’ remuneration report and the financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors 
have prepared the Group financial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union, and the parent company 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice), including Financial 
Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework 
(FRS 101).
Share capital and control continued
The Group has significant financing agreements which include 
change of control provisions which, should there be a change 
of ownership of the Company, could result in renegotiation, 
withdrawal or early repayment of these financing agreements. 
These are a USD 600 million note purchase agreement 
dated June 2010, a USD 900 million syndicated revolving 
credit agreement dated September 2014, and two USD 
300 million bilateral credit facility agreements, both dated 
September 2015. 
There are a number of other long-term commercial 
agreements that may alter or terminate upon a change of 
control of the Company following a successful takeover bid. 
These arrangements are commercially confidential and their 
disclosure could be seriously prejudicial to the Company. 
Agreements with the Company’s directors or employees 
providing compensation in the event of a takeover bid: 
Director Contractual entitlement
Mr S G Young None except that provisions in the Company’s 
share plans may cause options and/or awards 
granted to employees under such plans to vest  
on a takeover.
Mr D R Webb None except that provisions in the Company’s 
share plans may cause options and/or awards 
granted to employees under such plans to vest  
on a takeover.
Mr P E Green Mr Green may terminate his employment 
within six months and would be entitled to 
compensation from the Company for loss of 
office. The compensation would be annual 
remuneration plus the value of benefits for the 
unexpired notice period less 5%. In addition, 
provisions in the Company’s share plans may 
cause options and/or awards granted to 
employees under such plans to vest on  
a takeover.
Non-executive 
directors
None.
All other 
employees
There are no agreements that would provide 
compensation for loss of employment resulting 
from a takeover except that provisions in the 
Company’s share plans may cause options 
and/or awards granted to employees under 
such plans to vest on a takeover. 84 MEGGITT PLC          REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015
Under company law the directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of 
the profit or loss of the Group and the Company for that period.
In preparing these financial statements, the directors are 
required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent;
• state whether IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable 
United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 
have been followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the Group and parent company 
financial statements respectively; and
• notify its shareholders in writing about the use of disclosure 
exemptions, if any, of FRS 101 used in the preparation of 
financial statements.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and the Group and enable 
them to ensure that the financial statements and the Directors’ 
remuneration report comply with the Companies Act 2006 
and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of 
the IAS regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding 
the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities. The directors are also responsible 
for the maintenance and integrity of the Company’s website. 
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation 
in other jurisdictions. 
Each of the directors, whose names and functions are listed in 
the Board of directors on pages 50 to 51, confirm that to the best 
of their knowledge: 
• the Group financial statements, which have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true and 
fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit  
of the Group; and
• the Strategic report and this Directors’ report include a fair 
review of the development and performance of the business 
and the position of the Group, together with a description of 
the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.
Each of the persons who is a director in office at the date of this 
report confirms that:
• so far as the director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; and
• the director has taken all steps that he ought to have taken 
as a director in order to make himself or herself aware 
of any relevant audit information and to establish that the 
Company’s auditor is aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in 
accordance with the provisions of section 418 of the 
Companies Act 2006.
Fair, balanced and understandable
The directors as at the date of this report consider that 
the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Group’s position, performance, 
business model and strategy. The Board has made this 
assessment on the basis of a review of the accounts process, 
a discussion on the content of the annual report assessing 
its fairness, balance and understandability, together with the 
confirmation from executive management that the report is 
fair, balanced and understandable.
Going Concern
The directors have formed a judgement, at the time of approving 
the financial statements, that there is a reasonable expectation 
that the Group and the Company have adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for a period of at least 
12 months from the date of this report. For this reason, the 
directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing 
the Group and Company financial statements.
In reaching this conclusion, the directors have considered:
• the financial position of the Group as set out in this report 
and additional information provided in the financial 
statements including note 3 (Financial risk management), 
note 28 (Bank and other borrowings) and note 30 
(Derivative financial instruments);
• the resources available to the Group taking account of its 
financial projections and considerable existing headroom 
against committed debt facilities and covenants; and
• the principal risks and uncertainties to which the Group is 
exposed, as set out on pages 26 to 29, the likelihood of them 
arising and the mitigation actions available.

Our audit approach
Overview
Materiality • Overall Group materiality: £10 million 
which represents 5% of profit before tax.
Audit Scope • We identified 10 reporting units which, in 
our view, required a full scope audit based 
on their size or risk. In addition we 
determined that specified audit procedures 
were required at a further 8 reporting units 
to address specific risk characteristics or 
to provide sufficient overall Group coverage 
of particular financial statement line items.
• We used component teams in 4 countries to 
perform a combination of full scope audits 
and specified procedures at 12 reporting 
units, with the Group team performing 
the remainder.
• Reporting units where we performed audit 
procedures accounted for 63% of Group 
profit before tax and 84% of Group total 
assets. Our audit scope provided sufficient 
appropriate audit evidence as a basis for 
our opinion on the Group financial 
statements as a whole.
Areas of focus • Goodwill impairment assessments
• Development costs and programme 
participation costs impairment 
assessments
• Environmental provisions
• Revenue recognition under long term 
contract accounting primarily in the 
Group’s energy business 
• Retirement benefit obligation liabilities
• Provisions for uncertain tax positions
The scope of our audit and our areas of focus
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”).
We designed our audit by determining materiality and 
assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial 
statements. In particular, we looked at where the directors 
made subjective judgements, for example in respect of 
significant accounting estimates that involved making 
assumptions and considering future events that are inherently 
uncertain. As in all of our audits we also addressed the 
risk of management override of internal controls, including 
evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the directors 
that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. 
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest 
effect on our audit, including the allocation of our resources 
and effort, are identified as “areas of focus” in the table below. 
We have also set out how we tailored our audit to address 
these specific areas in order to provide an opinion on the 
financial statements as a whole, and any comments we make 
on the results of our procedures should be read in this context. 
This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.
Report on the Group financial statements
Our opinion 
In our opinion, Meggitt PLC’s Group financial statements 
(the “financial statements”):
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs 
as at 31 December 2015 and of its profit and cash flows for 
the year then ended;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) 
as adopted by the European Union; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of 
the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
What we have audited
The financial statements, included within the Annual Report 
and Accounts (“The Annual Report”), comprise:
• the Consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2015;
• the Consolidated income statement and the Consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income for the year then ended;
• the Consolidated cash flow statement for the year then ended;
• the Consolidated statement of changes in equity for the 
year then ended; and
• the notes to the financial statements, which include 
a summary of significant accounting policies and other 
explanatory information.
Certain required disclosures have been presented elsewhere 
in the Annual Report, rather than in the notes to the financial 
statements. These are cross-referenced from the financial 
statements and are identified as audited.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the 
preparation of the financial statements is applicable law and 
IFRSs as adopted by the European Union.

Goodwill impairment assessments
Refer to notes18 (pages 114 to 116)
The Group holds significant amounts of 
goodwill (£1,866.0m) on the balance sheet 
which is supported by an annual 
impairment review. No impairment charge 
has been recorded against goodwill in the 
current year. 
Our audit focused on the risk that 
the carrying value of goodwill could 
be overstated. 
Certain assumptions used in the 
impairment review are subjective and 
are key judgements, these include:
• The future cash flow growth 
assumptions used in the Group’s most 
recent budgets and plans for the next 
five years approved by management (the 
“plan”), and the growth rate used beyond 
the period covered by the plan; and
• The discount rate applied to future 
cash flows.
We focused in particular on the following 
cash-generating units (“CGUs”): 
• Meggitt Aircraft Braking Systems 
(“MABS”), as it has the highest carrying 
value of goodwill of £734.0m, and the 
second lowest percentage headroom. 
Headroom is £356.3m; 
• The CGU with the least headroom in 
percentage terms. This CGU has 
a goodwill balance of £58.0m and 
limited headroom of £4.6m. 
We evaluated the directors’ future cash flow forecasts and the process by which 
they were drawn up, and tested the integrity of the underlying discounted cash 
flow model. We compared the forecasts used in this model to the plan and 
assessed the actual performance in the year against the prior year budgets to 
evaluate historical forecasting accuracy.
In respect of the two CGUs we focussed on, we assessed the directors’ 
assumptions for future cash flow growth in the plan, by:
• Comparing the future cash flow growth assumptions to economic and industry 
forecasts, including the civil aerospace capacity trend rate of 5%, measured in 
available seat kilometres (ASKs) and where growth exceeded this sensitising 
the model down to this rate. 
• Evaluating the historical accuracy of the directors’ forecast to actual 
performance, which in respect of these CGUs, showed performance in line 
with or in excess of forecast;
• Additionally we performed sensitivity analysis in respect of the key 
assumptions to ascertain the extent of change in those assumptions which, 
either individually or collectively, would be required for the goodwill to be 
impaired. We assessed the likelihood of these changes in assumptions arising.
For all impairment assessments we:
• Tested the discount rates, by comparing key inputs, where relevant, to 
externally derived data or data for comparable listed organisations. We used 
our specialists in assessing the overall discount rates used, and observed 
them to be within a reasonable range; and
• Considered the use of the long-term GDP growth rate for the country in which the 
CGU operates for the growth rate used beyond the period covered by the plan.
Although inherent uncertainties exist in any long term forecasting exercise, based 
on the audit procedures performed, we found that the directors’ judgements were 
supported by reasonable assumptions. For all CGUs, with the exception of one, 
with a carrying value of goodwill of £58.0m, it would require significant downside 
changes before a material impairment was required. For that one CGU, we found 
that reasonably foreseeable changes in key assumptions could result in 
a material impairment charge. 
We assessed whether the Group’s disclosures regarding the extent to which 
changes in key assumptions would need to change for the recoverable amount to 
fall below the carrying value of goodwill, in particular in relation to those CGUs 
with the lowest percentage headroom. We determined that these disclosures 
appropriately draw attention to the significant areas of judgement.

Development costs and programme participation costs impairment assessments
Refer also to note 19 (page 116)
The Group holds significant amounts 
of development costs (£408.4m) and 
programme participation costs (£267.6m) 
on the balance sheet. These intangible 
assets are subject to impairment testing at 
the individual asset (“programme”) level, 
at least annually and, where headroom 
is limited or if events or changes in 
circumstances indicate the carrying value 
may not be recoverable, more frequently. 
An impairment charge of £6.4m has been 
recorded against these balances in the 
current year. Our audit focused on the risk 
that the carrying value of these intangible 
assets could be overstated. 
We focused our audit procedures on those 
programmes against which the directors 
have recorded an impairment provision and 
those with limited headroom or significant 
carrying value. 
The key assumptions assessed were:
• the estimated aircraft volumes 
(“fleet forecast”); 
• the period over which future cash 
flows are forecast; 
• the sales price per part; and 
• the discount rate applied to 
future cash flows.
We evaluated the directors’ future cash flow forecasts and the process by which 
they were drawn up, and tested the integrity of the underlying discounted cash 
flow model. In respect of the programme impairment assessments tested we: 
• Agreed the fleet forecast data up to 2030 used in calculating the programme 
forecast cash flow to external market forecasts, and corroborated any 
significant deviations applied by the directors to supporting evidence. 
We assessed fleet forecasts used beyond the period covered by the external 
market forecasts, considering average aircraft lives and trend analysis and 
considered them to be reasonable;
• Agreed the sales price per part to customer contract and did not identify 
any material exceptions in these tests; and
• Tested the discount rates, by comparing key inputs, where relevant, to 
externally derived data or data for comparable listed organisations. We used 
our specialists in assessing the overall discount rates used, and observed 
them to be within a reasonable range. 
Although inherent uncertainties exist in any long term forecasting exercise, 
based on the audit procedures performed, we found that these judgements were 
supported by reasonable assumptions.
Environmental provisions
Refer also to note 31 (page 126)
The Group has liabilities of £111.0m  
relating to environmental matters. 
The environmental matters primarily 
relate to known exposures arising from 
environmental investigation and remediation 
of a number of manufacturing sites in the US 
where the Group has been identified as 
a potentially responsible party under US 
law. The liabilities are based on subjective 
judgements as to the estimated clean-up 
cost and length of time that operating and 
monitoring of the site is required. 
The Group has separately recognised 
insurance receivables of £80.1m, in relation 
to these environmental matters. We focused 
on the required recognition criteria being 
met and recoverability of these receivables.
Our work on the valuation of environmental liabilities comprised the following:
• We obtained the cost estimates and reports prepared by the Group’s external 
environmental consultants for the most significant sites. We assessed the 
consistency of the cost estimates year on year and the level of costs incurred 
compared to the prior year estimates to assess the historical accuracy of 
the estimates and understand changes to the scope of remediation plans. 
The changes in scope have been appropriately reflected in the provision;
• We assessed the competence and objectivity of the Group’s external 
environmental consultants, confirming that they are qualified and affiliated 
with the appropriate industry bodies in the respective local territory, and 
are independent of the Group; and
• We reconciled the cost estimates and reports to the provision recorded and 
gained an understanding of all significant adjustments applied by the directors 
such as differences in the operating and monitoring period and the application 
of additional provision for incremental costs. We assessed the reasonableness 
of these, including reviewing historical data where appropriate and consider 
the provision to be supported by reasonable assumptions.
Our work on the valuation of insurance receivables comprised the following: 
• We obtained the insurance policies to confirm the coverage limits;  
• We obtained confirmation from the insurer of the claims and settlements 
to date, and assessed the extent of insurance coverage against the known 
exposures, including the likelihood of reimbursement; and 
• We obtained evidence of the insurers’ financial position to assess their ability 
to meet the policy obligations. The recognition of the insurance receivable 
is supportable.

Area of focus How the scope of our audit addressed the area of focus
Revenue recognition under long term contract accounting primarily in the Group’s energy business
Refer also to note 5 (pages 105)
We focused on the recognition of revenue 
where long term contract accounting 
is used, due to the application by the 
directors of estimates and judgements in 
determining the amount of revenue to be 
recorded.
The Group’s long term contract accounting 
is primarily concentrated in its energy 
business which contracts to manufacture 
printed circuit heat exchangers. These 
comprise the majority of the Group’s 
long term contract accounting revenue 
of £66.7m. The recognition of revenue 
is largely dependent on the estimated 
percentage of completion of each 
contract, which is determined based on 
the proportion of contract costs incurred 
to date compared to the estimated total 
contract costs.
As these contracts may span reporting 
periods, changes in the estimate of 
total contract costs or the inappropriate 
recording of costs around the year end 
could result in revenue being recorded 
in the incorrect period. 
Our work on the revenue recognised under long term contract accounting 
comprised the following:
• We tested the calculation of percentage of completion, which included testing 
the costs incurred and recorded against the contract to invoice or other 
supporting evidence and agreeing the total contract costs to cost summaries. 
We re-performed the percentage of completion calculation, confirming that 
the revenue recognised was accurate based on the total contract value as 
per the signed contract or purchase order. We found no material exceptions 
in these tests;
• We assessed the estimates of costs to complete for significant contracts, 
obtaining an understanding of the performance and status of the contracts 
through discussion with contract project managers, and where appropriate, 
corroborated explanations by examination of evidence, such as customer 
correspondence and receipt of milestone payments. Further we evaluated 
the historical accuracy of the estimates of total contract costs. We found that 
these estimates were supportable and we identified a satisfactory degree of 
historical estimation accuracy; and 
• We examined any loss making contracts and considered low margin contracts 
to determine the level of provisioning required. This included assessing 
the actual profit or loss achieved on contracts that completed in the year 
compared to the forecast position.
Retirement benefit obligation liabilities
Refer also to note 33 (pages 128 to 132)
The Group has retirement benefit 
obligations with gross liabilities of 
£1,078.6m, which are significant in the 
context of the overall Group balance sheet.
The valuation of retirement benefit 
obligations requires significant levels 
of judgement and technical expertise, 
including the use of actuarial experts 
in selecting appropriate assumptions. 
Small changes in a number of the key 
assumptions used to value the Group’s 
retirement benefit obligation, (including 
salary increases, inflation, discount rates 
and mortality) could have a material impact 
on the calculation of the liability. 
We evaluated the assumptions made in relation to the valuation of the liabilities, 
with input from our actuarial specialists. In particular we:
• Agreed the discount and inflation rates used to our internally developed 
benchmarks, based on externally derived data and comparable organisations;
• Compared assumed mortality rates to national and industry averages;
• Assessed the assumption for salary increases against the company’s historical 
trend and expected future outlook; and
• Assessed the competence and objectivity of the Group’s external specialists, 
confirming they are qualified and affiliated with the appropriate industry 
bodies in the respective local territory. 
Based on the evidence obtained, we found that the assumptions used by the 
directors were reasonable.

Provisions for uncertain tax positions
Refer also to note 14 (page 112 to 113)
Judgements have to be made by the 
directors on the tax treatment of a number 
of transactions in advance of the ultimate 
tax determination being certain. 
This is due to the complexity of the Group’s 
legal structure (including multiple legal 
entities), the number of tax jurisdictions 
(primarily the UK and US) in which 
the Group operates, the complexity of 
international tax legislation and the 
changing tax environment. In addition 
uncertainty arises from intergroup 
transactions relating to goods, services 
and internal financing. 
Where the amount of tax payable or 
recoverable is uncertain, the Group 
establishes provisions based on  the 
director’s judgement of the probable 
amount of the liability, or expected 
amounts recoverable. There is a risk 
that the conclusion of the appropriate 
tax treatment with tax authorities is at an 
amount materially different to the amount 
provided for.
In conjunction with our internal UK and international tax specialists we:
• Evaluated the process by which the directors calculated each tax exposure and 
assessed whether the assumptions they have used, in conjunction with their 
advisors, in developing the estimated exposure, provided a supportable and 
reasonable basis to calculate the provision for uncertain tax positions; 
• Considered any tax opinions or other tax advice the Group had received from 
its tax advisors in relation to the exposures identified to determine that the 
treatment is consistent with the advice obtained. We also considered the 
evidence of recent tax audits and external tax cases which may have an impact 
on existing tax exposures;
• Assessed and formed our own views on the key judgements with respect to 
open and uncertain tax positions and concluded that the judgements made by  
the directors were materially consistent with our own views in respect of the 
significant tax exposures; and
• Evaluated and concluded that the liabilities and potential exposures were 
appropriately disclosed in the financial statements.
The directors’ judgements in respect of the Group’s position on uncertain tax 
items are supportable and reasonable in the context of the information currently 
available to them and no material matters were identified by our work that the 
directors had not adequately reflected in their estimate.
How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed 
enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial 
statements as a whole, taking into account the geographical 
structure of the Group, the accounting processes and controls, 
and the industry in which the Group operates.
The Group’s accounting process is structured around a local 
finance function in each of the Group’s reporting units. These 
functions maintain their own accounting records and controls 
(although transactional processing and certain controls for 
some reporting units are performed at the Group’s shared 
service centres) and report to the head office finance team 
through an integrated consolidation system.
In establishing the overall Group audit strategy and plan, we 
determined the type of work that needed to be performed at the 
reporting units by the Group engagement team and by component 
auditors from other PwC network firms. Where the work was 
performed by component auditors, we determined the level 
of involvement we needed to have in the audit work at those 
reporting units so as to be able to conclude whether sufficient 
appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our 
opinion on the Group financial statements as a whole.
For each reporting unit we determined whether we required 
an audit of their complete financial information (“full scope”) 
or whether specified procedures addressing specific risk 
characteristics or particular financial statement line items 
would be sufficient. Those where a full scope audit was 
required included the largest reporting unit (Meggitt Aircraft 
Braking Systems in Akron), determined as individually 
financially significant because it contributes more than 15% 
of the Group’s profit. We performed a full scope audit at 
a further 9 reporting units, based on their size or risk. Senior 
members of the Group engagement team visited all of these 
reporting units, with the exception of one, for which a number 
of conference calls were held, to review the work undertaken 
by component auditors and assess the audit findings. The 
Group consolidation, financial statement disclosures and 
a number of complex items, prepared by the head office 
finance function, were audited by the Group engagement 
team. These included goodwill, other intangible assets, 
derivative financial instruments and related hedge accounting, 
retirement benefit obligations, environmental and contractual 
provisions, share based payments and central adjustments 
raised as part of the consolidation process. These audit 
procedures together with those performed on the 10 reporting 
units accounted for 63% of Group profit before tax and 84% of 
Group total assets. We also performed specified procedures 
on 8 reporting units to address specific risk characteristics 
or to provide sufficient overall Group coverage of particular 
financial statement line items, principally in relation to 
revenue and provisions. In addition to the work performed 
at the in scope reporting units, there is a substantial amount 
of work performed at the consolidated level. As a result of 
its structure and size, the Group also has a large number of 
small reporting units that have an immaterial profit before 
tax but, in aggregate, make up a material portion of its profit 
before taxation and total assets. These small reporting units 
are covered by the work that we perform at the consolidated 
level, whereby we perform analytical review procedures. 
A significant proportion of these remaining reporting units not 
selected for local procedures were subject to this analysis of 
year on year movements, at a level of disaggregation to enable 
a focus on higher risk balances and unusual movements.

Other required reporting
Consistency of other information
Companies Act 2006 opinion
In our opinion, the information given in the Strategic report 
and the Directors’ report for the financial year for which the 
financial statements are prepared is consistent with the 
financial statements.
ISAs (UK & Ireland) reporting 
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if, 
in our opinion:
• information in the Annual Report is:
 – materially inconsistent with the 
information in the audited financial 
statements; or
 – apparently materially incorrect based 
on, or materially inconsistent with, our 
knowledge of the Group acquired in the 
course of performing our audit; or
 – otherwise misleading.
We have no 
exceptions 
to report.
• the statement given by the directors on 
page 84, in accordance with provision C.1.1 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
(the “Code”), that they consider the Annual 
Report taken as a whole to be fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides 
the information necessary for members to 
assess the Group’s position. performance, 
business model and strategy is materially 
inconsistent with our knowledge of the 
Group acquired in the course of 
performing our audit.
We have no 
exceptions 
to report.
• the section of the Annual Report on page 
56, as required by provision C.3.8 of the 
Code, describing the work of the Audit 
Committee does not appropriately address 
matters communicated by us to the 
Audit Committee.
We have no 
exceptions 
to report.
The directors’ assessment of the prospects of the Group and 
of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency or 
liquidity of the Group
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if, 
in our opinion:
• the directors’ confirmation on page 26 of 
the Annual Report, in accordance with 
provision C.2.1 of the Code, that they 
have carried out a robust assessment of 
the principal risks facing the Group, 
including those that would threaten its 
business model, future performance, 
solvency or liquidity.
We have nothing 
material to add 
or to draw 
attention to.
• the disclosures in the Annual Report 
that describe those risks and explain 
how they are being managed 
or mitigated.
We have nothing 
material to add 
or to draw 
attention to.
Those not subject to analytical review procedures were 
individually, and in aggregate, immaterial. This gave us the 
evidence we needed for our opinion on the financial statements 
as a whole.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of 
materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for 
materiality. These, together with qualitative considerations, 
helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, 
timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual 
financial statement line items and disclosures and in 
evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and 
on the financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined 
materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Overall Group materiality £10 million (2014: £11 million).
How we determined it 5% of profit before tax.
Rationale for benchmark 
applied
Consistent with last year, we applied 
this benchmark, the application 
of which is an accepted auditing 
practice. We note reference by 
the directors of an alternative 
profit measure (underlying profit 
before tax), and we specifically 
consider the related adjustments 
and disclosure in reconciling to 
statutory profit before tax as part 
of our audit procedures. 
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report 
to them misstatements identified during our audit above 
£500,000 (2014: £500,000) as well as misstatements below 
that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for 
qualitative reasons.
Going concern
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the directors’ 
statement, set out on page 84, in relation to going concern. We 
have nothing to report having performed our review. 
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you 
if we have anything material to add or to draw attention to 
in relation to the directors’ statement about whether they 
considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the financial statements. We have nothing material 
to add or to draw attention to. 
As noted in the directors’ statement, the directors have 
concluded that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the financial statements. The going concern 
basis presumes that the Group has adequate resources to 
remain in operation, and that the directors intend it to do so, 
for at least one year from the date the financial statements 
were signed. As part of our audit we have concluded that the 
directors’ use of the going concern basis is appropriate. 
However, because not all future events or conditions can be 
predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the 
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.

Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if, 
in our opinion:
• the directors’ explanation on page 29 of 
the Annual Report, in accordance with 
provision C.2.2 of the Code, as to how 
they have assessed the prospects of the 
Group, over what period they have done 
so and why they consider that period to 
be appropriate, and their statement as 
to whether they have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group will be able 
to continue in operation and meet its 
liabilities as they fall due over the period 
of their assessment, including any 
related disclosures drawing attention 
to any necessary qualifications 
or assumptions.
We have nothing 
material to add 
or to draw 
attention to.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the 
directors’ statement that they have carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing the Group and the 
directors’ statement in relation to the longer-term viability of 
the Group. Our review was substantially less in scope than an 
audit and only consisted of making inquiries and considering 
the directors’ process supporting their statements; 
checking that the statements are in alignment with the 
relevant provisions of the Code; and considering whether 
the statements are consistent with the knowledge acquired 
by us in the course of performing our audit. We have nothing 
to report having performed our review.
Adequacy of information and explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to 
you if, in our opinion, we have not received all the information 
and explanations we require for our audit. We have no 
exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to 
you if, in our opinion, certain disclosures of directors’ 
remuneration specified by law are not made. We have no 
exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Corporate governance statement
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the part of 
the Corporate Governance Statement relating to ten further 
provisions of the Code. We have nothing to report having 
performed our review.
Responsibilities for the financial statements and 
the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the directors
As explained more fully in the Statement of directors 
responsibilities set out on pages 83 to 84, the directors are 
responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and 
for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
ISAs (UK & Ireland). Those standards require us to comply 
with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards 
for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for 
and only for the parent company’s members as a body in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these 
opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other 
purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown 
or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed 
by our prior consent in writing.
What an audit of financial statements involves
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are 
free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud 
or error. This includes an assessment of: 
• whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the 
Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed; 
• the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates 
made by the directors; and 
• the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the 
directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming 
our own judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the 
financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other 
auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary 
to provide a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. 
We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness 
of controls, substantive procedures or a combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial 
information in the Annual Report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to 
identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect 
based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge 
acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we 
become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Other matter 
We have reported separately on the parent company 
financial statements of Meggitt PLC for the year ended 
31 December 2015 and on the information in the Directors’ 
remuneration report that is described as having been audited.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
When a subsidiary is disposed, the difference between the fair value 
of consideration received or receivable and the value at which net 
assets of the subsidiary were recorded, immediately prior to disposal, 
is recognised in the income statement within net operating costs. 
Any contingent consideration receivable is measured at fair value at 
the date of disposal in determining the gain or loss to be recognised. 
Contingent consideration receivable is measured at fair value at each 
subsequent balance sheet date, with any changes in fair value recorded 
in the income statement within net operating costs.
When a foreign subsidiary is disposed, the cumulative exchange 
differences relating to the retranslation of the net investment in the 
foreign subsidiary are recognised in the income statement as part of 
the gain or loss on disposal. This applies only to exchange differences 
recorded in equity after 1 January 2004. Exchange differences 
arising prior to 1 January 2004 remain in equity on disposal as 
permitted by IFRS 1 (‘First time Adoption of International Financial 
Reporting Standards’). 
Transactions between, and balances with, Group companies are 
eliminated together with unrealised gains on inter-group transactions. 
Unrealised losses are eliminated to the extent the asset transferred is 
not impaired. The accounting policies of acquired businesses are 
changed where necessary to be consistent with those of the Group.
 
Foreign currencies
Functional and presentational currency
The Group’s consolidated financial statements are presented in 
pounds sterling. Items included in the financial statements of each of 
the Group’s subsidiaries are measured using the functional currency 
of the primary economic environment in which the subsidiary operates.
Transactions and balances
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at exchange rates 
prevailing on the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are reported at exchange 
rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences on 
retranslating monetary assets and liabilities are recognised in the 
income statement within net operating costs except where they relate 
to qualifying cash flow hedges or net investment hedges in which case 
exchange differences are recognised in hedging and translation 
reserves within other comprehensive income. 
Foreign subsidiaries
The results of foreign subsidiaries are translated at average exchange 
rates for the period. Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are 
translated at exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. 
Exchange differences arising from the retranslation of the results 
and opening net assets of foreign subsidiaries are recognised in 
hedging and translation reserves within other comprehensive income. 
Exchange differences on borrowings designated as net investment 
hedges of foreign subsidiaries are also recognised in hedging and 
translation reserves. 
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising from the acquisition 
of a foreign subsidiary are treated as assets and liabilities of the  
subsidiary and are retranslated at exchange rates prevailing at 
the balance sheet date.
1. Basis of preparation
Meggitt PLC is a public limited company listed on the London Stock 
Exchange, domiciled in the United Kingdom and incorporated in 
England and Wales with the registered number 432989. Its registered 
office is at Atlantic House, Aviation Park West, Bournemouth 
International Airport, Christchurch, Dorset, BH23 6EW.
Meggitt PLC is the parent company of a Group whose principal 
activities during the year were the design and manufacture of high 
performance components and sub-systems for aerospace, defence 
and other specialist markets, including energy, medical, industrial, 
test and automotive. 
The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the European Union and the Companies Act 
2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The consolidated 
financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and 
under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of 
certain financial assets and financial liabilities (including derivative 
instruments) at fair value.
2. Summary of significant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies adopted by the Group in the 
preparation of the consolidated financial statements are set out below. 
These policies have been applied consistently to all periods presented 
unless stated otherwise. 
 
Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements 
of the Company and all of its subsidiaries. A subsidiary is an entity over 
which the Group has control. The Group has control over an entity 
where the Group is exposed to, or has the rights to, variable returns 
from its involvement with the entity, and it has the power over the entity 
to affect those returns. The results of subsidiaries acquired are fully 
consolidated from the date on which control transfers to the Group. 
The results of subsidiaries disposed are fully consolidated up to the 
date on which control transfers from the Group. 
The cost of an acquisition is the fair value of consideration provided, 
including the fair value of any contingent consideration, as measured 
at the acquisition date. Contingent consideration payable is measured 
at fair value at each subsequent balance sheet date, with any changes 
in fair value recorded in the income statement within net operating 
costs. Identifiable assets and liabilities of an acquired business 
meeting the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised 
at fair value at the date of acquisition. To the extent the cost of an 
acquisition exceeds the fair value of net assets acquired, the difference 
is recorded as goodwill. To the extent the fair value of net assets 
acquired exceeds the cost of an acquisition, the difference is recorded 
immediately in the income statement within net operating costs. 
Costs directly attributable to an acquisition are recognised in the 
income statement within net operating costs as incurred.
When a subsidiary is acquired, the fair value of its identifiable assets 
and liabilities are finalised within 12 months of the acquisition date. 
All fair value adjustments are recorded with effect from the date of 
acquisition and consequently may result in the restatement of 
previously reported financial results. 98 MEGGITT PLC          REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
Revenue from services
Revenue is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the 
contract. For ‘cost-plus fixed fee’ contracts, revenue is recognised 
equal to the costs incurred plus an appropriate proportion of the fee 
agreed with the customer. For other contracts, the stage of completion 
is typically measured by reference to contractual milestones achieved, 
number of aircraft flying hours or number of aircraft landings.
Revenue from funded research and development
Revenue is recognised according to the stage of completion of the 
contract. The stage of completion is typically measured by reference 
to contractual milestones achieved.
Exceptional operating items
Items which are significant by virtue of their size or nature, which are 
considered non-recurring and which are excluded from the underlying 
profit measures used by the Board to monitor and measure the 
underlying performance of the Group (see note 10) are classified as 
exceptional operating items. They include, for instance, costs directly 
attributable to the integration of an acquired business, significant 
site consolidation costs and other significant restructuring costs. 
Exceptional operating items are included within the appropriate 
consolidated income statement category but are highlighted 
separately in the notes to the financial statements.
Amounts arising on the acquisition, disposal and 
closure of a business
These items are excluded from the underlying profit measures used by 
the Board to monitor and measure the underlying performance of the 
Group (see note 10). They include, for instance, gains or losses made 
on the disposal or closure of a business, adjustments to the fair value 
of contingent consideration payable in respect of an acquired business 
or receivable in respect of a disposed business and costs directly 
attributable to the acquisition of a business. Amounts are included 
within the appropriate consolidated income statement category but are 
highlighted separately in the notes to the financial statements.
Intangible assets
Goodwill 
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair 
value of the Group’s share of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities 
and contingent liabilities assumed. Goodwill is tested annually for 
impairment, and also whenever events or changes in circumstances 
indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is 
carried at cost less amortisation charged prior to 1 January 2004 less 
accumulated impairment losses. In the event the subsidiary to which 
goodwill relates is disposed, its attributable goodwill is included in the 
determination of the gain or loss on disposal.
Research and development
Research expenditure is recognised as an expense in the income 
statement as incurred. Development costs incurred on projects where 
the related expenditure is separately identifiable, measurable and 
management are satisfied as to the ultimate technical and commercial 
viability of the project and that the asset will generate future economic 
benefit based on all relevant available information are recognised as 
an intangible asset. Capitalised development costs are carried at cost 
less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Amortisation is 
charged over the periods expected to benefit, typically up to 15 years, 
commencing with launch of the product. Development costs not 
meeting the criteria for capitalisation are expensed as incurred. 
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued 
Segment reporting
Operating segments are those segments for which results are 
reviewed by the Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (‘CODM’) 
to assess performance and make decisions about resources to be 
allocated. The CODM has been identified as the Board (see page 52 
of the Corporate governance report). The Group has determined that 
its segments are Meggitt Aircraft Braking Systems, Meggitt Control 
Systems, Meggitt Polymers & Composites, Meggitt Sensing Systems 
and the Meggitt Equipment Group. 
With effect from 1 January 2015, the Meggitt Avionics business was 
transferred from Meggitt Equipment Group to Meggitt Sensing 
Systems. Prior period comparatives have been restated to reflect 
this change in divisional structure.
The principal profit measure reviewed by the CODM is ‘underlying 
operating profit’ as defined in note 10. A segmental analysis of 
underlying operating profit is accordingly provided in the notes 
to the financial statements. 
Segmental information on assets is provided in the notes to the 
financial statements in respect of ‘trading assets’, which are defined to 
exclude from total assets, amounts which the CODM does not review at 
a segmental level. Excluded assets comprise centrally managed 
trading assets, goodwill, other intangible assets (excluding software 
assets), derivative financial instruments, deferred tax assets, current 
tax recoverable and cash and cash equivalents.
No segmental information on liabilities is provided in the notes to the 
financial statements, as no such measure is reviewed by the CODM.
Revenue recognition
Revenue represents the fair value of consideration received or 
receivable in respect of goods and services provided in the normal 
course of business to external customers, net of trade discounts, 
returns and sales related taxes. 
Sale of goods
Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of 
ownership have transferred to the customer, managerial involvement 
and control of the goods is not retained by the Group, the revenue and 
costs associated with the sale can be measured reliably and the 
collection of related receivables is probable. In the majority of 
instances these conditions are met when delivery to the customer 
takes place. In a minority of instances ‘bill and hold’ arrangements 
exist whereby revenue is recorded prior to delivery but only when the 
customer has accepted title to the goods, the goods are separately 
identifiable and available for delivery on terms agreed with the 
customer and normal credit terms apply.
Contract accounting revenue
The Group is usually able to reliably estimate the outcome of a contract 
at inception and accordingly recognises revenue and cost of sales by 
reference to the stage of completion of the contract. Revenue is 
typically measured by applying to total contract revenue, the 
proportion costs incurred for work performed in the period bear to 
total estimated contract costs. Where it is not possible to reliably 
estimate the outcome of a contract, revenue is recognised equal to 
costs incurred, provided recovery of such costs is probable. If total 
contract costs are forecast to exceed total contract revenue then the 
expected loss is recorded immediately in the income statement. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE REPORTS STRATEGIC REPORT 99
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the construction or production 
of qualifying assets, are capitalised as part of the cost of those assets 
until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended 
use. Qualifying assets are those that necessarily take a substantial 
period of time to get ready for their intended use, which would generally 
be at least 12 months. All other borrowing costs are recognised in the 
income statement as incurred.
Taxation
Tax payable is based on taxable profit for the period, calculated using 
tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided in full using the liability method on temporary 
differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their 
corresponding book values as recorded in the Group’s financial 
statements. Deferred tax is provided on unremitted earnings of foreign 
subsidiaries, except where the Group can control the remittance and it 
is probable that the earnings will not be remitted in the foreseeable 
future. Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent it is 
probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible 
temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred tax is calculated using 
tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Current tax and deferred tax are recognised in the income statement, 
other comprehensive income or directly in equity depending on where 
the item to which they relate has been recognised.
Impairment of non-current non-financial assets
Assets are reviewed for impairment annually and also whenever events 
or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value may not be 
recoverable. To the extent the carrying value exceeds the recoverable 
amount, the difference is recorded as an expense in the income 
statement. The recoverable amount used for impairment testing is the 
higher of the value in use and fair value less costs of disposal. For the 
purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped at the lowest level 
for which there are separately identifiable cash inflows which are 
largely independent of cash inflows from other assets or groups of 
assets. At each balance sheet date, previously recorded impairment 
losses, other than any relating to goodwill, are reviewed and if no 
longer required reversed with a corresponding credit to the 
income statement.
Inventories
Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Cost represents materials, direct labour, other direct costs and related 
production overheads, based on normal operating capacity, and is 
determined using the first-in first-out (FIFO) method. Net realisable 
value is based on estimated selling price, less further costs expected 
to be incurred to completion and disposal. 
When a subsidiary is acquired, finished goods are recorded at fair 
value, which is typically estimated selling price less costs of disposal 
and a reasonable profit allowance for the selling effort. Work in 
progress is also recorded at fair value at acquisition, which is typically 
estimated selling price less costs to complete, costs of disposal and 
a reasonable profit allowance for work not yet completed. When 
inventory is subsequently disposed post acquisition, the fair value is 
charged to the income statement. The difference between the fair value 
of the inventory disposed and its actual cost of manufacture is 
excluded from the underlying profit measures used by the Board to 
monitor and measure the underlying performance of the Group 
(see note 10).
Provision is made for obsolete, slow moving or defective items 
where appropriate and for unrealised profits on items of inter-group 
manufacture. 
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued 
Programme participation costs
Programme participation costs consist of incentives given to Original 
Equipment Manufacturers in connection with their selection of the 
Group’s products for installation onto new aircraft where the Group 
has obtained principal supplier status. These incentives comprise 
cash payments and/or the supply of initial manufactured parts on 
a free of charge or deeply discounted basis. Programme participation 
costs are recognised as an intangible asset and carried at cost less 
accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. For manufactured 
parts supplied on a free of charge or deeply discounted basis, cost 
represents the cost of manufacture transferred from inventory less 
the value of any revenue received or receivable. Amortisation is 
charged over the periods expected to benefit from receiving the status 
of principal supplier, through the sale of replacement parts, typically 
up to 15 years. 
Other intangible assets
a) Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination
For acquisitions, the Group recognises intangible assets separately 
from goodwill provided they are separable or arise from contractual 
or other legal rights and their fair value can be measured reliably. 
Intangible assets are initially recognised at fair value, which is 
regarded as their cost. Intangible assets are subsequently held 
at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. 
Where intangible assets have finite lives, their cost is amortised on 
a straight-line basis over those lives. The nature of intangible assets 
recognised and their estimated useful lives are as follows:
Customer relationships .............................. Up to 25 years
Technology  .................................................. Up to 25 years
Trade names and trademarks .................... U p to 2 5 y e a r s
Order backlogs ............................................ Over period of backlog  
                                                                          (typically up to 3 years)
Amortisation of intangible assets acquired as part of a business 
combination is excluded from the underlying profit measures used by 
the Board to monitor and measure the underlying performance of the 
Group (see note 10).
b) Other purchased intangible assets
Purchased licences, trademarks, patents and software are carried 
at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. 
Amortisation is charged on a straight-line basis over their estimated 
useful economic life, typically over periods up to 10 years. 
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses, except for land which is 
recorded at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Cost includes 
expenditure directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. 
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated 
useful lives of the assets as follows:
Freehold buildings ...................................... Up to 50 years  
Leasehold property ..................................... O ver per iod of lease
Plant and machinery ................................... 3 to 10 years
Furnaces ...................................................... Up to 20 years
Fixtures and fittings .................................... 3 to 10 years
Motor vehicles.............................................. 4 to 5 years
Residual values and useful lives are reviewed annually and adjusted 
if appropriate.
When property, plant and equipment is disposed, the difference 
between sale proceeds, net of related costs, and the carrying value 
of the asset is recognised in the income statement. 100 MEGGITT PLC          REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
Provisions
Provision is made for environmental liabilities, onerous contracts, 
product warranty claims and other liabilities when the Group has 
a present obligation as a result of past events, it is more likely than 
not that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the 
obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated. Provisions are 
discounted to present value where the impact is significant, using 
a pre-tax rate. The discount rate used is based on current market 
assessments of the time value of money, adjusted to reflect any risks 
specific to the obligation which have not been reflected in the 
undiscounted provision. The impact of the unwinding of discounting  
is recognised in the income statement within finance costs.
Retirement benefit schemes
For defined benefit schemes, pension costs and the costs of providing 
other post-retirement benefits, principally healthcare, are charged to 
the income statement in accordance with the advice of qualified 
independent actuaries. 
Past service credits and costs are recognised immediately in the 
income statement.
Retirement benefit obligations represent, for each scheme, the 
difference between the fair value of the schemes’ assets and the 
present value of the schemes’ defined benefit obligations measured 
at the balance sheet date. The defined benefit obligation is calculated 
annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit 
method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is 
determined by discounting the defined benefit obligations using 
interest rates of high quality corporate bonds denominated in the 
currency in which the benefits will be paid and with terms to maturity 
comparable with the terms of the related defined benefit obligations. 
Where the Group has a statutory or contractual minimum funding 
requirement to make contributions to a scheme in respect of past 
service and any such contributions are not available to the Group once 
paid (either as a reduction in future contributions or as a refund during 
the life of the scheme or when the scheme liabilities are settled, to 
which the Group has an unconditional right), an additional liability 
for such amounts is recognised.
Remeasurement gains and losses are recognised in the period in 
which they arise in other comprehensive income.
For defined contribution schemes, payments are recognised in the 
income statement when they fall due. The Group has no further 
obligations once the contributions have been paid.
Share-based compensation
The Group operates a number of share-based compensation schemes, 
which are principally equity-settled.
For equity-settled schemes, the fair value of an award is measured at 
the date of grant and reflects any market-based vesting conditions. 
Non market-based vesting conditions are excluded from the fair value 
of the award. At the date of grant, the Group estimates the number of 
awards expected to vest as a result of non market-based vesting 
conditions and the fair value of this estimated number of awards is 
recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line 
basis over the period for which services are received. At each balance 
sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of awards 
expected to vest as a result of non market-based vesting conditions 
and adjusts the amount recognised cumulatively in the income 
statement to reflect the revised estimate. When awards are exercised 
and the Company issues new shares, the proceeds received, net of any 
directly attributable transaction costs, are credited to share capital 
(nominal value) and share premium.
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and 
subsequently measured at amortised cost less any impairment losses. 
An impairment is recognised in the income statement, when there is 
objective evidence the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due 
according to the original terms of the receivables. The impairment 
recorded is the difference between the carrying value of the receivable 
and its estimated future cash flows discounted where appropriate. 
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and deposits held at  
call with banks. Bank overdrafts are disclosed as current liabilities, 
within bank and other borrowings, except where the Group participates 
in offset arrangements with certain banks whereby cash and overdraft 
amounts are offset against each other.
Trade payables
Trade payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently 
measured at amortised cost. Trade payables are not interest bearing.
Leases
Leases where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards 
of ownership are classified as finance leases. Finance leases are 
capitalised at commencement of the lease at the lower of fair value 
of the leased asset and present value of the minimum lease payments. 
Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance 
charges so as to achieve a constant rate on the finance balance 
outstanding. The corresponding lease obligations, net of finance 
charges, are included in liabilities. Assets acquired under finance 
leases are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of 
the useful life of the asset or the lease term.
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of 
ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating 
leases. Payments made under operating leases, net of any incentives 
received from the lessor, are charged to the income statement on 
a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. 
Dividends
Interim dividends are recognised as liabilities when they are approved 
by the Board. Final dividends are recognised as liabilities when they 
are approved by the shareholders.
Borrowings
Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, being proceeds 
received less directly attributable transaction costs incurred. 
Borrowings are generally subsequently measured at amortised cost 
with any transaction costs amortised to the income statement over the 
period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. Certain 
borrowings however are designated as fair value through profit and 
loss at inception, if the Group has interest rate derivatives in place 
which have the economic effect of converting fixed rate borrowings into 
floating rate borrowings. Such borrowings are measured at fair value 
at each balance sheet date with any movement in fair value recorded in 
the income statement within net operating costs. Movements in fair 
value are excluded from the underlying profit measures used by the 
Board to monitor and measure the underlying performance of the 
Group (see note 10).
Any related interest accruals are included within borrowings. 
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has 
an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 
12 months after the balance sheet date. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE REPORTS STRATEGIC REPORT 101
Net investment hedges
Hedges of net investments of foreign subsidiaries are accounted 
for in a similar way to cash flow hedges. Changes in fair value 
of the effective portion of any hedge are recognised in other 
comprehensive income. Changes in fair value of any ineffective 
portion are recognised immediately in the income statement 
within net operating costs. Cumulative gains and losses previously 
recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to 
the income statement if the foreign subsidiary to which they 
relate is disposed. Any such gains or losses are excluded from 
the underlying profit measures used by the Board to monitor and 
measure the underlying performance of the Group (see note 10).
Derivatives not meeting the criteria for hedge accounting
Where derivatives do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting, 
changes in fair value are recognised immediately in the income 
statement within net operating costs. The Group utilises a large 
number of foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate against 
currency fluctuations. The Group has determined the additional 
costs of meeting the extensive documentation requirements in order 
to apply hedge accounting under IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement’ are not merited. Additionally, in 2015 
the Group has entered a cross currency derivative and a treasury lock 
derivative (as described in note 30) which do not meet the criteria for 
hedge accounting. Gains and losses arising from measuring these 
derivatives at fair value are excluded from the underlying profit 
measures used by the Board to monitor and measure the underlying 
performance of the Group (see note 10). 
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly 
attributable to the issue of new shares are deducted from the proceeds 
recorded in equity. 
Own shares represent shares in the Company that are held by 
an independently managed Employee Share Ownership Plan. 
Consideration paid for own shares, including any incremental directly 
attributable costs, is recorded as a deduction from retained earnings. 
Share buyback
The total consideration payable for shares purchased is deducted 
from retained earnings. The shares when purchased are generally 
cancelled, unless they are to be used to satisfy obligations under 
employee share plans. The nominal value of cancelled shares is 
transferred from share capital to a separate capital redemption 
reserve. Where the Group has entered into an irrevocable non-
discretionary contract to purchase for cancellation shares on its behalf 
during a close period, the obligation to purchase shares is recognised 
in full at the inception of the contract, even when the obligation is 
conditional on the share price. The obligation is remeasured at each 
balance sheet date with changes recognised in the income statement. 
Any gain or loss arising from the remeasurement of the obligation 
is excluded from the underlying profit measures used by the Board 
to monitor and measure the underlying performance of the Group 
(see note 10).
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Derivative financial instruments and hedging
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure 
to interest rate risk and foreign currency transactional risk. Derivative 
financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the 
date the derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently 
remeasured at fair value at each balance sheet date using values 
determined indirectly from quoted prices that are observable for 
the asset or liability. 
The method by which any gain or loss arising from remeasurement  
is recognised depends on whether the instrument is designated as  
a hedging instrument and if so the nature of the item hedged. 
The Group recognises an instrument as a hedging instrument by 
documenting, at inception of the instrument, the relationship between 
the instrument and the hedged item and the objectives and strategy for 
undertaking the hedging transaction. To be designated as a hedging 
instrument, an instrument must also be assessed, at inception and 
on an ongoing basis, to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair 
values or cash flows of hedged items. 
To the extent the maturity of the financial instrument is more 
than 12 months from the balance sheet date, the fair value is 
reported as a non-current asset or non-current liability. All other 
derivative financial instruments are reported as current assets or 
current liabilities. 
Fair value hedges
Changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments, that are 
designated and qualify as fair value hedges, are recognised in the 
income statement within net operating costs together with changes in 
fair value of the hedged item. Any difference between the movement in 
fair value of the derivative and the hedged item is excluded from the 
underlying profit measures used by the Board to monitor and measure 
the underlying performance of the Group (see note 10). The Group 
currently only applies fair value hedge accounting to the hedging 
of fixed interest rate risk on borrowings.
Cash flow hedges
Changes in fair value of the effective portion of derivative financial 
instruments, that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, 
are initially recognised in other comprehensive income. Changes 
in fair value of any ineffective portion are recognised immediately 
in the income statement within net operating costs. 
To the extent changes in fair value are recognised in other 
comprehensive income, they are recycled to the income statement 
in the periods in which the hedged item affects the income statement. 
The Group currently only applies cash flow hedge accounting to the 
hedging of floating interest rate risk on borrowings.
If the forecast transaction to which the cash flow hedge relates is  
no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss previously 
recognised in other comprehensive income is transferred to the income 
statement immediately. If the hedging instrument is sold, expires or 
no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the cumulative 
gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income 
is transferred to the income statement when the forecast transaction 
is recognised in the income statement. 102 MEGGITT PLC          REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Adoption of new and revised accounting standards
During the year, no new accounting standards became effective which had a significant impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements.
Recent accounting developments
A number of new standards and amendments and revisions to existing standards have been published and are mandatory for the Group’s future 
accounting periods. They have not been adopted early in these consolidated financial statements. None of these are expected to have a significant 
impact on the consolidated financial statements when they are adopted except as disclosed below;
•  IFRS 9, ‘Financial instruments’. The main change is expected to relate to the way in which movements in the fair value of the Group’s fixed rate 
borrowings, attributable to changes in the Group’s own credit risk, are accounted for. The Group is yet to assess the full impact of IFRS 9 which 
becomes effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The standard is subject to endorsement by the European Union.
•  IFRS 15, ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’. This standard establishes principles for reporting the nature, amount and timing of revenue 
arising from an entity’s contracts with customers. The Group, along with the aerospace industry as a whole, is continuing to assess the full 
impact of IFRS 15. Areas which are currently under review by the Group, and where a change to current practice may be required, are the 
recognition as an intangible asset of programme participation costs, the method of accounting for revenue on power by the hour and cost per 
brake landing contracts and contract revenue recognition. The standard becomes effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2018 and is subject to endorsement by the European Union.
•  IFRS 16, ‘Leases’. The main change is expected to relate to the recognition on the Group’s balance sheet of assets and liabilities relating to 
leases which are currently being accounted for as operating leases. The Group is yet to assess the full impact of IFRS 16 which becomes 
effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. This standard is subject to endorsement by the European Union.
3. Financial risk management
Financial risk factors
The Group’s operations expose it to a number of financial risks including market risk (principally foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk), 
credit risk and liquidity risk. These risks are managed by a centralised treasury department, in accordance with Board approved objectives, 
policies and authorities (see also pages 38 to 39 of the Chief Financial Officer’s review). Regular reports monitor exposures and assist in 
managing the associated risks. 
Market risk
Foreign exchange risk
The Group operates internationally and is subject to foreign exchange risks on future commercial transactions and the retranslation of the 
results of, and net investments in, foreign subsidiaries. The principal exposure arises with respect to the US dollar against the Pound sterling. 
To mitigate risks associated with future commercial transactions, the Group policy is to hedge known and certain forecast transaction exposure 
based on historical experience and projections. The Group hedges at least 70% of the next 12 months anticipated exposure and can hedge up to 
five years ahead. Details of hedges in place are provided in note 30. The Group does not currently hedge exposure arising from the retranslation 
of the results of foreign subsidiaries. The Group uses borrowings denominated in the relevant currencies to partially hedge its net investments 
in foreign subsidiaries.
Interest rate risk
The Group has borrowings issued at both fixed and floating rates of interest. Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the Group to fair value 
interest rate risk, whereas borrowings issued at floating rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. The Group’s policy is to 
generally maintain at least 25% of its net debt at fixed rates. The Group mitigates interest rate risks through interest rate derivatives which 
have the economic effect of converting fixed rate borrowings into floating rate borrowings, floating rate borrowings into fixed rate borrowings 
and in 2015 through a treasury lock which secures the rates of fixed interest payable on specified amounts of future fixed rate financing. 
Details of hedges in place are provided in note 30.
Credit risk
The Group is not subject to significant concentration of credit risk with exposure spread across a large number of customers across the world. 
In addition, many of the Group’s principal customers are either government departments or large multinationals. Policies are maintained to 
ensure the Group makes sales to customers with an appropriate credit history. Letters of credit, or other appropriate instruments, are put in 
place to reduce credit risk where considered necessary. The Group is also subject to credit risk on the counterparties to its other financial 
instruments which it controls through only dealing with highly rated counterparties and netting transactions on settlement wherever possible.

Liquidity risk
The Group maintains sufficient committed facilities to meet projected borrowing requirements based on cash flow forecasts. Additional 
headroom is maintained to protect against the variability of cash flows and to accommodate small bolt-on acquisitions. Key ratios are monitored 
to ensure continued compliance with covenants contained in the Group’s principal credit agreements. The following table analyses the Group’s

Sensitivity analysis
The Group’s principal exposure in relation to market risks are to changes in the exchange rate between the US dollar and Pound sterling and to 
changes in US interest rates. The table below illustrates the sensitivity of the Group’s results to changes in these key variables at the balance 
sheet date. The analysis covers only financial assets and liabilities held at the balance sheet date and is made on the basis of the hedge 
designations in place on those dates and assuming no hedge ineffectiveness.

The impact on equity from movements in the exchange rate comprises £106.9 million (2014: £53.2 million) in respect of US dollar net debt, offset by 
£5.4 million (2014: £9.1 million) in respect of other financial assets and liabilities. However, as all US dollar debt is designated as a net investment 
hedge, this element of the impact is entirely offset by the retranslation of foreign subsidiaries. The impact of a 1% movement in the US yield curve 
includes the effect on the Group’s forward foreign exchange contracts as well as other financial assets and liabilities.
Capital risk management
The Group’s objective when managing its capital structure is to minimise the cost of capital whilst maintaining adequate capital to protect against 
volatility in earnings and net asset values. The strategy is designed to maximise shareholder return over the long-term. The Group’s current 
post-tax average cost of capital is approximately 8% (2014: 8%) and its capital structure at 31 December is as follows:

3. Financial risk management continued 
The Board believes that in maintaining an efficient balance sheet, a net debt/EBITDA ratio of between 1.5x and 2.5x is appropriate, whilst retaining 
the flexibility to move outside the range if appropriate. Further details on the share buyback programme announced as part of the Group’s strategy 
for delivering net debt/EBITDA in this range can be found on page 38 of the Chief Financial Officer’s review, which also includes details on how 
the Group has complied with the two principal financial covenant requirements contained in its committed credit facilities for the year ended 
31 December 2015.
4. Critical accounting estimates and judgements
In applying the Group’s accounting policies set out in note 2, the Group is required to make certain estimates and judgements concerning the 
future. These estimates and judgements are regularly reviewed and revised as necessary. The estimates and judgements that have the most 
significant effect on the amounts included in these financial statements are described below. Further consideration of these critical estimates 
and judgements can be found in the Audit Committee report on page 57.
Goodwill
Each year the Group carries out impairment tests of goodwill which require estimates to be made of the value in use of its cash generating units 
(‘CGUs’). These value in use calculations are dependent on estimates of future cash flows, long-term growth rates and appropriate discount rates 
to be applied to future cash flows of the CGUs. Further details on these estimates and sensitivities of the carrying value of goodwill to these 
estimates are provided in note 18.
Fair value of intangible assets acquired in a business combination
On the acquisition of a business, it is necessary to attribute fair values to any intangible assets acquired, provided they meet the criteria to be 
recognised. The fair values of these assets are dependent on estimates of attributable future revenues, margins, cash flows and appropriate 
discount rates to be applied to future cash flows. The Group takes advice from third parties in determining fair values and the estimated useful 
lives of intangible assets arising on significant acquisitions. Intangible assets are subject to impairment testing at least annually or if events or 
changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable. Estimates of remaining useful lives of assets are also reviewed 
at least annually, and revised if appropriate (see note 20 for further details).
Development costs
The majority of capitalised development costs relate to technology developed for aerospace programmes. In such cases, costs are typically 
not capitalised until a contract to develop the technology is awarded by a customer as, prior to this date, it is generally not possible to reliably 
estimate the point at which research activities conclude and development activities commence. Absent a contract, the Group also does not 
believe there is generally sufficient certainty over the future economic benefits that will be generated from the technology, to allow capitalisation 
of those costs. Post contract award, the Group will capitalise development costs provided it retains the intellectual property in the technology 
throughout the life of the aircraft or engine and it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Group. In making a judgement as to 
whether economic benefits will arise, the Group will make estimates of aircraft or engine volumes (taking into account the extent to which the 
Group has a sole-source position), aftermarket revenues which are dependent on aircraft utilisation, fleet lives and operator service routines, 
costs of manufacture and costs to complete the development activity.
Capitalised development costs are subject to impairment testing at least annually and, where headroom is limited or if events or changes in 
circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable, more frequently. Estimates of remaining useful lives of assets are also 
reviewed at least annually, and revised if appropriate.
At 31 December 2015, the programme with the largest capitalised development balance has a net book value of £65.5 million. Fleet volumes 
would need to reduce by approximately 60% from management estimates, without any mitigation actions taken by the Group, before any 
impairment would need to be recognised.
Programme participation costs
Approximately 85% of capitalised programme participation costs relate to free of charge or deeply discounted manufactured parts (‘FOC’), with 
the balance relating to cash payments. All amounts relate to aerospace programmes. FOC costs are typically incurred just prior to individual 
aircraft entering service and only where the Group is satisfied the incremental aftermarket revenues that will be generated over the life of the 
part are sufficient, will amounts be capitalised. In making this judgement, the Group makes estimates of aircraft utilisation rates and fleet 
lives and operator service routines. The capitalisation of cash payments is subject to similar judgements to those described for development 
costs above.
Capitalised programme participation costs are subject to impairment testing at least annually and, where headroom is limited or if events or 
changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable, more frequently. Estimates of remaining useful lives of assets are 
also reviewed at least annually, and revised if appropriate. 
At 31 December 2015, the programme with the largest capitalised programme participation balance has a net book value of £29.9 million.  
No reasonably foreseeable change in assumptions would cause an impairment to be recognised.

4. Critical accounting estimates and judgements continued 
Environmental matters
The Group is involved in the investigation and remediation of certain sites for which it has been identified as a potentially responsible party under 
US law. Advice is received by the Group from its environmental consultants and legal advisors to assist in the determination of the timing and 
estimation of the costs the Group may incur in respect of such claims and appropriate provisions are made. The Group has extensive insurance 
arrangements in place to mitigate the impact of historical environmental events on the Group. To the extent estimates in respect of claims 
change as more information becomes available, adjustments are made to the carrying value of these provisions and, if the costs are determined 
to be covered by insurance, to the amounts recoverable from insurers. However, actual losses incurred could differ from the original estimates 
(see note 31 for further details).
Onerous contracts
The Group makes provision for any expected losses arising from onerous contracts which require estimates to be made of future contract 
revenues, margins, potential claims from third parties and cash flows. These estimates are dependent on a number of factors including 
anticipated sales volumes, future pricing, production costs and the outcome of negotiations with third parties. To the extent these estimates 
change as more information becomes available, adjustments are made to the carrying value of these provisions. However, actual losses incurred 
could differ from the original estimates (see note 31 for further details).
Legal, regulatory and other similar matters
The Group is subject to legal proceedings and other claims arising in the ordinary course of business. The Group is required to assess the 
likelihood of any adverse judgements or outcomes, as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of any provisions required 
and any impairment of related receivables for these matters is based on a careful analysis of each individual issue with the assistance of outside 
legal counsel. However, actual losses incurred could differ from the original estimates (see note 31 for further details).
Retirement benefit obligations
The liability recognised in respect of retirement benefit obligations is dependent on a number of estimates including those relating to mortality, 
inflation, salary increases and the rate at which liabilities are discounted. External actuarial advice is taken with regard to the most appropriate 
assumptions to use. Further details on these estimates and sensitivities of the retirement benefit obligations to these estimates are provided 
in note 33.
Contract accounting revenue
In determining amounts to be recognised as revenue under long-term contracts, the Group makes an assessment of the stage of completion of 
each contract and its expected profit at completion based on an estimate of total contract costs. Contract cost estimates are based on an internal 
evaluation taking into account the specific nature of the contract, including its level of technical risk, together with the historical accuracy of 
previous contract estimates. Estimates are reviewed and updated regularly throughout the life of the contract, which typically will span more 
than one accounting period. The total amount of revenue recognised under long-term contracts in the year is disclosed in note 5.
Income taxes
In determining the Group’s provisions for income tax and deferred tax, it is necessary to consider transactions in a small number of key tax 
jurisdictions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. To the extent the final outcome differs from the tax that has been provided, 
adjustments will be made to income tax and deferred tax balances held in the period the determination is made. If the actual outcome of events 
differed by 10% from the estimates made at 31 December 2015, the impact on the tax charge would be approximately £4.0 million. Judgements 
also need to be made as to the extent to which deferred tax assets and liabilities can be offset against one another (see note 32 for further details).

acquired business or receivable in respect of a disposed business and costs directly attributable to the acquisition of a business. Such amounts 
were previously recorded as exceptional operating items. Prior year comparatives have been restated to reflect this change.

c.  IFRS 3 requires finished goods acquired in a business combination to be recorded at fair value, which is typically estimated selling price less 
costs of disposal and a reasonable profit allowance for the selling effort. Work in progress acquired in a business combination is recorded 
at fair value, which is typically estimated selling price less costs to complete, costs of disposal and a reasonable profit allowance for work 
still to be carried out. The fair value of acquired inventory is thus significantly higher than the same items built post acquisition, the value of 
which includes no profit element. The difference between the fair value of the inventory consumed and its cost is excluded from the Group’s 
underlying profit figures.

d.  Although the Group uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge against foreign currency exposures, it has decided that the costs of 
meeting the extensive documentation requirements to be able to apply hedge accounting under IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement’ are not merited. The Group’s underlying profit figures exclude amounts which would not have been recorded if hedge accounting 
had been applied. 
  Where interest rate derivatives do not qualify to be hedge accounted, movements in the fair value of the derivatives are excluded from 
underlying profit. Where interest rate derivatives do qualify to be hedge accounted, any difference between the movement in the fair value of 
derivatives and in the fair value of fixed rate borrowings is excluded from underlying profit. Where cross currency derivatives and treasury lock 
derivatives do not qualify to be hedge accounted, movements in the fair value of the derivatives are excluded from underlying profit. 
  Gains or losses arising from the remeasurement of the fair value of close period share buyback commitments are excluded from underlying profit.

The Finance (No 2) Act 2015, included legislation to reduce the main rate of corporation tax in the UK from 20% to 19% with effect from 1 April 2017 
and to 18% with effect from 1 April 2020. As these changes were substantively enacted during 2015, they are reflected in the tax charge for the 
year. The impact of this change on net deferred tax liabilities at 31 December 2015, profit for the year (underlying and statutory) and comprehensive 
income for the year was not significant.

15. Earnings per ordinary share
Earnings per ordinary share (‘EPS’) is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to owners of the Company by the weighted average number of 
shares in issue during the year. The weighted average number of shares used excludes treasury shares and any shares bought by the Group and 
held during the year by an independently managed Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust (see note 36). The weighted average number of treasury 
shares excluded was 0.3 million shares (2014: Nil million) and the weighted average number of own shares excluded was 0.7 million shares 
(2014: 0.1 million). The calculation of diluted EPS adjusts the weighted average number of shares to reflect the assumption that all potentially 
dilutive ordinary shares convert. For the Group this means assuming all share awards in issue are exercised.

Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if there is any indication of impairment. No impairment charge was required in the 
year (2014: £Nil million) and the cumulative impairment charge recognised to date is £Nil million (2014: £Nil million). The total amounts of goodwill 
and other intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisitions in the year of the advanced composites businesses of Cobham plc (“Advanced 
Composites”) and the composites division of EDAC (“EDAC”) that are expected to be deductible for tax purposes will be assessed during 2016. 
The total amount of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisition of Precision Engine Controls Corporation in 2014 
that is deductible for tax purposes is £Nil million.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the Group’s cash generating units (‘CGUs’) which principally comprise its 
individual business operations. Goodwill is initially allocated, in the year a business is acquired, to CGUs expected to benefit from the acquisition. 
Subsequent adjustments are made to this allocation to the extent operations to which goodwill relates are transferred between CGUs.

18. Goodwill continued 
For each CGU, the Group has determined its recoverable amount from value in use calculations. Such calculations were not performed for 
Advanced Composites or EDAC due to the proximity of their acquisition to the balance sheet date. The value in use calculations are based on cash 
flow forecasts derived from the most recent budgets and plans for the next five years, as approved by management in December 2015. Cash flows 
for periods beyond five years are extrapolated using estimated growth rates. The resultant cash flows are discounted using a pre-tax discount 
rate appropriate for the relevant CGU. The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are shown below:
•  Sales volumes, selling prices and cost increases over the five years covered by management’s detailed plans. Sales volumes are based on 
industry forecasts and management estimates for the businesses in which each CGU operates including forecasts for OEM deliveries of large 
jets, regional aircraft and business jets, air traffic growth and military spending by the US DoD and other major governments. Selling prices 
and cost increases are based on past experience and management expectations of future changes in the market. The extent to which these 
assumptions affect each principal CGU with a significant level of goodwill are described below.
  MABS, Meggitt (North Hollywood), Inc., Meggitt Safety Systems, Inc. and MSS are broadly spread across both civil aerospace and military platforms 
with Meggitt (North Hollywood), Inc. and MSS also operating in the energy sector. MABS is a leading supplier of wheels, brakes and brake control 
systems, particularly for regional aircraft, business jets and military aircraft. Meggitt (North Hollywood), Inc. designs and manufactures fluid 
control devices and systems for most aircraft types and has a higher content on large jets. Meggitt Safety Systems, Inc. designs and manufactures 
fire protection and control systems for large, regional, business and military aircraft. MSS is a leading provider of high-performance sensing and 
condition-monitoring solutions for high-value rotating machinery and other assets and, within the aerospace sector, has a higher content on large 
jets. All four CGUs have significant OEM and aftermarket revenue derived from sole-source positions with the aftermarket, where platform lives can 
be up to thirty years for civil aircraft and longer for military, representing the greater proportion of revenue except for MSS which has a higher OEM 
content. Meggitt (Rockmart), Inc. and Meggitt Training Systems, Inc. both operate mainly in military markets. The principal customer of Meggitt 
(Rockmart), Inc. is the US DoD to whom they are a leading supplier of flexible fuel tanks. Meggitt Training Systems, Inc. supplies integrated live 
and virtual training packages for armed forces and law enforcement agencies across the world. 
  In civil aerospace, growth in capacity terms, measured in available seat kilometres (ASKs), is forecast to grow in line with the long-term trend 
rate of 5%, which together with the Group’s growing fleet, price increases and the expected output of the formation of the customer services and 
support organisation, should facilitate revenue growth in excess of the overall market for civil spares over the medium term. The Group’s continuing 
confidence in air passenger travel growth is supported by the sustained high levels of order intake at Boeing and Airbus. Large jet deliveries 
increased by 1% in 2015, and the Group expects good delivery growth over the next five years underpinned by continued strong recent order intake 
and a backlog at Boeing and Airbus which equates to over eight years of deliveries at current production rates. Deliveries of regional aircraft 
increased by 10% in 2015, with modest growth anticipated over the next few years, driven principally by demand for 70-90 seat aircraft, on which the 
Group has a strong shipset content. Total business jet deliveries increased by 6% in 2015. Further growth is anticipated in this market over the next 
five years, driven by increasing globalisation of the customer base and the ongoing improvement in the US economy, partially offset by the impact of 
a weaker oil and gas sector. Military markets look to be entering a more benign phase, with the expectation of a return to growth in military budgets 
in a number of regions. The Group has key positions on a broad range of military applications, including future growth platforms and is likely to 
benefit from increased expenditure on the retrofit and reset of repatriated military equipment. The Group therefore continues to anticipate average 
compound organic military percentage growth in low single digits in the medium term.
•  Growth rates used for periods beyond those covered by management’s detailed budgets and plans. Growth rates are derived from 
management’s estimates which take into account the long-term nature of the industry in which each CGU operates, external industry forecasts 
of long-term growth in the aerospace and defence sectors, the extent to which a CGU has sole-source position on platforms where it is able to 
share in a continuing stream of highly profitable aftermarket revenues, the maturity of the platforms supplied by the CGU and the technological 
content of the CGU’s products. For the purpose of impairment testing, a conservative approach has been used and where the derived rate 
is higher than the long-term GDP growth rates for the principal countries in which the CGU operates (UK: 2.3% (2014: 2.3%), US: 2.5% 
(2014: 2.4%)), the latter has been used.
•  Discount rates applied to future cash flows. The Group’s pre-tax weighted average cost of capital (WACC) was used as the foundation for 
determining the discount rates to be applied. The WACC was then adjusted to reflect risks specific to the CGU not already reflected in the future 
cash flows for that CGU. The discount rates used were as follows: MABS 10.1% (2014: 10.2%), Meggitt (North Hollywood), Inc., 11.3% (2014: 10.9%), 
Meggitt Safety Systems, Inc. 11.1% (2014: 10.9%), MSS 10.0% (2014: 10.1%), Meggitt (Rockmart), Inc. 10.7% (2014: 10.4%), and Meggitt Training 
Systems, Inc. 10.0% (2014: 9.8%). The discount rates used for ‘Other’ CGUs ranged between 9.2% to 11.1% (2014: 8.3% to 11.0%).
A sensitivity analysis was carried out for each CGU to determine the extent to which its assumptions would need to change for the calculated 
recoverable amounts from value in use, to fall below the carrying value of goodwill of the CGU. Management has concluded that no reasonably 
foreseeable change in the key assumptions used in the impairment model would result in a significant impairment charge being recorded in the 
financial statements in respect of the principal CGU’s described above. The principal CGU with the least headroom in percentage terms is MABS 
followed by Meggitt (Rockmart), Inc. then Meggitt (North Hollywood), Inc.. To require an impairment in the Group financial statements, one of the 
following would be required:

Headroom £356.3m £39.0m £100.8m 116 MEGGITT PLC          REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015
18. Goodwill continued
‘Other’ goodwill of £292.6 million (2014: £287.6 million) relates to approximately 10 individual CGUs. The CGU with the least headroom in percentage 
terms has a goodwill balance of £58.0 million and limited headroom of £4.6 million based on value in use calculations and using a discount rate of 
10.8%. A potential impairment would be required if there were more than a 4% reduction in estimated cash flows, 10% reduction in long-term 
growth rates or 2% increase in the discount rate applied. Restructuring of the way the business operates in 2016, which is not reflected in the five 
year plan, is expected to lead to further headroom being created, when impairment testing is carried out in future years.

Fair value measurement and hierarchy
For trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, trade and other payables, obligations under finance leases and the current 
element of floating rate bank and other borrowings, fair values approximate to book values due to the short maturity periods of these financial 
instruments. For trade and other receivables, allowances are made within book value for credit risk. 
Derivative financial instruments measured at fair value, are classified as level 2 in the fair value measurement hierarchy, as they have been 
determined using significant inputs based on observable market data. The fair values of foreign currency forward contracts have been derived 
from forward exchange rates observable at the balance sheet date together with the contractual forward rates. The fair values of interest rate 
derivatives and the treasury lock derivative, have been derived from forward interest rates based on yield curves observable at the balance sheet 
date together with the contractual interest rates. The fair value of the cross currency derivative has been derived from forward interest rates 
based on yield curves observable at the balance sheet date, forward exchange rates observable at the balance sheet date and the contractual 
interest and forward exchange rates.
The non-current portion of bank and other borrowings measured at fair value, is classified as level 3 in the fair value measurement hierarchy, 
as it has been determined using significant inputs which are a mixture of those based on observable market data (interest rate risk) and those not 
based on observable market data (credit risk). The fair value attributable to interest rate risk has been derived from forward interest rates based 
on yield curves observable at the balance sheet date together with the contractual interest rates and with the credit risk margin kept constant. 
The fair value attributable to credit risk has been derived from quotes from lenders for borrowings of similar amounts and maturity periods.  
The same methods of valuation have been used to derive the fair value of the current element of fixed rate bank and other borrowings and the 
non-current element of bank and other borrowings which are held at amortised cost, but for which fair values are provided in the table above.
There were no transfers of assets or liabilities between levels of the fair value hierarchy during the year.
Financial liabilities designated as fair value through profit and loss

approximately £7.6 million.

Interest rate swaps
The total notional principal amount of outstanding interest rate swap contracts at 31 December 2015 is £379.9 million (2014: £359.1 million), of 
which £67.8 million will expire in 2017, £108.6 million will expire in 2018, £118.7 million will expire in 2020 and £84.8 million will expire in 2022. 
The contracts are all denominated in US dollars. Of the notional principal amount outstanding, £108.5 million (2014: £102.6 million) has the 
economic effect of converting floating rate US dollar borrowings into fixed rate US dollar borrowings and £271.4 million (2014: £256.5 million) 
has the economic effect of converting fixed rate US dollar borrowings into floating rate US dollar borrowings. To the extent they meet the criteria 
for hedge accounting, the floating rate to fixed rate swap contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges and the fixed rate to floating rate swap 
contracts as fair value hedges. 
Cross currency swap
The cross currency swap has been used to synthetically convert US dollar denominated floating borrowings into Swiss franc denominated 
fixed borrowings to hedge against Swiss franc denominated assets of overseas subsidiaries. The cross currency swap does not qualify to be 
hedge accounted. 
Treasury lock 
The treasury lock has been used to secure current market interest rates for specified amounts of future fixed-rate funding. The treasury lock 
does not qualify to be hedge accounted.
Foreign currency forward contracts
Although the Group uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge against foreign currency exposures, it has decided that the costs of 
meeting the extensive documentation requirements to be able to apply hedge accounting under IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition 
and Measurement’ are not merited.

*  Amounts in respect of onerous contracts and warranty costs have been recorded in cost of sales. Amounts in respect of environmental and 
other provisions have been recorded in net operating costs.
a.  Provision has been made for known exposures arising from environmental remediation in a number of businesses. The Group’s operations 
and facilities are subject to laws and regulations that govern the discharge of pollutants and hazardous substances into the ground, air and 
water as well as the handling, storage and disposal of such materials and other environmental matters. Failure to comply with its obligations 
potentially exposes the Group to serious consequences, including fines, other sanctions and limitations on operations. The Group is involved in 
the investigation and remediation of current and former sites for which it has been identified as a potentially responsible party under US law. 
Provision has been made for the expected costs arising from these sites based on information currently available. The provisions are expected 
to be substantially utilised over the next fifteen years and are discounted, where appropriate, using an appropriate discount rate. A receivable 
has been established to the extent these costs are recoverable under the Group’s environmental insurance policies or from other parties 
and for which movements in that receivable are shown in the table above (see also note 23). During the year, further information regarding 
the extent of remediation required was received, which resulted in the reversal of £15.9 million of provision previously held. As the revision of 
cost estimates related to sites which are insured, there was a corresponding reduction in the insurance receivable and no net impact on net 
operating costs.
b.  Provision has been made for estimated losses under certain trading contracts. During 2013, the Group was made aware of an issue relating 
to the supply from a vendor of non-conforming raw material in one of our businesses. Provision has been made for the estimated future costs 
associated with this matter, which include the provision of a number of free of charge replacement parts to customers over a period of several 
years. There are a number of uncertainties regarding the ultimate amounts that will be payable, including the extent to which replacement 
parts will be required. However, the directors believe, based on the information currently available, that the ultimate outcome will not be 
significantly different from that recognised. Onerous trading contract provisions are expected to be substantially utilised over the next ten 
years and are discounted, where appropriate, using a discount rate appropriate to each provision.
c.  Provision has been made for product warranty claims. These provisions are expected to be utilised over the next three years. The provisions 
are not discounted given the short period over which they will be utilised.
d.  A number of asbestos-related claims have been made against subsidiary companies of the Group. To date, the amount connected with such 
claims in any year has not been material and many claims are covered fully or partly by existing insurance and indemnities. There is a provision 
for certain claims which cannot be recovered from insurers. During 2013, an administrative settlement was reached with the US Government 
following its investigation of alleged violations of US export control laws by certain subsidiaries of the Group. Under the terms of the 30-month 
consent agreement, Meggitt-USA, Inc. was assessed a civil penalty of USD 25 million, of which USD 22 million was suspended on condition 
the Government approved certain past or future remedial costs incurred or to be incurred by the Group’s US subsidiaries. Such approval was 
received during the year. In addition, the Group was required to implement additional future compliance measures. The provisions are expected 
to be substantially utilised over the next ten years and are discounted, where appropriate, using a discount rate appropriate to each provision.

Deferred tax liabilities all fall due after more than one year. 
The Group has unrecognised tax losses of £24.3 million (2014: £23.5 million) for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised. Deferred tax 
assets have not been recognised in respect of these losses, as it is not regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered. Deferred tax 
assets not recognised, would be recoverable in the event they reverse and suitable taxable profits are available. There are no unremitted earnings 
in foreign subsidiaries that would give rise to a tax liability in the event of those subsidiaries remitting their earnings. 128 MEGGITT PLC          REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015
33. Retirement benefit obligations
Pension schemes
The Group operates a number of pension schemes for the benefit of its employees. The nature of each scheme which has a significant impact 
on the financial statements is as follows: 
•  In the UK, the Group operates a funded defined benefit scheme which is closed to new members but open to future accrual for existing 
members;
•  In the US, the Group operates five defined benefit schemes, all of which are closed to new members. With two exceptions, these schemes are 
open to future accrual for existing members. The schemes are a mixture of funded and unfunded schemes; and
•  In Switzerland, the Group operates a funded defined benefit scheme which is open to new members and to future accrual. 
The UK and US schemes provide benefits to members in the form of a guaranteed level of pension payable for life. The benefits provided depend 
on a member’s length of service. For the majority of schemes, the benefits are also dependent on salary at retirement or average salary over 
employment in the final years leading up to retirement. In the US, one scheme provides a fixed benefit for each year of service. The Swiss scheme 
has many of the characteristics of a defined contribution scheme but provides for certain minimum benefits to be guaranteed to members. 
For all funded schemes, benefit payments are made from funds administered by third parties unrelated to the Group. The assets of such schemes 
are held in trust funds, or their equivalent, separate from the Group’s finances.
The UK scheme is a registered scheme and subject to the statutory scheme-specific funding requirements outlined in UK legislation, including 
the payment of levies to the Pension Protection Fund. It is established under trust and the responsibility for its governance lies with the trustees 
who also agree funding arrangements with the Group.
The funded US schemes are tax-qualified pension schemes regulated by the Pension Protection Act 2006 and are insured by the Pension Benefit 
Guarantee Corporation up to certain limits. They are established under, and governed by, the US Employee Retirement Income Security Act 1974. 
Meggitt is a named fiduciary with the authority to manage the operation of the US schemes.
The Swiss scheme is a tax qualified pension plan subject to the Swiss Federal Law on Occupational Retirement, Survivors’ and Disability Pension 
Plans which constitutes a legal framework setting out the minimum requirements for occupational pension plans. The responsibility for its 
governance lies with a foundation, which is similar in nature to a UK trustee board.
For all unfunded schemes, benefit payments are made by the Group as obligations fall due. The Group also operates a number of defined 
contribution schemes under which the Group has no further obligations once the contributions have been paid.
Healthcare schemes
The Group has two principal other post-retirement benefit schemes providing medical and life assurance benefits to certain employees, 
and former employees, of Meggitt Aircraft Braking Systems Corporation and Meggitt (Rockmart), Inc. These schemes are unfunded.

*  In 2014, the Group made changes to the way in which medical benefits are provided. These changes, following which the Group continues to 
provide comparable benefits, resulted in a past service credit being recognised of £8.4 million, which is included within the amounts shown 
in the table. 
Of the total charge, £39.4 million (2014: £26.6 million) has been charged to operating profit (see note 9), of which £22.2 million (2014: £19.5 million) 
has been included in cost of sales and £17.2 million (2014: £7.1 million) in net operating costs. The remaining £11.2 million (2014: £10.0 million) 
is included in finance costs (see note 13).

In determining the fair value of scheme liabilities, the Group uses mortality assumptions which are based on published mortality tables adjusted 
to reflect the characteristics of the scheme populations. The Group’s mortality assumptions in the UK are based on recent mortality investigations 
of Self Administered Pension Schemes adjusted to reflect the profile of the membership of the scheme, which include the results of an analysis of 
members used to support the 2015 triennial UK actuarial valuation. Allowance has been made for rates of mortality to continue to fall at the rate of 
1.25% per annum.
In the US, mortality assumptions are based on the RPH-2014 headcount weighted table, for schemes where benefits are not salary-linked, and 
the RP-2014 table for other schemes, with both tables projecting rates of mortality to fall using the Social Security Administration’s projection 
scale (‘Scale SSA’).

* Provided in respect of the most significant overseas schemes.
Details on the sensitivity of scheme liabilities to changes in assumptions are provided below:
•  The impact of a 10 basis point reduction in discount rate would cause scheme liabilities at 31 December 2015 to increase by approximately 
£17.8 million.
•  The impact of a 10 basis point increase in inflation and salary inflation rates would cause scheme liabilities at 31 December 2015 to increase 
by approximately £11.7 million.
•  The impact of assuming every scheme member were to live for an additional year would cause scheme liabilities at 31 December 2015 
to increase by approximately £31.7 million.
The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in a single assumption while keeping all other assumptions constant. In practice, this is 
unlikely to occur, and changes in some assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to 
significant actuarial assumptions, the same method of calculating the defined benefit obligation has been used as when calculating the 
retirement benefit obligations recognised in the balance sheet. The methods and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity 
analysis are consistent with the previous year. 
Risks
The Group is exposed to a number of risks arising from operating its defined benefit pension and healthcare schemes, the most significant 
of which are detailed below. The Group has not changed the process used to manage defined benefit scheme risks during the year. 
Asset volatility 
In determining the present value of schemes’ defined benefit obligations, liabilities are discounted using interest rates of high quality 
corporate bonds. To the extent the actual return on schemes’ assets is below this yield, the retirement benefit obligations recognised in 
the consolidated financial statements would increase. This risk is partly mitigated by funded schemes investing in matching corporate 
bonds, such that changes in asset values are offset by similar changes in the value of scheme liabilities. However, the Group also invests 
in other asset types such as equities, property, hedge funds, commodities and derivatives where movements in asset values may be 
uncorrelated to movements in the yields on high quality corporate bonds. The Group believes that, due to the long-term nature of its 
scheme liabilities, it is appropriate to invest in assets which are expected to out-perform corporate bonds over this timeframe. Scheme 
assets are well diversified, such that the failure of any single investment would not have a material impact on the overall level of assets. 
In 2014, part of the equity portfolio held by the UK and US schemes was disinvested. The amounts disinvested totalled approximately 
£100.0 million. The proceeds were used to purchase structured investments consisting of high quality government bonds together with 
equity derivatives. The structured investments enable the schemes to benefit from equity-like returns, subject to certain caps, on the 
amounts invested, whilst providing an element of protection against falls in equity markets. The Group actively monitors how the duration 
and expected yield of scheme assets are matching the expected cash outflows arising from the pension obligations. For each UK and 
US funded scheme, there is a ‘glide-path’ in place which provides, to the extent the funding position improves, for asset volatility to be 
reduced by increased investment in long-term index linked securities with maturities that match the benefit payments as they fall due.
Interest risk
In determining the present value of schemes’ defined benefit obligations, liabilities are discounted using interest rates of high 
quality corporate bonds. If these yields fall, the retirement benefit obligations recognised in the consolidated financial statements 
would increase. This risk is partly mitigated through the funded schemes investing in matching assets as described above. 
Inflation risk
In determining the present value of schemes’ defined benefit obligations, estimates are made as to the levels of salary inflation, inflation 
increases that will apply to deferred benefits during deferment and pensions in payment, and healthcare cost inflation. To the extent actual 
inflation exceeds these estimates, the retirement benefit obligations recognised in the consolidated financial statements would increase. 
Salary inflation risk is partly mitigated in both the UK and US schemes by linking benefits in respect of future service to average salaries over 
a period of employment rather than final salary at retirement. Benefits in respect of certain periods of past service are still linked to final salary 
at retirement. In the UK, inflation risk in respect of deferred benefits and pensions in payment is mitigated by caps on the levels of inflation 
under the scheme rules. In the US and Switzerland, the schemes provide for no inflation to be applied to benefits in deferment or retirement. 
Exposure to inflation on US healthcare costs has been mitigated by freezing Group contributions to medical costs at 2011 cost levels.  132 MEGGITT PLC          REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015
33. Retirement benefit obligations continued 
Longevity risk
In determining the present value of schemes’ defined benefit obligations, assumptions are made as to the life expectancy of members during 
employment and in retirement. To the extent life expectancy exceeds this estimate, the retirement benefit obligations recognised in the 
consolidated financial statements would increase. This risk is more significant in the UK plan, where inflationary increases result in higher 
sensitivity to changes in life expectancy. The Group currently does not use derivatives, such as longevity swaps, to mitigate this risk.
Other information 
In the UK, the last triennial valuation was in 2012 following which the Group agreed with the trustees to increase deficit reduction payments, with 
the aim being to eliminate the deficit by 2024. Under the agreement with the trustees, deficit payments in 2016 will be £21.9 million and will 
increase by approximately 5% per annum until 2024. Although the present value of future deficit payments agreed as part of the 2012 actuarial 
valuation exceed the scheme deficit at 31 December 2014, such amounts would be recoverable by the Group under the scheme rules once the last 
member has died and accordingly no additional minimum funding liability arises. The 2015 triennial valuation is approaching completion and 
discussions with the trustees have commenced over a revised recovery plan to address the additional deficit of approximately £70.0 million 
arising since the 2012 valuation. Assuming the additional deficit is funded on a similar basis to the existing recovery plan, additional annual deficit 
payments of approximately £7.5 million would be required, commencing in 2016.
In the US, deficit reduction payments are driven by regulations and provide for deficits to be eliminated over periods up to 15 years. Deficit 
payments in 2016 are expected to be £Nil million and, absent any changes in legislation, will then increase over the following two years to 
£8.0 million by 2018. Thereafter, annual payments are expected to remain relatively stable for the remainder of the recovery period. The present 
value of deficit payments due under legislation do not exceed the schemes’ deficits at 31 December 2015 and accordingly no additional minimum 
funding liability arises.
The Swiss scheme has a surplus on a funding basis.
The estimated total Group contributions expected to be paid to the schemes during 2016 are £42.3 million, assuming the additional deficit under 
the 2015 UK valuation is funded on a similar basis to the existing recovery plan.
The weighted average duration of the UK schemes’ defined benefit obligation is 19.3 years. The weighted average duration of the overseas 
schemes’ defined benefit obligation is 11.0 years. The expected maturity of undiscounted pension and healthcare benefits at 31 December 2015

35. Share-based payment
The Group operates a number of share schemes for the benefit of its employees. The total expense recorded in the income statement in respect  
of such schemes was £4.1 million (2014: £1.7 million) (see note 9). The nature of each scheme which has a significant impact on the expense 
recorded in the income statement is set out below. 
Meggitt Long Term Incentive Plan 2014 
Equity-settled
Under the Meggitt Long Term Incentive Plan 2014, an annual award of shares may be made to certain senior executives. The number of shares, 
if any that an executive ultimately receives, depends on three performance conditions:
•  An earnings per share (EPS) measure (33% of the award); 
•  A return on trading assets (ROTA) measure (33% of the award); and
 • A strategic goals measure (33% of the award). 134 MEGGITT PLC          REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015
35. Share-based payment continued
Each of the conditions is measured over a three year performance period. An expense of £2.4 million (2014: £1.7 million) was recorded in the year. 
Awards are made as nil cost options. An employee is generally entitled to a payment at the end of the vesting period, equivalent to dividends that 
would have been paid during the vesting period, on any shares that vest. The fair value of the award made in 2015 has been estimated at the 
market price of the share on the date of grant, which was 559.10 pence (2014: 467.54 pence). Movements in the number of outstanding shares that 
may potentially be released to employees are as follows:

Deferred Share Bonus Plan
Equity-settled
Under the Deferred Share Bonus Plan, an award of shares may be made to certain senior executives. The number of shares, if any that an executive 
ultimately receives, depends on them remaining in service for a specified period of time. There are no other significant performance conditions.
An expense of £1.1 million (2014: £0.1 million) was recorded in the year. Awards are made as nil cost options. An employee is generally entitled to 
a payment at the end of the vesting period, equivalent to dividends that would have been paid during the vesting period, on any shares that vest. 
The fair value of the awards made in 2015 were estimated at the market price of the share on the date of each grant. The average price at the date 
of grant was 540.00 pence. No significant grants were made in 2014. Movements in the number of outstanding shares that may potentially be

Meggitt Executive Share Option Scheme 2005 
Equity-settled
Awards are no longer made under this scheme. Share awards under the scheme were granted to certain senior executives at an exercise price 
equal to the market price of the shares on the day before the grant was made. The awards are generally exercisable at the earliest three years 
after the grant date. Awards can only be exercised if the Group meets an earnings per share performance condition. The Group has no obligation, 
legal or constructive, to settle the awards in cash. Awards under Part A of the scheme provide for the executive on exercise to be entitled, on 
payment of the exercise price, to the number of shares under award. Awards under Part B of the scheme are in the form of equity-settled share 
appreciation rights (SAR’s) and provide for the executive on exercise to be entitled to receive equity equivalent to the gain in value between the 
exercise price and the market price on the date of exercise. Awards may be exercised at any point between the vesting date and ten years after 
the date the award was made.
No charge (2014: £0.9 million credit) was recorded in the year. Movements in the number of outstanding awards and their related weighted

36. Own shares and treasury shares
Own shares represent shares in the Company that are held by an independently managed Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust (‘the trust’)
formed to acquire shares to be used to satisfy share options and awards under the employee share schemes as described in the Directors’ 
remuneration report on pages 60 to 80. At 31 December 2015, the trust held 1.9 million ordinary shares (2014: 0.3 million ordinary shares) of 
which 1.7 million were unallocated (2014: 0.3 million), being retained by the trust for future use. The balance were held for employees in a vested 
share account to satisfy particular awards which had fully vested. All shares, whether or not allocated, are held for the benefit of employees. 
The shares held at 31 December 2015 were purchased during the year at a cost of £9.7 million (2014: £1.7 million). The market value of the shares 
at 31 December 2015 was £7.2 million (2014:£1.8 million) representing 0.25% of the issued share capital of the Company (2014: 0.04%). 
During the Group’s share buyback programme, 1.5 million of the shares purchased in 2015 were not cancelled but retained as treasury 
shares. Of these, 1.1 million were used to satisfy share options and awards under the UK Share Incentive Plan and Sharesave Scheme. 
At 31 December 2015, 0.4 million shares remained in treasury with a market value of £1.3 million, representing 0.05% of the issued share 
capital of the Company.

Other financial commitments
The Group enters into long-term arrangements with aircraft and original equipment manufacturers to design, develop and supply products to 
them for the life of the aircraft. This represents a significant long-term financial commitment for the Group and requires the consideration of 
a number of uncertainties including the feasibility of the product and the ultimate commercial viability over a period which can extend over 
40 years. The directors are satisfied that, at this time, there are no significant contingent liabilities arising from these commitments. Based on 
latest OE delivery forecasts from external agencies, the future estimated expenditure under contractual commitments to incur development costs 
and programme participation costs at 31 December 2015, which are expected to be recognised as intangible assets when incurred are as follows:

The Company has given guarantees in respect of credit facilities for certain of its subsidiaries, some property leases, other leasing arrangements 
and the performance by some current and former subsidiaries of certain contracts. Also, there are similar guarantees given by certain other 
Group companies. The directors do not believe that the effect of giving these guarantees will have a material adverse effect upon the Group’s 
financial position. 
The Company and various of its subsidiaries are, from time to time, parties to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of 
business. The directors do not anticipate that the outcome of these proceedings, actions and claims, either individually or in aggregate, will have  
a material adverse effect upon the Group’s financial position.  136 MEGGITT PLC          REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015

41. Major non-cash transactions
During 2014, the Company issued 11.6 million shares worth £53.0 million in respect of scrip dividends (see notes 16 and 34). In 2015, the scrip 
dividend plan was replaced by a dividend reinvestment plan which provides an efficient reinvestment option for shareholders without the need 
for new shares to be issued.
42. Business combinations 
On 25 November 2015, the Group acquired the advanced composites businesses of Cobham plc (“Advanced Composites”) for USD 200 million in 
cash, subject to an adjustment for working capital in the business at completion. The acquisition comprised 100% of the voting rights of Cobham 
Advanced Composites Limited and Cobham Composites Products Inc. together with certain assets of Cobham Advanced Electronic Solutions Inc.
Advanced Composites is a global leader in the design, development and production of highly engineered aerospace composite engine components 
(spinners, internal multi-stage components, exhaust flaps), radomes (C4I and defensive measures radomes, with a growing position in civil 
radomes) and complex secondary structures (air-to-air refuelling, structural munitions components). It has operating facilities located in the 
UK and United States. Advanced Composites is being integrated into the Meggitt Polymers & Composites division.
On 21 December 2015, the Group acquired 100% of the voting rights in EDAC Composites LLC (“EDAC”), the owner and operator of the former 
EDAC composites business, formerly known as Parkway Aerospace & Defense, from Greenbriar Equity Group and other associated sellers for 
USD 340 million in cash, subject to an adjustment for working capital in the business at completion. 
EDAC produces highly engineered aerospace components for jet engine and airframe applications, with over 85% of revenues in civil aerospace 
composites. It has a substantial presence, via multi-year long-term agreements, on high-growth jet engine platforms including the GEnX, Pratt 
& Whitney PurePower family and LEAP engines. It has operating facilities in the USA and Mexico. EDAC is being integrated into the Meggitt 
Polymers & Composites division.

Due to the proximity of the acquisitions of Advanced Composites and EDAC to the balance sheet date, the difference between the book value of 
acquired net assets and consideration payable has been provisionally recognised as goodwill. During 2016, the Group will determine the fair value 
of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed, with any corresponding adjustment necessary being made to 
the value of goodwill recognised.  138 MEGGITT PLC          REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015

For the period from acquisition to 31 December 2015, Advanced Composites contributed revenue of £7.1 million, an underlying profit before tax 
of £0.4 million and a profit before tax of £0.2 million. The pro forma consolidated results of the Group, had Advanced Composites been acquired 
on 1 January 2015, would show an increase in revenue of £46.7 million and a reduction in profit before tax of £3.0 million.
Due to the timing of the acquisition of EDAC, the impact on the results of the Group for the year is not significant. The pro forma consolidated 
results of the Group, had EDAC been acquired on 1 January 2015, would show an increase in revenue of £69.4 million and a reduction in profit 
before tax of £0.7 million.
Pro forma information above has not been adjusted to reflect the Group’s accounting policies (due to the proximity of the acquisitions to the 
balance sheet date), to eliminate any costs that are not expected to recur, to adjust for any item that the Group would exclude from its underlying 
profit measures or to reflect any synergies arising from the acquisitions. It includes however, acquisition related expenses incurred by the Group 
of £3.9 million (see note 10) and finance costs that would have been payable in respect of borrowings incurred to finance the acquisitions had they 
completed on 1 January 2015. The information therefore is for illustrative purposes only and is not indicative of the results of the Group, had the 
acquisitions been made on 1 January 2015. 
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE REPORTS STRATEGIC REPORT 139
43. Restatement of prior year comparatives
IFRS 3 requires fair values of assets and liabilities acquired to be finalised within 12 months of the acquisition date. All fair value adjustments 
are required to be recorded with effect from the date of acquisition and consequently result in the restatement of previously reported financial 
results. During 2015, the Group finalised the fair values of PECC which completed on 31 December 2014 and this resulted in adjustments 
to the balance sheet at that date. These amendments primarily relate to the recognition of intangible assets separately from goodwill and 
associated deferred tax liabilities. Goodwill is attributable to the profitability of the acquired business and expected future synergies arising 
following the acquisition.
The impact of the restatements is shown below:

Adequacy of accounting records and information and 
explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to 
you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have 
not been received from branches not visited by us; or
• the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ 
remuneration report to be audited are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Directors’ remuneration
Directors’ remuneration report - Companies Act 2006 opinion
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 2006.
Other Companies Act 2006 reporting
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report 
to you if, in our opinion, certain disclosures of directors’ 
remuneration specified by law are not made. We have no 
exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
Responsibilities for the financial statements 
and  the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the directors
As explained more fully in the Statement of directors 
responsibilities set out on pages 83 to 84, the directors are 
responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and 
for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
ISAs (UK & Ireland). Those standards require us to comply 
with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for 
Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for 
and only for the parent company’s members as a body in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these 
opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other 
purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown 
or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed 
by our prior consent in writing.
Report on the company financial statements
Our opinion
In our opinion, Meggitt PLC’s parent company financial 
statements (the “financial statements”):
• give a true and fair view of the state of the parent company’s 
affairs as at 31 December 2015;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements 
of the Companies Act 2006.
What we have audited
The financial statements, included within the Annual Report, 
comprise:
• the Company balance sheet as at 31 December 2015;
• the Company statement of changes in equity; and
• the notes to the financial statements, which include 
a summary of significant accounting policies and other 
explanatory information.
Certain required disclosures have been presented elsewhere 
in the Annual Report, rather than in the notes to the financial 
statements. These are cross-referenced from the financial 
statements and are identified as audited.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in 
the preparation of the financial statements is United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101: “Reduced 
Disclosure Framework”, and applicable law (United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Other required reporting
Consistency of other information
Companies Act 2006 opinion
In our opinion, the information given in the Strategic report 
and the Directors’ report for the financial year for which 
the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the 
financial statements.
ISAs (UK & Ireland) reporting
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) 
(“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”) we are required to report to you if, in 
our opinion, information in the Annual Report is:
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited 
financial statements; or
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, our knowledge of the parent company 
acquired in the course of performing our audit; or
• otherwise misleading.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this 
responsibility.
Independent auditors’ report to the  
members of Meggitt PLC SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE REPORTS STRATEGIC REPORT 143
What an audit of financial statements involves
We conducted our audit in accordance with ISAs (UK & 
Ireland). An audit involves obtaining evidence about the 
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient 
to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are 
free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or 
error. This includes an assessment of: 
• whether the accounting policies are appropriate to 
the parent company’s circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed; 
• the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates 
made by the directors; and 
• the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the 
directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming 
our own judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the 
financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other 
auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary 
to provide a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. 
We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness 
of controls, substantive procedures or a combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial 
information in the Annual Report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to 
identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect 
based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge 
acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we 
become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Group financial 
statements of Meggitt PLC for the year ended 
31 December 2015.

Company statement of changes in equity
As at 31 December 2015 146 MEGGITT PLC          REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015
Operating leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of 
ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating 
leases. Payments made under operating leases, net of any incentives 
received from the lessor, are charged to the income statement on 
a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Taxation
Tax payable is based on taxable profit for the period, calculated using 
tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is provided in full using the liability method on temporary 
differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their 
corresponding book values as recorded in the Company’s financial 
statements. Deferred tax is provided on unremitted earnings of foreign 
subsidiaries, except where the Company can control the remittance 
and it is probable that earnings will not be remitted in the foreseeable 
future. Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent it is 
probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible 
temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred tax is calculated using 
tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Current tax and deferred tax are recognised ion the income statement, 
other comprehensive income or directly in equity depending on where 
the item to which they relate has been recognised.
Foreign currencies
The Company’s financial statements are presented in pounds sterling. 
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at exchange rates 
prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and 
liabilities, denominated in foreign currencies are reported at exchange 
rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences on 
retranslating monetary assets and liabilities are recognised in the 
income statement, except where they relate to qualifying cash flow 
hedges in which case the exchange differences are recognised in other 
comprehensive income. 
Retirement benefit schemes
For defined benefit schemes, pension costs are charged to the income 
statement in accordance with the advice of qualified independent 
actuaries.
Past service credits and costs are recognised immediately in the 
income statement.
Retirement benefit obligations represent, for each scheme, the 
difference between the fair value of the schemes’ assets and the 
present value of the schemes’ defined benefit obligations measured at 
the balance sheet date. The defined benefit obligation is calculated 
annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit 
method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is 
determined by discounting the defined benefit obligations using 
interest rates of high quality corporate bonds denominated in the 
currency in which the benefits will be paid and with terms to maturity 
comparable with the terms of the related defined benefit obligations. 
Where the Company has a statutory or contractual minimum funding 
requirement to make contributions to a scheme in respect of past 
service and any such contributions are not available to the Company 
once paid (either as a reduction in future contributions or as a refund 
during the life of the scheme or when the scheme liabilities are settled, 
to which the Company has an unconditional right), an additional liability 
for such amounts is recognised.
Remeasurement gains and losses are recognised in the period in 
which they arise in other comprehensive income.
For defined contribution schemes, payments are recognised in the 
income statement when they fall due. The Company has no further 
obligations once the contributions have been paid.
1. Basis of preparation
The Company transitioned from UK GAAP to Financial Reporting 
Standard 101’ Reduced Disclosure Framework’ (FRS 101) for all 
periods presented. Transition reconciliations showing all material 
adjustments are disclosed in note 15. These financial statements have 
been prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost 
accounting convention, as modified by the revaluation of certain 
financial assets and financial liabilities (including derivative financial 
instruments) at fair value, in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
The Company has taken advantage of the legal dispensation contained 
in Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 allowing it not to publish 
a separate income statement and related notes. The Company has also 
taken advantage of the legal dispensation contained in Section 408 of 
the Companies Act 2006 allowing it not to publish a separate statement 
of other comprehensive income.
The following exemptions from the requirements of IFRS have been 
applied in the preparation of these financial statements, in accordance 
with FRS 101:
• Paragraphs 45(b) and 46-52 of IFRS 2, ‘Share-based payment’ 
• IFRS 7, ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ 
• Paragraphs 10(d), 10(f) and 134-136 of IAS 1 ‘Presentation of   
 financial statements 
• IAS 7, ‘Statement of cash flows’ 
• Paragraphs 30 and 31 of IAS 8 ‘Accounting policies, changes in  
 accounting estimates and errors’ 
• Paragraph 17 of IAS 24, ‘Related party disclosures’ 
• The requirements in IAS 24, ‘Related party disclosures’ to disclose 
 related party transactions entered into between two or more  
 members of a group
2. Summary of significant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies adopted by the Company in the 
preparation of the financial statements are set out below. These 
policies have been applied consistently to all periods presented unless 
stated otherwise.
Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less provision for 
impairment in value, except for investments acquired before 
1 January 1988 where Section 612 merger relief has been taken and 
investments are stated at the nominal value of the shares issued in 
consideration using the deemed cost exemption in IFRS 1 on transition 
to FRS 101.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets, consisting of software are recorded at cost less 
accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Amortisation is 
charged on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic 
life, typically over periods up to 10 years.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses. Cost includes expenditure 
directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. Depreciation is 
calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of 
the assets as follows:
Leasehold property ..................................... O ver per iod of lease
Plant and equipment ................................... 3 to 10 years
Motor vehicles.............................................. 5 years
Notes to the financial statements of the Company SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE REPORTS STRATEGIC REPORT 147
If the forecast transaction to which the cash flow hedge relates is no 
longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss previously 
recognised in other comprehensive income is transferred to the 
income statement immediately. If the hedging instrument is sold, 
expires or no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting the 
cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive 
income is transferred to the income statement when the forecast 
transaction is recognised in the income statement.
Derivatives not meeting the criteria for hedge accounting 
Where derivatives do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting, 
changes in fair value are recognised immediately in the income 
statement. The Company utilises a large number of foreign currency 
forward contracts to mitigate against currency fluctuations. The 
Company has determined that the additional costs of meeting the 
extensive documentation requirements in order to apply hedge 
accounting are not merited. Additionally, in 2015 the Company has 
entered a cross currency derivative and a treasury lock derivative (as 
described in note 30 to the Group consolidated financial statements on 
page 125) which do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting.
Borrowings
Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, being proceeds 
received less directly attributable transaction costs incurred. 
Borrowings are generally subsequently measured at amortised cost 
with any transaction costs amortised to the income statement over the 
period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. Certain 
borrowings however are designated as fair value through profit and 
loss at inception, if the Company has interest rate derivatives in place 
which have the economic effect of converting fixed rate borrowings into 
floating rate borrowings. Such borrowings are measured at fair value 
at each balance sheet date with any movement in fair value recorded in 
the income statement. 
Any related interest accruals are included within borrowings. 
Borrowings are classified as creditors falling due within one year 
unless the Company has an unconditional right to defer settlement of 
the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Share capital 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly 
attributable to the issue of new shares are deducted from the proceeds 
recorded in equity. 
Own shares represent shares in the Company that are held by an 
independently managed Employee Share Ownership Trust. 
Consideration paid for own shares, including any incremental directly 
attributable costs, is recorded as a deduction from retained earnings.
Dividends
Interim dividends are recognised when they are approved by the Board. 
Final dividends are recognised when they are approved by the 
shareholders. Details of the dividends paid and proposed by the 
Company are disclosed in note 16 to the Group consolidated financial 
statements on page 113.
Share buyback
The total consideration payable for shares purchased is deducted from 
retained earnings. The shares when purchased are generally 
cancelled, unless they are to be used to satisfy obligations under 
employee share plans. The nominal value of cancelled shares is 
transferred from share capital to a separate capital redemption 
reserve. Where the Company has entered into an irrevocable 
non-discretionary contract to purchase for cancellation, shares on its 
behalf during a close period, the obligation to purchase shares is 
recognised in full at the inception of the contract, even when that 
obligation is conditional on the share price. The obligation is 
remeasured at each balance sheet date with changes recognised in the 
income statement.
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Share-based compensation
Awards made to employees of the Company are equity-settled. The fair 
value of an award is measured at the date of grant and reflects any 
market-based vesting conditions. Non market-based vesting 
conditions are excluded from the fair value of the award. At the date of 
grant, the Company estimates the number of awards expected to vest 
as a result of non market-based vesting conditions and the fair value of 
this estimated number of awards is recognised as an expense in the 
income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. At 
each balance sheet date, the Company revises its estimate of the 
number of awards expected to vest as a result of non market-based 
vesting conditions and adjusts the amount recognised cumulatively in 
the income statement to reflect the revised estimate. When awards are 
exercised and the Company issues new shares, the proceeds received, 
net of any directly attributable transaction costs, are credited to share 
capital (nominal value) and share premium.
The grant by the Company of options over its equity instruments to 
employees of subsidiary undertakings, is treated as a capital 
contribution. The fair value of the awards made is recognised, over the 
vesting period, as an increase in investment in subsidiary 
undertakings, with a corresponding credit to retained earnings.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on 
the date the derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently 
remeasured at fair value at each balance sheet date using values 
determined indirectly from quoted prices that are observable for the 
asset or liability. 
The method by which any gain or loss arising from remeasurement, is 
recognised depends on whether the instrument is designated as 
a hedging instrument and if so the nature of the item hedged. The 
Company recognises an instrument as a hedging instrument by 
documenting, at inception of the instrument, the relationship between 
the instrument and the hedged item and the objectives and strategy for 
undertaking the hedging transaction. To be designated as a hedging 
instrument, an instrument must also be assessed, at inception and on 
an ongoing basis, to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair 
values or cash flows of hedged items.
To the extent the maturity of the financial instrument is more than 12 
months from the balance sheet date, the fair value is reported as 
a non-current asset or creditor falling due after more than one year. All 
other derivative financial instruments are reported as current assets 
or creditors falling due within one year. 
Fair value hedges
Changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments, that are 
designated and qualify as fair value hedges, are recognised in the 
income statement together with changes in the fair value of the hedged 
item. The Company currently only applies fair value hedge accounting 
to the hedging of fixed interest rate risk on borrowings.
Cash flow hedges
Changes in fair value of the effective portion of derivative financial 
instruments, that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, are 
initially recorded in other comprehensive income. Changes in fair value 
of any ineffective portion are recognised immediately in the income 
statement. To the extent changes in fair value are recognised in other 
comprehensive income,they are recycled to the income statement in 
the periods in which the hedged item affects the income statement. 
The Company currently only applies cash flow hedge accounting to the 
hedging of floating interest rate risk on borrowings.  148 MEGGITT PLC          REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015

The Company has unrecognised tax losses of £7.3 million (2014: £7.3 million) for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised. Deferred tax 
assets have not been recognised in respect of these losses, as it is not regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered. Deferred tax 
assets not recognised, would be recoverable in the event they reverse and suitable taxable profits are available. There are no unremitted earnings 
in foreign subsidiaries that would give rise to a tax liability in the event of those subsidiaries remitting their earnings.
11. Retirement benefit obligations
The Company is the sponsoring employer of the Meggitt Pension Plan, a funded defined benefit plan. Each participating company in the Meggitt 
Pension Plan bears employer contributions in respect of future service. No other amounts are recharged by the Company to any other 
participating employer. The Company has recognised the total deficit on the Meggitt Pension Plan in its financial statements. The directors believe 
the FRS 101 deficit for the plan would be consistent with the IAS 19 deficit reported in note 33 to the Group consolidated financial statements on 
pages 128 to 132 in respect of the UK scheme. 
The total charge to net operating expenses in respect of the defined contribution scheme in which employees of the Company participate was 
£1.0 million (2014: £0.7 million). At 31 December 2015, an amount of £0.1 million (2014: £0.1 million) relating to contributions payable in respect 
of the scheme were outstanding.

*   Present value of scheme liabilities.

The liability recognised in respect of the plan is dependent on a number of estimates including those relating to mortality, inflation, salary 
inflation and the rate at which liabilities are discounted. External actuarial advice is taken with regard to the most appropriate assumptions 
to use. Details on the sensitivity of scheme liabilities to changes in assumptions are provided below:
•  The impact of a 10 basis point reduction in discount rate would cause scheme liabilities at 31 December 2015 to increase by approximately  
£12.4 million;
•  The impact of a 10 basis point increase in inflation and salary inflation rates would cause scheme liabilities at 31 December 2015 to increase 
by approximately £11.6 million;
•  The impact of assuming every scheme member were to live for an additional year would cause scheme liabilities at 31 December 2015 
to increase by approximately £18.8 million.
The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in a single assumption while keeping all other assumptions constant. In practice, this 
is unlikely to occur, and changes in some assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation 
to significant actuarial assumptions, the same method of calculating the defined benefit obligation has been used as when calculating the 
retirement benefit obligations recognised in the balance sheet. The methods and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity 
analysis are consistent with the previous year. 
The weighted average duration of the UK scheme defined benefit obligation is 19.3 years.  154 MEGGITT PLC          REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015

15. Transition to FRS 101
For all periods up to and including the year ended 31 December 2014, the Company prepared its financial statements in accordance with 
the previously extant United Kingdom generally accepted accounting practice (UK GAAP). These financial statements, for the year ended 
31 December 2015, are the first the Company has prepared in accordance with FRS 101. Accordingly, the Company has prepared individual 
financial statements which comply with FRS 101 applicable for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014 and the significant accounting 
policies meeting those requirements are described in the relevant notes.
In preparing these financial statements, the Company has started from an opening balance sheet as at 1 January 2014, the Company’s date of 
transition to FRS 101, and made those changes in accounting policies and other restatements required for the first-time adoption of FRS 101. 
As such, this note explains the principal adjustments made by the Company in restating its balance sheet at 1 January 2014 prepared under 
previously extant UK GAAP and its previously published UK GAAP financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2014.
On transition to FRS 101, the Company has applied the requirements of paragraphs 6-33 of IFRS 1 ‘First time adoption of International 
Financial Reporting Standards’.

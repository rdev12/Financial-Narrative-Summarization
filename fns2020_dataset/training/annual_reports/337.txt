Chairman’s Statement
Having only recently been appointed as 
the Chairman of Advanced Medical 
Solutions Group plc, I am delighted to 
report that 2013 was another good year 
of growth for the Group and that the 
progress that was reported in the Interim 
Statement has continued. We are 
pleased to report a 13% increase in 
revenue to £59.5 million (2012: £52.6 
million), representing growth of 11% on a 
constant currency basis, and an increase 
in adjusted
1
 profit before tax of 12% to 
£13.5 million (2012: £12.1 million).
The Group ended the year with net cash 
of £5.3 million (2012: net debt £5.5 
million), with the €25 million of debt 
taken on by the Group in December 2011 
to finance the acquisition of RESORBA® 
having been fully repaid within 2 years.
Our brands continue to perform well and 
good progress has been made against 
the Group’s vision and strategy.
Operationally, we continue to generate 
efficiencies and have delivered a further 
improvement in gross margin across the 
Group from streamlining processes as 
well as working with partners to improve 
our service and supply.
The Group is in the enviable position of 
having several significant opportunities 
from its existing products and 
geographic markets as well as from the 
new developments it is currently working 
on. In addition to this, our balance sheet 
strength enables us to consider further 
acquisitions should they be in line with 
the Group’s vision and strategy and meet 
our required financial metrics.
Dividend
We are proposing a final dividend of 
0.41p per share, making a total dividend 
for the year of 0.60p per share, a 15.4% 
increase compared with prior year. If 
approved at the Annual General Meeting 
on 20 May 2014, this will be paid on 28 
May 2014 to shareholders on the register 
at the close of business on 2 May 2014.
Board Changes
Peter Steinmann was appointed as 
Non-Executive Director on 1 July 2013. 
His extensive knowledge of the global 
medical devices market and commercial 
experience will assist the Group with its 
market expansion strategy. Don Evans 
retired from the Board and as Chairman 
of the Group on 31 December 2013.  
All our thanks go to Don who has 
contributed so much to the growth and 
success of AMS over the last 17 years.  
I joined the Board as Non-Executive 
Director on 4 December 2013 and 
became Chairman on 1 January 2014, 
following Don’s retirement. I look forward 
to leading the Group to achieve its 
strategy and meet its objectives in  
the next stage of its development.
People
Finally, on behalf of the Board, I would 
like to thank all our employees, 
customers, suppliers, business partners 
and shareholders for their continued 
support over the last year.

Strategic Report
Business model
The Group is primarily involved in the 
design, development, manufacture and 
distribution of novel, high performance 
materials for use in advanced 
woundcare products and surgical 
dressings as well as medical adhesives 
and sutures for closing and sealing 
wounds. The Group distributes its 
products to the global device market  
by selling to healthcare companies and 
distributors as well as selling directly 
into the hospital and dental markets in 
Germany, Czech Republic, Russia and 
to the NHS in the UK. 
The Group’s strategy is to:
• innovate, design and develop market 
leading products
• leverage our existing routes, as well 
as, accessing new routes to market
• grow both our OEM partner 
business and our own brands
• not be over-reliant on any one 
partner or market
• drive operational efficiency 
improvements and eliminate 
non-value added activities
• make selective acquisitions that 
provide commercial and 
technological synergies
The Group operates through four 
Business Units: Branded Direct, Branded 
Distributed, OEM, and Bulk which are 
each responsible for their respective 
sales, marketing and Research & 
Development (R&D) activities, and focus 
on a strategic route to market. The 
Business Units are supported by 
Operations, Regulatory and Quality, HR, 
Finance, Legal and IT which are Group 
functions. There are harmonised policies, 
processes and procedures, across  
the Group.
This business structure provides clarity 
on accountability and responsibility and 
clear lines for decision making that will 
support the growth of the Group. 
While each of the Business Units have 
objectives and risks specific to that 
business unit, there are some risks that 
are common throughout the Group.
Principal risks and uncertainties
for the Group 
Global economic conditions
The general economic conditions in a 
number of geographies, including the UK 
and Europe, are such that governments 
are looking to reduce spend on public 
services, including spend on health care, 
while other governments, such as in the 
US, are raising taxes from medical device 
companies to help pay for the services 
they are providing. Both of these actions 
have the potential to reduce demand. 
However, with ageing populations 
suffering from health problems such  
as obesity and diabetes, the incidence  
of chronic wounds which are treated  
with advanced woundcare products 
continues to increase. Both the 
developed world and developing 
economies are experiencing increasing 
demand for surgery to treat health 
problems which increases the need  
for wound closure products. Overall, 
demographics are beneficial for the 
Group. The Group has a widespread 
geographical market coverage and a 
diverse customer base which helps to 
minimise the impact of any single one 
adverse event in any region or with any 
one customer.
Pricing pressures and commoditisation 
of products
There are pricing pressure risks and 
continued competition from other 
products. The Group tries to provide 
differentiated products which are 
patented whenever possible as well  
as providing a complete service to its 
customers to mitigate this risk. 
Due to the nature of the products  
sold, the Group isn’t exposed to the 
‘patent cliff’ being seen across the 
pharmaceutical industry.
Regulatory risk
The Group is subject to various 
regulatory requirements. With 
regulations becoming increasingly 
stringent there is always an element of 
compliance risk. Failure to achieve 
regulatory approval could result in the 
inability of the Group to supply goods 
into a market. To mitigate this risk the 
Group has a stringent compliance regime 
in place, is regularly audited by BSI 
(British Standards Institution) and TUV 
(Technischer Überwachungsverein) as 
well as other country regulatory bodies 
and has strengthened its regulatory 
management team.
Product quality risk
The Group operates in highly regulated 
markets with strict quality requirements. 
Any quality failure involving the Group’s 
products could lead to the loss of 
reputation, loss of revenues, the loss  
of a customer, recall costs as well as 
sanctions from a regulator. To mitigate 
this, the Group operates within a strictly 
controlled Quality Management System 
and has strengthened its Quality 
management team. 
Development risk
The Group continues to invest in R&D to 
develop its next generation of products. 
Not all research leads to successful new 
products but the Group believes that  
by monitoring progress against key 
milestones it avoids excessive 
expenditure on projects that do not 
deliver a viable product. 
There is also a risk that the Group will not 
identify a new technology or opportunity 
before its competitors and will miss an 
opportunity to gain competitive 
advantage. The Business Unit structure 
now in place will provide more focus on 
the market reducing the risk of missed 
opportunities.
Finance risk
The Group is subject to various financial 
risks and the following are considered 
the most significant. Currently the Group 
has no borrowings, so does not consider 
liquidity or interest rates to be a 
significant risk. 
Currency
The Group’s main currency exposure is  
to the US dollar and to the Euro. The 
Group’s policy is to hedge significant 
transaction exposure by using forward 
contracts and options. The Group aims  
to have 70% of its estimated 
transactional exposure for the next 
twelve months hedged. Its currency 
exposure is reviewed regularly.
In 2013, 16% of the Group’s sales were in 
US dollars and 37% of its sales were in 
Euros. If in 2013, the average US dollar 
rate had depreciated against Sterling by 
10%, there would have been a £1.0 million 
(2012: £0.7 million) adverse impact on 
revenue and the gross margin and profit 
would have been reduced by 60bps 
(2012: 60bps).
In 2013, if the average Euro rate had 
depreciated against Sterling by 10%,  
there would have been a £2.2 million 
(2012: £2.0 million) adverse impact on 
revenue and the gross margin and profit 
would have been reduced by an average 
of 10bps (2012: 70bps).
Credit risk
The Group assesses the risk of 
contracting with each customer and  
sets credit limits which are carefully 
monitored. If a significant risk is 
identified, credit facilities are withdrawn 
and transactions are carried out on a 
cash basis. If a key partner was 
significantly affected by a difficult 
trading environment, this would have a 
short-term impact on the Group.
Cost pressures
The Group estimates that if material 
prices had increased by a further 5%  
in 2013 and the Group had been unable 
to pass the increase on, there would have  
been a negative impact of £0.6 million  
(2012: £0.6 million) to the cost and the 
gross margin would have reduced by 
100bps (2012: 100bps). 4   |   Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc  Annual Report 2013

BRANDED  
DIRECT 
The Branded Direct Business Unit is responsible for driving sales 
of our own brands: ActivHeal®, LiquiBand® and RESORBA® to end 
users in the UK, Germany and Czech Republic where the Group 
has its own sales teams. This Business Unit is also responsible for 
directing R&D for sutures and collagens which comprise the 
major part of this Business Unit’s revenues.
ActivHeal® is the Group’s brand of advanced woundcare 
dressings that it sells into the NHS in the UK. The proposition of 
this brand is that it provides a range of ‘good value’, generic 
advanced woundcare dressings that deliver cost savings to the 
NHS without compromising on clinical outcomes or patient care. 
The ActivHeal® range is supported by a dedicated team of 
experienced healthcare professionals and by online education 
modules that provide training on the treatment of wounds. With 
the NHS continuing to operate under budgetary constraints 
ActivHeal® provides a good growth opportunity for the Group. 
The LiquiBand® range of medical adhesives and sealants, based 
on cyanoacrylate, are used to close and protect wounds in a safe 
and secure way. In the UK, LiquiBand® is well recognised in the 
majority of Accident & Emergency (A&E) units where its high 
strength attribute make it the product of first choice for closing 
trauma wounds. 
RESORBA®s suture range includes several brands such as 
CAPROLON®, GLYCOLON®, MOPYLEN® and RESOPREN® that 
are sold into hospitals, private practices and to oral surgeons. 
RESORBA®s haemostat range includes KOLLAGEN-resorb and 
GENTA-COLL -resorb. The latter is a very pure collagen that 
includes the antibiotic gentamicin for use in wounds where there 
is a high risk of infection. Combining the suture and collagen 
technologies, RESORBA® has developed products and brands 
that are particularly applicable to the oral surgery market eg 
PARASORB® Sombrero® is a collagen cone used for dental 
implants. 
The new UK Surgical sales team are now targeting the Operating 
Room (OR) opportunity with both LiquiBand® and the 
RESORBA® range of products while the German sales team 
continue to sell LiquiBand® alongside the RESORBA® range of 
sutures and haemostats.

sutures and collagens with 
LiquiBand® products
• developing the collagen range  
eg adding new antibiotics and 
developing stronger collagens
Risk Description Mitigating Actions
Market share growth There is the risk that gaining market share 
takes longer than expected or that the 
cost of accessing the market is more than 
originally budgeted
• regular reviews of progress against 
plan are taken and corrective action 
is taken, if necessary
Product launch There is the risk that the sales of a new 
product are slower than expected
• regular review of progress is made 
and corrective action taken, if 
necessary
• feedback from users and key opinion 
leaders is sought and acted on
• clinical papers and data supporting 
product are provided 6   |   Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc  Annual Report 2013
BRANDED  
DISTRIBUTED 
The Branded Distributed Business Unit is responsible for 
driving sales of our LiquiBand® and RESORBA® brands to 
all markets where the Group does not have its own sales 
teams and sales are made through distributors. This 
Business Unit also includes all sales made by our Russian 
subsidiary which are made both by the direct sales team in 
Moscow and by the distributor network that the Moscow 
sales team supports throughout the rest of Russia. This 
Business Unit is responsible for directing R&D for all of our 
medical adhesives and sealants. 
The Group works with distributors world-wide, accessing 
over 60 countries.
The largest market for tissue adhesives is the US and this 
is the most significant opportunity for LiquiBand®. 
Approval to sell LiquiBand® in the US was obtained in 
2010. The Group is currently working to obtain approval  
to sell RESORBA® sutures in the US.

Strategy
The strategy of this Business Unit is to increase sales of the Group’s brands in all markets where the Group does not have a sales 
force by:
Risk Description Mitigating Actions
Developing new markets through 
partners and distributors is not 
successful
There is the risk that the Business Unit’s 
partners and distributors are not 
successful in developing new markets 
because the partner or distributor has 
underestimated the difficulty of 
accessing the market or the opportunity 
ceases to be a priority to them 
• contracts have agreed set minimas 
which allow terms to be renegotiated 
or agreements terminated
Regulatory approval is not achieved There is a risk that the launch of 
products is delayed due to lack of 
regulatory approval in new markets 
outside EU and the US
• the Group has an experienced 
Regulatory team and works with 
partners and distributors where they 
have local expertise. In general, 
regulatory approval is taking longer 
to achieve and is becoming more 
complicated
• the Group’s diversified approach with 
markets and products reduces the 
impact of any one project causing 
substantial risk to the business
Foreign exchange risk reduces 
profitability
This Business Unit has most exposure to 
foreign exchange risk through the US 
dollar and potentially to the currencies 
of new export markets
• the Group hedges significant 
transaction exposure by using 
forward contracts and options and 
aims to have 70% of its estimated 
transactional exposure for the next 
twelve months hedged
Increasing the market share of 
LiquiBand® in the US: 
• partner with key distributors that 
access the US hospital and alternative 
site (non-hospital) segments
• provide new products
• help train and provide account support
Maximising opportunities across Europe, 
Middle East, Asia and South America: 
• leverage the combined existing 
distributor network for LiquiBand®  
and RESORBA®
Accessing new markets:
• gain regulatory approval for 
LiquiBand® in China
• gain regulatory approval for 
RESORBA® sutures in the US
• identify new market opportunities

• internal application of cyanoacrylate for 
the fixation of hernia meshes in the EU

OEM
The OEM Business Unit is responsible for supporting  
our business-to-business partners with a multi-product 
portfolio that is globally competitive, backed by 
intellectual property and know-how. In addition to 
providing innovative products, a key differential from  
our competitors is that a full service is provided which 
includes design, development, manufacture and 
distribution of products supported by regulatory 
capabilities as well as clinical evidence and  
marketing support. 
AMS works with many of the world’s leading healthcare 
companies, supplying them with finished packed 
products. 
Our technologies include foams, fibres, collagens, 
hydrogels and hydrocolloids. In particular, silver alginate is 
a key growth driver for this Business Unit and we support 
our partners to access new markets and gain market 
share.
This Business Unit is responsible for directing R&D for 
advanced woundcare products and technologies.

Strategy
The strategy of this Business Unit is to support the Group’s partners to be successful with the products we supply and to 
increase their market share in our areas of technical expertise. This is the Group’s largest Business Unit.  
Its strategy is to:
Risk Description Mitigating Factors
Industry consolidation and reliance on 
key customers
The healthcare sector continues to 
experience considerable business 
consolidation. This presents both 
opportunities and risk. There could be a 
loss of business if a partner was an 
acquired party. The loss of a key partner 
would have an adverse impact on this 
Business Unit’s revenues and profit in the 
short term
• minimisation of over reliance on any 
one customer
• all customers have contracts with 
agreed termination clauses 
New products are not successful Lack of success in launching new products 
or identifying a new technology could lead 
to the loss of a partner
• strong links with partners reduce the 
risk of missed opportunities
• R&D progress is monitored against 
the stage gate process to ensure 
projects are progressing to plan and 
action is taken if necessary
Increased global competition reduces 
profitability
There are increasing numbers of contract 
manufacturers across the world which 
may provide a low cost business case for 
partners
• offering a full service including a 
strong regulatory and quality 
assurance together with product 
development and clinical support 
mitigates a pure cost of supply 
proposition
Foster increasingly strong partner 
relationships with existing customers  
by:
• key account management
• reliability of service and quality
• expansion of product portfolio
• regulatory support for expansion  
into new markets 
Secure new partners through: 
• reputation for quality, customer  
service and regulatory capability
Develop new products including:
• launch of antimicrobial foam in  
H1 2014
• development of foam dressings  
eg atraumatic dressings in 2014
• expansion of fibre range This Business Unit is responsible for providing bulk 
materials, both foam and fibre, to third party convertors 
and partners that have their own converting capability. It 
is also responsible for supplying bulk materials within the 
Group.

• Developing long-term relationships 
with partners and distributors based 
on a full service of quality and supply
• Develop more cost effective 
processes
• Provide innovative formulations of 
foam and fibre with unique capabilities

in Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) and identifying 
plant and equipment constraints before they are business 
critical. Lean manufacturing regimes are in place on all sites 
and continue to be extended to improve operational 
performance 
• Quality: All manufacturing sites are compliant to ISO 13485 
and use validated processes and process control techniques 
to ensure that the Group has an effective management 
system in place. The quality team has been strengthened 
and training extended across the Group. In 2013 the Group’s 
manufacturing sites were audited on several occasions by 
many different legislative bodies and found to be compliant 
• Regulatory: To grow the business new products need 
regulatory approval and new territories require product 
registration. AMS successfully achieved new product 
approvals in the US and EU as well as extending regulatory 
registrations to new markets such as Russia and China 
amongst others. AMS works with its distributors and OEM 
partners to meet local regulatory requirements. The 
Regulatory team has been strengthened to meet increasing 
regulatory requirements Strategic Report (continued)

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S 
STATEMENT
Chris Meredith
Chief Executive Officer
I am pleased to report that AMS has 
delivered another year of strong growth 
and that we are seeing the first year of 
benefit from the reorganisation of  
the Group into Business Units.
Branded Direct
The Branded Direct Business Unit’s 
revenues grew 14% to £22.9 million (2012: 
£20.1 million) and 11% at constant currency. 
This Business Unit’s key growth drivers are 
our three brands of ActivHeal®, LiquiBand® 
and RESORBA®.
Sales of our ActivHeal® dressings into the 
NHS grew 32% to £5.5 million (2012: £4.2 
million) as a result of the continued support 
to our brand and the free-of-charge training 
and education of NHS staff from our clinical 
nurse team. The product range continues to 
be enhanced with the regular launch of 
foam and fibre dressings developed by our 
own Research & Development (R&D) group 
and we continue to target new hospitals as 
well as improve compliance in existing 
accounts. With a market share of only 5%, 
we still have considerable opportunities  
and expect double-digit growth to continue 
in 2014.
UK LiquiBand® sales into the Accident 
and Emergency Room (A&E) grew 5% to 
£2.5 million (2012: £2.4 million) and sales 
of LiquiBand® into the Operating Room 
(OR) increased 175% to £0.4 million 
(2012: £0.2 million), reflecting the early 
success of the new UK surgical sales 
team which is also selling RESORBA® 
haemostats and sutures alongside 
LiquiBand®. We expect to see continued 
success from this team which is expected 
to deliver further growth in the OR in 
2014. LiquiBand® sales in Germany grew 
3% at constant currency to £1.4 million.
German sales including sales of 
RESORBA® branded sutures and 
collagen dressings grew by 8% and by 
3% at constant currency to £13.8 million 
(2012: £13.2 million). Within this, sales of 
haemostats, sutures and dental cones 
performed well, whilst sales of sutures to 
German hospitals declined slightly. 
Although the German hospital suture 
market is very competitive we are 
confident that sales growth is possible 
and with our increased focus on, and 
capability to deal with, Group Purchasing 
Organisations, we expect the hospital 
segment to return to growth in 2014.
This Business Unit’s R&D continues to 
improve the attributes of the Group’s 
haemostats. In particular, we are looking 
to enhance our haemostat range with the 
inclusion of antibiotics to prevent 
infection following surgery, as well as 
developing reinforced collagens that will 
encourage faster regrowth of tissue 
following surgery.
Branded Distributed
Our Branded Distributed Business Unit 
reported revenue growth of 28% at 
constant currency to £8.8 million (2012: 
£6.8 million). The key growth driver is 
LiquiBand® into the US which accounted 
for 34%, or £3.0 million (2012: £1.7 million) 
of the total, up by 78% at constant 
currency over 2012.
Following the disappointment with one 
of our distributors in 2012, our progress in 
the acute care or hospital sector stalled 
in that year. We addressed this issue by 
renegotiating our contract and seeking 
additional product approvals. As a result, 
we have been able to sign further  Our Hernia Mesh Fixation device 
is due to launch in H1 2014.
Company Overview Governance Financial Statements
Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc  Annual Report 2013   |   13
distributorship agreements with other 
partners, broadening our access to the 
market while enhancing our product 
range. We gained FDA clearance in 2013 
for our 2-octyl cyanoacrylate tissue 
adhesive, complementing our existing 
butyl and blended formulations. We are 
already starting to see the benefits of 
these developments and, with our wider 
distribution network and our increased 
portfolio of products, we continue to  
be optimistic about the opportunity in 
the US.
Sales of LiquiBand® through our 
distributors for the EU and the Rest of 
the World also showed good growth, 
increasing to £1.3 million (2012: £0.9 
million), with our distributors in France 
and Italy both performing well. We were 
also pleased to see our first sales into 
South Korea as a consequence of our 
continued geographic expansion 
strategy. Sales of RESORBA® products 
through distributors also made good 
progress increasing to £2.8 million  
(2012: £2.2 million), with export sales to 
France and China doing particularly well.
In Russia, as previously advised, supply  
of product was temporarily disrupted 
earlier in the year due to a requirement to 
re-register all products with the Russian 
regulatory body and this affected the 
overall growth for the year. As a 
consequence, sales grew by 3% to £1.7 
million (2012: £1.6 million) but declined 
2% at constant currency. We do not 
expect a similar challenge in 2014. 
Approval to sell LiquiBand® in Russia  
was granted in September 2013 and  
has resulted in initial sales which we 
anticipate will show steady growth 
throughout 2014. Regulatory approval 
for LiquiBand® in China continues on 
track for a H2 2014 launch. Upon 
approval we intend to launch our 
products through distributors.
Our Hernia Mesh fixation device, which 
will be our first application for the use of 
our medical adhesives inside the body, is 
on plan for a launch in the EU in H1 2014. 
Development time took slightly longer 
than expected after modifications were 
made to one of the mechanical parts in 
the delivery system. This product will be 
sold both by the Group’s direct sales 
teams as well as through a distributor 
network.
In this Business Unit’s R&D, we continue 
to make enhancements to our existing 
range of topical adhesives, including 
improvements to the applicator and to 
extending the range of sizes as well as 
developing ways to improve the in-house 
synthesis of the base monomers.
OEM
This Business Unit delivered 7% growth 
at constant currency in 2013 and had 
revenues of £23.6 million (2012: £22.0 
million).
Our silver alginate products contributed 
52% of the revenue, an increase of 15% at 
constant currency to £12.1 million (2012: 
£10.5 million), and are a key growth driver 
within this unit. Our partners continue to 
grow sales both by accessing new 
markets and by winning market share 
from the market leader which we 
estimate still has over 70% of the 
available market. There is, therefore, still  
a large opportunity for our customers to 
grow further. We continue to support  
our partners by helping them to gain 
regulatory approval for new markets and 
by supporting their marketing campaigns 
with efficacy data.
Sales of our foam-based finished 
dressings increased to £1.8 million (2012: 
£0.9 million), with our new trilaminate 
dressings contributing to this growth. 
The collagen OEM business acquired 
with RESORBA® remained flat year-on-
year, while sales of our older woundcare 
products declined to £7.2 million (2012: 
£8.0 million) as customers and markets 
move to more modern dressings.
We have a strong pipeline of R&D 
projects for wound care applications in 
this Business Unit, and product launches 
for both new anti-microbial dressings 
and atraumatic foam dressings are 
scheduled for H2 2014. Other longer-
term work includes the development  
of a range of post-operative surgical 
dressings.
Bulk Materials
The Bulk Materials Business Unit grew by 
9% at constant currency with revenue of 
£4.2 million (2012: £3.8 million). Foam roll 
stock is the key growth driver in this unit, 
with revenue of £3.3 million (2012: £3.4 
million), 86% of the total. The follow-on 
orders from the pipeline fill in 2011 have 
returned but are not yet at the full 
expected level. Further progress was 
held back by below expectation ordering 
from an existing key customer who 
de-stocked. To mitigate this effect, 
several contracts with new customers 
have been agreed which will support  
a growth in sales in 2014. 14   |   Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc  Annual Report 2013

Operations
Improvements continue throughout the 
business, enabling the Group to meet the 
increased production volumes needed 
for growth without significant capital 
investment being required. We estimate 
that 120bps of gross margin 
improvements were achieved in 2013 
through lean management techniques 
and process improvements. The major 
capital projects in 2014 will be focused 
on delivering further efficiency 
improvements, particularly to our foam 
conversion process.
Our Quality and Regulatory processes 
have been reviewed and our teams 
restructured to ensure that they are 
aligned to give full support to the 
Business Units. Our processes have been 
streamlined and are now operating under 
one Quality Management Standard 
across the Group.
We have also been investing in improving 
our business systems. Following a 
successful launch at our Plymouth site, 
our Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) 
system has been launched in Winsford in 
February 2014 and is expected to launch 
in Etten Leur, Netherlands in Q3 2014. 
The benefits are that we will have 
business systems in place that are more 
robust and suitable for a growing Group, 
aiding decision-making and ensuring that 
information is reported in a consistent 
and timely fashion across the Group.
Outlook
We have significant growth opportunities 
across all our Business Units and are 
continuing to make progress on our 
strategy to be recognised as a leading 
global manufacturer and developer of 
innovative products in the advanced 
woundcare, wound closure and  
surgical markets.
We will continue to invest in growing our 
ActivHeal®, LiquiBand® and RESORBA® 
brands and, with relatively low market 
share, we are confident there are still 
large opportunities available to us.
Our OEM partners remain key to our 
business and we will continue to support 
their efforts with our products, service 
and regulatory know-how.
We are excited by our product pipeline. 
Our Hernia Mesh fixation device is due 
for launch in H1 2014. This will be our first 
product where our medical adhesives will 
be used internally and we believe further 
applications for the use of medical 
adhesives internally will follow. We are 
also enhancing our existing range of 
medical adhesives through 
improvements in applicators and 
developments in our base monomers. 
We expect that our new anti-microbial 
and atraumatic foam dressings will 
provide a significant enhancement to our 
advanced woundcare offering and that 
development of our collagen technology 
will improve our surgical portfolio.
With sound business systems and a 
strong balance sheet, we are in an 
excellent position to make selective 
acquisitions that provide commercial and 
technological synergies for the Group.
With our innovative products, together 
with prospects of capturing increased 
market share in our existing markets and 
our continued support of our OEM 
partners, we are confident that 2014  
will be another year of good growth.

Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc  Annual Report 2013   |   15
FINANCIAL 
REVIEW
Reported revenue increased by 13% to 
£59.5 million (2012: £52.6 million). At 
constant currency (that is re-translating 
the current period’s performance at the 
previous period’s exchange rates), 
revenue growth would have been 11%.
The Group had no exceptional items in 
2013 (2012: £0.8 million). Amortisation  
of acquired intangible assets was  
£0.4 million (2012: £0.5 million).
Comparisons with 2012 are made on a 
pre-exceptional, pre-amortisation of 
acquired intangible asset cost basis as 
we believe that this provides a more 
relevant representation of the Group’s 
trading performance. To aid comparison, 
the Group’s adjusted income statement is 
summarised in Table 1 below.
Across the Group, gross margins 
increased by 310bps to 57.6% (2012: 
54.5%), 190 bps resulting from mix and 
currency and 120 bps from operational 
improvements.
Administration expenses
1
 increased by 
26% to £19.7 million (2012: £15.6 million), 
with investment being made across the 
Group to ensure that the business has 
the infrastructure for future growth. 
Extra costs of £0.5 million were incurred 
in the sales teams in Germany and the 
UK, £0.3 million in Quality and 
Regulatory, and £0.2 million in other 
professional services such as internal 
audit, transfer pricing and tax. Salary and 
bonus costs increased by £1.0 million. 
Administration costs were also inflated 
by £1.0 million due to the forex effect of 
translating overseas subsidiary costs in 
Euros to Sterling as well as the translation 
of outstanding debtor balances at the 
year end.
Total spend on R&D, both expensed  
and capitalised, was £2.8 million  
(2012: £2.8 million). Following a  
review of development, £0.3 million  
of impairments were taken in 2013 
against two projects.

Profit before tax for the period was 
22% higher at £13.1 million (2012: £10.8

The Group’s effective rate of tax for the 
year was 13.5%. This is reflective of the 
utilisation of previously unrecognised 
brought forward tax losses in the UK, 
together with patent box and R&D 
relief. It also reflects the impact of 
blending profits and losses from 
different countries and the different 
tax rates associated with these 
countries.

Earnings (excluding exceptional items and amortisation of 
acquired intangible assets) increased by 6.8% to £11.8 million 
(2012: £11.0 million), resulting in a 5.9% increase in adjusted 
basic earnings per share to 5.72p (2012: 5.40p) and a 6.4% 
increase in diluted adjusted earnings per share to 5.64p  
(2012: 5.30p).
Profit after tax (after exceptional items and amortisation) 
increased by 17.7% to £11.4 million (2012: £9.7 million), resulting 
in a 16.2% increase in basic earnings per share to 5.52p (2012: 
4.75p) and a 17% increase in fully diluted earnings per share to 
5.45p (2012: 4.66p).
The Board is proposing a final dividend of 0.41p per share, to 
be paid on 28 May 2014 to shareholders on the register at the 
close of business on 2 May 2014. This follows the interim 
dividend of 0.19p per share that was paid on 1 October 2013 
and would make a total dividend for the year of 0.60p per 
share (2012: 0.52p), a 15.4% increase on 2012.
The Group generated an adjusted operating cash flow before 
exceptional items of £14.2 million (2012: £13.4 million) (see 
Table 5) and had net cash of £5.3 million (2012: net debt £5.5 
million) at the end of the year.
The operational performance of the Business Units is shown in 
Table 3 below. The adjusted profit from operations and the 
adjusted margin are shown after excluding amortisation of 
acquired intangibles. In determining, and to aid comparison of,

EBITDA increased by 13% to £16.9 million (2012: £15.0 million).
Working capital increased by £2.8 million in the year. Inventory 
increased by £1.5 million to £8.0 million or 4.0 months of 
supply (2012: 3.2 months of supply) in anticipation  
of Q1 2014 sales and to build some additional inventory ahead 
of the change to the new ERP system. Trade and other 
receivables increased by £1.9 million, with trade debtor days  
at 44 (2012: 43) in line with the growth of the business.
The Group generated net cash flow from operating activities 
before exceptional items of £14.2 million (2012: £13.4 million).
We invested £2.0 million in capital equipment, software  
and capitalised R&D in the year (2012: £2.8 million). The major 
areas of spend have been in developing our ERP business 
information system for launch in Winsford and in upgrading 
equipment around the Group.
Finance costs of £0.6 million have been paid on our €25 million 
term loan facility and the availability of the £8 million revolving 
credit facility with HSBC.
The first payment of taxation in the UK of £0.4 million has been 
made. A refund of £0.3 million of tax in Germany was received.
The Group generated a free cash flow of £11.5 million in the 
year (2012: £8.5 million). The conversion of adjusted operating 
profit into free cash flow was 81% (2012: 66%).
The Group paid its final dividend for the year ended  
31 December 2012 of £0.71 million (2012: £0.62 million) on  
28 May 2013, and its interim dividend for the six months  
ended 30 June 2013 of £0.40 million (2012: £0.34 million) on  
4 October 2013.
In December 2011, the Group entered into a €25 million 
amortising term loan facility with HSBC, with a final maturity  
of 31 July 2015. This facility carried an annual interest rate of 
EURIBOR plus a margin of 1.5% to 2.5% depending on the 
Group’s net debt to EBITDA ratio.
On 13 July 2012, the Group converted half of the then 
outstanding €23 million term loan into Sterling to align the cash 
flows generated by the business with the repayment of the 
term loan. The resulting £9.4 million Sterling facility carried an 
annual interest rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 1.5% to 2.5% 
depending on the Group’s net debt to EBITDA ratio. The Group 
made several repayments of the term loan ahead of schedule 
and, on 30 September 2013, the Group repaid both 
outstanding term loans in full.
In December 2011, the Group also entered into an £8 million 
revolving credit facility with HSBC with a final maturity of  
31 July 2015. This facility is for general working capital 
purposes, and carries an annual interest rate of LIBOR plus  
a margin of 1.5% to 2.5% depending on the Group’s net debt  
to EBITDA ratio. At 31 October 2013, this facility was reduced 
to £4 million and was undrawn as at 31 December 2013.
At the end of the period, the Group had net cash of £5.3 million 
(2012: net debt

 £5.5 million). The movement in net debt

Directors’ Report
For the year ended 31 December 2013
The Directors present their report, incorporating the 
Chairman’s Statement, the Strategic Report including the  
Chief Executive’s Statement and the Financial Review, together 
with the audited financial statements for the year ended  
31 December 2013.
Business review and future developments
The Company is required by the Companies Act 2006 to 
include a Strategic Report. The information that fulfils the 
requirements of the Strategic Report can be found on pages 3 
to 17, which are incorporated in this report by reference. This 
report details the strategy and key risks of the Group, the 
performance for the year ended 31 December 2013 and its 
prospects for the future.
Share listing
The Company’s Ordinary Shares are admitted to and traded  
on AIM, a market operated by the London Stock Exchange. 
Further information regarding the Company’s share capital, 
including movements during the year are set out in note 30  
to the financial statements.
Capital Structure
The Group raises appropriate levels of debt to fund acquisitions 
on significant capital events, ensuring that it has adequate cash 
for working capital and short-term requirements.
The Group repaid its term loan ahead of schedule in 2013 and 
is now debt free. The Group intends to raise further finance 
as necessary.
Key Performance Indicators
The Directors have monitored the performance of the Group 
with particular reference to the relevant key performance 
indicators: revenue growth, customer service (OTIF), operating 
margin and earnings per share growth. The Group monitors 
progress on a regular basis. Performance against the key 
performance indicators can be found on page 14.
Going concern
After making enquiries and on the basis outlined in the 
Corporate Governance Report on pages 28 to 31, the Directors 
have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future and for this reason they continue to adopt 
the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.
Dividends
The Group made a profit for the year to 31 December 2013 of 
£11.4 million (2012: £9.7 million). The Directors are 
recommending payment of a final dividend of 0.41p per share. 
The final dividend will, subject to shareholders’ approval, be 
paid on 28 May 2014 to shareholders on the register at the 
close of business on 2 May 2014. This will make a total dividend 
of 0.60p for the full year (2012: 0.52p).
The total value of the final dividend being proposed is  
£0.8 million (2012: £0.7 million).
Research and Development
The Group has expensed to the income statement in the year 
ended 31 December 2013 £2,196,000 (2012: £1,996,000) on 
research and development. In accordance with International 
Accounting Standards a further £612,000 (2012: £802,000)

Employees
The Group depends on the skills and commitment of its 
employees in order to achieve its objectives. Staff at every 
level are encouraged to make the fullest possible contribution 
to the Group’s success. The Group is an equal opportunities 
employer. It is committed to giving fair and equal treatment to 
all employees and job applicants in terms of recruitment, pay 
conditions, promotions, training and all employment matters 
regardless of their age, disability, race, sex, sexual orientation, 
marriage and civil partnership, gender reassignment, religion 
or belief. An equal opportunities policy is in force which aims 
to ensure that all employees are selected, trained, 
compensated, promoted and transferred solely on the 
strength of their ability, skills, qualifications and merit. The 
Group also believes that all employees have a right to work in 
an environment free from harassment and bullying.
The Group’s policy is to consult and discuss with employees, 
through meetings, both formal and informal, those matters 
likely to affect employees’ interests. The Employees’ 
Consultative Committee in the UK, and the Works Council, in 
Germany, which comprises representatives of employees and 
management, meet regularly to discuss business issues and 
areas of concern. Management communicates with staff 
through regular team briefs.
The Group’s aim is to recruit and retain sufficient skilled and 
motivated employees to meet the needs of the business. The 
Group operates to the internationally recognised medical 
device standard ISO 13485. Staff work within a defined quality 
system and are trained in Lean Manufacturing Practices. Each 
line manager is responsible for implementing this approach. 
Employees are encouraged to become involved in the financial 
performance of the Group through participation in the Group’s 
Deferred Share Bonus Plan and are incentivised directly 
through the Company’s bonus scheme, performance reviews, 
and training and development opportunities.
It is the Group’s policy to give full and fair consideration to all 
applications for employment from disabled persons having 
regard to their particular aptitudes and abilities and to 
encourage the training and career development of all 
personnel employed by the Group, including disabled persons.  Company Overview Governance Financial Statements
Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc  Annual Report 2013   |   23
Should an employee become disabled, the Group would, where practicable, seek to continue their employment and arrange 
appropriate training.
Employees’ share schemes
Employees, except for participants in the Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), may be eligible after a period of service to be 
granted options over shares in the Company under the Company Share Option Plan or Executive Share Option Scheme. The 
Group received HMRC approval in 2009 to adopt a Company Share Option Plan (CSOP). Under the CSOP, employees are 
allowed to receive up to £30,000 of options in a tax-efficient manner. Options granted under these schemes are not offered at 
a discount. Further details are included in the Remuneration Report on pages 25 to 27.
The Company also operates a Deferred Share Bonus Scheme (DSB) in which employees are invited to participate. The DSB 
encourages employee share ownership which helps to align the employees’ interests with those of the shareholders. The details 
on the DSB Scheme are provided in the Remuneration Report on page 26.
The Company no longer satisfies the requirements for granting tax-efficient options under its EMI scheme. Options already 
granted under this scheme will be allowed to vest in accordance with the rules of the scheme.
2,251,507 Ordinary Shares were issued during the year to employees exercising their share option LTIPs and DSBs. Details are 
given in note 32 to the Group financial statements.
Health and Safety
The Group is committed to high standards in health, safety and environmental performance. It is the Group’s policy to abide by 
all laws, directives and regulations pertinent to its field of operations and to act in a manner so as to minimise the effects of its 
operations on the environment. The Group provides safe places and systems of work, safe plant and machinery, safe handling 
of materials and ensures appropriate information, instruction and training is given. Employees are encouraged to identify ‘near 
misses’ to ensure preventative actions are taken to avoid any unsafe work practices and a common All Incident Rate (AIR) 
reporting metric is used across the Group. Emphasis is placed on all employees having a responsibility to maintain a safe working 
environment. Health & Safety Committees at all sites assist with advice on safe working practices and ensure any corrective 
action is taken where necessary. Health and Safety reports are regularly received from Group sites and are reviewed by the 
Board. Regular audits are undertaken to evaluate compliance with Group policy.
Environment
Where possible, the Group aims to reduce its impact on the environment. The Group facility at Winsford has been built with a 
high level of thermal insulation to reduce the Group’s carbon footprint. It is also one of the first in the country to utilise a solar 
wall: a renewable energy source that captures the sun’s warmth and supplements the building’s heating system. Lighting is 
controlled by movement sensors to avoid wastage and the heating system is fully programmable.

Further details of the Directors’ remuneration and benefits are included in the Remuneration Report on pages 25 to 27.
The Board has agreed procedures for considering, and where appropriate, authorising directors’ conflicts or potential conflicts 
of interest. Only independent Directors i.e. those who have no interest in the matter under consideration, will be able to take the 
relevant decision. In taking the decision the Directors must act in a way they consider, in good faith, will be most likely to 
promote the Company’s success. Directors will be able to impose limits or conditions when giving authorisation if they believe it 
is appropriate. The Board will report annually on the Company’s procedures for ensuring that the Board’s power of authorisation 
in respect of conflicts of interest operated effectively and that procedures have been followed. None of the Directors had any 
interest during or at the end of the year in any contract in any relation to the business of the Company or its subsidiaries.
Directors’ and officers’ liability insurance
Insurance cover is in force in respect of the personal liabilities which may be incurred by Directors and Officers of the Company 
in the course of their service with the Group, as permitted by the Companies Act 2006. 24   |   Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc  Annual Report 2013

At the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, Peter Allen, who

Directors’ interests in the shares of the Company, together with

the Directors, are disclosed in the Remuneration Report 
commencing on page 25.
Directors’ responsibilities statement
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors 
are required to prepare the Group financial statements in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation and have elected to prepare the parent 
company financial statements in accordance with 
United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice 
(United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). 
Under company law the directors must not approve the 
accounts unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or 
loss of the Company for that period.
In preparing the Parent Company financial statements, the 
Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently; 
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent; and 
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business. 
In preparing the Group financial statements, International 
Accounting Standard 1 requires that Directors:
• properly select and apply accounting policies; 
• present information, including accounting policies, in a 
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information; 
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users 
to understand the impact of particular transactions, other 
events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and 
financial performance; and 
• make an assessment of the Group’s ability to continue as a 
going concern. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 
2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of 
the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
• the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the 
relevant financial reporting framework, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or 
loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the

Directors’ Report (continued)
For the year ended 31 December 2013 Company Overview Governance Financial Statements
Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc  Annual Report 2013   |   25
The Board presents the Remuneration Report for the year 
ended 31 December 2013.
As an AIM quoted company, Advanced Medical Solutions 
Group plc is not required to comply with the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report Regulations 2002. The following 
disclosures are made voluntarily.
The Remuneration Committee comprises four Non-Executive 
Directors of the Group, Penny Freer (Chairman), Steve Bellamy, 
Peter Steinmann and Peter Allen, and they have no personal 
financial interest, other than as shareholders, in the matters to 
be decided. They have no conflict of interest arising from 
cross-directorship and no day-to-day involvement in running 
the business. They do not participate in any bonus, share 
option or pension arrangements. The Committee met 6 times 
during the year. All meetings were attended by all members, 
with the exception of Peter Steinmann and Peter Allen who 
attended all meetings following their appointments on 1 July 
and 4 December respectively. Until his retirement on 
31 December 2013 Don Evans was a member of the 
Remuneration Committee and attended all of the meetings  
in the year.
The Board has accepted the Remuneration Committee’s 
recommendations in full.
The Remuneration Committee, on behalf of the Board and in 
consultation with the Chief Executive, determines the Group’s 
policy on executive remuneration, employment conditions and 
the individual remuneration packages of the Executive 
Directors of all Group companies and management earning in 
excess of £100,000 per annum. It administers the Share Option 
Schemes, determines the design of performance-related pay 
schemes, sets the targets for such schemes and 
approves payment under such schemes. The Terms of 
Reference of the Remuneration Committee are reviewed each 
year and are available for review on the Company’s 
website ‘www.admedsol.com’.
Remuneration policy
The remuneration policy is based on the need to offer 
competitive packages to attract, retain and motivate senior 
executives of the highest calibre, whilst at the same time not 
paying more than is necessary for this purpose. A cohesive 
reward structure consistently applied with links to corporate 
performance, is seen as crucial in ensuring attainment of the 
Group’s strategic goals. Regular reviews of the policy are 
carried out, supported by independent advice, to ensure that 
the range and level of emoluments and incentive schemes 
continue to match current market practice. Kepler Associates 
were engaged in February 2012 to advise the Remuneration 
Committee with regard to the remuneration of the executives 
and senior management, and provided further guidance 
throughout 2013. The Remuneration Committee took into 
account their recommendations which included the 
introduction of an Executive Shareholding Policy, which will 
require the Executive Directors and Senior Management Team 
to hold a minimum of 100% and 50% respectively, of their 
pre-tax salary in Company shares within 5 years of attaining 
office as well as a change to the existing bonus scheme. As a 
result of their recommendations, the Board are proposing the 
introduction of a Deferred Annual Bonus (DAB) Scheme which 
will be recommended to shareholders at the AGM on the 20 
May 2014.
Salary
The Remuneration Committee reviews the salaries of the 
Executive Directors and Senior Managers of all Group 
companies annually which are compared against performance 
and market medians.
Annual performance bonus 
Each of the Executive Directors is entitled under the terms of 
their service agreements to receive an annual bonus to be 
determined by the Remuneration Committee based on the 
Group’s financial performance and the achievement of specific 
targets which are set by the Remuneration Committee. In 2013, 
the targets set were against Group revenue, Group profit 
before tax and earnings per share. Each participant may 
receive up to 100% of their salary, as a bonus. 85% of the award 
is dependent upon the financial performance of the Group and 
15% is achievable for meeting personal objectives. Senior 
management may receive up to 50% of their salary in bonus. 
43% of the award is dependent on financial performance 
targets and 7% on personal objectives. Following advice from 
Kepler, the Remuneration Committee is proposing to introduce 
a Deferred Annual Bonus (DAB) Scheme whereby both 
Executive Directors and Senior Managers will be required to 
defer up to 25% of their annual bonus into share awards that 
will vest after three years. This DAB is being proposed at the 
Annual General Meeting. Details on the DAB are included in 
Appendix 1 of the Notice of Meeting on pages 74 to 78.
Share options
Employees, except for participants in the Long Term Incentive 
Plan (LTIP), may be granted options over shares in the 
Company under the Company Share Option Plan and 
Executive Share Option Scheme, under which either approved 
or unapproved options may be granted. Options granted under 
these schemes are not offered at a discount.
The exercising of options under these schemes is conditional 
on certain performance conditions which are pre-determined 
by the Remuneration Committee and which accord with the 
Joint Statement from the Investment Committees of the 
Association of British Insurers and the National Association of 
Pension Funds. Options are exercisable normally only after the 
third anniversary of the date of grant (or such later time as may 
be determined at the time of grant) and cannot in any event be 
exercised later than the tenth anniversary of the date of grant. 
Awards will not vest if the Group is not profitable at the end of 
the performance period. Full details are included in note 32 on 
pages 61 to 65.
Company Share Option Plan (CSOP)
The Company received approval for a Company Share Option 
Plan (CSOP) on 2 June 2010. This was adopted after HMRC 
approval on 13 August 2010. This Plan allows relevant 
employees to receive up to £30,000 of Company shares by 
reference to the market value of these shares on the grant date 
and to benefit from the growth in value of those shares.
2009 Executive Share Option Scheme
Options granted under this scheme are not offered at a 
discount. Up until 2010, the Company was able to offer options 
under an Enterprise Management Incentive (EMI) Scheme. The 
Company no longer satisfies the requirements for operating 
this scheme, however, options already granted will be allowed 
to vest in accordance with the scheme rules. 
Long term incentives
The Company’s Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) was 
introduced in 2005. Individuals who are entitled to awards 
under the LTIP are not eligible to receive options under the 
Company’s Share Option Plan or the Executive Share Option 
Scheme. The objectives of the LTIP are to align the interests of 
Executives with those of shareholders by making a part of 
remuneration dependent on the success of management in 
delivering superior returns to shareholders. 50% of the Award 
is determined based on the performance of the Company 
compared with the AIM Healthcare Share Index over a three 
year period and 50% of the Award is determined by the growth 
in the average earnings per share per year of the Company 
over a three year period.
Of the 50% of the Award that is determined by reference to the 
AIM Healthcare Share Index, no shares will be awarded if the 
Company is ranked below the 50% level. If the Company is 
Remuneration Report 26   |   Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc  Annual Report 2013
Remuneration Report (continued)
ranked in the upper quartile of the index i.e. at 75% or above, 
the full 50% of the Award shall become vested. If the Company 
is ranked between 50% and 75%, the provision of an Award 
which shall become vested shall be determined on a 
straight-line basis between 0% and 50%.
The other 50% of the Award will be vested if the Company 
achieves an average of 20% or more earnings per share  
growth per year over three years from the date of grant. No 
award is made if earnings per share is less than 10% There is a 
discretionary underpin at the end of the performance period 
that requires the Committee to be satisfied that the recorded 
EPS performance is consistent with the underlying 
performance of the Company.
The proportion of the Award that shall become vested if the 
Company achieves an average earnings per share growth per 
year between 10% and 20% shall be on a straight-line basis 
between 0% and 50%. Awards made have no performance 
re-testing facility.
The LTIP introduced in 2005 is due to end on the 24 May 2015. 
A new LTIP is being proposed at the Annual General Meeting 
to replace the existing scheme. Details of the proposed scheme 
are included in Appendix 1 of the Notice of Meeting on pages 
74 to 78.
Deferred Share Bonus Plan
The Company also has a Deferred Share Bonus Plan (the ‘DSB’) 
which is available to all employees. The DSB allows for the 
payment of any bonus to be made in the form of shares. It also 
allows for the provision of additional matching shares if the 
bonus shares are held for a set period. The DSB encourages 
employees to acquire shares in the Company and retain those 
shares to receive additional free shares from the Company.  
It acts as a valuable retention tool and aligns the employees’ 
interests with those of shareholders. The first year that the  
DSB operated was in 2007. In 2013 the Company allowed 
employees to invest a part of their gross salary in the DSB 
scheme in lieu of any bonus being paid. 
Pension
All staff are entitled to become members of the Group Pension 
and Life Assurance Scheme, which was set up with effect from 
1 February 1999. The Scheme entitles Executive Directors to 
contribute up to 10% of salary with the Group contributing 10%. 
All other employees contribute 3% of their salary which is 
matched by a 6% contribution from the Group. The Pension 
Plan is a money purchase scheme. In 2011, the Group made 
further arrangements allowing individuals to sacrifice their 
salary for pension contributions. Automatic enrolment will be 
implemented in 2014.
Service agreements
The service agreements for Chris Meredith and Mary Tavener 
are terminable by either party giving not less than 12 months 
notice in writing.
Private healthcare
Executive Directors and other senior employees are entitled to 
private healthcare and permanent health insurance.
Non-executive directors
The fees of the Non-Executive Directors are determined by the 
Executive Directors. No Director or senior manager shall be 
involved in any decisions as to their own remuneration. 
Non-Executive Directors receive travel expenses but do not 
participate in any incentive arrangements. The Non-Executive 
Directors have entered into terms of appointment. The 
Non-Executive Directors’ appointments are terminable by 
either party upon six months notice in writing without any right 
to compensation on early termination. Don Evans retired as 
Chairman on 31 December 2013. As a result of his previous 
position as Chief Executive Officer, he held LTIPs with a vesting 
date of 23 April 2012. The Remuneration Committee 
recommended, and the Board agreed, that these LTIPs vest in 
the normal way, subject to the usual performance conditions. 
Don Evans exercised all of his remaining LTIPs and DSBs during 
the year with the exception of 4,411 shares from the DSB 
Scheme which were exercised on 3 January 2014. There were 
no payments made to Don Evans as a result of his retirement.

Until 2013 the annual bonus, which was discretionary, was not determined until the financial results had been audited and approved 
by the Board. No bonus was payable to the Directors in respect of the 2012 financial year. The Board agreed that from 2013 a 
bonus for the current financial year should be accrued. The bonus recorded in the table above is in respect of the 2013 financial 
year, to be paid or deferred into shares in 2014. Company Overview Governance Financial Statements

Corporate Governance Report
UK Corporate Governance Code
The rules relating to AIM companies do not require the 
Company to report in accordance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2012 (“the Code”). However, the Board is 
committed to the principles of good corporate governance 
and the directors have applied the Code in a manner which 
they consider appropriate for the size of the Group. The 
departures considered more significant by the directors are 
mentioned below.
Board composition and Diversity
The Board comprises the Non-Executive Chairman, the Chief 
Executive, the Group Finance Director and three Non-
Executive Directors. The Directors’ biographies appear on 
pages 18 and 19 and detail their experience and suitability for 
leading and managing the Group. The Non-Executive 
Directors, all of whom are considered by the Board to be 
independent, bring a valuable range of expertise and 
experience in assisting the Group to achieve its strategic aims. 
The Chairman fosters a climate of debate and challenge in the 
boardroom. This is built on his challenging but supportive 
relationship with the Chief Executive which sets the tone for 
Board interaction and discussions.
We recognise the importance of diversity at Board level and 
our Board members comprise a number of different 
nationalities with a wide range of skills and experiences from  
a variety of business backgrounds. Our current female 
representation on the Board is 33.3%, already above the 
minimum representation level to be achieved by 2015.
Peter Allen was appointed as Chairman on 1 January 2014 
following his appointment as a Non-Executive Director on 
4 December 2013 and is considered to be independent.  
Don Evans retired as Chairman on 31 December 2013 and was 
not considered to be independent. The Group also appointed  
a Non-Executive Director with commercial experience of the 
medical device sector, Peter Steinmann, to strengthen the 
Board in 2013. Position profiles for both appointments were 
prepared and an external recruitment agency used to source 
candidates, a process managed by the Nomination Committee. 
The size of the Board increased at the end of 2013 to 7. 
Following Don Evans retirement on 31 December 2013 this has 
reduced to 6.
All Directors are required to stand for re-election at the 
first Annual General Meeting following their appointment and, 
as a minimum, every three years thereafter. 
Senior Independent Director
In March 2010 Penny Freer was appointed as Senior 
Independent Director.
Board Committees
The Board has delegated specific authority to the Audit 
Committee, Nomination Committee and the Remuneration 
Committee.
Peter Allen, Penny Freer, Steve Bellamy and Peter Steinmann 
are members of the Remuneration, Audit and Nomination 
Committees. Chris Meredith is a member of the Nomination 
Committee. Until his retirement on 31 December 2013 
Don Evans was a member of all Committees.
Terms of Reference of all three Board Committees are available 
on our corporate website ‘www.admedsol.com’.
Role of the Board
The Board retains full and effective control of the Group and 
has a schedule of matters specifically reserved for its approval. 
The Board is responsible for formulating the Group’s corporate 
strategy, approval of budgets, monitoring financial 
performance, approval and review of major capital 
expenditure, corporate governance and risk management. 
Matters are delegated to the Board Committees, Executive 
Directors and the Senior Management Team (SMT) 
where appropriate. 
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the 
Company Secretary and can take independent professional 
advice, if necessary, at the Group’s expense. The Board 
approves the appointment and removal of the Company 
Secretary. The Non-Executive Directors are able to contact  
the Executive Directors and senior managers at any time for 
further information. Company Overview Governance Financial Statements

Board and Committee meetings
The Board meets on a formal basis regularly, and met formally 10 times in 2013. Members are supplied with financial and 
operational information in good time for review in advance of the meetings. Most Board Committee meetings are scheduled 
around Board meetings. 
The Directors attended the following meetings in the year ended 31 December 2013:

Board and Committee evaluation
The performance evaluation of the Board, its Committees and Directors is undertaken by the Chairman annually and 
implemented in collaboration with the Committee Chairman. The 2013 Board and Committee evaluations were conducted by 
way of each Director and Committee member completing comprehensive questionnaires. The results are collated, discussed 
and acted upon by the Board and Committees. The Board reviews the outcomes of the Committee evaluations and assesses 
their performance. The Chairman confirms that the performance of the Non-Executive Directors continues to be effective.
In line with good corporate governance and the UK Corporate Governance Code the Board completed an external Board 
evaluation exercise in 2013. This involved interviews with all Board members, the Senior Management Team and external 
advisors. The results were presented to the Board, discussed and acted upon. 
Professional advice, indemnities and insurance
There is provision for Directors to take independent professional advice relating to the discharge of their responsibilities should 
they feel they need it. The Company has arranged Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance against certain liabilities and 
defence costs. However, the Directors’ insurance does not provide protection in the event of a Director being found to have 
acted fraudulently or dishonestly.
Investor relations
The Board appreciates that effective communication with the Company’s Shareholders and the investment community as a 
whole is a key objective. The views of both institutional and private Shareholders are important, and these can be varied and 
wide-ranging, as is their interest in the Company’s strategy, reputation and performance. The Executive Directors have overall 
responsibility for ensuring effective communication and the Company maintains a regular dialogue with its shareholders, mainly 
in the periods following the announcement of the interim and final results, but also at other times during the year. The views of 
shareholders are sought through direct contact and via feedback from advisors and are communicated to the Board as a whole. 
The Board encourages the participation of shareholders at its Annual General Meeting, notice of which is sent to shareholders at 
least 20 working days before the meeting. The AMS website ‘www.admedsol.com’ is regularly updated and provides additional 
information on the Group including information on the Group’s products and technology. 
Annual General Meeting
This year’s AGM will, as last year, include a presentation by the Chief Executive on the current progress of the business and allow 
the opportunity for questions on this or any of the resolutions before the meeting. The Company proposes separate resolutions 
for each issue and specifically relating to the reports and accounts. The Company ensures all proxy votes are counted and 
indicates the level of proxies on each resolution along with the abstentions after it has been dealt with on a show of hands.
After the meeting, shareholders will have the opportunity to talk informally to the Board and raise any further questions or 
issues they may have. The outcome of the AGM and a copy of the AGM presentation will be posted on the Company’s website 
after the meeting.
Internal control 
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness, taking guidance from the 
Audit Committee. In the context of the Group’s business any such system can only reasonably be expected to manage rather 
than eliminate risks arising from its operations. It can therefore only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against 
material loss or misstatement. 30   |   Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc  Annual Report 2013
Key features of the internal control system are as follows:
• The Group has an organisational structure with clear 
responsibilities and lines of accountability. The Group 
promotes the values of integrity and professionalism. The 
members of the Board are available to hear, in confidence, 
any individual’s concerns about improprieties; 
• The Board has a schedule of matters expressly reserved for 
its consideration. This schedule includes potential 
acquisitions, major capital projects, treasury, risk 
management policies, approval of budgets and health  
and safety;
• The Board monitors the activities of the Group through the 
management accounts, monthly forecasts and other reports 
on current activities and plans. The Senior Management 
Team regularly monitors financial and operational 
performance in detail; 
• The Group has set appropriate levels of authorisation which 
must be adhered to as the Group concludes its business;
• The Group operates a ‘whistle-blowing’ policy enabling any 
individual with a concern to approach the Non-Executive 
Directors in confidence; and 
• The Group has appointed a third party to carry out internal 
audits on behalf of the Group which is managed by the Audit 
Committee.
Risk Management
The recent challenging business climate has resulted in a 
sustained focus on the approach to risk. The Directors consider 
risk management to be crucial to the Group’s success and give 
a high priority to ensuring that adequate systems are in place 
to evaluate and limit risk exposure. 
Management are responsible for the identification and 
evaluation of significant risks applicable to their areas of the 
business together with the design and operation of suitable 
internal controls. These risks have been discussed in the 
Strategic Report on pages 3 to 17 and are assessed on a 
continual basis, and may be associated with a variety of internal 
or external factors including financial and operational risks.
Management report to the Board regularly on their review of 
risks and how they have managed the risks. The Board reviews 
the inherent risks, including the key risks, at Board meetings 
and the system of control necessary to manage such risks.  
The Board reviews the effectiveness of the Group’s procedure 
in managing risk and, therefore, believes it meets the 
requirements of the Guidance. The business risks and controls 
to mitigate the risks are formally reviewed by the Audit 
Committee and then by the Board at least twice a year. 
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises Steve Bellamy (Chairman), 
Penny Freer, Peter Steinmann (from 1 July 2013) and Peter 
Allen (from 4 December 2013). Don Evans was a member of 
the Audit Committee until his retirement on 31 December 2013.
Steve Bellamy, a qualified Chartered Accountant, chairs the 
Committee. The Committee has Terms of Reference that are 
reviewed at least annually and were updated at the end of 
2013. The Deputy Company Secretary acts as Secretary to 
the Committee.
The Committee met five times during the year. The Chief 
Executive Officer, Group Finance Director, Group Financial 
Controller, external audit partner and internal auditor attended 
a number of these meetings. The Audit Committee also met 
with the external audit partner without the Executives and 
Senior Managers present. The role of the Committee is to:
consider the appointment, fees, independence and 
effectiveness of the auditor and the audit process, and discuss 
the scope of the audit and its findings; 
• monitor the Group’s accounting policies;
• review and challenge the Group’s assessment of business 
risks and internal controls to mitigate these risks; 
• review the annual and interim statements prior to their 
submission for approval by the Board; 
• review and challenge the Going Concern assumptions for 
the Group; 
• review the Group’s Whistle-blowing, Bribery and 
Gifts policies; 
• review the internal audit plan and the reports of the internal 
auditors; and
• annually assess the performance of external auditor through 
feedback from management and from the Audit Committee.
Significant judgements have been challenged through open 
discussion and rigorous debate between the Committee and 
the auditor.
It is the task of the Audit Committee to ensure that auditor 
objectivity and independence is safeguarded when non-audit 
services are provided by the auditor. To ensure auditor 
objectivity and independence there is a process in place to 
approve any non-audit work provided by the auditor.
Internal Audit
Following a review of the Group in 2012, the Audit Committee 
proposed, and the Board accepted, the recommendation that  
a separate internal audit function be set up. This was achieved 
by outsourcing to Baker Tilly LLP. The Audit Committee have 
prepared the Terms of Reference and a plan of work. Baker 
Tilly LLP commenced work during the second half of 2013. 
Findings and recommendations are received by the Audit 
Committee who also review progress on corrective actions. 
The Audit Committee:
• approves the appointment or termination of appointment 
of the internal auditors;
• reviews and approves the charter of the internal audit 
function and ensures the function has the necessary 
resources and access to information to enable it to fulfil its 
mandate, and is equipped to perform in accordance with 
appropriate professional standards for internal auditors;
• ensures the internal auditor has direct access to the Board 
Chairman and to the Committee Chairman, and is 
accountable to the Committee;
• reviews and assesses the annual internal audit work plan;
• receives a report on the results of the internal auditor’s work 
on a periodic basis;
• reviews and monitors management’s responsiveness to the 
internal auditor’s findings and recommendations;
• meets with the internal auditor at least once a year without 
the presence of management; and
• monitors and reviews the effectiveness of the company’s 
controls in the context of the company’s overall risk 
management system.
All internal audit reports are discussed with the Audit 
Committee and the external auditor, and the recommendations 
considered and acted upon. Baker Tilly LLP attends Audit 
Committee meetings every 6 months and updates the Audit 
Committee in writing ahead of the Committee meetings.
The Group also calls on the services of external bodies to 
review the controls in certain areas of the Group. The quality 
assurance systems are reviewed by the Group’s notified bodies, 
the British Standards Institution (BSI) and TUV Product 
Service, on a regular basis.

Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee comprises Peter Allen  
(Chairman from 1 January 2014), Penny Freer, Steve Bellamy, 
Chris Meredith and Peter Steinmann (from 1 July 2013). 
Don Evans was a member of the Nomination Committee  
until his retirement on 31 December 2013.
The Committee nominates and recommends the appointment 
of new Directors to the Board, considers succession planning 
for Directors and other Senior Management, and membership 
of the Audit and Remuneration Committees. In making 
recommendations, the Committee takes into account the 
balance of skill, knowledge and experience of the Board and 
gives due regard to the benefits of diversity of the Board, 
including gender. The Committee has Terms of Reference that 
are reviewed at least annually and were updated at the end of 
2013. The Deputy Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the 
Committee. The Committee met formally four times during 
the year.
The Committee identified the need for a Non-Executive 
Director with relevant commercial experience of the medical 
device sector during 2013. A profile for this position was drawn 
up, agreed and a recruitment process, using an external 
recruitment agency unrelated to the business, was 
implemented leading to the appointment of Peter Steinmann 
on 1 July 2013.
Following Don Evans’ announcing his intention to retire from 
the Board in 2013, a profile for this position was drawn up, 
agreed and an external recruitment agency unrelated to the 
business appointed to identify suitable candidates. Don Evans 
was involved in the recruitment process for his successor to 
ensure continuity and a smooth transition. Don Evans stepped 
down on 31 December 2013 and Peter Allen was appointed as 
Chairman on 1 January 2014.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises Penny Freer 
(Chairman), Steve Bellamy, Peter Steinmann (from 1 July 2013)
and Peter Allen (from 4 December 2013). Don Evans was a 
member of the Remuneration Committee until his retirement  
on 31 December 2013.
The Committee, in consultation with the Chief Executive, 
determines the Group’s policy on executive remuneration, 
employment conditions, and the individual remuneration 
packages of Executive Directors of all Group companies and 
Senior Management earning in excess of £100,000 per annum. 
It also approves all new incentive schemes, the grants of 
options under the Group’s Share Option Schemes, and the 
grant of shares under the Group’s Long Term Incentive Plan 
(LTIP). The Committee has Terms of Reference that are 
reviewed at least annually and were updated at the end of 
2013. The Deputy Company Secretary acts as Secretary to  
the Committee. The Remuneration Committee met 6 times  
in 2013. The report of the Committee is included on  
pages 25 to 27.
Going concern
In carrying out their duties in respect of going concern, the 
Directors have carried out a review of the Group’s financial 
position and cash flow forecasts for the next twelve months. 
These have been based on a comprehensive review of revenue, 
expenditure and cash flows, taking into account specific 
business risks and the current economic environment.
With regard to the Group’s financial position, it had cash 
and cash equivalents at the year-end of £5.3 million 
(2012: £8.9 million) and was debt free (2012: Term loan of 
€10.3 million and £6.31 million). The Group has a revolving 
credit facility of £4 million which expires on 31 July 2015. 
While the current economic environment is uncertain, AMS 
operates in a market whose demographics are favourable, 
underpinned by an increasing need for products to treat 
chronic and acute wounds. Consequently, market growth is 
predicted. The Group has a number of long-term contracts 
with customers across different geographic regions and also 
with substantial financial resources, ranging from government 
agencies through to global healthcare companies.
Having taken the above into consideration the Directors have 
reached the conclusion that the Group is well placed to 
manage its business risks in the current economic environment. 
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the financial statements.

framework that has been applied in the preparation of the group financial statements is applicable law and International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the 
preparation of the parent company financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to 
state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for 
the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the

opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s and the parent company’s circumstances and 
have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the 
directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial 
information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any 
information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the 
course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at  
31 December 2013 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
•  the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
•  the Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice; and
•  the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if,  
in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
•  the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
•  certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
•  we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc  Annual Report 2013   |   37
Notes Forming Part of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements
1. Reporting entity
Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc (“the Company”) is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England 
and Wales (registration number 2867684). The Company’s registered address is Premier Park, 33 Road One, Winsford Industrial 
Estate, Cheshire, CW7 3RT.
The Company’s Ordinary Shares are traded on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange plc. The consolidated financial 
statements of the Company for the 12 months ended 31 December 2013 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together 
referred to as the “Group”).
The Group is primarily involved in the design, development and manufacture of novel high performance polymers (both natural 
and synthetic) for use in advanced woundcare dressings and materials, and medical adhesives and sutures, for closing and 
sealing tissue, for sale into the global medical device market.
2. Basis of preparation
The Group accounts have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs), as adopted by 
the EU.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis of accounting except as disclosed in the accounting 
policies set out below.
The individual financial statements for each Group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which it operates (its functional currency). For the purpose of the Consolidated Financial Statements, the results 
and financial position of each Group company are expressed in pounds sterling, which is the functional currency of the 
Company, and the presentational currency for the Consolidated financial statements.
In carrying out their duties in respect of going concern, the Directors have carried out a review of the Group’s financial position 
and cash flow forecasts for the next 12 months. These have been based on a comprehensive review of revenue, expenditure and 
cash flows, taking into account specific business risks and the current economic environment. 
With regards to the Group’s financial position, it had cash and cash equivalents at the year-end of £5.3 million. The Group also 
has in place a revolving credit facility of £4 million, which is not drawn down and expires on 31 July 2015.
While the current economic environment is uncertain, AMS operates in markets whose demographics are favourable, 
underpinned by an increasing need for products to treat chronic and acute wounds. Consequently, market growth is predicted. 
The Group has a number of long-term contracts with customers across different geographic regions and also with substantial 
financial resources, ranging from government agencies through to global healthcare companies.
After taking the above into consideration, the Directors have reached a conclusion that the Group is well placed to manage its 
business risks in the current economic environment. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing 
the accounts.
The Group has applied IAS 24 (revisions 2010), IFRIC 14 (amendments 2010) and improvements to IFRS (2010). These have had 
no significant impact on this set of financial information.
3. Accounting policies
Use of estimates and judgments
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the 
application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expense. Actual results may differ 
from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting 
estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected. 
Impairment of goodwill
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which the 
assets have been allocated. The value in use calculation requires the Group to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise 
from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate to calculate present value.
Capitalisation of development costs
In determining the development expenses to be capitalised, estimates and assumptions are required based on expected future 
economic benefits generated by products that are the result of these development costs. Other important estimates and 
assumptions in this assessment process are the required internal rate of return, the distinction between research and 
development and the estimated useful life. 38   |   Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc  Annual Report 2013
Notes Forming Part of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements (continued)
3. Accounting policies continued
Share-based payment
The charge to the income statement in relation to options and incentive plans is based on the Black-Scholes Merton or the 
Binominal Theorem valuation technique. This technique requires a number of assumptions to be made such as those in relation 
to share price volatility, movement in interest rates, dividend yields and staff behavioural patterns.
Inventory impairment provisions
The Group makes provisions for inventory deemed to be obsolete or slow-moving. This provision is established on each 
individual stock keeping unit (SKU) based on the age of the stock, the forward order book, management’s experience and its 
assessment of the present value of estimated future cash flows.
Receivables impairment provisions
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Group’s 
management based on prior experience and their assessment of the present value of estimated future cash flows.
Deferred tax
A deferred tax asset is recognised when it is judged probable that the Group will generate taxable profits which can be offset 
against tax losses.
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group has the power to govern the financial and 
operating policies of an entity so as to retain benefits from its activities. The financial statements of the subsidiaries are included 
in the Consolidated financial statements on the basis of acquisition accounting, from the date that control commences until the 
date that control ceases.
Intercompany transactions and balances between Group entities are eliminated upon consolidation.
Business combinations
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the equity method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate 
of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, the equity instruments issued by the 
Group in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the issue of debt or equity. Acquisition 
related expenses are accounted for as expenses in the period in which the costs are incurred and the services rendered, with the 
exception of directly attributable costs incurred as a result of raising equity, which are off-set against share premium, and raising 
debt which are capitalised and amortised over the term of the debt. The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except 
for non-current assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-Current Assets Held 
for Sale and Discontinued Operations, which are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the 
business combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities 
recognised. If, after reassessment, the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the 
identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is initially 
recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill which is 
recognised as an asset is reviewed for impairment at least annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately in profit or loss 
and is not subsequently reversed.
Revenue recognition
Revenue represents the fair value of sales of the Group’s products to external customers at amounts excluding value added tax, 
and is recognised when the products have been delivered and title has passed. Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is 
probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured. 
Revenue from royalty income receivable under licence agreements from external customers at amounts excluding value added 
tax is recognised as the products under licence are sold and the revenue can be reliably measured. 
Other income
This represents non-refundable up-front licence payments received for the grant of rights for the development and marketing 
of products, and other sundry income. The income is recognised in the income statement, over the life of each development 
project, in proportion to the stage of completion of each project. Company Overview Governance Financial Statements

3. Accounting policies continued
Finance income
Finance income relates to interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and investments. Interest income is accrued on a time basis, 
by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.
Finance costs
Finance costs relate to finance payments associated with financial liabilities. They are recognised in the income statement as 
they accrue using the effective interest method.
Finance costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that 
necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use, are added to the cost of those assets, until such 
time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use.
Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets 
is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is 
probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable 
estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the foreign exchange rate 
ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement. Non-monetary 
assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at 
the date of the transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value 
are translated at foreign exchange rates ruling at the date the fair value was determined.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are 
translated at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. The revenue and expenses of foreign operations are 
translated at an average rate for the year where this rate approximates to the foreign exchange rates at the dates of the 
transactions. Exchange differences arising on consolidation are recognised in equity.
Hedging
The Group designates certain hedging instruments, which include derivatives, embedded derivatives and non-derivatives in 
respect of foreign currency risk, as either fair value hedges, cash flow hedges, or hedges of net investments in foreign 
operations. Hedges of foreign exchange risk on firm commitments are accounted for as cash flow hedges. At the inception of 
the hedge relationship, the entity documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along with 
its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of the 
hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument is highly effective in offsetting changes 
in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item. Note 26 sets out details of the fair values of the derivative instruments used for 
hedging purposes. Details on the hedging reserve in equity are in note 31.
Taxation
Taxation expense includes the amount of current income tax payable and the charge for the year in respect of deferred taxation.
The income tax payable is based on an estimation of the amount due on the taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit is different 
from profit before tax as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expenditure which are not 
taxable or deductible in the year as a result of either the nature of the item or the fact that it is taxable or deductible in another 
period. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated by using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by 
the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is accounted for on a basis of temporary differences, except to the extent where it arises from the initial recognition 
of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination. Deferred tax assets are recognised only 
to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to 
equity, in which case it is dealt with within equity. It is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when 
the asset is realised or the liability is settled based on tax laws enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
Intangible assets
Acquired intellectual property rights
Intellectual property rights that are acquired in a business combination are initially recognised at their fair value. Intellectual 
property rights purchased outright are initially recognised at cost. Intellectual property rights are capitalised and amortised over 
their estimated useful economic lives, usually not exceeding 18 years. In determining the useful economic life each asset is reviewed 
separately and consideration given to the period over which the Group expects to derive economic benefit from the asset. 40   |   Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc  Annual Report 2013
3. Accounting policies continued
Development costs
Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge, is recognised 
in the income statement as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Expenditure on development activities, where research findings are applied to a plan or design for the production of new or 
substantially improved products and processes, is capitalised once it can be demonstrated that the product or process is clearly 
identifiable, technically and commercially feasible, will generate future economic benefits, that the development costs of the 
asset can be measured reliably and the Group has sufficient resources to complete development. Expenditure capitalised is 
stated as the cost of materials and direct labour less accumulated amortisation.
Where development expenditure results in new or substantially improved products or processes and it is probable that recovery 
will take place, it is capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis over the product’s useful life starting from the date on which 
serial production commences, which is between one and ten years. Patents and trademarks are measured initially at purchase 
cost and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which is between three and twenty years.
Software intangibles
Where computer software is not integral to an item of property, plant or equipment its costs are capitalised and categorised as 
intangible assets. Amortisation is provided on a straight-line basis over its economic useful life, which is in the range of three to 
ten years.
Property, plant and equipment
Land and buildings and plant and equipment held for use in the production of goods and services or for administrative purposes 
are carried in the balance sheet at cost less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated 
impairment losses.
The Group elected to use the fair value as the deemed cost in respect of land and buildings at the date of transition to IFRS. Fair 
value was calculated by reference to their existing use at the date of transition.
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost, less estimated residual values, of all property, plant and equipment, over the 
expected useful life of the asset from the date that the asset is brought into use. It is calculated at the following rates:
• Freehold property and improvements   – 4% per annum on cost
• Leasehold improvements    – over the length of the lease
• Plant and machinery    – 6.7% to 33.3% per annum on cost
• Fixtures and fittings    – 33.3% per annum on cost
• Motor vehicles     – 25% per annum on cost
Property, plant and equipment in the course of construction for production are carried at cost, less any recognised impairment 
loss. Depreciation of these assets, on the same basis as other property, plant and equipment assets, commences when the 
assets are ready for their intended use.
No depreciation is provided on freehold land.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill
The carrying amount of the Group’s assets other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each balance sheet date to 
determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable 
amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated to reduce the carrying amount of the assets in 
the unit on a pro rata basis. A cash-generating unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that 
are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.
Calculation of recoverable amount
The recoverable amount of Group’s receivables carried at amortised cost is calculated as the present value of estimated future 
cash flows. As the Group’s receivables are of short duration they are not discounted.
Reversal of impairment
An impairment loss in respect of a receivable carried at amortised cost is reversed if the subsequent increase in recoverable 
amount can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised.
In respect of other assets, an impairment loss is reversed when there is an indication that the impairment loss may no longer 
exist and there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that 
would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.

Financial Statements (continued) Company Overview Governance Financial Statements

3. Accounting policies continued
Inventory
Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable direct 
labour costs, that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition and an attributable 
proportion of manufacturing overheads based on normal levels of activity.
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less further costs to completion and disposal.
The Group makes provision for inventory deemed to be irrecoverable or where the net realisable value is lower than cost. This 
provision is established on a stock keeping unit (SKU) basis by reference to the age of the stock, the forward order book, 
management’s experience and its assessment of the present value of estimated future cash flow.
Financial instruments
Classification of financial instruments
Financial instruments are classified as financial assets, financial liabilities or equity instruments.
Financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity only to the extent that they meet the following two conditions:
• They include no contractual obligations upon the Group to deliver cash or other financial assets that are potentially 
unfavourable to the Group; and 
• Where the instrument will or may be settled in the Group’s own equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative that includes 
no obligation to deliver a variable number of the Group’s own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the 
Group exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.
To the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability. 
Recognition and valuation of financial assets
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand and cash deposits and amounts under short-term guarantees 
usually three months or less that are held for the purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments and are subject to 
insignificant risk in change in value and which are readily convertible to a known amount of cash. Cash held in accounts with 
more than 90 days’ notice that are not required to meet short-term cash commitments are shown as an investment. 
Investments
Cash held in accounts with more than 90 days’ notice that are not required to meet short-term cash commitments are shown as 
an investment. The Group invests funds which are surplus to requirements in fixed rate deposits operating within parameters for 
credit ratings and credit limits for individual institutions that are approved and monitored by the Board.
Under IAS 39 ‘Financial instruments; recognition and measurement’, such investments are classified as loans and receivables and 
are recognised at fair value on initial recognition and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method.
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables are recognised and carried at the lower of their original invoiced value and recoverable amount. An 
impairment is made when it is likely that the balance will not be recovered in full. The recoverable amount is calculated as the 
present value of estimated future cash flows. Estimated future cash flows are not discounted due to the relatively short period 
of time between recognition of trade receivables and receipt of cash.
Recognition and valuation of equity instruments
Equity instruments are stated at par value. Any premium on issue is taken to the share premium account.
Recognition and valuation of financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
Trade payables
Trade payables are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently recognised at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method.
Other loans
Other loans are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently recognised at amortised cost.
Financial liabilities at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss (“FVTPL”)
A derivative that is not designated and effective as a hedging instrument is classified as held for trading. Financial liabilities are 
classified as at FVTPL where the financial liabilities are held for trading.
Financial liabilities at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss recognised in profit or loss. Fair value is 
determined in the manner described in note 26. 42   |   Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc  Annual Report 2013
3. Accounting policies continued
Derivative financial instruments
The Group enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to manage its exposure to foreign exchange rate risk. Further details 
of derivative financial instruments are disclosed in note 26 to the financial statements.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured 
to their fair value at each balance sheet date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss (administrative costs) 
immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the 
recognition in profit or loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship. The Group currently designates certain derivatives 
as hedges of highly probable forecast transactions or hedges of foreign currency risk of firm commitments (cash flow hedges). 
A derivative with a positive fair value is recognised as a financial asset whereas a derivative with a negative fair value is 
recognised as a financial liability. 
Derivatives with remaining maturity of less than 12 months are presented as current assets or current liabilities.
Leased assets
Leases are classified as finance leases when the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership 
to the Group. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held as finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the 
minimum lease payments during the lease term at the inception of the lease. Lease payments are apportioned between the 
reduction of the lease liability and finance charges in the income statement so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the 
remaining balance of the liability. Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life 
of the assets and the lease term.
Assets leased under operating leases are not recorded on the balance sheet. Rental payments are charged directly to the 
income statement. Lease incentives, primarily up-front cash payments or rent-free periods, are capitalised and spread over 
the period of the lease term on a straight line basis unless another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern of 
the users’ benefit. Payments made to acquire operating leases are treated as prepaid lease expenses and amortised over the life 
of the lease.
Pensions
The Group operates a money purchase pension scheme. The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group 
in an independently administered fund. The amount charged against the income statement represents the contributions 
payable to the scheme in respect of the accounting period.
Share-based payments
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 ‘Share-based payments’. IFRS has been applied to all options granted after 
7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2006.
The Group issues equity–settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are 
measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value as determined at the grant date of equity–settled share-based 
payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of options that will 
eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of a Black-Scholes Merton or a Binomial Theorem model. The expected life used in the model 
has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effect of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and 
behavioural considerations.
Capital management
As at 31 December 2013, the Group had net funds. Capital is managed by maximising retained profits. Working capital is 
managed in order to generate maximum conversion of these profits into cash and cash equivalents thereby maintaining capital. 
Capital includes share capital, share premium, investment in own shares, share-based payments reserve, share-based payments 
deferred tax reserve, other reserve, translation reserve and retained earnings reserve. There are no externally imposed capital 
requirements on the Group.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items are those items that are unusual because of their size, nature or incidence, or that the directors consider 
should be disclosed separately to enable a full understanding of the Group’s results. This includes non-recurring transaction costs 
(see note 6). Exceptional items have been presented separately on the face of the income statement. The directors consider that 
this presentation gives a fairer presentation of the results of the Group.

Employee Benefit Trusts
The Group operates an Employee Benefit Trust (EBT): ‘Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc UK Employee Benefit Trust’.
The Group has de facto control of the assets, liabilities and shares held by the Trust and bear their benefits and risks. The Group 
records assets and liabilities of the Trust as its own.
In compliance with IAS 32 ‘Financial Instruments: Presentation Group’, shares held by the EBT are included in the consolidated 
balance sheet as a reduction in equity. Gains and losses on Group shares are recognised directly in reserves.
IFRS not yet effective and not adopted early
The following IFRSs have been issued but have not been adopted by the Group in these financial statements, as they are not yet 
effective; none of which are likely to have a material effect on the Group’s results, operations or financial position:
• IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements 
• IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements 
• IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures (2011)
• IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities 
• IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements (2011) 
• IAS 32 Amendments to IFRS 7 and IAS 32 
• Amendments to IAS 36 Impairment of assets 
• Amendments to IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement 
• Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27 
Unless otherwise listed above, no other standard, amendment or interpretation is likely to have a material effect on the Group’s 
results, operations or financial position.
4. Segment information
In the latter stages of the year to December 2012 the Group was re-organised into four business units: Branded Direct, Branded 
Distributed, OEM and Bulk Materials. These divisions are the basis on which the Group reports its segment information. 
Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a 
reasonable basis. Unallocated items comprise mainly investments, and related revenue, corporate assets, head office expenses, 
income tax assets and the Group’s external borrowings. These are the measures reported to the Group’s Chief Executive for the 
purposes of resource allocation and assessment of segment performance.
Business segments
The principal activities of the business units are as follows:
• Branded Direct – Selling, marketing, and innovation of the Group’s branded products sold directly by the Group’s sales teams
• Branded Distributed – Distribution, marketing and innovation of the Group’s brands sold by distributors in markets not 
serviced by the Group’s sales team
• OEM – Selling, marketing and innovation of the Group’s products supplied to partners under their brands
• Bulk Materials – Selling, marketing and innovation of bulk materials to medical device partners and convertors  44   |   Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc  Annual Report 2013

The goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful economic life at 31 December 2012 were allocated to the relevant 
Business Units in proportion to profit from operations on a consistent basis for all four segments. However, it has since become 
apparent that the allocation did not represent a true representation of the goodwill and intangible assets utilised by each 
segment. This was due to a number of one off transactions occurring which distorted the allocation.
The 31 December 2012 comparative information has been re-presented to reallocate £1.4 million of goodwill and £0.4 million of 
intangibles assets from Branded Distributed to Branded Direct, such that these assets are ascribed to the appropriate business 
segment. The adjustments result in no impact upon profit. 46   |   Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc  Annual Report 2013

Legislation to reduce the main rate of UK corporation tax to 21% and 20% was passed by parliament on 18 July 2013 to take 
effect from 1 April 2014 and 1 April 2015. The reduction in the main rate to 20% had been substantively enacted at the balance 
sheet date and, therefore, the deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated in these financial statements at this rate.
In addition to the amount charged to the income statement and other comprehensive income, the Group has recognised 
directly in equity:
• excess tax deductions related to share-based payments on exercised options together with
• changes in excess deferred tax deductions related to share-based payments, totalling £15,000 surplus: (2012: £451,000 surplus). 50   |   Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc  Annual Report 2013

36,933 9,374 357 1,266 47,930
Further comment on the allocation of goodwill to business units is provided in note 4. The Group tests goodwill annually for 
impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
      
The recoverable amounts have been determined based on a value-in-use calculation on a cash generating unit basis, which uses 
cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by the Directors covering a five-year period. These budgets have 
been adjusted to reflect the existing state of the business and, consequently, omit investment plans. Cash flows beyond that 
five-year period have been extrapolated using a steady 2% (2012: 2%) per annum growth rate, being the medium-term expected 
growth; the growth rate would have to fall significantly in order for an impairment to be required. This growth rate does not 
exceed the long-term average growth rate for the market in which the Group operates. A discount rate of 8% per annum (2012: 
8%), being the Group’s current pre tax weighted average cost of capital, has been applied to these cash flows, being an 
estimation of current market risks and the time value of money. The Directors believe that any reasonably possible further 
change in the key assumptions on which the recoverable amount is based would not cause any of the carrying amounts to 
exceed the relevant recoverable amount.

10,255 9,157
The Group’s principal financial assets are cash and trade receivables. The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its 
trade receivables.
The average credit period taken on sales of goods is 43 days (2012: 43 days). No interest is charged on the receivables within 
the contracted credit period. Thereafter, interest may be charged at 2% per month on the outstanding balance. In determining 
the recoverability of a trade receivable the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivable from the 
date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date. The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the Group’s large and 
unrelated customer base. Accordingly, the Directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the 
allowance for impairments.
Before accepting any new customer, the Group assesses the potential customer’s credit quality and defines credit limits by 
customer. Limits are reviewed on an ongoing basis and reflect current payment history.
Included in the Group’s trade receivable balance are debtors which are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has 
not provided as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable. The 
Group does not hold any collateral or other credit enhancements over these balances. The carrying amount and ageing of these 
debtors are summarised below:

Non-current liabilities
Other payables 520 572
Trade payables, other payables and accruals and deferred income principally comprise amounts outstanding for trade 
purchases and ongoing costs. 
The average credit period taken for trade purchases is 42 days (2012: 41 days). No interest is charged on trade payables that are 
within pre-agreed credit terms. Thereafter, interest may be charged on the outstanding balances at various interest rates. The 
Group has financial risk management policies in place to ensure that all payables are paid within the pre-agreed credit terms.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade payables approximates to their fair value.

See Strategic Report (page 3) for risk sensitivities in respect of US dollar and Euro denominated revenue and material prices.
Forward foreign exchange contracts 
It is the policy of the Group to enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to cover specific foreign currency payments 
and receipts.
In accordance with IFRS 7 ‘Improving Disclosures about Financial Instruments’ the Group’s financial instruments are considered 
to be classified as level 2 instruments. Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than unadjusted 
quoted prices in active markets (Level 1 categorisation) that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (ie as prices) or 
indirectly (ie as derived from prices).

31. Reserves
Investment in own shares
This is the nominal value of the shares held in trust on behalf of employees in respect of the DSB scheme.
Other reserve
This represents Advanced Medical Solutions Limited’s share premium account arising from merger accounting. 
Hedging reserve 
The hedging reserve represents the cumulative amount of gains and losses on hedging instruments deemed effective in cash 
flow hedges. The cumulative deferred gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in profit or loss only when the 
hedged transaction impacts the profit or loss, or is included as a basis adjustment to the non-financial hedged item, consistent 
with the applicable accounting policy.
Translation reserve 
Exchange differences relating to the translation of the net assets of the Group’s foreign operations, which relate to subsidiaries 
only, from their functional currency into the parent’s functional currency, being Sterling, are recognised directly in the translation 
reserve. Gains and losses on hedging instruments that are designated as hedges of net investments in foreign operations are 
included in the translation reserve.
£732,000 has been recorded in the translation reserve during the period, which would otherwise have been recognised in 
administration costs (2012: £1,258,000), if hedge accounting had not been adopted.

Under the terms of the Company’s Share Option Schemes, approved by Shareholders in 1999 and amended in 2001 and 2002, 
the Board may offer options to purchase Ordinary Shares in the Company to all employees of the Company at the market price 
on a date to be determined prior to the date of the offer. Since 2005, individuals who are entitled to awards under the LTIP are 
no longer eligible to receive options under the Company’s Share Option Schemes.
Performance targets are assessed over a three-year period from the date of grant. Once options have vested they can be 
exercised during the period up to ten years from the date of grant.
The expected volatility was determined by calculating the historic volatility of the Group’s share price over the previous  
three years. 62   |   Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc  Annual Report 2013

Financial Statements
Year ended 31 December 2013
1. Significant accounting policies
Basis of accounting
The separate financial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006. They have been 
prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards  
and law.
The principal accounting policies are summarised below. They have all been applied consistently throughout the year and the 
preceding year.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption of FRS8 ‘Related Party Disclosures’ from disclosing transactions with other 
members of the Group and the exemption in FRS29 ‘Financial Instruments’ for making disclosures in relation to financial 
instruments.
Going concern
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for 
the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements. 
Further detail is contained in note 2 of the consolidated financial statements.
Investments
Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries and associates are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
For investments in subsidiaries acquired for consideration including the issue of shares qualifying for merger relief, cost is 
measured by reference to the nominal value only of the shares issued. Any premium is ignored.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered 
into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of 
its liabilities.
Share-based payments
The Group has applied the requirements of FRS20 ‘Share-based Payments’. In accordance with the transitional provisions, 
FRS 20 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as at 1 January 2005.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are 
measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value as determined at the grant date of equity-settled share-based 
payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will 
eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of a Black-Scholes Merton model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based 
on management’s best-estimate, for the effect of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
Liquid resources
Liquid resources comprise variable term deposits that are accessible with less than 12 months’ notice.
2. Profit for the year
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company has elected not to present its own profit and loss 
account for the year. AMS Group plc reported a profit for the financial year ended 31 December 2013 of £6,606,000  
(2012: profit of £2,942,000).
The auditor’s remuneration for audit and other services is disclosed in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.
The average number of employees in the year was 10 (2012: 8). The directors’ remuneration is detailed in note 9 to the 
consolidated financial statements and in the Remuneration Report. 68   |   Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc  Annual Report 2013

Notes
1. A member entitled to attend and vote at the meeting convened by the notice set out above may appoint a proxy to attend, 
speak and, on a poll to vote in his place. A holder of more than one ordinary share may appoint different proxies in relation to 
each or any of those ordinary shares. 
2. A member may appoint more than one proxy provided each proxy is appointed to exercise rights attached to different shares. 
A member may not appoint more than one proxy to exercise rights attached to any one share. To appoint more than one 
proxy notice must be given to the Company’s Registrars not later than 48 hours before the time appointed for the holding of 
the meeting. 
3. A proxy does not need to be a member of the Company but must attend the meeting to represent you. Details of how to 
appoint the Chairman of the meeting or another person as your proxy using the proxy form are set out at note 1 of the proxy 
form. If you wish your proxy to speak on your behalf at the meeting you will need to appoint your own choice of proxy (not 
the Chairman) and give your instructions directly to them. 
4. On a vote on a resolution on a show of hands at the meeting, a proxy has one vote for and one vote against if the proxy has 
been appointed by more than one member and the proxy has been instructed by one or more of the members to vote for the 
resolution and by one or more other member to vote against it. 
5. Any corporation which is a member can appoint one or more corporate representatives who may exercise on its behalf all of

Notes on special business
Resolutions 8 and 9: Approval of the Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc Deferred Annual Bonus Plan 2014 (2014 DAB) 
and the Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc Long Term Incentive Plan 2014 (2014 LTIP)
The Company’s current long term incentive plan is due to expire on 24 May 2015 and therefore shareholders are being asked to 
approve a replacement plan, the main features of which are set out in Appendix 1 on pages 74 to 78 of this document. The 
Remuneration Committee of the Company considers the 2014 DAB and the 2014 LTIP to be an important means of motivating 
the Executive Directors and Senior Management and align the interests of the Executive Directors and senior management with 
those of the Company’s shareholders.
Resolution 10: Authority to Allot Shares and other relevant securities
This resolution would give the Directors the authority to allot Ordinary Shares up to an aggregate nominal amount equal to 
£3,458,432 (representing 69,168,648 Ordinary Shares of 5p each). This amount represents approximately one-third of the issued 
Ordinary Share capital of the Company as at 31 March 2014, the latest practicable date prior to publication of this Notice.
The authority sought under this resolution will expire at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting of the Company held in 
2015 or, if earlier, 15 months after the passing of the resolution.
While the Directors have no present intention of issuing any of the authorised but unissued share capital, it is considered prudent 
and appropriate to maintain the flexibility that this authority provides.
Resolution 11: Disapplication of Pre-emption Rights
Your Directors also require additional authority from shareholders to allot shares or grant rights over shares or sell treasury 
shares where they propose to do so for cash and otherwise than to existing shareholders in proportion to their existing holdings. 
Accordingly, Resolution 11 will be proposed as a special resolution to grant such authority. Apart from rights issues, open offers or 
any other pre-emptive offer as mentioned the authority will be limited to the issue of shares and sales of treasury shares for cash 
up to an aggregate nominal value of £1,037,530 (being 10% of the Company’s issued Ordinary Share capital at 31 March 2014, the 
latest practicable date prior to publication of this Notice). This is in keeping with the extent for which such authority has been 
sought and given at each previous Annual General Meeting of the Company since 2006.
Allotments made under the authorisation in paragraph (a) of Resolution 11 would be limited to allotments by way of a rights issue 
only (subject to the right of the directors to impose necessary or appropriate limitations to deal with, for example, fractional 
entitlements and regulatory matters).
If given, this authority will expire at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting of the Company held in 2015 or, if earlier, 15 
months after the passing of the resolution.
Resolution 12: Purchase by the Company of its own Shares
In certain circumstances, it may be advantageous for the Company to purchase its own shares. Under Section 701 of the 2006 
Act, the Directors of a company may make market purchases of that company’s shares if authorised to do so. Your Directors 
believe that granting such approval would be in the best interests of shareholders in allowing directors the flexibility to react 
promptly to circumstances requiring market purchases.
Accordingly, Resolution 12, which will be proposed as a special resolution, will give the Directors the authority to purchase issued 
shares of the Company under Section 701 of the 2006 Act.
The authority contained in this resolution will be limited to an aggregate nominal value of £518,765 (representing 5% of the issued 
Ordinary Share capital of the Company as at 31 March 2014 the latest practicable date prior to publication of this Notice; representing 
10,375,297 Ordinary Shares of 5p each). The price which may be paid for those shares is also restricted as set out in the resolution.
This authority will expire at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting of the Company held in 2015 or, if earlier, 15 months 
after the passing of the resolution.
The Board has no present intention of exercising this authority. However, this will be kept under review, and the Board will use this 
power only if and when, taking account of market conditions prevailing at the time, other investment opportunities, appropriate 
gearing levels and the overall financial position of the Group, they believe that the effect of such purchases will be in the best 
interests of shareholders generally and that they will result in an increase in earnings per share.
Shares purchased under this authority may be held as treasury shares. Shares held in treasury do not carry voting rights and no 
dividends will be paid on any such shares. Shares held in treasury in this way can be sold for cash or cancelled. This would allow 
the Company to manage its capital base more effectively and to replenish its distributable reserves.
If and when the Board resolves to exercise its authority to make market purchases, it will at that time decide whether shares 
purchased are to be cancelled or held in treasury.
As at 31 March 2014, the latest practicable date prior to publication of this Notice, there were share options outstanding over 
ordinary shares, representing 2.9% of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital. The Company has no warrants in issue in 
relation to its shares. If the buyback authority was to be exercised in full, these options would represent 3.0% of the Company’s 
ordinary issued share capital. 74   |   Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc  Annual Report 2013
Notice of Meeting (continued)
Appendix 1 (which summarises the 2014 DAB & 2014 LTIP)
1. SUMMARY OF THE MAIN PROVISIONS OF THE ADVANCED MEDICAL SOLUTIONS GROUP PLC DEFERRED 
ANNUAL BONUS PLAN 2014 (2014 DAB)
2 Eligibility
The 2014 DAB will be operated and administered by the Remuneration Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company 
(Remuneration Committee). The Remuneration Committee will determine who may participate in the 2014 DAB (Participants) 
and this will extend to any employee (including an Executive Director) of the Company or any of the Company’s subsidiaries. 
3 Terms of Award
Under the 2014 DAB, Participants will compulsorily defer part of their bonus for the relevant financial year. The Remuneration 
Committee’s current intention is that Participants will defer up to 25% of their bonuses, although the Remuneration Committee 
can determine this from time to time. Awards under the 2014 DAB equivalent to the value of the deferred bonus may be in the 
form of:
• a conditional right to acquire shares in the Company; or
• a nominal or nil cost option to acquire shares in the Company
(together the Awards).
Such Awards may be granted over newly issued shares, treasury shares or shares purchased in the market. No payment will be 
required from Participants either for the grant of Awards or for the shares themselves. At the time of vesting, the Remuneration 
Committee may determine that, in substitution for their right to acquire shares, the Participant shall be paid a sum equal to the 
cash equivalent.
Awards in the form of an option will normally lapse on the date immediately before the tenth anniversary of the date of grant if 
they remain unexercised at that date.
Awards under the 2014 DAB may only be granted within the period of 42 days following the approval of the 2014 DAB by the 
Company’s shareholders, the announcement of the Company’s results for any period, the lifting of any restrictions stopping  
the grant of Awards or any day on which the Remuneration Committee determines that exceptional circumstances exist.
4 Deferral period
Awards will generally only vest or become exercisable at the end of a three year period (Deferral Period) determined by the 
Remuneration Committee at the time of grant.
5 Vesting of Awards and Leavers
An Award will normally vest at the end of the Deferral Period unless it lapses earlier as set out below.
In the case of death, the Award will normally vest as soon as practicable following the death of the Participant unless the 
Remuneration Committee determines otherwise. The unvested Award will vest in full on death. 
Awards will lapse immediately where the Participant is lawfully dismissed without notice.
Where the Participant ceases to be employed by any member of the Group for any other reason (Good Leaver Circumstances), 
a Participant’s unvested Award will usually continue and the Award will vest at the end of the Deferral Period unless the 
Remuneration Committee determines otherwise. The unvested Award will vest in full in Good Leaver Circumstances. 
In all of the above circumstances, Awards in the form of options will normally be exercisable for a period of six months after 
vesting, save in the case of death, where it will be twelve months. 
6 Corporate events
In the event of a change of control of the Company, Awards will vest. Where the event occurs during the Holding Period, the 
period of time which has elapsed since the start of the Performance Period and the relevant event shall also be taken into 
account, unless the Remuneration Committee determines otherwise. Where an Award is in the form of an option, this will then  
be exercisable for a period of one month. 
Alternatively, the Remuneration Committee may permit or require Awards to be exchanged for equivalent awards which relate  
to shares in a different company.
7 Limits on the issue of shares
The number of shares which can be issued under the 2014 DAB will be restricted by the general limit of 15% of the Company’s 
issued share capital in a ten year period which applies for all of the Company’s share incentive schemes.  Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc  Annual Report 2013   |   75
8 Malus
The Remuneration Committee may take such steps as it considers appropriate to reduce the number of shares subject to an 
Award (to nil if appropriate) and/or impose further conditions on the Award in certain circumstances. Such circumstances 
include, but are not limited to: 
• a material misstatement of the Company’s audited financial results;
• a serious failure of risk management by the Company, any Group member or a relevant business unit; or
• reputational damage to the Company, any Group member or a relevant business unit as a result of the Participant’s 
misconduct or otherwise.
9 Dividends
The Remuneration Committee may determine that on the vesting of an Award in the form of a conditional share award or cash 
award, or on the exercise of an Award in the form of an option, a Participant shall receive an amount in cash and/or shares 
equivalent to the value of some or all of the dividends (and special dividends at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee) 
that would have been paid on the vested shares between the date of grant of the Award and the date of vesting.
10 Non-transferability of Awards
Each Award is personal to the Participant and accordingly, Participants may not transfer, assign, charge, encumber or otherwise 
alienate their Awards or shares subject to their Awards nor create in favour of any third party any interest therein (nor, in any 
case, attempt so to do).
11 Rights attaching to shares
All shares issued or transferred under the 2014 DAB will rank pari passu with all other shares of the Company for the time being 
in issue (save as regards any rights attaching to such shares by reference to a record date prior to the date of issue or transfer  
to the Participant).
12 Variation of capital
In the event of any rights or capitalisation issue, sub-division, consolidation, reduction or other variation of the Ordinary Share 
capital of the Company, the Board may make such adjustment as it considers appropriate to the number of shares subject to  
an Award and/or the price payable on the exercise of options (where an Award takes the form of an option).
13 Amendments to the 2014 DAB
The Remuneration Committee may alter the provisions of the 2014 DAB in any respect provided that the prior approval of 
shareholders in general meeting is obtained for alterations or additions which are to the advantage of Participants and relate  
to eligibility, limits, the basis for determining a Participant’s entitlement to, and the terms of, the Shares or cash comprised in  
an Award and the impact of any variation of capital.
The requirement to obtain the prior approval of shareholders will not, however, apply in relation to any alteration or addition 
which is minor in nature and made to benefit the administration of the 2014 DAB, to comply with the provisions of any existing  
or proposed legislation or to obtain or maintain favourable tax, exchange control or regulatory treatment for the Company, any 
of its subsidiaries or for Participants.
14 Termination
The 2014 DAB will terminate on the tenth anniversary of its adoption, or such earlier time as the Board may determine but the rights 
of existing participants will not be affected by such termination. In the event of termination, no further Awards will be granted.
15 Benefits not pensionable
Awards under the 2014 DAB are non-pensionable. 76   |   Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc  Annual Report 2013
Notice of Meeting (continued)
SUMMARY OF THE MAIN PROVISIONS OF THE ADVANCED MEDICAL SOLUTIONS GROUP PLC LONG-TERM 
INCENTIVE PLAN 2014 (2014 LTIP)
16 Eligibility
The 2014 LTIP will be operated and administered by the Remuneration Committee. The Remuneration Committee will determine 
who may participate in the 2014 LTIP (Participants) and this will extend to any employee (including an Executive Director) of the 
Company or any of the Company’s subsidiaries.
17 Terms of Award
Awards under the 2014 LTIP may be in the form of:
• a conditional right to acquire shares in the Company; or
• a nominal or nil cost option to acquire shares in the Company
(together the Awards).
Such Awards may be granted over newly issued shares, treasury shares or shares purchased in the market. No payment will be 
required from Participants either for the grant of Awards or for the shares themselves. At the time of vesting, the Remuneration 
Committee may determine that, in substitution for their right to acquire shares, the Participant shall be paid a sum equal to the 
cash equivalent.
Awards in the form of an option will normally lapse on the date immediately before the tenth anniversary of the date of grant if 
they remain unexercised at that date.
Awards under the 2014 LTIP may only be granted within the period of 42 days following the approval of the 2014 LTIP by the 
Company’s shareholders, the announcement of the Company’s results for any period, the lifting of any restrictions stopping the 
grant of Awards or any day on which the Remuneration Committee determines that exceptional circumstances exist.
18 Individual limits
Awards will not be granted to a Participant under the 2014 LTIP over shares with a market value in excess of 200 per cent of 
salary in each of the Company’s financial years.
19 Performance conditions and holding period
Awards will generally only vest or become exercisable subject to the satisfaction of a performance condition measured over a 
three year period (Performance Period) determined by the Remuneration Committee at the time of grant.
Awards will vest dependent on the satisfaction of performance conditions determined by the Remuneration Committee prior to the 
date of grant. The performance conditions must contain objective conditions, which must be related to the underlying financial 
performance of the Company. It is intended that Awards granted in 2014 shall be subject to the following performance conditions:
Performance Condition % of Award subject to the Performance Condition
TSR Condition 50%
EPS Condition 50%
The TSR Condition is based on Total Shareholder Return (TSR) measured over a three-year period against the TSR of the AIM 
All-Share Supersector Health Care Index (Index).
Performance will be measured over periods of three years. The initial Performance Period for TSR will commence on the date of 
grant of the 2014 Awards for the TSR Condition and on 1 January 2014 for the EPS Condition. 
Performance measurement for the TSR Condition for the 2014 Awards will be based on the average price over the 90 dealing 
day period to the date of grant measured against the 90 dealing day period prior to the three year anniversary following the date 
of grant. Awards will vest on a sliding scale from 25% to 100% for performance above median to upper quartile performance 
against the Index. No Awards will vest for performance below median.
The EPS Condition is based on the Company’s earnings per share measure over a three year Performance Period. For the 2014 
Awards this will start at the beginning of the 2014 Financial Year, 1 January 2014.
Performance measurement for the EPS Condition for the 2014 Awards will be based on the % increase of the Company’s EPS 
over the performance period. Awards will vest on a sliding scale from 25% to 100% for an average increase of EPS over target 
EPS to an average increase of EPS of 20% over the Performance Period. No Awards will vest for an average increase of EPS 
below target EPS. In 2014, the target EPS will be set at 5%.
The Remuneration Committee will have the flexibility to make appropriate adjustments to the performance conditions, to ensure 
that the award achieves its original purpose.
Any vesting is also subject to the Remuneration Committee being satisfied that the Company’s performance on these measures 
is consistent with underlying business performance. Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc  Annual Report 2013   |   77
20 Vesting of Awards and Leavers
An Award will normally vest on the date, following the end of the Performance Period, on which the Remuneration Committee 
determines the extent of which the performance condition has been satisfied unless it lapses earlier as set out below.
Where the Participant ceases to be employed by any member of the Group by reason of ill health, injury, disability, a sale of the 
entity that employee the Participant out of the Group or for any other reason at the Remuneration Committee discretion (Good 
Leaver Circumstances), a Participant’s unvested Award will usually continue and the Award will vest on the normal vesting date 
unless the Remuneration Committee determines otherwise.
The Remuneration Committee will decide the extent to which an unvested Award will vest in Good Leaver Circumstances, taking 
account of: (i) the period of time that has elapsed since the start of the Performance Period until the date of cessation of 
employment (unless the Remuneration Committee decide otherwise); and (ii) the extent to which any performance condition is 
satisfied at the end of any Performance Period or, as appropriate, at the date on which the Participant ceases to be employed by 
a Group company. 
In the case of death, the Award will normally vest as soon as practicable following the death of the Participant unless the 
Remuneration Committee determines otherwise. The Remuneration Committee will decide the extent to which an unvested 
Award will vest on death, taking account of: (i) the period of time that has elapsed since the start of the Performance Period until 
the date of death (unless the Remuneration Committee decide otherwise); and (ii) the extent to which any performance 
condition is satisfied at the end of any Performance Period or, as appropriate, at the date of death.
In all of the above circumstances, Awards in the form of options will normally be exercisable for a period of six months after 
vesting. Awards will lapse immediately where the Participant is lawfully dismissed without notice.
21 Corporate events
In the event of a change of control of the Company, Awards will vest taking into account the extent to which any performance 
condition has been satisfied at the date of the change of control. Where the event occurs during the Performance Period, the 
period of time which has elapsed since the start of the Performance Period and the relevant event shall also be taken into 
account, unless the Remuneration Committee determines otherwise. Where an Award is in the form of a nil-cost option, this will 
then be exercisable for a period of one month. 
Alternatively, the Remuneration Committee may permit or require Awards to be exchanged for equivalent awards which relate to 
shares in a different company.
22 Limits on the issue of shares
The number of shares which can be issued under the 2014 LTIP will be restricted by the general limit of 15% of the Company’s 
issued share capital in a ten year period which applies for all of the Company’s share incentive schemes. 
23 Malus
The Remuneration Committee may take such steps as it considers appropriate to reduce the number of shares subject to an 
Award (to nil if appropriate) and/or impose further conditions on the Award in certain circumstances. Such circumstances 
include, but are not limited to: 
• a material misstatement of the Company’s audited financial results;
• a serious failure of risk management by the Company, any Group member or a relevant business unit; or
• reputational damage to the Company, any Group member or a relevant business unit as a result of the Participant’s 
misconduct or otherwise.
24 Dividends
The Remuneration Committee may determine that on the vesting of an Award in the form of a conditional share award or cash 
award, or on the exercise of an Award in the form of an option, a Participant shall receive an amount in cash and/or shares 
equivalent to the value of some or all of the dividends (and special dividends at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee) 
that would have been paid on the vested shares between the date of grant of the Award and the date of vesting.
25 Non-transferability of Awards
Each Award is personal to the Participant and accordingly, Participants may not transfer, assign, charge, encumber or otherwise 
alienate their Awards or shares subject to their Awards nor create in favour of any third party any interest therein (nor, in any 
case, attempt so to do).
26 Rights attaching to shares
All shares issued or transferred under the 2014 LTIP will rank pari passu with all other shares of the Company for the time being in 
issue (save as regards any rights attaching to such shares by reference to a record date prior to the date of issue or transfer to 
the Participant).
27 Variation of capital
In the event of any rights or capitalisation issue, sub-division, consolidation, reduction or other variation of the Ordinary Share 
capital of the Company, the Board may make such adjustment as it considers appropriate to the number of shares subject to an 
Award and/or the price payable on the exercise of options (where an Award takes the form of a share option). 78   |   Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc  Annual Report 2013

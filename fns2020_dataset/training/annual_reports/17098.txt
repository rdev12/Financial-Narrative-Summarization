motivated and engaged team members delivering 
outstanding service to 22 million customers every  
month across our hotels, coffee shops and restaurants. 
Our vision is to grow legendary brands by building

Whitbread Way , to describe our business philosophy . Hotels & Restaurants
Premier Inn is the UK’s leading, and award–winning, hotel 
business, with 649 hotels and more than 51,000 rooms across 
the UK. More than 75% of the UK population live within five 
miles of a Premier Inn. Internationally we have four hotels in 
the Middle East and two in India.
We offer our customers a 100% money–back guarantee of  
a good night’s sleep as well as a quality room, comfortable 
surroundings and friendly service. We call it our Good Night 
Guarantee.
All Premier Inn UK bedrooms have an ensuite bathroom, TV  
with Freeview and Wi–Fi internet access. All our hotels have  
a bar and restaurant, either inside the building, or next to  
it offering a wide range of dishes. 372 of these restaurants  
are our own brands: Beefeater; Brewers Fayre; Table Table; 
and Taybarns. We also have Thyme restaurants within a 
number of our city centre sites.

Whitbread
Whitbread has built some of the UK’s most successful, 
much–loved hospitality brands including Premier Inn and 
Costa. We employ over 40,000 people worldwide and  
serve 22 million customers every month. 
We’ve set our sights on ambitious and fast–paced profitable

to around 75,000 UK rooms and roughly double the system 
sales of Costa to around £2 billion. 
Although our businesses span different areas of the 
hospitality business, they all share common values and a clear 
vision on responsibility. We have demonstrated our ability  
to build strong brands through the consistent delivery  
of operational excellence and a great customer experience  
in people intensive businesses.

Whitbread Annual Report and Accounts 2012/13 2 Costa
Costa, voted the UK’s favourite coffee shop, has grown 
significantly over the past five years and now has 1,578  
stores in the UK and 949 overseas. 
Only the very best coffee available goes into creating the 
unique taste and aroma of our Costa Mocha Italia blend —  
in fact, just 1% of the world’s production is good enough  
for us to choose from. All the coffee we serve in the UK,  
and most of that served in the rest of the world, is roasted  
at our Lambeth roastery.
Costa is an international brand represented in 29 countries.  
It employs a multi–channel strategy, with equity stores, 
franchise stores and joint ventures as well as a wholesale 
operation and Costa Express, which now has 2,560 machines. 
A recently added channel is ‘Costa at home’, with Costa  
coffee being sold for use in domestic coffee machines for  
the first time.

Chairman’s
statement
Anthony Habgood
Chairman
Whitbread has grown its total sales in 
the year by over 14% and continued to 
produce strong operating cash ﬂows 
of over £500 million. This has funded 
both signiﬁcant organic investment to 
grow our businesses and a double digit 
percentage increase in our dividends 
while maintaining prudent debt levels. 
With the Premier Inn and Costa brand 
propositions going from strength to 
strength this growth is set to continue.
Our businesses continue to benefit from a consistent and 
long–term focus on their customers, with particular emphasis 
on continuing to refurbish and maintain the hotels, restaurants 
and coffee shops to high standards. I am pleased to see the 
level of innovation taking place throughout the Company, 
whether it is in the use of social media to communicate with 
our teams and customers or updating room designs. Our 
ability to invest in this way is again a consequence of our 
financial strength.

Board
We reported last year that Christopher Rogers would take 
over as Managing Director of Costa and that we had begun 
the search for a new Group Finance Director. I was pleased 
that Nicholas Cadbury joined as our new Group Finance 
Director in November 2012 from Premier Farnell PLC, where 
he had been Chief Financial Officer since 2011. Prior to that he 
had held a variety of roles at Dixons Retail PLC, including the 
position of Chief Financial Officer between 2008 and 2011. 
Nicholas is already proving to be an important member  
of our top management team as Whitbread continues on  
its growth path.
Louise Smalley, who has worked at Whitbread for 18 years  
and has been Group HR Director since 2007, also joined the 
Board in November 2012. At its heart, Whitbread is a 
hospitality business focused on people. Louise is instrumental 
in creating a great place to work for our 40,000 team 
members, developing our global talent and building 
leadership strength. Having worked closely with her over the 
last six years I know she will continue to be an invaluable 
contributor at the Board.
Governance
As a board of directors we have a duty to run the  
Company effectively and ethically on behalf of all of our  
key stakeholders. This is something that sets the tone for  
how we do business and is not simply about behaviour  
in the boardroom. I believe our fast and open reaction  
to the horse meat issues, which had been prevalent  
in our industry, was a good example of this behaviour.

People
As you will see from our business model on page 8, the 
people who work for Whitbread really are a vital ingredient in 
the Company’s success. Whether it’s the people in our hotels, 
coffee shops and restaurants, or those providing them with 
the support so that they can concentrate on making everyday 
experiences feel special for our customers, they all play a vital 
role. Once again, I’d like to thank them all on behalf of the 
Board for their dedication, enthusiasm and professionalism 
this year.

Executive’s 
review
Andy Harrison
Chief Executive
We delivered a strong ﬁnancial 
performance in 2012/13 in a 
challenging consumer market. T otal 
sales grew by 14.2% to £2,030.0 million. 
Group underlying proﬁt before tax  
rose 11.4% to £356.5 million (2011/12: 
£320.1 million), with underlying basic 
EPS increasing by 12.0% to 150.45p.
Our strong cash flow from operations of £526.0 million 
allowed us to increase the dividend by 12.0% and reinvest 
£343.6 million in the business to open new sites and refurbish 
our existing estate. Our disciplined approach to deploying 
capital has enabled us to grow shareholder value year after 
year. In 2012/13 Group return on capital increased to 14% 
whilst we maintained our strong balance sheet with net debt  
of £471.1 million.
Whitbread Hotels & Restaurants delivered a strong 
performance with total sales up 9.7% and like for likes up 
2.8%. Within Hotels & Restaurants, Premier Inn grew total 
sales by 13.1% and continued to outperform, with total  
revenue per available room growing by 1.7% compared  
to a decline of 3.6% for the Midscale and Economy sector  
and a growth of 0.8% for the total UK hotel market. 
Restaurants outperformed its competitive benchmark,  
the Coffer Peach industry tracker, with like for like sales 
growth of 2.3%. Costa produced another strong performance 
with total sales up 24.1% and worldwide system sales up 
22.6% to £1.0 billion. In the UK its Retail equity business 
delivered 6.8% like for like sales increase and has now 
delivered an impressive 44 consecutive quarters of like  
for like sales growth.
Growth milestones
In April 2011 we established ambitious growth milestones  
to grow Premier Inn UK rooms to 65,000 rooms and to 
double Costa’s worldwide system sales to £1.3 billion. We are 
well on track to achieve these targets and have announced 
new 2018 milestones, which will grow Premier Inn UK to 
around 75,000 rooms and double Costa’s system sales to 
around £2 billion. This organic growth opportunity, together 
with our clear focus on returns, will create substantial 
shareholder value.

Current trading
In the first few weeks of our new financial year, Group trading 
has been in line with our plan. Premier Inn has maintained its 
positive momentum. The unseasonably cold weather has held 
back sales within Restaurants, and benefitted Costa. 
Making everyday experiences special
Whitbread is a people intensive business. We have 22 million 
customers a month who are served by our 40,000 team 
members across 2,500 sites around the UK and hundreds 
more worldwide. It is our team members who make these 
experiences special so our customers want to return time  
and again. 
I would like to personally thank our team members for the 
tremendous work that they do, every day.
Our simple business philosophy is captured by our Whitbread 
Way model, which is on page 8. This model can be seen 
throughout the Group. It is the foundation of our customer–
focused balanced scorecard, which we call our WINcard and 
is used at every one of our sites.
Innovation is a key theme in our business philosophy. It 
encompasses a wide range of improvements to the customer 
experience and to business efficiency, from the development 
of our digital channels in Premier Inn to continuous 
improvements to Costa’s food range.
Winning Teams
We use a six–monthly employee satisfaction survey called 
Your Say to measure our people’s engagement. This year  
95%, that’s over 36,500 team members, took the time to 
complete the 28 question survey. They told us that 78% of 
them are proud to work for the Company and the employee 
engagement score across the Group was an excellent 77.5%.
Alongside this internal measure, we are also delighted to have 
received external recognition as a great place to work, ranking 
tenth in the Sunday Times Best Big Companies to Work  
For 2013 list and number eight in the Britain’s Top Employers 
survey run by the CRF Institute.
Our profitable growth means we are creating thousands  
of jobs each year. In 2012/13 we employed an additional  
3,000 people (net) in the UK, many of whom were from  
the long–term unemployed and under the age of 25. We are 
proud that the jobs we offer provide very real opportunity  
to people who want to develop their skills and their careers, 
not just in the UK but on a global stage.

Whitbread Annual Report and Accounts 2012/13 6 7
I am pleased that many of our team members are sharing 
directly in Whitbread’s success through the Company’s 
Sharesave scheme. This year saw the highest uptake for seven 
years with over 3,000 people opening a three or five–year 
plan. Those who joined the scheme three or five years ago 
shared in a £2.8 million profit in February.
Customer Heartbeat
We are passionate about putting the customer at the  
heart of everything we do. We believe that great service, 
constant innovation and a continued investment in our 
product is the winning formula for building a stronger 
Customer Heartbeat and growing ever stronger brands which 
can consistently outperform the competition. We achieved 
our highest ever sales, guest satisfaction scores and brand 
preference in the year.
Across Hotels & Restaurants and Costa we have achieved 
record net promoter scores, with more customers than  
ever ranking their experience of a Premier Inn, a restaurant  
or a Costa, nine or ten out of ten. When it comes to brand 
preference, both Premier Inn and Costa remain the number 
one brand of choice in their markets, according to the UK’s 
leading brand survey, YouGov, and both have increased their 
lead over the competition.
One of the biggest contributing factors to building a stronger 
Customer Heartbeat, and driving Profitable Growth, is a 
continued investment in our estate. In Hotels & Restaurants 
we have invested £103.1 million, a significant amount of  
which was invested in maintaining and upgrading almost 
6,000 rooms, whilst at Costa we have spent £18.2 million  
on re–imaging 120 stores and maintaining the estate.
Profitable Growth
In 2012/13 Premier Inn continued to win market share  
through opening 4,242 net new rooms and 29 net new hotels 
taking the total estate to 51,671 rooms and 649 hotels. This, 
combined with our committed pipeline of 10,000 rooms puts 
us on track to reach our growth milestone of 65,000 rooms 
by 2016. 
We have now extended this milestone to 75,000 rooms by 
2018. We anticipate around half of this will come from new 
catchment areas where Premier Inn is not currently present. 
London remains an important area of focus. We currently 
have some 6% of the total London hotel market with 8,000 
rooms and envisage reaching 13% by 2018, which equates  
to 20,000 rooms. 
We are building the Premier Inn brand in selected 
international markets, initially building our own hotels and 
then moving towards an ‘asset light’ model. We have four 
hotels in the Middle East and two hotels in India, which  
are making good progress. We have a committed pipeline  
of 12 hotels, with plans underway for a further eight in our 
target market of the Middle East, India and South East Asia. 
Costa opened 186 net new stores in the UK during the year, 
taking the total to 1,578. In addition to growing our store 
portfolio we also had a highly successful year with the growth 
of Costa Express which added 1,368 new units, driven by its 
partnership with Shell which saw the installation of around 
700 machines on its forecourts. There are now 2,560 Costa 
Express machines across the UK.
Costa EMEI and Costa Asia opened 138 new stores including 
its first stores in France, Cambodia, Thailand and Singapore. 
China remains an exciting opportunity and we opened 89 net 
new stores in the year taking the total to 253 in 28 cities,  
on track to achieve our target of 500 stores by 2016.
We are well on the way towards achieving our growth 
milestones of 3,500 stores globally, 3,000 Costa Express 
machines and £1.3 billion of system sales by 2016. We have 
now extended our Costa growth milestone to around  
£2 billion of system sales by 2018.
Good Together
Our Good Together programme runs throughout everything 
we do. Good Together is our corporate social responsibility 
programme which incorporates three pillars — Team and 
Community; Customer Wellbeing and Energy and 
Environment. All three pillars have achieved some great 
results in the year including raising over £2.3 million for  
our chosen charities of Great Ormond Street Hospital 
Children’s Charity (GOSHCC) and the Costa Foundation; 
diverting 93% of Hotels & Restaurants waste from landfill;  
and the introduction of nutritional information on Costa 
packaging in store and online. We are proud of the efforts  
we are making in this area and are working hard to achieve 
our 2017 targets (which can be found on page 9) to ensure  
we are a force for good in all the communities in which  
we operate.
We are taking our responsible sourcing policy to a new level. 
We have strengthened our testing and traceability regime  
for processed meat and have implemented the lessons 
learned from the horse meat contamination issues prevalent 
in the industry.

Teams
Across our 655 Premier Inns and 397 restaurants we employ 
29,000 people, serving millions of customers every month. 
Success is all about making everyday experiences feel 
special for our customers and we rely on our Winning Teams 
to do just that. That’s why it’s so vital that our teams are 
highly engaged and passionate about what they do.
We measure their engagement through our six–monthly  
Your Say survey and in the most recent survey we achieved  
our highest ever response rate and engagement scores.

  Engagement Engagement Response Response

Hotels & Restaurants 75% 72% 96% 87%
Your Say is a tool that lets us know the things that matter 
most to our teams and we use the results to develop specific 
action plans. One of the priorities identified is to have better 
two–way communication and we have taken a number of 
steps to address this, including new listening forums. These 
have taken place in over 100 sites enabling team members to 
have a voice and speak freely with the leaders of the business 
and to share ideas for improvement.
Leadership  
We are focused on building our talent and succession pipeline 
in all regions and countries where we operate to meet our 
ambitious growth plans.
We continue to run our very successful two day leadership 
development programme, designed to accelerate our leaders’ 
understanding of how they can contribute to future success. 
To date some 450 leaders have benefitted from this intensive 
focus on their personal development, and this year all 112 
Premier Inn senior managers took part in the programme.
We have a number of graduate programmes running within 
operational teams and functional departments to help bring 
high calibre and high potential talent into the organisation. 
Our focus on building internal leadership and developing  
‘high potential’ individuals has ensured that 71% of 
management and senior appointments in the year came  
from internal promotions. 
Skills development 
Developing the skills and abilities of our teams is core to  
our strategy, to enable our people to achieve their ambitions, 
have a good sense of wellbeing at work and deliver great 
experiences to our millions of customers. In 2012/13 we 
significantly broadened our approach and are now reaching 
out into the communities in which we operate, supporting  
our Good Together goal to be a force for good.
We have hosted and taken part in several industry–led  
forums, ‘Big Conversations in Hospitality’, to focus on three 
areas: youth unemployment; apprenticeships; and work 
experience. This has resulted in 10,000 pledges from 
ourselves and other industry employers to offer jobs, 
experience and apprenticeships to young people. 
We secured funding from the Government’s Employer 
Ownership of Skills project to support our own programme, 
WISE (Whitbread Investing in Skills and Employment),  
which focuses on a number of initiatives including:
 building links with schools, colleges and universities;
 providing sustainable and inspirational work experience  
to young people;
 transitioning the unemployed into work; and
 developing a progression of apprenticeships.

Work placements
This year, we have started providing opportunities to young 
and unemployed people who may struggle to gain experience 
and access to employment. In total, 220 placements were 
completed with structured work experience for school 
students to give them experience working in a highly 
customer–focused environment. 
Apprenticeships
We were proud to win ‘Employer of the Year’ at the Hospitality 
Guild Apprenticeship Awards and were commended for an 
outstanding contribution to raising the profile of 
apprenticeships and raising skills across our industry. 
The number of apprenticeships completed in 2012/13  
was 415 and 2,613 qualifications were attained. Since we 
introduced apprenticeships in 2009, 650 have been completed 
alongside a total of 6,456 qualifications, which include  
awards for ‘Skills for Life’ and functional English and maths. 
Creating opportunities
Our ambitious growth plans, both in the UK and internationally, 
make Whitbread an exciting place to work with plenty of 
opportunities and we are proud of our ability to develop 
people and build exciting and diverse careers. 
This year we have appointed over 17,000 people into positions 
across the business including 657 management roles. Out of 
these over 1,100 were brand new jobs in newly opened sites. 
We have a target to ensure 50% of new roles go to people not 
in education, employment or training and have achieved 35%  
in our new site openings. 
Reward and recognition
The ‘Guest Promise’ rewards scheme, launched in 2011, is 
making a big difference to our teams and customer service. 
The scheme provides an incentive for all team members to 
make everyday experiences special for our customers and is 
based on achievement of their site’s customer Net Promoter 
Score targets.
Working everyday 
Gillian Shepherd and Nisha Jassal both 
joined the new Premier Inn Westﬁeld, 
Stratford and were recruited through  
Jobcentre Plus.
In the year we also launched the ‘My Rewards’ programme  
in our Restaurants business and will roll this out in Premier  
Inn in 2013/14. This industry–leading programme works by 
using re–loadable, pre–paid VISA debit cards for all reward 
payments.
We have a strong culture of recognition and celebrating 
success, which helps create an environment in which people 
see that their work is valued and are inspired to achieve.  
This year Restaurants recognised 100 ‘heroes’ in the business. 
This is a programme which will be run again this year to create 
even more ‘heroes’.

Quality product, Good Night Guarantee
Something that sets Premier Inn apart from our competitors  
is the quality of our rooms and hotels. This year we invested 
£103.1 million in maintenance, a significant part of which was  
in refurbishing around 6,000 rooms to ensure our hotels are  
in the best condition.
We are so confident in our product that we guarantee  
it with our ‘Good Night Guarantee’. Any guest who doesn’t  
enjoy a good night’s sleep is refunded their full night’s stay.
We run one of the largest guest satisfaction surveys in 
Europe, with 860,000 responses every year. This gives us 
invaluable insight into what our customers love and what they 
think we could improve upon. A great example where we have 
worked hard to improve the customer experience is on the 
level of noise in our hotels. We’ve run a number of projects 
looking at smarter ways to reduce noise.
Ready everyday 
Premier Inn prepares 37,000  
rooms every day.
Dynamic pricing
Our dynamic pricing model continues to evolve and enables 
us to manage demand and offer customers the best value.  
In the year we rolled out our two tier pricing system, Premier 
Flexible and Premier Saver, which gives customers a greater 
choice. The price sensitive customer can select a Saver rate, 
which has more restrictive cancellation terms, whilst the 
customer who values flexibility can book at the flexible rate, 
which can be cancelled up until the day of arrival and with  
a full refund. 
We are able to offer great value packages for customers.  
A good example is our new ‘Sleep, Park and Fly’ airport 
package which is available at Gatwick and Heathrow. This 
enables customers to book for one night and leave their  
car at the airport for a highly competitive rate.
With 60,000 people sleeping in our hotels a night  
and our restaurant teams serving 125,000 meals a day,  
it’s all about making these everyday experiences feel  
special for our customers. 
Largest network
Our large UK network means that we are able to meet the 
needs of our customers by being located in convenient 
places. Over the year we have opened 29 hotels, with  
4,242 net rooms. Of those, nine hotels were alongside  
a new joint site restaurant.
A key area for growth is London, where historically we have 
been under–represented. This year we have added 841 new 
rooms, which is 12% more capacity within Greater London.  
We now have hotels in some key locations including Leicester 
Square and in the City of London at Blackfriars. The Stratford 
Premier Inn, on the site of the new Westfield shopping centre 
and overlooking the Olympic Park, opened in time to 
welcome many thousands of Olympic guests and delegates. 
The UK hotel market
While the overall growth of the hotel market in the UK is 
expected to be slow, the branded budget sector continues  
to win share from independent operators, which gives  
us confidence in setting new milestones. We expect the 
independent market to decline from around 54% to 46%  
of the total hotel market while the branded budget sector 
rises from around 21% to 28%.

Happy everyday 
Premier Inn has received high guest 
recommend scores throughout this year.
A leading digital retailer
Premier Inn is now one of the UK’s leading digital retailers, 
with 83% of all our bookings made digitally, up from 76%  
last year. This has been driven by continued investment in 
marketing to encourage people to use the website, which has 
increased visits to 61 million in 2012/13. In March we launched 
our latest TV advert, with Lenny Henry. This helped drive 
‘spontaneous awareness’ to 71% in October, ahead of all our 
key competitors, and deliver an increase in web visits of 21%. 
Our new digital platforms are performing well with 29% of 
bookings made through mobile devices.
We continue to invest in our digital capability, building a 
dedicated team and enhanced infrastructure. We are working 
to improve both our search engine optimisation and the 
booking flow when a customer makes a reservation online. 
Brand awareness and loyalty
Premier Inn has topped the YouGov brand index for a  
fourth year running, and has been rated No. 1 for ‘best value 
hotel’ three years running. Popular with leisure and business 
customers alike, this year Premier Inn was voted the Best 
Leisure Hotel Chain and Best Budget Hotel Brand at the  
2012 British Travel Awards. 
Our business customers benefit from our ‘Business Account 
Card’, which enables them to control expenses in their 
organisation, whether they’re a company with ten or 10,000 
employees. Business Account represents 26% of all Premier 
Inn revenue and we now have 22,000 accounts. 82% of 
Business Account holders make the most of our ‘meal deals’ 
in the adjoining restaurant.
Building stronger restaurant brands
At every Premier Inn, customers can be sure to get great food 
and drink and we have 372 joint site restaurants that are next 
door to the hotel and operate under either the Beefeater Grill, 
Brewers Fayre, Table Table or Taybarns brand. 
In a highly value sensitive market our restaurant brands 
outperformed the competition and delivered our best ever 
customer satisfaction scores. This has been achieved by  
a significant reduction in customers scoring zero to six out  
of ten and an improvement in customers scoring nine or  
ten out of ten.
In the year, we completed the rollout of Buffet Place in 
Brewers Fayre sites, with 17 new Buffet Places opened.  
£3.6 million has been invested in refurbishing 36 restaurants 
and we are also continually innovating within our Beefeater 
Grill and Brewers Fayre brands, with new approaches to 
design, menus and customer environments.
Customer appeal
We increased the number of people eating in our restaurants 
by appealing to more and more customers with our great 
value menus, quality food and outstanding levels of service. 
We’re focused on making our teams really passionate about 
food, giving them the skills and knowledge they need to be 
able to ‘wow’ customers. We continue to develop our menus, 
introducing new dishes and concepts such as nachos topped 
with rump steak or paprika chicken and spicy cheese dipping 
sauce, Sunday Roast with mini joints from our chargrill  
and a new ‘Burgers and Hot Dogs’ buffet at Brewers Fayre.
Smile everyday 
We achieved 72.8% friendly service score  
in our Restaurants guest service survey.
Appealing to the local market is key to any restaurant’s 
success and we have focused on making sure each restaurant 
is actively promoting itself within its community. This entails 
much more prominent signage outside each site, targeted 
local promotions such as ‘Breakfast with Santa’ (which was  
a big success with families over Christmas) and a major drive  
to increase breakfast sales, which are up 16.6% year on year.

Joint site restaurants
We have a total of 397 restaurants, of which the majority  
are adjacent to a Premier Inn. The joint site model continues 
to provide significant benefits to Whitbread through offering 
a superior customer experience to both our hotel and 
restaurant guests. This translates into a higher guest 
recommend score leading to higher RevPAR in the adjacent 
hotel, delivering a better return on capital. 
International
Overseas, our four hotels in the Middle East and two hotels  
in India made good progress with like for like occupancy rising 
by 12% pts to 77% and like for like RevPAR growing 20% pts  
to £33. Our committed pipeline now consists of 12 hotels and 
eight signed memoranda of understanding as we continue  
to expand the Premier Inn brand across the Middle East, India 
and South East Asia, pursuing a more ‘asset light’ strategy.
Expanding everyday 
Whitbread’s Hotels & Restaurants network 
continues to grow with 655 Premier Inns 
and 397 restaurants.
During 2012/13 our Hotels & Restaurants business delivered  
a solid performance amid a challenging consumer market. 
Total sales grew by 9.7% and like for like sales by 2.8%. 
Underlying operating profit rose by 5.9% to £313.1 million 
and return on capital was maintained at 12.4%. 
Our strong cash flow generation allowed us to invest  
£158.2 million in growing our estate during the year. This, 
combined with our disciplined approach to deploying capital 
in both new hotels and restaurants, while maintaining our 
existing estate, allows us to grow profits and shareholder 
value year after year. 
Growth
During 2012/13 Premier Inn continued to win market share 
through opening 4,242 net new rooms and 29 hotels (net) 
taking our total number of rooms to 51,671. Our market share  
is around 7% of the total hotel market. This, combined with 
our committed pipeline of 10,000 rooms, puts us on track to 
reach our 2016 growth milestone of 65,000 rooms. We have 
now extended this growth milestone to c.75,000 UK Premier 
Inn rooms by 2018. The London hotel market, where we  
are under represented, remains a key focus for the Group, 
representing 40% of our committed pipeline, as we continue 
to increase the penetration of Premier Inn in the capital.  
In addition to our Premier Inn expansion, we also added ten 
new joint site restaurants during the year taking our total 
number of restaurants to 397.
While it is important that we deliver on our growth milestones, 
it is equally as important that we deliver a good return on 
capital. Our continuous focus on improving customer 
propositions combined with the key levers of dynamic pricing, 
digital, re–investment in our estate and the strength of our 
network drove like for like sales growth of 3.1% for Premier Inn 
during the period. Like for like revenue per available room 
(RevPAR), which is a key focus for Premier Inn, grew by 1.7% 
as we continued to outperform the Midscale and Economy 
sector, winning market share. 
Restaurants also delivered a positive performance for the  
year with like for like sales growth of 2.3%, outperforming the 
Coffer Peach industry benchmark. The growth in like for like 
sales has been driven by management actions and a focus  
on breakfast and coffee sales as well as careful revenue 
management.

Teams
We believe that if we create a great place to work for our 
team members this will help us to build Winning Teams  
to make everyday experiences special for our millions  
of Costa customers.
Costa uses Whitbread’s six–monthly team engagement 
survey, Your Say, to measure how well we are doing at 
building a great place to work.

Your Say
Costa had record Your Say scores this year, with 93% of 
people completing the survey and an overall engagement 
score of 83%, up from 78%.
We use Your Say to help us understand how it feels to work  
at Costa and have a rigorous action planning process at  
stores and in our support teams to learn from the results and 
continuously strive to make Costa a better place to work.
Communication is a key area where we know we can improve 
and our new team member website, Costa Share, provides  
a great way to share information and news. This year we used 
Costa Share to ask our team members to vote for their new 
uniform which proved very popular and highly engaging.  
We also run regular focus groups at stores and in regions  
to explore important topics with our teams.
Leadership 
At Costa we offer exciting leadership opportunities around 
the world and are committed to developing talented leaders. 
We do this in a number of ways. This year we rolled out  
a nationwide coaching scheme to all store managers and 
regional development managers to help them to engage and 
enable their teams better. More than 1,800 barista maestros, 
assistant managers and store managers have been developed 
through one of Costa’s management development training 
workshops and 25 store managers have progressed through 
our high potential development programme,  
Shining Stars.
Skills development
This year we launched a new barista induction and skills 
training programme to more than 13,000 team members 
across Costa Retail and Costa Enterprises to engage, focus 
and enable our baristas to deliver an unbeatable coffee 
experience. 
The quality of our coffee and expertise of our baristas  
is vital to Costa’s success. This year we focused on further 
developing the knowledge of our skills trainers in the sensorial 
analysis of espresso, which has led to their accreditation by 
the International Institute of Coffee Tasters.
We have given a facelift to our Lambeth Training Academy 
with new, more advanced equipment and state of the art 
technology for the students to experience and learn from.
Job opportunities
With our ambitious growth plans, opening a store almost 
every day around the world, Costa is creating jobs and careers 
for thousands of people. In the UK, new openings of Costa 
Retail company–owned stores have created 904 new jobs  
in 2012/13, whilst our franchise and delivery partners have 
added many more.

Our baristas make an average of more  
than 850,000 cups of coffee a day.

Career progression
Harriet Mason started her career with Costa in August  
2001 as a barista. Using her skills and expertise gained 
through progressing at a store level, Harriet’s passion for 
development led her to being nominated as a high potential 
store manager and considered for an associate retail 
development management role. After shining at the 
assessments, Harriet was one of two appointments made. 
This allowed her to take the next step in her career and 
develop as a leader in a multi–site role with responsibility  
for ten stores in Scotland. Now a retail development 
manager with responsibility for more than 20 stores,  
Harriet continues to be an inspiration to her team and  
peers, constantly stretching herself in her role and looking 
for the next challenge to strengthen her leadership skills  
and style even further. 
Opportunities to share in Costa’s success 
Pay for progression 
Since implementing pay for progression in our UK Retail  
stores there has been major shift in the way we reward  
our baristas after they complete their basic training.  
We continue to pay above National Minimum Wage and  
we also offer an incentive scheme called Feel Good that  
all our baristas can participate in.
Reward and recognition
Feel Good allows baristas to earn points and rewards for 
delivering great customer service. In 2012/13 we awarded  
80 million Feel Good points to more than 8,400 team 
members and, at present, 70% of our store teams are 
registered on the scheme. Points are awarded on a quarterly 
basis against the customer measure, Listen and Learn, and  
six–monthly against like for like sales. They can then be 
redeemed online for a wide range of items from musical 
instruments to experience days. 
Other ways in which we reward and recognise our teams 
include campaign incentives, introduced at the beginning  
of our summer and Christmas campaigns to improve  
team engagement, enhance the customer experience  
and drive sales.
Across all levels of the business, individuals and teams  
are recognised through the use of ‘Grazie’ cards, which give  
a personalised ‘thank you’ message, and recognition pins  
in the form of flying coffee beans. Many of these individuals 
and teams are also celebrated at award events held across  
the business.
Costa Barista of the Year 
Every year Costa baristas from around the world get to 
showcase their coffee making talents at the Barista of the 
Year competition. The grand final is a two day competition, 
testing their technical and coffee knowledge. This year’s 
winner was Victoria Stewart from a Costa store in St Andrews.

Making Costa the easy choice for customers
We place a lot of focus on making it easy to choose Costa  
by investing in growing our store network and extending  
the ways we sell coffee to our customers.
In the UK alone, in 2012/13 we opened 186 stores of which 97 
were equity and 89 were individual and corporate franchises. 
We also opened another four drive–thrus, taking the total to 
nine and we have a solid pipeline for further drive–thrus in 
2013/14 and beyond. The drive–thru concept is proving very 
popular with customers.
Choice everyday 
Our drive–thru stores offer customers  
a new way to get a cup of Costa coffee.
Costa Express has been another highly successful innovation. 
It offers customers another place to buy their favourite cup  
of coffee. We have also introduced ‘Costa at home’, which 
now enables customers to make a cup of Costa coffee 
themselves.
Internationally, the Costa brand is in the process of 
establishing itself within key markets, with China offering  
the biggest opportunity for growth. In 2012/13 we opened  
89 stores in China, bringing our total to over 250 stores in  
28 cities. In total we opened 138 stores across Costa EMEI  
and Costa Asia.
Costa is one of the few brands on the UK high street that  
is consistently achieving great like for like sales growth  
and expanding at a rapid pace. We believe this success  
is thanks to our commitment and focus on always putting  
the customer at the heart of everything we do.
No. 1 UK coffee shop brand
For the third year in a row, Costa has been recognised  
as the UK’s No. 1 coffee brand by Allegra Strategies.  
Their independent survey of over 5,000 adults reported 
that 41% of the UK population voted Costa as their  
favourite coffee shop brand, versus 26% for Starbucks. 
YouGov’s usage and awareness study also showed that  
Costa was the UK’s most popular coffee shop as shown  
in the graph below.

A key factor in helping to drive awareness has been Costa’s

was launched in October 2012 and has seen a very positive 
response with first mention awareness up by 5% pts and 
overall brand warmth up by 2% pts.

Best quality coffee
As well as choice, customers are also looking for a great 
quality cup of coffee and at Costa we are passionate about 
only serving the very best, hand–made by our specially  
trained baristas.
Our award–winning roastery in Lambeth roasts 7,500 tonnes 
of green coffee a year and supplies every Costa store  
around the globe, with the exception of our stores in India. 
The Roastery was recently accredited with an ISO 50001 
certificate recognising reductions in carbon emissions and is 
the only roastery in the world to have achieved this accolade.
Taste everyday 
Our unique Mocha Italia blend has  
been roasted in Lambeth for 42 years.
A warm and welcoming store design
We are proud of our store design and ambience. Our baristas 
do a tremendous job creating a warm and welcoming 
atmosphere and we put a lot of effort into making sure the 
design and layout of the stores is equally warm and welcoming.
In 2012/13 we started to roll out our new ‘evolution’ design  
across the estate and completed 120 re–images in the year, 
with an investment of £18.2 million in refurbishment and 
maintenance. In addition to these refurbishments we have  
also opened 109 new stores incorporating the ‘evolution’ 
design this year.
We are also using the ‘evolution’ store design for new 
openings overseas. In China we have opened five ‘Metro’ 
stores and nine ‘Bake Off’ stores, where we are trialling  
the concept of baristas cooking certain dishes in store  
to create fresh baked pastries and savoury dishes. 
Developing new food and drink products
Over the course of the year Costa has launched a number  
of new products including Cortado, Caffé Caramella and  
Chai Latte. 
We also introduced a number of new flavours to our Ice  
Cold Costa range, including three lemonade–based drinks. 
Supported by strong point of sale advertising, Ice Cold  
Costa proved popular with UK customers. 
In Europe, innovative new products such as the rosemary  
and kalmata olive bread are selling well, whilst in China 
western products are the biggest sellers with tiramisu and 
hazelnut latte cake being the most popular.
Using customer insight to drive customer satisfaction
Our ‘Listen and Learn’ customer insight programme has been 
a driving force in Costa’s outperformance. Providing real time 
customer feedback to each UK store inspires our teams to 
deliver great customer service, linking them directly to what 
customers are saying about their experience. This provides  
a snapshot to the team of what is going well and what 
opportunities they have to delight customers even further. 
The impact on driving team engagement as well as improving 
service quality is tremendous.
In 2012/13 Costa achieved an increase in Net Promoter  
Score, with one of the highest scoring areas being ‘friendliness 
of staff’.
Loyalty card 
The Costa Coffee Club continues to go from strength to 
strength with two million active users of the card. The scheme 
continues to drive loyalty with the number of visits per quarter 
up 4% year on year and average transaction value also up 4% 
year on year. As a result total spend through the Club is up 
20% year on year. 
During the year we launched the Costa Coffee Club app  
and integrated it onto Costa’s Facebook page, which means 
members can now check their points balance, manage their 
card and report it lost or stolen all via Facebook. Our last 
promotion on the Coffee Card app saw almost 32,000  
people log in to their accounts using Facebook across  
three days in January.
Connecting everyday 
Costa’s Facebook fans are up 269% and are 
set to hit one million next year, making it one  
of the top ﬁve largest sites within hospitality.

Growth
During the year we opened 89 new stores in China taking  
our total number of stores to 253 in 28 cities. This puts  
us on track to achieve our target of 500 stores by 2016.
Making Costa convenient
In addition to our store portfolio, we provide access to Costa 
through a number of different channels including Wholesale, 
Costa Express and ‘Costa at home’. Costa Express, which 
targets the self–serve coffee bar market, had a highly 
successful year adding 1,368 new units following a successful 
partnership with Shell for the installation of around 700 units. 
We ended the year with 2,560 units. Our wholesale business 
also made good progress and, following the successful launch  
of our ‘Costa at home’ range, we continue to make progress  
in a nascent but fast growing category.

Costa has added 1,368 new Costa Express 
units to its portfolio.
Costa produced another outstanding performance  
during the year, with total sales increasing by 24.1% driven  
by good like for like growth and a strong store opening 
programme. 
Total system sales, which are sales derived from Costa– 
owned and franchise stores, were up 22.6% to £1.0 billion.  
This puts us on track to achieve our 2016 growth milestone  
of £1.3 billion of system sales. Costa Express had another 
strong performance with the addition of 1,368 units taking  
our total number of units to 2,560. 
Following a strong top line performance, underlying operating 
profit increased by 29.3% to £90.1 million. Once again, a 
disciplined approach to capital deployment combined with 
strong cash flow generation has increased return on capital  
by 2.3% pts to 34.7%. 
Growth
During 2012/13 we continued to invest in strengthening  
our position as the UK’s leading coffee shop as well as 
expanding in selected international markets where we can 
build significant market share. In the UK we opened 186  
net new stores taking the total to 1,578 and internationally  
we opened 138 net new stores taking the total to 949.  
This takes our total worldwide store numbers to 2,527.  
We recently announced a new 2018 milestone to get to 
around £2 billion of system sales. 
To facilitate our growth we use a range of ownership models 
such as equity, franchise and joint ventures which we currently 
operate in a total of 29 countries across the world. This not 
only helps us in delivering on our expansion plans, but also 
helps us to focus on driving like for like growth across our 
equity estate and joint ventures. During the year we delivered 
another strong performance, with like for like sales growth  
of 6.8% across our equity estate in the UK. This is driven by 
our continuous focus on innovation, investment in the brand 
and customer propositions. 
International
We made good progress during the year, with our franchise 
business in the Middle East and India continuing to perform 
well. However, progress in our Eastern and Southern 
European markets was more difficult due to weak consumer 
confidence resulting from the ongoing crisis in the Eurozone. 
China remains an exciting opportunity for Costa where we 
operate two joint ventures.

Key 
Performance 
Indicators
Our key performance indicators are 
based on the strategic framework  
of the Company — Winning Teams, 
Customer Heartbeat, Profitable 
Growth and Good Together. Behind 
each of these headings are clear and 
measurable targets which together 
make up our balanced scorecard  
or WINcard as we call it (Whitbread  
In Numbers). It is used throughout  
the Company. Every hotel, restaurant  
and coffee shop has its own WINcard. 
All support centres, each business  
and the Group as a whole have their 
own WINcards. Every month the results 
are published throughout the Group  
so that everyone knows exactly how 
they are doing against the key targets  
for the year.
As these are key strategic measures  
a number of them form an important 
part of the incentive schemes for our 
teams. Details of how the executive 
directors are rewarded for their 
WINcard performance are described  
in the remuneration report on page 57.
The WINcard targets are set at the 
beginning of each year and agreed  
with the Remuneration Committee. 
They are set at or above the level 
achieved in the previous year to  
improve performance. In general  
a green WINcard is achieved where  
the performance is better than  
both target and the previous year.  
An amber score is for performance  
which is better than the prior year  
but below target and a red score  
is for a result below the previous year.

Winning Teams
Team engagement
Engagement measures how  
our teams feel about working for  
the Company. We find out by  
asking everyone in the Company  
to complete a survey twice a year  
that asks questions that give us  
a very clear idea as to how they  
are feeling at that time. 
Team turnover
We measure the percentage of  
our team members who leave the 
business during the year. For example,  
if we had team turnover of 50%  
that would mean that half had left 
during the year and had to be replaced.
Why this is important
We want our people to enjoy what  
they do and to know we will work  
to improve things if they tell us they  
are not happy. We also know that the 
happier our teams feel about their  
work the better they will serve our 
customers. We will attract as well  
as retain great people if we can show  
high levels of engagement. 
Why this is important
We aim to keep turnover as low  
as possible as this means that we  
have more settled and consistent  
teams who will serve their customers 
better. We also save money on 
recruitment and training if we can 
retain team members.

Health & Safety
Nothing could be more important  
than the safety of our teams and  
our customers. Independent audits  
are carried out throughout the  
year to check that standards are  
being maintained with certain key 
areas resulting in automatic failure  
if they are not met.
Brand standards
Our customers rightly expect  
a consistently high standard  
of service and physical  
surroundings in our sites.  
We have developed brand  
standards, which are  
appropriate to the relevant  
business and not directly  
comparable to each other.
Brand performance
With our aim to make everyday 
experiences special it is vital  
that we have a robust way of 
measuring how our customers  
rate our performance in terms  
of recommendations and  
preference over other brands. 
Why this is important
Our people have a right to work  
in a safe environment and our 
customers rightly expect us to  
look after them when they choose  
to sleep, eat or drink with us.  
A significant health and safety  
failure would also affect confidence  
in our business.
Why this is important
We know that our customers have  
a choice when they are booking  
a hotel or choosing a restaurant  
or cup of coffee and that we have

Profitable Growth
Profit
As with all businesses we measure  
our financial success by the profits  
we make through our growing  
brands and operating our businesses 
efficiently. A budget is agreed with  
the Board each year which sets  
a target profit level.
Like for like sales growth
We closely follow the sales  
growth performance of those  
hotels, restaurants and coffee  
shops that have been open  
for more than a year. 
Market performance/Growth
Our strategy is based on the  
profitable growth of our brands  
which we measure in terms  
of our sales per available room  
compared to our competitors  
in hotels and the number  
of net new stores in Costa. 
Why this is important
Recognising that our shareholders have 
a choice in investing their money we 
need to be able to demonstrate that  
our businesses can produce sustainable 
profit growth. This should mean that  
the underlying value of the Company 
will increase and dividends can be  
paid in line with that growth.
Why this is important
While we are investing so much in the 
organic growth of Hotels & Restaurants 
and Costa we need to keep a close eye 
on how the mature parts of the business 
are performing. This enables us to make 
better investment decisions in terms  
of our new developments as well as 
being able to react to shorter–term 
performance trends.
Why this is important
We need to be able to understand  
how we are performing on a constant 
basis to show our shareholders how  
we are performing against the rest of 
the market and to develop our strategy 
accordingly. 
How we have done in 2012/13 
As shown earlier in this report we  
grew our Group underlying profit  
before tax by 11.4% last year with  
Hotels & Restaurants growing its profits 
by 5.9% and Costa by 29.3%. These 
were very good results, achieved  
in a difficult economic environment. 
 
 
 
How we have done in 2012/13 
The strength of our brands has  
meant we have beaten our like  
for like targets across the Company  
with Group at 3.7%, Hotels & 
Restaurants at 2.8% and  
Costa at 6.8%. 
How we have done in 2012/13 
We had a RevPAR premium of 6.2% 
against our hotel competitors last  
year and we opened 324 net new  
Costa stores worldwide.

Returns on investment 
A crucial factor in measuring our 
performance is how well we have  
invested our shareholders’ money.  
We calculate this by dividing the 
underlying profit of an asset or  
business by the capital value of  
the asset it has been invested in. 
Carbon consumption/Waste to landfill
Our corporate responsibility 
programme covers a number  
of areas against which we measure 
ourselves. Hotels & Restaurants  
has a carbon reduction target and 
Costa has a target to reduce waste  
to landfill.
Why this is important
Our investors want to be able to  
judge how well we are using their 
money in comparison to other 
investments that they could make.  
We also want to be able to compare 
the performance of different types  
of businesses and assets to focus our  
own plans, and measuring returns  
helps us to do so.
Why this is important
Companies have a responsibility  
to reduce their impact on the 
environment which we fully endorse. 
There are also clear economic  
benefits in reducing carbon 
consumption primarily through  
reduced energy bills.
How we have done in 2012/13 
The Group returns grew from  
13.6% to 14% last year. Hotels & 
Restaurants return on capital was 
maintained at 12.4% and Costa  
grew returns to 34.7%.
How we have done in 2012/13 
We remain on track for our Group 
target of reducing our relative carbon 
use by 25% by 2017. The colder  
weather this year made this harder  
to achieve. Costa now diverts 59%  
of its waste from landfill.
Return on capital is an important 
indicator and is a key measure for the 
Company’s Long Term Incentive Plan, 
but is not on the WINcard.

Whitbread has delivered another 
strong ﬁnancial performance, with 
revenue for the year at £2,030.0 million 
up by 14.2% on last year, underlying 
proﬁts before tax up 11.4% to  
£356.5 million and operating cash  
ﬂow before pension payments  
up 10.0% to £526.0 million. 
Hotels & Restaurants 
Revenue rose to £1,360.1 million, up 9.7%, with Premier Inn 
growing by 13.1% to £853.8 million and Restaurants by  
4.5% to £506.3 million. Premier Inn and Restaurants both 
benefitted from new openings with 4,242 net additional 
Premier Inn rooms and ten new restaurants on joint sites. 
Although Premier Inn International did not open any new 
rooms in the year, it benefitted from a full year of sales  
on the 375 net rooms opened in the previous year. 
Like for like sales growth for UK Hotels and Restaurants  
was 2.8%, with Premier Inn at 3.1%. This growth was driven  
by maintaining the quality of the rooms, with 5,979 rooms 
refurbished in the year, investment in our online distribution 
and the continued development of dynamic pricing. This 
enabled us to outperform our Midscale and Economy sector 
competitors, with RevPAR growth of 1.7%. 
Restaurants like for like sales grew 2.3%, led by improvements 
to our menu offering and the growing customer base staying 
at the adjacent hotels. Through our continued focus on the 
customer and by delivering value for money, the number  
of like for like covers increased 3.0% compared to last year.
Costa
Costa’s revenue increased to £672.4 million up by 24.1% on 
last year. Costa opened 324 net new coffee shops in the year, 
with a net 186 in the UK and net 138 in overseas markets. Like 
for like sales in the UK grew 6.8% as we benefitted from the 
innovation in new food and beverage ranges and the growing 
customer preference for the Costa brand. Costa Enterprises 
also grew strongly with 1,368 net new Costa Express coffee 
machines taking the total to 2,560.

Revenue 2,030.0 1,778.0 14.1
Profits
Whitbread’s underlying profit before tax at £356.5 million  
was up by 11.4% on last year. Underlying profit before tax 
excludes the pension interest charge, the amortisation  
of acquired intangibles and exceptional items.
Both business segments increased underlying operating  
profit with Costa up 29.3% to £90.1 million and Hotels  
and Restaurants up 5.9% to £313.1 million maintaining the  
Group’s strong performance over the last five years.
Hotels and Restaurants profit in the UK was up 6.3% to  
£319.2 million. Profit growth was lower than sales growth  
of 9.7%, predominantly due to the higher rent costs as we 
increase the mix of leasehold properties. Rent costs increased 
to £69.5 million, up 26% on last year which was approximately 
in line with sales growth from leasehold properties. 
International hotel losses were £6.1 million, with the continued 
planned investment in establishing our South East Asia 
operations and preparing our Middle East business for  
further expansion. This was partially offset by an improvement  
in our trading results, particularly in the Middle East. 
Costa’s strong performance was led by the UK where profits 
increased 34.7% to £87.7 million with good growth in both  
UK Retail and Enterprises. Costa’s international profits 
reduced to £2.4 million from £4.6 million as we invested  
in our future growth. We experienced good profit progression 
in the Middle East and from our European franchises.  
In China, where we increased investment in our infrastructure, 
we expect to achieve profitability on a monthly basis in the  
first half of the year. The adverse economic environment  
in Poland resulted in a like for like sales decline, reducing  
our profitability year on year. We expect the Polish market  
to remain tough over the next year and we will be affected  
by a recent increase in VAT rates on milk based drinks that  
will raise the VAT charge by roughly £2 million.
Central costs were £23.1 million, up £3.2 million on last year, 
principally arising from increased share based payment  
costs, a significant part of which was attributable to the 
strong performance of the share price during the year. 
Total profit for the year after tax and exceptional items  
was £301.3 million, up 13.3% on last year.

Whitbread Annual Report and Accounts 2012/13 30 Whitbread Annual Report and Accounts 2012/13 Finance Director’s review 31
Interest 
The underlying interest charge for the year was £23.6 million, 
a reduction of £1.7 million compared to last year. This resulted 
from the decrease in the level of fixed interest rate debt 
following the maturity of a number of fixed rate swaps,  
which lowered the underlying effective interest rate to 4.8% 
from 5.7%.
The total pre–exceptional interest cost amounted to £41.6 
million and included the IAS 19 pension charge of £18.0 million 
(2011/12: £14.0 million). This charge represents the difference 
between the expected return on scheme assets and the 
interest cost of the scheme liabilities. In 2013/14 this charge is 
expected to increase to approximately £26.0 million following 
the changes to IAS 19 (2011) that limit the expected return  
on investments that are applied to the scheme’s assets to the 
same rate as that applied to the scheme’s liabilities.
Exceptional items 
Exceptional items for the year amounted to a benefit of  
£52.1 million. Full details are set out in Note 5 to the financial 
statements.
There are three significant items. The first, a £15.3 million 
profit on the sale of property, investments and businesses, 
predominantly relates to the sale and leaseback transaction 
undertaken in December 2012, which gave rise to a profit on 
disposal of £19.7 million. This transaction is a useful reminder 
of the value created from our freehold developments and  
the strong asset backing within Whitbread’s balance sheet. 
The second item relates to the refund of tax and release 
of accruals, which had been charged in previous periods,  
of £13.5 million and the related interest of £10.8 million. The  
third major exceptional item is the release of £16.8 million of 
deferred tax liability, predominantly due to the reduction in 
corporation tax rates to 23% following the enactment of the 
Finance Act 2012.
Taxation
Underlying tax for the year amounts to £91.5 million at an 
effective tax rate of 25.7%, which compares to 26.4% last year. 
The major reason for the change in tax rate is the reduction  
in corporation tax rates for 2013, partly offset by increased 
overseas tax losses for which the Group has recognised no  
tax benefit.
Earnings per share
Underlying basic earnings per share for the year is 150.45p  
up 12.0% on last year and underlying diluted earnings per 
share for the year is 149.19p up 11.3% on last year. 
Further details can be found in Note 7.
Dividend
The recommended final dividend is 37.90p representing an 
increase on last year of 12.3% making a total dividend for the 
year of 57.40p up 12.0% on last year, in line with the Group’s 
basic earnings per share growth.

statements adding back the pension payments.
Cash generated from operations before pension payments 
increased by 10.0% to £526.0 million. This strong cash  
flow is enabling Whitbread to fund its growth from internal 
resources. Investment in capital expenditure was up  
£35.7 million on last year to £343.6 million, ensuring that the 
Group continued to grow its market share through new site 
developments and investments whilst improving its existing 
property estate. In addition, contributions to capital and loans 
to joint ventures increased by £3.2 million to £4.8 million.
As mentioned above, during the year the Group successfully 
completed a sale and leaseback transaction of seven sites 
with proceeds of £51.0 million in cash. The transaction 
provided funds, alongside the operating cash flow, to support 
the investment of £134.0 million in new freehold properties  
in the year. 
The payment into the pension fund was £45.7 million, a 
reduction of £49.7 million on last year, following the decision 
made in 2011/12 to make a one off advanced payment of 
£25 million. In 2013/14 the pension deficit payments will revert 
back to the original 2011 triennial scheduled payments of  
£55 million together with c.£9 million contribution from the 
properties held as security in favour of the pension scheme.

Dividend payments amounted to £77.8 million. In the year 
there was a significantly higher take up of the scrip dividend 
than last year at 17.7%. The gross dividend payment without 
the scrip dividend would have been £94.5 million.
Our underlying effective profit and loss corporation tax rate 
was 25.7% for the year. On a cash basis, the Group benefitted 
from a refund of approximately £18.4 million in the year 
relating to overpayments of taxes in previous years and  
from the timing of scheduled tax payments, as we anticipate 
that in the first half of next year we will pay approximately  
£38 million in respect of this year to HMRC. It is not  
expected that material refunds will be received in 2013/14. 
As a result of the free cash inflow the net debt as at  
28 February 2013 reduced by £33.2 million to £471.1 million 
(2011/12: £504.3 million).
Capital expenditure
The Group’s cash capital expenditure was £343.6 million, with 
£261.3 million in Hotels & Restaurants and £80.1 million in Costa. 
Capital expenditure is split between expansionary expenditure 
(which includes the acquisition and development of properties) 
and maintenance expenditure. 
Expansionary expenditure increased by £24.1 million to  
£220.1 million. Of this, £158.2 million related to Hotels & 
Restaurants, supporting the 4,272 gross new room openings 
and the ten new restaurants in the year. As mentioned  
earlier, this included an investment of £134.0 million in  
freehold property. 
Value everyday 
Underlying basic earnings per share 
increased this year to 150.45p, up 12%.
Freehold properties are Whitbread’s preferred route to  
market, where possible, for Hotels and Restaurants. They 
provide operational flexibility to develop the property to 
specific requirements and give financial benefits in retaining 
more of the value created from the hotel’s performance, 
avoiding inflationary rent and capturing development gains. 
They also offer a choice on how to fund the future growth,  
by capitalising on these development profits through the 
option of sale and leasebacks where the proceeds can be 
recycled back into new freehold properties.
Costa spent £61.9 million on the opening of its 404 gross  
new coffee shops.
Maintenance capital was £123.5 million. A significant amount  
of this was spent on ensuring our products continue to meet 
customers’ expectations and stay ahead of the competition.  
To that effect £103.1 million was spent on maintenance in  
Hotels & Restaurants and £18.2 million in Costa, a considerable 
amount of which supported the 5,979 rooms and 120 coffee 
shops refurbished in the year.
Our current plans for 2013/14 indicate that the Group’s  
capital expenditure will be approximately £350 million.  
This is particularly sensitive to the timing of transactions  
and opportunities that arise within the freehold market.
Pensions
As at 28 February 2013 there was an IAS 19 pension deficit  
of £541.7 million, a reduction of £57.0 million year on year.  
The main reasons for the reduction in the deficit were the 
increase in the value of assets under investment and the cash 
contributions of £45.7 million from the Company which were 
only partially offset by increased liabilities due to the higher 
inflation rate assumption. 
In the year, the triennial pension agreement between the 
Company and the Pension Trustee for the year ended  
31 March 2011 was completed. Under the agreement there 
were no significant amendments to the Company’s cash 
contributions to the scheme as agreed under the 2008 
agreement. As part of the agreement, further security in the 
form of a charge over properties with a market value totalling 
£180 million was agreed to be given in favour of the pension 
scheme. This takes the total value of property security in 
favour of the scheme to £408 million.
From next year there are two changes to pension accounting 
standards that affect the Group’s accounts. Firstly, the 
changes under IAS 19 (2011), as mentioned in the Interest 
section above, will increase the pension finance charge from 
£18 million to approximately £26 million. Secondly, certain 
pension administration costs of c.£2.8 million will be reported 
through operating profit rather than as part of the pension 
finance income.

Delivered everyday 
We have delivered an increased  
return on capital of 14%.
Funding and financial status
Whitbread aims to maintain its financial position and capital 
structure consistent with retaining its investment grade status. 
To this end, we work within the financial framework of net 
debt to EBITDA (pension and lease adjusted) of less than  
3.5 times. 
The Group remains well funded with a broad source of funds 
and a good spread of maturity dates. The principal sources  
of funds are: 
 the Group’s strong cash flow from operations, which it  
uses as its primary source of funds for capital expenditure 
to achieve growth milestones;
 Whitbread also enters into leasehold agreements to fund  
its expansion. Although the Group prefers the benefits that 
freehold properties provide to its hotel business, leasehold 
agreements are less capital intensive and allow us to gain 
distribution in locations where freehold acquisitions may 
not be available, such as in many city centres and in 
particular in London. Leases are also more suitable to the 
Costa business model where short leases allow flexibility  
in reacting to the changing dynamics of the high street.  
At the year–end, with the growth in Costa Retail and the  
mix of leasehold hotel rooms increasing 5% pts to 31% of the 
estate, the undiscounted lease commitment for the Group 
as at 28 February 2013 was £2,460.5 million (2011/12: 
£1,987.2 million);
 sale and leaseback transactions are used to release capital, 
allowing Whitbread to crystallise profit on property 
investments and recycle the proceeds into new freehold 
property; and
 the Group has funded its medium term requirements 
through £258.2 million of US Private Placements maturing 
between 2017 and 2022, together with a £650.0 million 
bank revolving credit facility maturing in December 2016.
 
Return on capital
A prime focus for the Group is return on capital. The Group 
calculates return on capital by dividing underlying profit 
before interest and tax for the year by net assets at the 
balance sheet date adding back debt, taxation liabilities and 
the pension deficit. In the year, return on capital increased  
by 0.4% pts to 14.0%. 
The improvement was a result of Costa’s strong trading 
resulting in a return on capital improvement of 2.3% pts  
to 34.7% and its increased proportion of the Group.
Within Hotels & Restaurants, where strong returns were 
maintained at 12.4%, there was progress on the underlying 
trading returns and there was a benefit from the higher 
proportion of leasehold properties. This progress was offset 
by the investments we made in the Hotels & Restaurants  
fast growing digital channels, the Restaurants management 
team and the infrastructure of the international hotels.

Risk 
management
The starting point for the assessment 
of risks at Whitbread is the Company’s 
business model. Risks are linked  
to each component of the business 
model as shown below.
Structure
The structure of the risk management process at Whitbread  
is shown in the diagram on page 35. Both Whitbread Hotels  
& Restaurants and Costa maintain risk matrices aligned to 
their own business model. These matrices analyse the risks  
to the achievement of each business’s strategic goals and 
prioritise those risks as low, medium or high based on both 
the likelihood and potential impact of each risk. The matrices, 
together with controls and mitigating actions, are reviewed  
on a regular basis by the management board of each business.
The outputs of the process carried out by the businesses  
form the basis of the risk matrix for the Group. The most 
significant business–level risks are included in the Group risk 
matrix, together with other risks that are specific to the Group. 
The Group risk matrix is reviewed on a quarterly basis by  
the Board and annually by the Audit Committee.
The process:
 links risks to the Group’s business model and strategic 
objectives;
 analyses risks based on likelihood and potential impact;
 outlines key controls and mitigating actions; and
 ensures that risks and controls are reviewed quarterly  
and updated as necessary.
The risk and control matrices form the basis of the annual 
assurance plan, which provides for the independent testing  
of controls and mitigating actions by Ernst & Young, NSF  
(an independent health and safety auditing company),  
the Company’s internal control evaluation process or PwC  
as part of the operational audit programme.

The current status
In total, there were 21 risks (2012: 18 risks) identified on  
the Group risk matrix considered by the Audit Committee  
in March 2013. After taking account of the controls and 
mitigation plans the Audit Committee and the Board 
considered that 15 of the risks either had a low likelihood  
of occurring or a low potential impact. For this reason,  
these 15 risks have not been categorised as principal risks  
for the purposes of this Report.
The six principal risks identified, together with details  
of controls, mitigation and assurance plans are summarised 
on pages 36 and 37. Two of these risks are considered to have 
a high likelihood of occurring. The first is the risk of a serious 
food provenance issue, which has increased during the year 
due to the Europe–wide problems with the processed meat 
supply chain. This issue has been given significant focus  
and we have strengthened our testing and traceability regime 
as a result. The other risk deemed to have a high likelihood  
is the loss of key employees who have been targeted by 
recruitment consultants. We have taken action to ensure that 
our key employees understand the benefits of staying with 
the Company, both in terms of development opportunities 
and long–term remuneration benefits.

Corporate

Introduction from Anthony Habgood, Chairman
Corporate governance is something that touches all aspects 
of our business and affects all of our employees in many 
different ways. Whitbread is committed to maintaining high 
standards in this area to ensure that the Company is managed 
with integrity and transparency.
Although corporate governance flows through all of our 
operations, the Board takes responsibility for leading on high 
standards of accountability and ethical behaviour. The 2010 
UK Corporate Governance Code (‘the Code’) was applicable 
in 2012/13 and is the standard against which we measured 
ourselves. In order to ensure our compliance we undertook  
a thorough review of our arrangements including our:
 overall compliance with the Code with respect to business 
and corporate practices;
 matters reserved to the Board; and
 terms of reference for each of the three Board committees.
The results of this review were presented at the January 
Board meeting and formally adopted by the Board. We are 
pleased to report that the Company complied with all the 
provisions of the Code throughout the financial year.
The 2012 Corporate Governance Code (‘the 2012 Code’)  
will apply to the Company in 2013/14, but we have decided  
to adopt some of the new principles and provisions early to 
ensure that we maintain our high standards. These changes 
are reflected in the reports of the Audit and Nomination 
committees which can be found on pages 47 and 48.
During the year, other key activities have included:
 an internal evaluation of the Board;
 a talent review and succession plan for key executive  
roles; and
 the appointment of two new executive directors.
Diversity and equality have always been core values at 
Whitbread. The Board believes that diversity is highly 
important, not only for board effectiveness but for the 
effectiveness of the Company as a whole. Whitbread  
appoints members of the Board on the basis of qualification 
and merit and does not discriminate on any grounds.  
We are committed to an active policy of equal opportunities 
and embrace diversity at all levels.
Details of how Whitbread has applied the main and 
supporting principles of the Code with regard to remuneration 
can be found in the remuneration report on pages 49 to 63. 
Details of the membership and activities of the Remuneration 
Committee can be found on page 52.
Maintaining high standards of corporate governance is key  
to supporting our financial performance and protecting your 
Company. Simon Barratt, our General Counsel and Company 
Secretary, provides further details in the pages ahead on  
how Whitbread complied this year in the following areas:
 the Board;
 shareholder relations;
 internal control; and
 Board committees.
Corporate governance is an area that continues to change 
and develop. Next year we will be reviewing the way in which 
the Audit Committee reports to the Board on how it has 
carried out its responsibilities and developing the new form  
of remuneration report.
We keep all developments under review and will always  
aim for a level of governance that is appropriate and relevant 
to the Company.

The Board 
Who is on the Board of Directors?
There are 13 members of the Board including the Chairman,

Two new directors have been appointed during the course of 
the year. In November 2012, Nicholas Cadbury was appointed 
to the Board as the new Group Finance Director and Louise 
Smalley joined the Board as Group Human Resources Director. 
While each of Nicholas and Louise have expertise within their 
function, they also use their experience to contribute to wider 
debates at Board level including on operational matters. 
As you can see below, we have provided information on the 
mix of skills and experience represented on the Board. The 
Board brings together individuals with a diverse range of 
experience, which contributes to a positive culture of mutual 
respect and constructive challenge.
Biographical details of each of the directors can be found  
on pages 40 and 41.

What were the key activities of the Board this year?
The Board generally holds meetings at monthly intervals 
during the year and on an ad hoc basis as and when required. 
Ten meetings were held last year. Attendance at meetings  
by directors is set out below:

Members of the executive team attended committee meetings as 
appropriate. Anthony Habgood is not a member of the Audit Committee 
but attended all three meetings during the year.
When appointed to the Audit Committee it was known that Susan Hooper 
had prior commitments for the March and April meetings. Susan received 
the papers and provided feedback for the meetings.
A set of Board papers, including monthly financial and trading 
reports, is circulated in advance of each meeting so that 
directors have sufficient time to review them and arrive at  
the meeting fully prepared.
The agenda for each Board meeting is agreed with the 
Chairman and the Chief Executive so that current events and 
potential future issues can be discussed alongside the regular 
reports.
At each meeting, the Board starts with a review of the minutes 
from the previous meeting, matters arising and progress  
on action points. This is followed by reports from the Chief 
Executive, the Finance Director and the Managing Directors  
of Whitbread Hotels & Restaurants and Costa describing the 
operational and functional performance. Reports from the 
specific parts of the business and new business opportunities 
are presented before a review of the secretariat report  
which sets out any updates on best practice and corporate 
legislation.
The Board has a rolling agenda which sets out matters to  
be considered throughout the year. This allows all directors  
to contribute to the setting of the agenda. Having a rolling 
agenda ensures that there is a structured approach to the 
consideration of recurring issues with such items being evenly 
spread across the calendar. The rolling agenda is structured 
such that the Board gives its attention to each area of the 
business in turn so that a strong understanding of the entire 
Company is maintained. This year, the Board has considered  
a range of matters, details of which can be found on page 39.
There is a schedule of matters reserved exclusively to the 
Board. These matters include:
 approval of Group financial statements and the preliminary 
announcement of half and full–year results;
 changes relating to the Group’s capital structure;
 the annual budget and the Group’s business plan;
 approving acquisitions and disposals valued at over  
£12 million;
 interim dividends and recommendation of final dividends;
 establishment of Board committees, terms of reference  
and membership of Board committees; and
 maintaining sound risk management and internal control 
systems.
The schedule of matters reserved was reviewed at the 
January 2013 Board meeting and is available on our website.
How and why did the Board appoint new executive directors 
this year?
As stated in the 2011/12 Annual Report and Accounts,  
when Christopher Rogers was appointed Managing Director  
of Costa Coffee, it was necessary for the Board to appoint  
a new Group Finance Director. The Nomination Committee 
began by considering the specification of a Group Finance 
Director and any additional skills and experience that required 
increased representation on the Board. The Committee  
then prepared a description of the capabilities required.  
An external search consultant, Spencer Stuart, was engaged  
and a number of candidates were identified. Selected 
candidates met with the Nomination Committee and further 
interviews led to the appointment of Nicholas Cadbury  
as the new Group Finance Director.

A review of Board composition and the importance of the 
40,000 team members to the success of the Company  
led to the conclusion that the Company would benefit from  
the appointment of the Group HR Director to the Board.  
The appointment of Louise demonstrates the importance  
of people development and talent planning at Whitbread.
How does the Board keep up to date with new 
developments?
A monthly report, prepared by the Company Secretary,  
is presented at each Board meeting. This report provides 
updates on corporate legislation and best practice on  
matters including corporate governance.
Formal training events were attended by Board members 
during the year on a range of issues including: workshops  
on succession planning, remuneration and corporate 
governance. Investor relations and market updates were  
also considered by the Board. The Company’s auditor also 
prepared a paper for the Board on the key developments  
in accounting and governance practice.
All directors have access to independent professional advice 
at the Company’s expense. Directors serving on Board 
committees confirmed they are satisfied that they receive 
sufficient resources to enable them to undertake their duties 
effectively. Each director has access to the Company 
Secretary for advice on governance.
How does the Board identify and consider directors’ 
conflicts of interest?
Directors are required to disclose any conflicts of interest 
immediately as and when they arise throughout the year.  
In addition, a formal process is undertaken each year in 
February when each director confirms to the Board details  
of their external interests including any other directorships 
which they hold.
These are assessed by the Board to determine whether the 
director’s ability to act in the best interests of the Company 
could be compromised. If there are no such potential or actual 
conflicts, the external interests are authorised by the Board. 
All authorisations are for a period of 12 months. No director  
is counted as part of a quorum in respect of the authorisation 
of his or her own conflict situation.
It is recognised that all organisations are potential customers 
of Whitbread and, in view of this, the Board has authorised  
all directors’ current external directorships.
Induction process
In the 2011/12 Annual Report we provided detail on the 
induction process for the new independent non–executive 
directors. In 2012/13 we appointed two new executive 
directors.
The induction process for Nicholas Cadbury was full, formal  
and tailored, focusing on Whitbread’s businesses. Initial 
meetings were held with the Chairman, Chief Executive, 
Group HR Director, all executive and non–executive 
directors, and the Company Secretary. This was followed  
by time with:
 the finance director of each business;
 the IT and Digital Directors;
 the Communications Director; and
 the Pensions Director.
Nicholas met with a number of major investors and sell  
side analysts of the Company. Meetings were also held  
with the Group’s bankers, auditors, lawyers and advisers. 
Nicholas was provided with a detailed review of all  
of our businesses and went on several visits to different 
Premier Inn, Restaurant and Costa sites. He also spent  
a day working in a restaurant and completed a tour  
of the Costa Roastery. This provided valuable insight  
into the Company and allowed Nicholas to develop his 
understanding of each business. 
The induction process for Louise was comprehensive and 
tailored, focussing on the key responsibilities and duties  
of directors. Louise already had a detailed knowledge  
of Whitbread’s businesses so focused on meeting with  
the Group’s advisers, including brokers for a briefing on 
shareholder engagement, and the Company’s lawyers  
on the responsibilities of directors.
Training and development goes well beyond the induction 
process and is an ongoing process for all Board members.
How is the independence of directors assessed?
The Board has a majority of independent non–executive 
directors. Independence is assessed annually against the  
Code. None of the provisions listed in the Code which may 
compromise independence apply to any of Whitbread’s  
non–executive directors. As such, the Board concluded  
that all of the non–executive directors are independent.
Does the Company have appropriate insurance cover  
in respect of legal action against its directors?
The Company has appropriate directors’ and officers’ liability 
insurance in place. In addition to this, the Company provides 
an indemnity for directors against the costs of defending 
certain legal proceedings. These are reviewed periodically.

What are each of the Board members responsible for?
All Board members have responsibilities in the areas of strategy, performance, risk and people. Specific duties of the Chairman 
and Chief Executive are set out below: 
Chairman Chief Executive
 Leadership of the Board and setting its agenda including 
approval of the Group’s strategy, business plans, annual 
budget and key areas of business importance.
 Maintaining contact with major shareholders and ensuring 
that Board members understand their views concerning  
the Company.
 Ensuring a culture of openness and debate around the 
Board table.
 Leading the annual evaluation of the Board, the committees 
and individual directors.
 Ensuring, through the General Counsel, that the members 
of the Board receive accurate, timely and clear information.
 Optimising the performance of the Company.
 Ensuring effective communication with shareholders  
and employees.
 The creation of shareholder value by delivering  
profitable growth and a good return on capital.
 Ensuring the Company has a strong team of high– 
calibre executives, and putting in place appropriate 
management succession and development plans.
 Leading the activities of the Whitbread Leadership 
Forum — a group of the Company’s most senior 
executives.
The role of the Senior Independent Director
The Senior Independent Director provides a sounding board 
for the Chairman and supports him in the delivery of his 
objectives. The Senior Independent Director is available to 
shareholders if they have concerns which the normal channels 
have failed to resolve or which would be inappropriate to raise 
with the Chairman or the executive team. He also leads the 
evaluation of the Chairman on behalf of the other directors.
The role of the executive directors
The executive directors are responsible for the day–to–day 
running of the business and for implementing the operational 
strategic plans of the Company.
The role of the non–executive directors
The non–executive directors play a key role in constructively 
challenging and scrutinising the performance of the 
management of the Company.
How is performance evaluated?
Board and committees:
An annual evaluation of the Board and committees is carried 
out. Last year an external evaluation was held and this year  
it was conducted internally.
This year’s evaluation had two aspects:
 each director completed a formal questionnaire on  
the performance of the Board and each of the Board 
committees; and
 the Chairman met or spoke to all directors on a  
one–to–one basis.
The conclusions of the review were that the directors were 
aligned in their view that the Board functioned well and 
received appropriate information to consider the main 
strategic items.
Areas of discussion were:
 the presentation of the WINcard at Board meetings; and
 contact with the Whitbread Hotels & Restaurants 
International Board.
In response to last year’s evaluation, the following action  
has been taken:
 an annual update on relevant regulatory, accounting  
and legal issues from the auditor;
 a planning and review meeting of the Nomination 
Committee is held on an annual basis; and 
 meetings have been held at different Company sites, and  
in November 2013 the Board will travel to India and the 
Middle East to attend a Board meeting and review new 
developments in these markets. 
In accordance with the Code, we intend to have an externally 
facilitated evaluation of the Board at least every three years.
Individual directors:
The Chairman has one–to–one meetings with each director  
to discuss their performance.
Chairman:
Each year the Senior Independent Director meets with  
the non–executive directors without the Chairman present  
to discuss the performance of the Chairman. The Senior 
Independent Director also speaks with the executive  
directors to gain their views before discussing the results  
with the Chairman.

Shareholder relations 
How does the Company interact with shareholders?
All shareholders:
The Company communicates with both institutional  
and private shareholders through the following means:
 the Company’s website (www.whitbread.co.uk), where 
information and news is regularly updated;
 the Annual Report, which sets out details of the Company’s 
strategy, business models and performance over the past 
financial year and plans for future growth;
 the Annual General Meeting, where all shareholders have 
the opportunity to vote on the resolutions proposed and  
to put questions to the executive team; and
 presentations of full and half–year results to analysts and 
shareholders and these are available on the Company’s 
website.
In addition, all shareholders are able to contact the Company 
via the website, email, telephone or post to raise issues. 
The Company also takes opportunities to interact more 
directly with institutional and private shareholders.
Institutional shareholders:
 the Chief Executive, Group Finance Director and Director  
of Investor Relations held meetings with institutional 
investors following the full–year and interim results;
 the Chairman met institutional shareholders on request;
 the Board received updates on the views of major 
shareholders from the Company’s brokers; and
 Investor Days will take place in July and December this year.
Private shareholders:
 live webcast presentations of the annual and interim results; 
and
 electronic communications with shareholders including use 
of the online share portal.
How are shareholders able to participate in the AGM?
In accordance with the Code, the Notice of AGM and related 
papers are sent to the shareholders at least 20 working  
days before the meeting. The Company proposes a separate 
resolution on each substantially separate issue including  
a specific resolution to approve the report and accounts.  
For each resolution, proxy appointment forms provide 
shareholders with the option to vote in advance of the 
AGM if they are unable to attend in person. All valid proxy 
votes received for the AGM are properly recorded and 
counted by Whitbread’s registrars.
As in previous years, all voting by shareholders will be by poll 
using electronic handsets. The voting results, including proxy 
votes received, will be displayed on a screen at the end of the 
meeting. In addition, the audited poll results will be disclosed 
on the Company’s website following the meeting, and 
announced through the regulatory news service.
The information that is required by DTR 7.2.6, relating to  
the share capital of the Company can be found within the 
directors’ report on pages 64 to 67. 
Internal control 
How does the Company maintain adequate systems  
of internal control?
The Board is responsible for the Group’s systems of internal 
control and risk management, and for reviewing their 
effectiveness. These systems are designed to manage rather 
than eliminate risk of failure to achieve business objectives. 
They can only provide reasonable, and not absolute, 
assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Board has established an ongoing process for identifying, 
evaluating and managing the Group’s significant risks. This 
process was in place throughout the 2012/13 financial year 
and up to the date of this report. The process is regularly 
reviewed by the Board and accords with the internal control 
guidance for directors in the Code. A report of the key risks 
can be found on pages 34 to 37.
Risk analysis
 The Board identifies the principal risks of the Company on a 
regular basis and throughout the year it reviews the actions 
in place to mitigate the risks together with assurance and 
monitoring activity. The analysis covers health and safety, 
financial, market, operational and reputational risks which 
the Company may face as well as specific areas identified  
in the business plan and budget process.
 Each of the businesses also carries out its own risk analysis 
together with PwC as operational auditor and this is 
reviewed regularly by the management boards.
 All major capital and revenue projects, together with 
significant change programmes, include the consideration  
of the risks involved and an appropriate action plan.
 The scope of the audit agreed with Ernst & Young will 
identify the specific financial risks facing the Group.
Smart everyday 
We continue to invest in Costa; 120 stores  
have been refurbished this year.

Controls
 The Company reviews and confirms its compliance  
with the Corporate Governance Code on an annual basis.
 The matters reserved to the Board require that major 
projects and programmes must have specific Board 
approval.
 Limits of delegations and authority are prescribed to  
ensure that the appropriate approvals are obtained if Board 
authority is not required to ensure appropriate segregation 
of tasks.
 Group financial policies controls and procedures are in 
place and regularly reviewed and updated. 
 The Whitbread Code of Conduct, setting out required levels 
of ethics and behaviour, is communicated to employees.
 The Code of Conduct makes reference to specific policies 
and procedures which have to be followed.
 Management is responsible for ensuring the appropriate 
maintenance of financial records and processes that ensure 
that financial information is relevant, reliable, in accordance 
with applicable laws and regulations and is distributed both 
internally and externally in a timely manner.
 A review of the financial statements is completed by 
management to ensure that the financial position and 
results of the Group are appropriately reflected.
 All financial information published by the Group is subject 
to the approval of the Audit Committee and the Board.
 An annual review of internal controls is undertaken by the 
Board with the assistance of the Audit Committee. 
Assurance
 The Board, with the assistance of the Audit Committee, 
approves an audit programme which ensures that the 
significant areas of risk identified are independently 
reviewed within at least a three–year period. 
 The programme and the results of the audits are regularly 
assessed during the year.
 The Audit Committee reviews the major findings from both 
the operational and external audits.
 PwC, as operational auditor, has been appointed to carry  
out the independent audits. Its reports are reviewed  
by the Audit Committee and on a monthly basis by the 
management team to ensure that the actions required  
to address issues identified are implemented. 
 PwC reports annually to the Audit Committee on the 
effectiveness of operational and financial controls across 
the Group.
 Ernst & Young review and report on the significant issues 
identified in their audit report and liaise with PwC in 
covering the agreed areas of risk throughout the year. 
 An internal control evaluation process is overseen by the 
management team which assesses the level of compliance 
with the controls, policies and processes and the results  
are reviewed and tested on a sample basis by PwC.
 Post–completion reviews of major projects and investments 
are carried out and reported on to the Board.

reviewed annually and updated in line with best practice.  
They have been updated in 2013 to reflect certain of the 
changes in the 2012 Code. They are available in full on the 
Company’s website.

Role of the Audit Committee
The principal role of the Audit Committee is the review  
of the Company’s financial results and internal controls. The 
Committee meets three times a year, and will hold additional 
meetings as and when required. The full terms of reference 
are available on the Company’s website. 
Financial results
The Committee agrees the scope of the year’s audit, the areas 
of focus, the engagement letter and the fees of the Auditor  
at a meeting in October each year. At the meeting in April, it 
receives presentations from the Group Finance Director and 
the lead auditor on the financial results for the full–year, any 
important judgements or estimates made in the process, any 
points of difference identified in the audit and any outstanding 
work to be done before an unqualified opinion will be given.  
At the same meeting the Committee reviews the RNS 
announcement of the results, a going concern statement  
and other important elements from the preparation of the 
accounts, including the management representation letter. 
This is all reported to the next Board meeting.
A similar process takes place at the Committee’s meeting  
in October for the half–year results although this is not subject 
to a full audit.
At both of the meetings described above the Committee 
meets with the external and the operational auditors without 
the management team being present to give an opportunity 
for any issues to be raised.
Auditor
The Committee oversees the relationship with the external 
auditor. Each year there is a review of the performance of  
the external auditor and its independence and effectiveness. 
The Audit Committee carried out a competitive tender of  
the external audit in 2010/11 and recommended that Ernst  
& Young be reappointed. As the lead partner has been in the 
position for five years, a new lead partner will be appointed  
in 2013/14. This rotation will maintain the objectivity and 
independence of the Group’s external auditor. 
Internal controls
The Audit Committee holds an annual evaluation of internal 
controls in March. The Committee reviews the Group risk 
matrix and assesses the effectiveness of the internal 
processes that have been implemented to enable those risks 
to be mitigated and monitored. This review is completed in 
conjunction with an Internal Controls Effectiveness Review 
from PwC as operational auditor. Each risk is assessed and  
the level of assurance required is determined. 
The Audit Committee then approves a plan from PwC to carry 
out reviews of the chosen areas during the following year.
As part of its duty to review the effectiveness of the Company’s 
financial reporting and internal controls, this year the 
Committee:
 received updates from the IS Director on the status of  
the security in the Company’s information systems in the 
context of general concerns about cyber attacks and 
personal information;
 reviewed a revised method of carrying out the internal 
controls evaluation and reporting to the Committee; and
 received reports from management and PwC on controls  
in a support centre function and made recommendations 
for improvements to various internal processes.
Further information on risk management can be found  
on pages 34 to 37.
Committee duties 
Other Committee duties which are carried out during the  
year are:
 reviewing the speaking out facility which enables genuine 
issues concerning the Company to be raised anonymously 
and without fear of reprisal. A summary report of the 
matters raised and the findings of the investigations is also 
considered by the Committee; and
 confirming that the terms of reference of the Committee 
remain up to date and in line with good corporate 
governance.
Changes relating to the Audit Committee in the 2012 Code
The terms of reference of the Audit Committee have  
been revised to provide for:
 the Committee reporting to the Board on how it has 
discharged its responsibilities; and
 the external audit contract to go out to tender at least  
every ten years.
During the early part of the year the Committee will be 
reviewing the requirements of the 2012 Code in relation to  
the review of the report and accounts on behalf of the Board. 
It will then put in place the appropriate processes that will 
enable this to be completed.

Role of the Nomination Committee
The role of the Nomination Committee is to review the 
composition of the Board and to identify and nominate 
directors who could enhance the Board’s performance.  
The Committee is also responsible for evaluating the  
directors on an annual basis.
The Committee meets twice a year to review its terms  
of reference, and consider the annual re–election of directors. 
Additional meetings are held as and when required for  
the selection and appointment process of new directors.
The full terms of reference are available on the Company’s 
website.
Our approach to the annual re–election of directors
As required by the Code, all directors will be subject to  
re–election at the next AGM. The Nomination Committee held 
a planning and review meeting in March when the contribution 
and commitment of each member of the Board was reviewed. 
Following this discussion it was recommended that all 
directors be proposed for reappointment at this year’s AGM. 
Details setting out why each director is deemed to be suitable 
for reappointment will be included with the AGM papers 
circulated to all shareholders.
Simon Melliss’ second three–year term came to an end  
in April 2013. In view of Simon’s strong leadership of the  
Audit Committee and his contribution generally to Board 
discussions, the Nomination Committee was satisfied that  
his reappointment would be beneficial to the Company,  
and recommended that he be reappointed for a further  
three–year period. No other non–executive director of the 
current Board has been a director for a term longer than  
six years.
In accordance with the Code, none of the executive directors 
has more than one non–executive directorship in a FTSE 100 
company or a chairmanship of a FTSE 100 company.
Changes relating to the Nomination Committee 
in the 2012 Code
Following the changes in the 2012 Code, the terms of 
reference of the Nomination Committee have been revised 
and approved by the Board. These changes reflect the 
inclusion of gender when reviewing the structure, size and 
composition of the Board.
In accordance with the 2012 Code, it is intended that  
the 2013/14 Annual Report and Accounts will include  
a description of the Board’s policy on diversity, including 
gender, any measurable objectives that it has set for 
implementing the policy, and progress on achieving the 
objectives. 
Signed and approved on behalf of the Board.

Introduction
Introduction from Ian Cheshire
In last year’s report, I explained that we had taken the 
opportunity to redefine Whitbread’s remuneration principles, 
which are outlined on page 53 of this report. The intention  
of the principles is to ensure that remuneration arrangements 
are aligned to and support the delivery of the Group’s 
business strategy and shareholder value creation.
Whitbread’s strategy, which is to invest in growing its leading 
brands, Premier Inn and Costa, has stretching targets which,  
if delivered successfully, will create significant value for our 
shareholders. The Committee believes that the executive 
team should be rewarded for the achievement of the strategy 
and therefore incentives should be clearly aligned to 
delivering earnings growth and returns above our cost of 
capital. To this end, amendments to the Long Term Incentive 
Plan (LTIP) performance conditions were proposed and 
approved at the 2012 AGM. Further details on the LTIP can  
be found on page 55.

Along with profit and returns targets, the WINcard remains  
a key element of our remuneration structure. It is designed to 
ensure that executives are incentivised on both non–financial 
and financial measures. The Customer Heartbeat schematic, 
which is described on page 8 shows how we intend to deliver 
our strategic aims by providing a great place to work for our 
people, so that they care for our customers and provide them 
with an experience that will make them come back time and 
time again. We intend to deliver these aims whilst being a 
force for good in the communities in which we operate. The 
diagram on page 49 shows how elements of the remuneration 
package are linked to this model.
A significant proportion of the incentives available to 
executives are paid in shares, a material element of which  
are deferred. The Remuneration Committee believes that 
executives should use the incentive schemes to build a 
significant shareholding in the Company in order to provide 
greater alignment between executives and shareholders.  
We also strengthened our shareholding guidelines, details  
of which can be found on page 58, in relation to the retention 
of a proportion of vesting share awards until the guidelines 
have been met.
2012/13 highlights
Performance linked to reward
Whitbread has once again delivered an excellent set of  
results in 2012/13, with double–digit growth in sales, profits 
and dividend. As explained above, the Group’s strategy is  
to grow its leading brands with a clear focus on returns in 
order to create substantial shareholder value. The Committee 
is pleased to note that, as well as the strong trading 
performance, the Group remains on track to achieve its 
growth milestones, whilst continuing to grow returns and 
shareholder value. The Group’s return on capital increased  
to 14% from 13.6% in the prior year.
Last year, we reported that the Company had performed  
well, but had not quite achieved its profit target. As a result, 
incentive awards were at a reduced level in 2011/12. This  
year, the improved performance has led to a well–deserved 
increase in awards. Details can be found on page 57. In 
addition, the Group’s sustained performance over the last 
three years has led to a significant proportion of the 2010 LTIP 
awards vesting and details of this can be found on page 55.
Executive directors’ service contracts
During the year we implemented the policy that the executive 
directors’ service agreements be in consistent form and 
reflecting best practice in relation to termination payments. 
Details of the key terms of these agreements can be found  
on page 58.

Changes to the Board
Christopher Rogers began his new role as Managing Director 
of Costa in July 2012. He continued as Group Finance Director 
until Nicholas Cadbury joined the Company in November. As 
disclosed last year, Christopher remained on the Board and 
his remuneration package was unchanged, except that with 
effect from 1 September 2012 his incentive targets became 
based on the Costa WINcard, with the profit element split 
50:50 between Costa PBIT and Group underlying profit.
Nicholas Cadbury and Louise Smalley joined the Board during 
the year. In each case the Remuneration Committee based the 
packages offered to the new directors on the remuneration 
principles outlined on page 53.
Nicholas Cadbury joined the Board as Group Finance Director 
on 14 November 2012. Nicholas’s remuneration package 
includes:
 a salary of £460,000;
 a potential award under the Whitbread Incentive Scheme 
(subject to the achievement of Group underlying profit 
targets and Group WINcard measures) to a maximum  
value of 167% of salary (on a pro–rata basis in 2012/13); 
 an annual award to the value of 125% of salary under  
the Long Term Incentive Plan; and
 a pension contribution (or cash in lieu of a pension 
contribution) to the value of 25% of salary.

Louise Smalley, Group HR Director since 2007, was appointed 
to the Board on 1 November 2012. Louise’s remuneration 
package includes: 
 a salary of £300,000;
 a potential award under the Whitbread Incentive Scheme 
(subject to the achievement of Group underlying profit 
targets and Group WINcard measures) to a maximum  
value of 167% of salary (on a pro–rata basis in 2012/13); 
 an annual award to the value of 125% of salary under  
the Long Term Incentive Plan; and
 a pension contribution (or cash in lieu of a pension 
contribution) to the value of 25% of salary.
Pension
There has been a change to the policy on pension 
contributions during the year. Previously, the executive 
directors were entitled to a Company pension contribution  
of 25% of salary, with these contributions increasing by  
a further 2.5% of salary after each of five and ten years’ 
service up to a maximum of 30%. 
The Remuneration Committee reviewed this policy in  
the light of best practice and determined that there would  
be no future pension contributions in excess of 27.5% of salary 
for current executive directors. It was further agreed that  
any new executive directors would receive a contribution  
of 25% of salary with no further increases for service. 
2013 salary review
When reviewing the salaries of the executive directors the 
Committee takes into account a range of factors including 
changes to salaries across the Group, the personal 
performance of the director measured against agreed 
objectives, current trading circumstances and our 
remuneration policy.
The general salary increase across Whitbread in May 2013  
will be 2.25%. Andy Harrison and Christopher Rogers will  
each receive an increase at this rate. The Committee awarded 
Patrick Dempsey an increase of 5.6% in recognition of his 
significant contribution to the Board. Nicholas Cadbury  
and Louise Smalley will not be entitled to a salary review  
until 2014.
The basic salaries of the executive directors with effect  
from 1 May 2013 will be as follows:
  Basic salary at Basic salary at
Director 1 May 2013 1 May 2012
1
 
Andy Harrison £733,644 £717,500
Nicholas Cadbury £460,000 £460,000
Patrick Dempsey £450,000 £426,300
Christopher Rogers £516,056 £504,700
Louise Smalley £300,000 £300,000
1 Or at the date the director was appointed to the Board.
Total remuneration received by executive directors
The following table shows the total amount of remuneration 
received by each of the executive directors in 2012/13.  
This includes the director’s salary and bonus (both the cash 
element to be paid in May 2013 and the deferred shares to  
be awarded in 2013 under the Annual Incentive Scheme), any 
cash paid in lieu of pension or other benefits, an amount 
representing LTIP awards made in 2010 and vesting in 2013 
and any profit made on the exercise of Sharesave options 
during the year. The value given for the LTIP awards is based 
on the average market value over the last quarter of the 
financial year (2525.64p), as the awards will not become 
exercisable until after the date of this report.

1  The figures shown represent total remuneration received since  
the date of appointment to the Board for Nicholas Cadbury and  
Louise Smalley. The figures relating to LTIP awards vesting in 2013  
are pro–rated based on the proportion of the three–year performance 
period that the individual was a director. This was 30 months for  
Andy Harrison and four months for Louise Smalley.
2  The 2011/12 comparatives have been re–stated to reflect the latest  
draft of the proposed guidance on directors’ remuneration issued  
by BIS. Specifically, the updated figures include the deferred shares 
awarded in 2012 and not the deferred shares awarded in 2009 and 
vesting in 2012.
There are two main reasons for the increase in Andy 
Harrison’s remuneration over the prior year. Firstly, LTIP 
awards have vested to him for the first time. As disclosed  
in 2010/11 Andy received an LTIP award of 175% salary on  
his appointment three years ago. 89% of this award has 
vested as a result of the Company’s EPS growing in excess  
of RPI + 10% p.a. and TSR being between median and upper 
quartile versus the comparator group over the three–year 
performance period. (During the performance period the 
share price has risen from £14.14, being the price used to 
calculate the award, to £25.25.)
Secondly, the improved performance of the Company in 
2012/13 led to a bonus of £897,198 (more than half of which  
is deferred for a further three years) compared with £545,990 
in the prior year.
These rewards, as well as the rewards received by other 
executives, are a direct result of the delivery of the Group’s 
business strategy and the creation of shareholder value  
and, as such, are a good example of how the Company’s 
remuneration strategy is aligned with the interests of 
shareholders.

remuneration principles:
Overall remuneration principles
Our approach to senior executive remuneration is designed to:
 be aligned to the business strategy and the achievement  
of planned business goals;
 support the creation of sustainable long–term shareholder 
value;
 provide an appropriate balance between remuneration 
elements that attract, retain and motivate the right calibre 
of executive talent; and
 encourage a high–performance culture by ensuring 
performance–related remuneration constitutes a substantial 
proportion of the remuneration package and by linking 
maximum payout opportunity to outstanding results.
The table on page 53 outlines the principles behind each key 
element of remuneration, the opportunity for each director  
in the year ahead and a brief summary of how it works.  
A more detailed explanation of how the incentive schemes 
work can be found on pages 55 to 57.

Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) 
Structure
The LTIP is designed to closely align the interests of senior 
executives with shareholders. It operates as follows:
 executives receive an annual LTIP award based on a 
percentage of salary;
 there is a three–year performance period;
 at the end of the three–year performance period, the 
vesting levels for the awards are determined based on the 
extent to which performance targets have been met; and
 any vested awards become nil–cost options and executives 
have up to seven years to call for the vested shares.
Performance conditions
The Remuneration Committee reviewed the performance 
conditions for the LTIP in 2012 and determined that it would 
be appropriate to change them in order to align the LTIP  
more closely with the Group’s strategic aims. After consulting 
with major shareholders, as well as with the ABI and RREV, 
shareholders were asked to approve the new performance 
conditions at the 2012 AGM. 99.4% of shareholders voted  
in favour of the amended performance conditions.
As a result, the awards made in 2012, were made on the  
new basis with performance conditions operating as follows:
 EPS and ROCE measures on a matrix basis;
 the ROCE measure operates both as a hurdle and as  
a multiplier to a base award generated by performance 
against the EPS measure;
 up to 75% of awards are dependant on EPS growth  
over the three–year performance period, subject to  
a satisfactory ROCE performance;
 ROCE will be used as a multiplier on a straight–line  
sliding scale basis to increase the EPS element by up 
to a further third;
 no element of the award will vest if a minimum level  
of ROCE of 12% is not achieved in 2014/15; and
 the Committee will have the discretion to reduce the  
vesting levels if it believes that performance has not been 
sufficiently value–enhancing during the performance 
period.
Clawback
Unlike the Annual Incentive Scheme, for which clawback 
provisions were introduced, the Committee decided that 
clawback provisions would be impractical for the LTIP.  
This is because awards are typically exercised shortly after 
performance conditions are calculated and vesting is 
confirmed. As such, the Committee was unconvinced that 
clawback provisions would be enforceable in practice. 
However, the Committee confirmed that it would consider 
reducing the vesting of future LTIP awards in the event of a 
mis–statement of results leading to an increased vesting level.
Awards to be made in 2013
LTIP awards will be made to the executive directors in 2013  
to the value of 125% of salary. The awards will be subject  
to the same performance conditions as those awards made  
in 2012. The matrix below shows how the performance 
conditions will operate.

Awards vesting in 2013
The LTIP awards made to executives in 2010 were subject  
to independently operating performance conditions as set  
out in the table below. The outcome of each condition is  
also shown in the table.

As a result 89.77% of the shares awarded under the 2010  
LTIP have vested. The awards vesting to the executive 
directors are as follows:

proportion of the performance period that the individual was a director 
as required by the regulations. Andy Harrison has been a director  
for 30 months out of the three–year performance period and Louise 
Smalley for four months. The total number of shares vesting will be 
77,726 to Andy and 7,842 to Louise.
Link between strategy and LTIP reward
Strategy LTIP reward
Whitbread’s strategy is to invest in growing its leading brands, Premier Inn 
and Costa. We have announced new growth milestones to increase the size 
of Premier Inn UK to around 75,000 rooms and to roughly double Costa’s 
system sales to £2 billion by 2018. This will involve substantial capital 
commitment as we continue to grow in the UK and develop in our 
international markets.
To reward executives for those elements of performance responsible  
for the achievement of the strategy and therefore clearly align 
incentives towards delivering improved shareholder value. Award levels 
are currently set at a maximum of 125% of salary for executive directors.

Annual Incentive Scheme 
continued
Annual Incentive Scheme 
Structure
The Annual Incentive Scheme is the Company’s bonus 
scheme, which applies to approximately 80 executives.  
The scheme has been designed to incentivise outstanding 
performance across a number of key stakeholder measures 
and it rewards executives with both a cash payment and  
an award of deferred shares. The scheme operates over  
a four–year period as follows:
 the performance in the first year is measured against both 
financial and non–financial measures to determine the level 
of awards;
 the measures are set by the Remuneration Committee  
so that ‘on–target’ performance has in–built stretch;
 at the end of the first year cash payments are made and  
any deferred shares are awarded as appropriate;
 there is a further three–year holding period for the deferred 
shares before they vest to the executive; and
 clawback provisions apply to the deferred share awards  
in the event of a material misstatement of results.
There are two types of measure used to determine the level  
of awards under the scheme. There is a profit measure and 
there are a number of WINcard measures. The scheme is 
designed to incentivise executives to deliver great results by 
providing an excellent environment for our people, and giving 
them the tools to make everyday experiences special for  
our customers. The team engagement and guest heartbeat 
measures are up–weighted to reflect the importance of  
those elements to Whitbread’s success. In addition, there  
is a health and safety measure, which acts as a hurdle, 
demonstrating our determination to provide a safe 
environment for employees and customers alike. The profit 
measure is the most incentivised element with an award to  
the value of 137% of salary available for stretch performance.
 
Profit measure 2013/14
The profit measures set for the executive directors for 2013/14 
are appropriate to each director’s role. Nicholas Cadbury, 
Andy Harrison and Louise Smalley have a Group underlying 
PBIT measure. Patrick Dempsey will have a profit measure 
split on a 40:60 basis between Group Underlying PBIT and 
Whitbread Hotels & Restaurants PBT, whilst Christopher 
Rogers will have a profit measure split on a 40:60 basis 
between Group Underlying PBIT and Costa PBT. 
The graph below shows the percentage of salary received  
at different levels of profit performance, as well as the split

element.

We believe that our Winning Teams make everyday experiences special

Profitable Growth. The WINcard contains KPIs for Winning Teams, 
Customer Heartbeat and Profitable Growth.
Executive directors can earn up to 137% of salary based on profit 
performance and up to a further 30% based on WINcard targets,  
which include non–financial KPIs. A material part of any award  
is deferred for three years.

WINcard measures 2013/14
Each executive director will be incentivised based on six 
WINcard targets appropriate to the director’s role. The targets 
include two up–weighted measures (each worth 9% of salary 
for a green score and 4.5% of salary for an amber score) and 
four standard measures (each worth 3% of salary for a green 
score and 1.5% of salary for an amber score). 80% of any 
awards made in relation to these WINcard measures are  
made in cash, with the remaining 20% being deferred equity. 
Further information on the WINcard targets can be found  
on pages 26 to 29. 
Awards for 2012/13

Christopher Rogers 38.32 69.41 107.73
Louise Smalley 11.47 20.86 32.33
 
Awards based on WINcard measures
The WINcard targets in 2012/13 were appropriate to the 
director’s role. For example, Patrick Dempsey had WINcard 
measures specific to Whitbread Hotels & Restaurants.  
For the first half of the year Christopher Rogers had Group 
targets and, following his appointment as Managing Director 
of Costa at the half–year, he had Costa measures in the 
second half of the year. The award to be made to Nicholas 
Cadbury has been calculated on a pro–rata basis from the 
date of his appointment, whilst the award to be made to 
Louise Smalley is partly based on her salary prior to her 
appointment to the Board and partly based on her new salary. 
Nicholas Cadbury, Andy Harrison and Louise Smalley each 
had 100% Group targets.
All executive directors had five green WINcard scores in the 
year, two of which were up–weighted. Christopher Rogers 
also had one amber score.

Pension 
Like all employees, the executive directors are entitled to 
participate in the Company’s pension scheme. The scheme  
is a defined contribution scheme. The levels of contribution 
for employees vary depending on the job grade of the 
individual, with employees at the entry level able to contribute 
2% of their salary and receive a Company contribution of  
3% of salary. Life assurance is provided to employees who 
choose to join the pension scheme. Employees who do not 
choose to participate may be automatically enrolled with 
contributions in line with the automatic enrolment regulations.
As explained on page 51 there was a change to the policy  
on pension contributions for the executive directors during 
the year, with a reduction in the upper limit for Company 
contributions from 30% to 27.5% of salary. No future executive 
director will receive contributions above 25% of salary.
Executives are able to elect to receive a monthly amount  
in cash (less an amount equal to the employer’s national 
insurance contribution) in lieu of the pension contribution. 
Currently, Andy Harrison and Christopher Rogers have 
elected to receive a cash payment, while Nicholas Cadbury, 
Patrick Dempsey and Louise Smalley each receive a pension 
contribution and a cash supplement representing the  
balance over and above the annual allowance set by  
HMRC for pension contributions.
The percentage of salary currently received by the executive 
directors, together with the year in which the contribution 
would increase to 27.5% where applicable, is shown in the 
table below.

Other benefits
All executive directors are entitled to a company car or a cash 
allowance. They also receive private health cover.
Shareholding guidelines for executives
The Committee believes that the shareholding guidelines  
for executives play an important role in the alignment  
of the interests of executives and shareholders and help  
to incentivise executives to deliver sustainable long–term 
performance.
Executive directors are required to build and hold a 
shareholding at least equal to 100% of salary within five years 
of appointment, whilst other senior executives are expected  
to reach a holding to the value of 50% of salary. Until they 
reach this level, executives are expected to retain a proportion 
of vesting awards. The table below shows the holdings of 
executive directors as at 28 February 2013:
  Value of shareholding 
Director at 28 February 2013 % of salary
Andy Harrison £4,821,604 672
Nicholas Cadbury £15,138 3
Patrick Dempsey £629,665 148
Christopher Rogers £1,261,500 250
Louise Smalley £290,095 97
Terms of executive directors’ service contracts
The key terms of the executive directors’ service contracts, 
which have been standardised during the year, are as follows:
 notice period — six months by the director and 12 months 
by the Company;
 termination payment — under none of the contracts  
is any specific compensation payable on termination of 
employment. For the executive directors, the Company  
may terminate the director’s contract by paying the salary, 
together with pension contributions (or cash in lieu of 
pension) and benefits for a 12–month period. Payments 
would reduce or cease in the event that the director 
obtained another job in that time;
 sickness — full salary for a maximum of 12 months in any 
three–year period or for a maximum of nine consecutive 
months; and
 non–compete — for six months after leaving.
The dates of the executive directors’ service contracts are  
as follows:
Andy Harrison 3 March 2010
Nicholas Cadbury 3 September 2012 
Patrick Dempsey 26 March 2013
Christopher Rogers 18 February 2013
Louise Smalley 25 October 2012

Executive directors — fees from external directorships
The executive directors are entitled to retain fees from 
external directorships. Christopher Rogers served as a 
non–executive director of HMV Group plc until he stepped 
down from that Board on 30 June 2012. He received  
£15,000 during the year as a result of that directorship.  
None of the other executive directors received any fees  
from external directorships.
Employee Share Ownership Trust (ESOT)
The Company funds an ESOT to enable it to acquire and  
hold shares for the Annual Incentive Scheme, the LTIP  
and the matching share award made to Andy Harrison  
on his appointment in 2010. As permitted, the Company 
transferred 320,000 shares from its treasury shares account 
to the ESOT during the year to be utilised for the future 
satisfaction of LTIP awards.
As at 29 April 2013, the ESOT held 1,145,387 shares. The 
executive directors each have a technical interest in these 
shares as potential beneficiaries of the Trust, but no shares  
in the ESOT have been earmarked to any individual. All 
dividends on shares in the ESOT are waived by the trustee. 
During the period from 1 March 2013 to 29 April 2013,  
no director has exercised an option to call for the transfer  
of shares from the ESOT.
Share price information
The mid–market price of a Whitbread PLC share on  
28 February 2013 was 2523p (1 March 2012: 1687p). The 
highest and lowest price paid for ordinary shares during  
the year were 2694p and 1633p respectively.
Changes since 28 February 2013
There have been no changes in the directors’ interests  
in ordinary shares since 28 February 2013.
Dilution limits
Whitbread’s share plans comply with the recommended 
guidelines on dilution limits and the Company has always 
operated within these limits. The current Association of British 
Insurers (‘ABI’) guidance on headroom limits provide that 
overall dilution under all plans should not exceed 10% over  
a ten–year period in relation to the Company’s issued share 
capital, with a further limitation of 5% in any ten–year period 
on executive plans. Assuming none of the extant options 
lapse and will be exercised, and having included all exercised 
options as well as shares transferred from treasury in order  
to settle LTIP awards, the Company has utilised 3.50% of the 
10% in ten years limit and 1.41% of the 5% in ten years limit.
2012 Annual General Meeting
At the Annual General Meeting in 2012 the advisory resolution 
to approve the remuneration report was passed, with 97.4%  
of votes received being in favour of the resolution. There were 
no questions raised by shareholders at the meeting relating  
to the Company’s remuneration policy.
I am pleased with the progress we have made this year in 
further aligning our remuneration policies with the Company’s 
strategy and the creation of improved shareholder value.
Signed and approved on behalf of the Board.

1  Under the rules of the Scheme awards cannot vest during a close or prohibited period. The 2010 awards normal release date would be 1 March 2013. 
However, as this date was during a close period the awards will automatically vest on the next day on which dealings are permitted. It is anticipated 
that this will be 30 April 2013, the date on which the full–year results are released.
The awards are not subject to additional performance conditions above those set prior to grant and will vest in full on the 
release date subject to the director remaining an employee of Whitbread at that date. If the director ceases to be an employee 
of Whitbread prior to the release date by reason of redundancy, retirement, death, injury, ill health, disability or some other 
reason considered to be appropriate by the Remuneration Committee, the awards will be released in full. If the director ceases 
to be an employee of Whitbread for any other reason the proportion of award which vests depends upon the year in which the 
award was made and the date the director ceases to be an employee. If the director leaves within the first year after an award  
is made none of the award vests, between the first and second anniversary 25% vests and between the second and third 
anniversary 50% vests.

Further details regarding the interests of the directors in  
the share capital of the Company, including with respect  
to options to acquire ordinary shares, are set out in the 
remuneration report. There has been no change to the 
interests shown above between the end of the financial  
year and the date of this report.
Share capital
Details of the issued share capital can be found in Note 27 
to the accounts.
Holders of ordinary shares are entitled to attend and  
speak at general meetings of the Company, to appoint one  
or more proxies and, if they are corporations, corporate 
representatives to attend general meetings and to exercise 
voting rights. Holders of ordinary shares may receive a 
dividend and on a liquidation may share in the assets of the 
Company. Holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive 
the Company’s Annual Report and Accounts. Subject to 
meeting certain thresholds, holders of ordinary shares  
may requisition a general meeting of the Company or the 
proposal of resolutions at annual general meetings. 
Voting rights
On a show of hands at a general meeting of the Company, 
every holder of ordinary shares present, in person or by  
proxy and entitled to vote, has one vote (unless the proxy is 
appointed by more than one member in which case the proxy 
has one vote for and one vote against if the proxy has been 
instructed by one or more members to vote for the resolution 
and by one or more members to vote against the resolution) 
and on a poll every member present in person or by proxy 
and entitled to vote has one vote for every ordinary share 
held. Voting rights for any ordinary shares held in treasury  
are suspended. None of the ordinary shares carry any special 
rights with regard to control of the Company. Electronic and 
paper proxy appointments and voting instructions must  
be received by the Company’s registrars not later than  
(i) 48 hours before a meeting or adjourned meeting 
(excluding non–working days), or (ii) 24 hours before  
a poll is taken, if the poll is not taken on the same day  
as the meeting or adjourned meeting.
Unless the directors decide otherwise, a shareholder cannot 
attend or vote at any general meeting of the Company or at 
any separate general meeting of the holders of any class of 
shares in the Company or upon a poll or exercise any other 
right conferred by membership in relation to general meetings 
or polls if he has not paid all amounts relating to those shares 
which are due at the time of the meeting.
Where a shareholder with at least a 0.25% interest in a class  
of shares has been served with a disclosure notice in relation 
to a particular holding of shares and has failed to provide the 
Company with information concerning those shares, those 
shares will no longer give that shareholder any right to vote  
at a shareholders’ meeting.
Restrictions on transfer of shares
There are the following restrictions on the transfer of shares  
in the Company:
 certain restrictions which may from time to time be 
imposed by laws and regulations (for example, insider 
trading laws);
 pursuant to the Company’s share dealing code, the 
directors and senior executives of the Company require 
approval to deal in the Company’s shares;
 where a person with at least a 0.25% interest in a class  
of shares has been served with a disclosure notice and has 
failed to provide the Company with information concerning 
interests in those shares;
 the subscriber ordinary shares may not be transferred 
without the prior written consent of the directors;
 the directors can, without giving any reason, refuse to 
register the transfer of any shares which are not fully paid; 
 transfers cannot be in favour of more than four joint  
holders; and
 the directors can refuse to register the transfer of an 
uncertificated share in the circumstances set out in  
the uncertificated securities rules (as defined in the 
Company’s Articles of Association).
The Company is not aware of any agreements between 
shareholders that may result in restrictions on the transfer  
of shares or on voting rights.

annual non–cumulative preferential dividend calculated at a 
rate of 75% of six month LIBOR on a value of 155p per B share 
and 159p per C share respectively, but are not entitled to any 
further right of participation in the profits of the Company.

Except in limited circumstances, the holders of the B shares 
and C shares are not entitled in their capacity as holders of 
such shares, to receive notice of any general meeting of the 
Company nor to attend, speak or vote at any such general 
meeting. 
Purchase of own shares
The Company is authorised to purchase its own shares in 
the market. Approval to renew this authority will be sought 
from the shareholders at the 2013 AGM.
The Company did not purchase any of its own shares  
during the year. 13.8 million shares (representing 7.14% of the  
total called up share capital at the beginning of the year)  
are held as treasury shares (1 March 2012: 14.1 million). During 
the course of the year, the Company transferred 320,000 
shares from treasury to the Employee Share Ownership Trust 
for the future satisfaction of awards under the Long Term 
Incentive Plan.
Employee share schemes
Whitbread does not have any employee share schemes with 
shares which have rights with regard to the control of the 
Company that are not exercisable directly by the employees.
Major interests
As at the end of the financial year, the Company had received 
formal notification, under the Disclosure and Transparency 
Rules, of the following material holdings in its shares (the 
percentages shown are the percentages at the time of the 
disclosure and have not been re–calculated based on the 
issued share capital at the year–end):
  Number of shares % of issued share capital 
BlackRock 17,184,930 9.73
Capital Group Companies, Inc. 10,746,506 5.99
Schroders PLC 10,531,421 5.35
Standard Life Investments 7,233,278 4.08
Legal & General 6,960,723 3.97
Since the end of the financial year the Company received a 
notification from Capital Group Companies, Inc. that they had 
increased their holding to 10,825,963 shares (6.04%) of the 
issued share capital. No further changes to the above have 
been disclosed to the Company in accordance with rule 5  
of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules between the end 
of the financial year and 29 April 2013.
Employment policies
Whitbread has a range of employment policies covering  
such issues as diversity, employee well–being and equal 
opportunities.
The Company takes its responsibilities to the disabled 
seriously and seeks not to discriminate under any 
circumstances (including in relation to training, career 
development and promotion) against current or prospective 
employees because of any disability. Fair and full 
consideration is given to applications for employment  
made by disabled persons, having regard to their aptitudes 
and abilities. Employees who become disabled during  
their career at Whitbread will be retained in employment 
wherever possible and given help with rehabilitation  
and training.
Employee involvement
The importance of good relations and communications with 
employees is fundamental to the continued success of our 
business. Each of the Group’s operating businesses maintains 
employee relations and consults employees as appropriate  
to its own particular needs. In addition, our employee opinion 
survey, Your Say, is conducted twice a year to provide insight 
in to the views of employees.
Our employees are actively encouraged to take part in our 
Sharesave scheme, which is available to all employees and 
offers an option price discounted by 20%.
Regular internal communications are made to all employees 
to ensure that they are kept well informed of the performance 
of the Group and of financial and economic factors that may 
affect the Company’s performance. 
Further information on employee involvement can be found  
in the Winning Teams sections on pages 12 and 20.
Amendment of the Company’s Articles of Association
Any amendments to the Articles of Association of the 
Company may be made in accordance with the provisions  
of the Companies Act 2006 by way of special resolution.
Significant agreements
The Company’s facility agreements and the private  
placement loan notes agreement, details of which can be 
found in Note 21 to the accounts, contain provisions entitling 
the counterparties to exercise termination or other rights  
in the event of a change of control of the Company. 
Contractual arrangements
The Group has contractual arrangements with numerous  
third parties in support of its business activities, none of which 
are considered individually to be essential to its business  
and, accordingly, it has not been considered necessary for an 
understanding of the development, performance or position 
of the Group’s business to disclose information about any  
of those third parties.

Financial instruments
Information on the Company’s use of financial instruments, 
financial risk management objectives and policies and 
exposure is given in Note 24 to the consolidated financial 
statements.
Supplier payment policy
The Company has no trade creditors (1 March 2012: nil).  
The Group has a standard term of 60 days in respect of 
payments to suppliers. Where this standard term does not 
apply, operating companies are responsible for agreeing 
terms and conditions for their business transactions when 
orders for goods and services are placed, so that suppliers  
are aware of the terms of payment and the relevant terms are 
included in contracts where appropriate. The Group keeps  
to the payment terms which have been agreed with suppliers. 
Where payment terms have not been specifically agreed, it  
is the Group’s policy to settle invoices close to the end of the 
month following the month of invoicing. The Group’s ability  
to keep to these terms is dependent upon suppliers sending 
accurate and adequately detailed invoices to the correct 
address on a timely basis. The Group had 47 days’ purchases 
outstanding at 28 February 2013 (1 March 2012: 47 days) 
based on the trade creditors at that date and purchases  
made during the year.
Charitable and political donations
During the year, the Company made a direct charitable 
donation of £111,480 to Great Ormond Street Hospital 
Children’s Charity and a further donation of £100,000 to  
the Costa Foundation. Costa Limited, a subsidiary of the 
Company, also made a direct donation of £929,871 to the 
Costa Foundation. In total £2.3 million was raised in the  
Group for its two designated charities. In addition, the 
Company organised and supported a number of charitable 
events and a number of its employees carried out charitable 
activities during working hours. The value of these activities 
has not been quantified. More information on Great Ormond 
Street Hospital Children’s Charity and the Costa Foundation 
can be found at the back of this document.
The Company has not made any political donations during  
the year and intends to continue its policy of not doing  
so for the foreseeable future. 
Auditor
Ernst & Young LLP have expressed their willingness to 
continue in office as auditor of the Company and a resolution 
proposing their reappointment will be put to shareholders  
at the 2013 AGM. After proper consideration, the Audit 
Committee is satisfied that the Company’s auditor, Ernst & 
Young LLP, continues to be objective and independent of the 
Company. In coming to this conclusion, the Audit Committee 
gave full consideration to any non–audit work carried out  
by Ernst & Young LLP. 
The Audit Committee has considered what work should not  
be carried out by the external auditor and has concluded that 
certain services will not be carried out by Ernst & Young LLP. 
Disclosure of information to auditor
The directors have taken all reasonable steps to make 
themselves aware of relevant audit information and to 
establish that the auditor is aware of that information. The 
directors are not aware of any relevant audit information 
which has not been disclosed to the auditor. 
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely 
to affect its future development, performance and position 
are set out in the business review on pages 4 to 37. The 
financial position of the Company, its cash flows, net debt  
and borrowing facilities and the maturity of those facilities  
are set out in the Finance Director’s report on pages 30 to 33. 
In addition there are further details in the financial statements 
on the Group’s financial risk management, objectives and 
policies (Note 24) and on financial instruments (Note 25).
A combination of the strong operating cash flows generated 
by the business and the significant headroom on its credit 
facilities supports the directors’ view that the Group has 
sufficient funds available for it to meet its forseeable working 
capital requirements. The directors have concluded that the 
going concern basis remains appropriate.
Annual General Meeting
The AGM will be held at 2pm on 18 June 2013 at the Queen 
Elizabeth II Conference Centre, Broad Sanctuary, Westminster, 
London SW1P 3EE. The Notice of Meeting is enclosed with 
this report for shareholders receiving hard copy documents, 
and available at www.whitbread.co.uk for those who elected 
to receive documents electronically. At the 2013 AGM,  
all voting will be by poll. Electronic handsets will be utilised 
and results will be displayed on the screen at the meeting.
Approved by the Board on 29 April 2013 and signed.

Statement of directors’ responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual  
Report and the consolidated financial statements in 
accordance with applicable company law and those 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs)  
as adopted by the European Union.
Under company law the directors must not approve the 
consolidated financial statements unless they are satisfied 
that they present fairly the financial position of the Group  
and the results and cash flows of the Group for that period.  
In preparing those consolidated financial statements, the 
directors are required to:
 select suitable accounting policies in accordance with  
IAS 8: Accounting policies, changes in accounting  
estimates and errors, and then apply them consistently;
 make judgements and estimates that are reasonable  
and prudent;
 state that the consolidated financial statements comply with 
IFRS subject to any material departures being disclosed and 
explained in the consolidated financial statements;
 prepare the accounts on a going concern basis unless  
it is inappropriate to presume that the Group will continue  
in its business;
 present information, including accounting policies, in a 
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information; and
 provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
specific requirements in IFRSs is insufficient to enable users 
to understand the impact of particular transactions, other 
events and conditions on the Group’s financial position and 
financial performance.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records, which disclose with reasonable accuracy 
at any time the financial position of the Group and enable 
them to ensure that the consolidated financial statements 
comply with the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the  
IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the Group and hence, taking reasonable steps for 
the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Responsibility statement
We confirm on behalf of the Board that, to the best  
of our knowledge:
 the consolidated financial statements, prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, 
give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit of the Group taken as a whole; and
 the directors’ report includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business and the 
position of the Group taken as a whole, together with  
a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that 
they face.

Independent auditor’s report to the members  
of Whitbread PLC 
We have audited the consolidated financial statements  
of Whitbread PLC for the year ended 28 February 2013  
which comprise the Consolidated Income Statement,  
the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income,  
the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Consolidated Cash  
Flow Statement and the related Notes 1 to 33. The  
financial reporting framework that has been applied 
in their preparation is applicable law and International  
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by  
the European Union.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members,  
as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken  
so that we might state to the Company’s members those 
matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s  
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility 
to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s 
members as a body, for our audit work, for this report,  
or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and of auditor 
As explained more fully in the Statement of directors’ 
responsibilities on page 70, the directors are responsible  
for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.  
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on  
the consolidated financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing  
(UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply  
with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards  
for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the consolidated financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts 
and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements 
sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the consolidated 
financial statements are free from material misstatement, 
whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment 
of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the 
Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the directors; and the  
overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non–financial 
information in the Annual Report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited consolidated financial 
statements. If we become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the  
implications for our report.
Opinion on consolidated financial statements
In our opinion the consolidated financial statements:
 give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s  
affairs as at 28 February 2013 and of its profit for the  
year then ended;
 have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs  
as adopted by the European Union; and
 have been prepared in accordance with the requirements  
of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies  
Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ report 
for the financial year for which the consolidated financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the consolidated 
financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report  
to you if, in our opinion:
 certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified  
by law are not made; or
 we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
 the directors’ statement, set out on page 67, in relation  
to going concern;
 the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating  
to the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions  
of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our 
review; and
 certain elements of the report to shareholders by the  
Board on directors’ remuneration.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Parent Company financial 
statements of Whitbread PLC for the year ended 28 February 
2013 and on the information in the directors’ remuneration 
report that is described as having been audited.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
At 28 February 2013
1  Authorisation of consolidated  
ﬁnancial statements
The consolidated financial statements of Whitbread PLC for 
the year ended 28 February 2013 were authorised for issue  
by the Board of Directors on 29 April 2013. Whitbread PLC  
is a public limited company incorporated and fully domiciled 
in England and Wales. The Company’s ordinary shares are 
traded on the London Stock Exchange.
The significant activities of the Group are described in  
Note 4, Segment information.
2 Accounting policies
Basis of accounting and preparation
The consolidated financial statements of Whitbread PLC  
and all its subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance  
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs)  
as adopted for use in the European Union and as applied in 
accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in 
pounds sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest 
hundred thousand except when otherwise indicated. The 
significant accounting policies adopted are set out below. 
The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these 
consolidated financial statements are consistent with those 
followed in the preparation of the Group’s consolidated 
financial statements for the year ended 1 March 2012, 
except for the change in presentation of the Consolidated 
income statement noted below and the adoption of the new 
Standards and Interpretations that are applicable for the  
year ended 28 February 2013.
Change in presentation
The categorisation of expenses within the consolidated 
income statement have been amended to combine the 
previously disclosed cost of sales, distribution costs and 
administrative expenses into one expense line above 
operating profit called operating costs. The directors believe 
that the revised consolidated income statement presentation 
is more relevant to the nature of the business and is consistent 
with the practice of others within the industry. Prior year 
comparatives have been re–presented accordingly to provide 
a consistent comparison. Cost of sales of £377.8m for the  
year ended 28 February 2013 and £288.4m for the year  
ended 1 March 2012, distribution costs of £1,059.4m for the 
year ended 28 February 2013 and £969.2m for the year ended 
1 March 2012 and administrative expenses of £206.9m for the 
year ended 28 February 2013 and £174.7m for the year ended 
1 March 2012 have been amalgamated into operating costs.
Amendment to IFRS 7 Financial instruments:  
Disclosures — on transfer of financial assets
These amendments promote transparency in the reporting  
of transfer transactions and improve users’ understanding  
of the risk exposures relating to transfers of financial assets 
and the effect of those risks on an entity’s financial position, 
particularly those involving securitisation of financial assets. 
The adoption of this interpretation has had no effect on the 
consolidated financial statements of the Group.
  
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the 
accounts of Whitbread PLC and all its subsidiaries, together 
with the Group’s share of the net assets and results of joint 
ventures and associates incorporated using the equity 
method of accounting. These are adjusted, where appropriate, 
to conform to Group accounting policies. The financial 
statements of material subsidiaries are prepared for the  
same reporting year as the parent Company.
Apart from the acquisition of Whitbread Group PLC by 
Whitbread PLC in 2000/01, which was accounted for using 
merger accounting, acquisitions by the Group are accounted 
for under the acquisition method and any goodwill arising  
is capitalised as an intangible asset. The results of subsidiaries 
acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the 
consolidated financial statements from or up to the date  
that control passes respectively. All intra–Group transactions, 
balances, income and expenses are eliminated on 
consolidation. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless  
the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the 
asset transferred.
Significant accounting policies 
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on acquisition is capitalised and represents 
the excess of the fair value of consideration over the Group’s 
interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities 
of a subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is reviewed 
for impairment annually, or more frequently, if events or 
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value  
may be impaired. On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable 
amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the 
profit or loss on disposal.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Intangible assets acquired separately from a business are 
carried initially at cost. An intangible asset acquired as part  
of a business combination is recognised outside of goodwill  
if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or other 
legal rights, and its fair value can be measured reliably.
Amortisation is calculated on a straight–line basis over  
the estimated life of the asset as follows:
 trading licences have an infinite life;
 brand assets are amortised over periods of 15 years;
 IT software and technology are amortised over periods  
of three to ten years;
 the asset in relation to acquired customer relationships  
is amortised over 15 years; and
 operating rights agreements are amortised over the  
life of the contract.
The carrying values are reviewed for impairment if events  
or changes in circumstances indicate that they may not  
be recoverable.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
At 28 February 2013
2 Accounting policies continued
Property, plant and equipment
Prior to the 1999/2000 financial year, properties were 
regularly revalued on a cyclical basis. Since this date the  
Group policy has been not to revalue its properties and, while 
previous valuations have been retained, they have not been 
updated. As permitted by IFRS 1, the Group has elected to  
use the UK GAAP revaluations before the date of transition to  
IFRS as deemed cost at the date of transition. Property, plant 
and equipment are stated at cost or deemed cost at transition 
to IFRS, less accumulated depreciation and any impairment  
in value. Gross interest costs incurred on the financing of 
qualifying assets are capitalised until the time that the projects 
are available for use. Depreciation is calculated on a straight–
line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset as follows:
 freehold land is not depreciated;
 freehold and long leasehold buildings are depreciated  
to their estimated residual values over periods up to  
50 years; and
 plant and equipment is depreciated over three to 30 years.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are 
reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be 
recoverable. Any impairment in the value of property, plant 
and equipment is charged to the income statement.
Profits and losses on disposal of property, plant and 
equipment reflect the difference between net selling price 
and the carrying amount at the date of disposal and are 
recognised in the income statement.
Payments made on entering into or acquiring leaseholds that 
are accounted for as operating leases represent prepaid lease 
payments. These are amortised on a straight–line basis over 
the lease term.
Impairment
The Group assesses assets or groups of assets for impairment 
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate 
that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. 
Individual assets are grouped for impairment assessment 
purposes at the lowest level at which there are identifiable 
cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows  
of other groups of assets (cash generating units or CGUs).  
If such indication of impairment exists or when annual 
impairment testing for an asset group is required, the  
Group makes an estimate of the recoverable amount.
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether 
there is any indication that previously recognised impairment 
losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such 
indication exists, the CGU’s recoverable amount is estimated. 
A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if 
there has been a change in the estimates used to determine 
the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss 
was recognised. If that is the case, the carrying amount of the 
asset is increased to its recoverable amount. That increased 
amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have 
been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss 
been recognised for the asset in prior years. Such reversal  
is recognised in the income statement. After such a reversal, 
the depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to 
allocate the asset’s carrying amount, less any residual value, 
on a straight–line basis over its remaining useful life.
The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater  
of its fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing 
value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted  
to their present value using a pre–tax discount rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value of 
money and the risks specific to the asset. For an asset that 
does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the 
recoverable amount is determined with reference to the  
CGU to which the asset belongs. Impairment losses are 
recognised in the income statement in operating costs.
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount  
of an asset or CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable  
amount. Impairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs  
are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any 
goodwill allocated to the units and then to reduce  
the carrying amounts of other assets in the CGU on  
a pro–rata basis.
For the purposes of impairment testing, all centrally held 
assets are allocated in line with IAS 36 to CGUs based  
on management’s view of the consumption of the asset.  
Any resulting impairment is recorded against the centrally 
held asset.
Goodwill and intangibles
Goodwill acquired through business combinations is  
allocated to groups of CGUs at the level management monitor 
goodwill, which is at strategic business unit level. The Group 
performs an annual review of its goodwill to ensure that its 
carrying amount is not greater than its recoverable amount.  
In the absence of a comparable recent market transaction 
that demonstrates that the fair value less the cost to sell  
of goodwill and intangible assets exceeds their carrying 
amount, the recoverable amount is determined from value  
in use calculations. An impairment is then made to reduce  
the carrying amount to the higher of the fair value less cost  
to sell and the value in use.
Property, plant and equipment
For the purposes of the impairment review of property,  
plant and equipment the Group considers CGUs to be each 
trading outlet.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment  
are reviewed for impairment when events or changes  
in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not  
be recoverable.
Consideration is also given, where appropriate, to the  
market value of the asset, either from independent sources  
or in conjunction with an accepted industry valuation 
methodology.
Investments in joint ventures and associates
The Group assesses investments for impairment whenever 
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying 
value may not be recoverable. If any such indication of 
impairment exists, the carrying amount of the investment  
is compared with its recoverable amount, being the higher  
of its fair value less costs to sell and value in use. Where  
the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount,  
the investment is written down to its recoverable amount.

2 Accounting policies continued
Assets held for sale
Non–current assets and disposal groups are classified  
as held for sale only if available for immediate sale in  
their present condition and a sale is highly probable and  
expected to be completed within one year from the date  
of classification. Such assets are measured at the lower  
of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell and  
are not depreciated or amortised.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable 
value. Cost is calculated on the basis of first in, first out  
and net realisable value is the estimated selling price less  
any costs of disposal.
Provisions
Provisions for warranties, onerous contracts and restructuring 
costs are recognised when the Group has a present legal or 
constructive obligation as a result of a past event, when it is 
probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle 
the obligation, and when a reliable estimate can be made of 
the amount of the obligation. 
Provisions are discounted to present value, where the effect  
is material, using a pre–tax discount rate that reflects current 
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks 
specific to the liability. The amortisation of the discount is 
recognised as a finance cost.
Non GAAP performance measure
The face of the income statement presents underlying profit 
before tax and reconciles this to profit before tax as required 
to be presented under the applicable accounting standards. 
Underlying earnings per share is calculated having adjusted 
profit after tax on the same basis. The term underlying profit 
is not defined under IFRSs and may not be comparable with 
similarly titled profit measures reported by other companies. 
It is not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP 
measurements of profit. The adjustments made to reported 
profit in the income statement in order to present an 
underlying performance measure include:
Exceptional items
The Group includes in the non GAAP performance measure 
those items which are exceptional by virtue of their size  
or incidence so as to allow a better understanding of the 
underlying trading performance of the Group. The Group  
also includes the profit or loss on disposal of property, plant 
and equipment, property reversions, profit or loss on the sale 
of a business, impairment and exceptional interest and tax.
IAS 19 income statement finance charge/credit for defined 
benefit pension schemes
Underlying profit excludes the finance cost/revenue element 
of IAS 19.
Amortisation charge on acquired intangible assets
Underlying profit excludes the amortisation charge on 
acquired intangible assets.
Taxation
The tax impact of the above items is also excluded in arriving 
at underlying earnings.
Foreign currency translation 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange 
quoted at the balance sheet date. Non–monetary items that 
are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency 
are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of 
initial transactions.
Trading results are translated into the functional currency 
(generally sterling) at average rates of exchange for the year. 
Day–to–day transactions in a foreign currency are recorded  
in the functional currency at an average rate for the month  
in which those transactions take place, which is used as a 
reasonable approximation to the actual transaction rate. 
Translation differences on monetary items are taken to the 
income statement except where they are part of a net foreign 
investment hedge, in which case translation differences are 
reported in other comprehensive income. The differences  
that arise from translating the results of foreign entities at 
average rates of exchange, and their assets and liabilities  
at closing rates, are also dealt with in a separate component  
of equity. On disposal of a foreign entity, the deferred 
cumulative amount recognised in equity relating to that 
particular foreign operation is recognised in the income 
statement. All other currency gains and losses are dealt  
with in the income statement.
A number of subsidiaries within the Group have a non–sterling 
functional currency. These are translated into sterling in the 
Group accounts. Balance sheet items are translated at the rate 
applicable at the balance sheet date. Transactions reported  
in the income statement are translated using an average rate 
for the month in which they occur.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards 
of the goods or services provided have transferred to the 
buyer, the amount of revenue can be measured reliably and  
it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the 
transaction will flow to the Group.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration 
receivable from the sale of goods and services to third parties 
after deducting discounts, allowances for customer loyalty 
and other promotional activities. Revenue includes duties 
which the Group pays as principal, but excludes amounts 
collected on behalf of other parties, such as value added tax. 
All material sales between Group businesses are eliminated.
Revenue of the Group comprises the following streams:
Sale of goods
Revenue from the sale of food, beverages and merchandise  
is recognised at the point of sale, with the exception of 
wholesale transactions which are recognised on delivery. 
Rendering of services
Revenue from room sales and other guest services is 
recognised when rooms are occupied and as services are 
provided.
Franchise fees
Revenue from fees received in connection with the franchise 
of the Group’s brand names is recognised when earned.

Customer loyalty programmes
Where award credits are granted as part of a sales 
transaction, a portion of revenue equal to the fair value  
of the reward points earned is deferred until redemption.  
The fair value of points awarded is determined with  
reference to the discount received upon redemption  
and the level of redemption.
Finance revenue
Interest income is recognised as the interest accrues, using 
the effective interest method.
Leases
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and 
benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating 
leases. Rental payments in respect of operating leases are 
charged against operating profit on a straight–line basis  
over the period of the lease. Lease incentives are recognised 
as a reduction of rental costs over the lease term.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period  
in which they are incurred, except for gross interest costs 
incurred on the financing of major projects, which are 
capitalised until the time that the projects are available  
for use.
Retirement benefits
In respect of defined benefit pension schemes, the obligation 
recognised in the balance sheet represents the present  
value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted for any 
unrecognised past service cost, reduced by the fair value  
of the scheme assets. The cost of providing benefits is 
determined using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation 
method. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full  
in the period in which they occur in the Consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income.
For defined benefit plans, the employer’s portion of the past 
and current service cost is charged to operating profit, with 
the interest cost net of expected return on assets in the plans 
reported within finance costs. The expected return on plan 
assets is based on an assessment made at the beginning  
of the year of long–term market returns on scheme assets, 
adjusted for the effect on the fair value of plan assets of 
contributions received and benefits paid during the year.
Curtailments and settlements relating to the Group’s defined 
benefit plan are recognised in the period in which the 
curtailment or settlement occurs.
Payments to defined contribution pension schemes are 
charged as an expense as they fall due.
Share–based payment transactions
Equity–settled transactions
Certain employees and directors of the Group receive equity–
settled remuneration in the form of share–based payment 
transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange 
for shares or rights over shares. The cost of equity–settled 
transactions with employees is measured by reference to 
the fair value, determined using a stochastic model, at the 
date at which they are granted. The cost of equity–settled 
transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding 
increase in equity, over the period in which the performance 
conditions or non–vesting conditions are fulfilled, ending 
on the relevant vesting date. Except for awards subject to 
market related conditions for vesting, the cumulative expense 
recognised for equity–settled transactions at each reporting 
date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the 
vesting period has expired, and is adjusted to reflect the best 
available estimate of the number of equity instruments that 
will ultimately vest. The income statement charge or credit  
for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense 
recognised as at the beginning and end of that period. If 
options are subject to market related conditions, awards are 
not cumulatively adjusted for the likelihood of these targets 
being met. Instead these conditions are included in the fair 
value of the awards.
Where an equity–settled award is cancelled, it is treated as  
if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense  
not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately. 
Where an equity–settled award is forfeited the related 
expense recognised to date is reversed.
Cash–settled transactions
The cost is fair valued at grant date and expensed over  
the period until the vesting date with a recognition of 
a corresponding liability. Where material, the liability is 
remeasured to fair value at each reporting date up to and 
including the settlement date, with changes in fair value 
recognised in profit or loss for the period.
Tax
The income tax charge represents both the income tax 
payable, based on profits for the year, and deferred income tax.
Deferred income tax is recognised in full, using the liability 
method, in respect of temporary differences between the tax 
base of the Group’s assets and liabilities, and their carrying 
amounts, that have originated but have not been reversed  
by the balance sheet date. No deferred tax is recognised if  
the temporary difference arises from goodwill or the initial 
recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not  
a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, 
affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or  
loss. Deferred income tax is recognised in respect of taxable 
temporary differences associated with investments in 
associates and interests in joint ventures, except where the 
timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be 
controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences 
will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Whitbread Annual Report and Accounts 2012/13 80 Whitbread Annual Report and Accounts 2012/13 Consolidated accounts 2012/13 81
2 Accounting policies continued
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that  
it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which 
the deductible temporary differences can be utilised. The 
carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at 
each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no 
longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to 
allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the 
tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset 
is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates that 
have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance 
sheet date.
Income tax is charged or credited to other comprehensive 
income if it relates to items that are charged or credited to 
other comprehensive income. Similarly income tax is charged 
or credited directly to equity if it relates to items that are 
charged or credited directly to equity. Otherwise income  
tax is recognised in the income statement.
Treasury shares
Own equity instruments which are held by the Group 
(treasury shares) are deducted from equity. No gain or loss  
is recognised in the income statement on the purchase, sale, 
issue or cancellation of the Group’s own equity instruments. 
Investments in joint ventures and associates
Joint ventures are established through an interest in a 
company (a jointly controlled entity).
Investments in joint ventures and associates are initially 
recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration 
given and including acquisition charges associated with the 
investment.
After initial recognition, investments in joint ventures and 
associates are accounted for using the equity method.
Recognition and derecognition of financial assets  
and liabilities
The recognition of financial assets and liabilities occurs when 
the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the 
instrument. The derecognition of financial assets takes place 
when the Group no longer has the right to cash flows, the 
risks and rewards of ownership, or control of the asset. The 
derecognition of financial liabilities occurs when the obligation 
under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires.
Financial assets
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
Some assets held by the Group are classified as financial 
assets at fair value through profit or loss. On initial recognition 
these assets are recognised at fair value. Subsequent 
measurement is also at fair value with changes recognised 
through finance revenue or costs in the income statement.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non–derivative financial assets  
with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in  
an active market, do not qualify as trading assets and have 
not been designated as either fair value through profit or  
loss or available–for–sale. Such assets are carried at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method if the time value  
of money is significant. Gains and losses are recognised  
in the income statement when the loans and receivables  
are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the 
amortisation process.
Trade receivables are recognised and carried at original 
invoice amount less any uncollectable amounts. An estimate 
for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full  
amount is no longer probable. Bad debts are written off  
when identified.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and short–term deposits in the balance sheet comprise 
cash at bank and in hand and short–term deposits with  
an original maturity of three months or less. For the purpose  
of the Consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash 
equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined 
above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Derivative financial instruments
The Group enters into derivative transactions with a view  
to managing interest and currency risks associated with 
underlying business activities and the financing of those 
activities. Derivative financial instruments used by the  
Group are stated at fair value on initial recognition and 
at subsequent balance sheet dates. Cash flow hedges 
hedge exposure to variability in cash flows that are either 
attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised 
asset or liability or a forecast transaction. Fair value hedges 
hedge exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised  
asset or liability or an unrecognised firm commitment  
and include foreign currency swaps.
Hedge accounting is only used where, at the inception of the 
hedge, there is formal designation and documentation of the 
hedging relationship, it meets the Group’s risk management 
objective strategy for undertaking the hedge and it is 
expected to be highly effective.
The fair value of interest rate swap contracts is determined  
by reference to market values for similar instruments. 
The portion of any gains or losses of cash flow hedges,  
which meet the conditions for hedge accounting and are 
determined to be effective hedges, is recognised directly  
in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.  
The gains or losses relating to the ineffective portion are 
recognised immediately in the income statement. 
The change in fair value of a fair value hedging derivative  
is recognised in the income statement in finance costs.  
The change in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability 
that is attributable to the hedged risk is also recognised  
in the income statement within finance costs.

2 Accounting policies continued
When a firm commitment that is hedged becomes an asset  
or a liability recognised on the balance sheet then, at the  
time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains  
or losses that had previously been recognised in equity are 
included in the initial measurement of the acquisition cost  
or other carrying amount of the asset or liability. For all other 
cash flow hedges, the gains or losses that are recognised 
in equity are transferred to the income statement in the 
same period in which the transaction that results from a firm 
commitment that is hedged affects the income statement.
Gains or losses arising from changes in fair value of derivatives 
that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised 
immediately in the income statement.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging 
instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised or no 
longer qualifies for hedge accounting. At that point in time, 
for cash flow hedges, any cumulative gain or loss on the 
hedging instrument recognised in equity is kept in equity  
until the forecast transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction  
is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain 
or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the income 
statement. When a fair value hedge item is derecognised, 
the unamortised fair value is recognised immediately in the 
income statement.
Borrowings
Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value of the 
consideration received net of any directly associated issue 
costs. Borrowings are subsequently recorded at amortised 
cost, with any difference between the amount initially 
recorded and the redemption value recognised in the  
income statement using the effective interest method.
Significant accounting judgements and estimates
Key assumptions concerning the future, and other key  
sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, 
have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to  
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next 
financial year. 
The main assumptions and sources of estimation uncertainty 
are outlined below:
 An impairment test of tangible and intangible assets  
is undertaken each year on both an EBITDA multiple 
approach and a discounted cash flow approach. Note 14 
describes the assumptions used together with an analysis  
of the sensitivity to changes in key assumptions.
 Judgement involving estimates is used in determining the 
value of provisions carried for onerous contracts. This is 
primarily based around assumptions on rent and property–
related costs for the period the property is vacant and then 
assumptions over future rental incomes or potential reverse 
lease premiums paid. Note 23 provides details of the value 
of the provision carried.
 Defined benefit pension plans are accounted for in 
accordance with actuarial advice using the projected unit 
credit method. Note 31 describes the assumptions used 
together with an analysis of the sensitivity to changes in  
key assumptions. 
 The calculation of the Group’s total tax charge necessarily 
involves a degree of estimation and judgement in respect  
of certain items whose tax treatment cannot be finally 
determined until resolution has been reached with the 
relevant tax authority. The final resolution of certain  
of these items may give rise to material income statement 
and/or cash flow variances.
  Corporation tax is calculated on the basis of income before 
taxation, taking into account the relevant local tax rates  
and regulations. For each operating entity, the current 
income tax expense is calculated and differences between 
the accounting and tax base are determined, resulting  
in deferred tax assets or liabilities.
  Assumptions are also made around the assets which  
qualify for capital allowances and the level of disallowable 
expenses and this affects the income tax calculation. 
Provisions are also made for uncertain exposures which  
can have an impact on both deferred and current tax.
  A deferred tax asset shall be recognised for the carry 
forward of unused tax losses, pension deficits and unused 
tax credits to the extent that it is probable that future 
taxable profit will be available against which the unused  
tax losses and unused tax credits can be utilised. 
  Detailed amounts of the carrying value of corporation  
and deferred tax can be found in Note 9.
Standards issued by the International Accounting  
Standards Board (IASB) not effective for the current  
year and not early adopted by the Group
The following standards and interpretations, which have  
been issued by the IASB, ratified by the EU and are relevant 
for the Group, become effective after the current year–end 
and have not been early adopted by the Group:
IAS 19 Employee Benefits (Amendment)
The IASB has issued numerous amendments to IAS 19.  
These range from fundamental changes such as removing  
the corridor mechanism and the concept of expected  
returns on plan assets to simple clarifications and re–wording. 
The impact on the Group is on disclosure in the consolidated 
financial statements but there will also be an impact on the 
income statement due to the change in interest rate used to  
calculate the return on assets and the reclassification of the 
administration costs that are not related to asset management 
to operating costs. The amendment becomes effective for 
annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013. If the 
Group had adopted IAS 19 revised as at 28 February 2013,  
net pension finance costs for the year would have been  
higher by £9.0m and operating costs higher by £3.1m.

IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures —  
Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
The amendment requires that, if financial assets and liabilities 
have the right of set off, (and we would account as such)  
then disclosure is required to explain what asset has been 
derecognised and the reasons for doing so. In addition, the 
amendment requires disclosures about the continuation  
of set off to enable the user to evaluate the nature of, and  
risks associated with, the entity’s continuing involvement  
in those derecognised assets. The Group, under IAS 39, 
offsets assets and liabilities and therefore will be required  
to provide disclosure of this in the consolidated financial 
statements going forward but there will be no impact on the 
Group’s financial position or performance. The amendment  
becomes effective for annual periods beginning on or  
after 1 January 2013.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments:  
Classification and Measurement
IFRS 9, as issued, reflects the first phase of the IASB’s  
work on the replacement of IAS 39 and applies to 
classification and measurement of financial assets and 
financial liabilities as defined in IAS 39. The standard was 
initially effective for annual periods beginning on or after  
1 January 2013, but Amendments to IFRS 9: Mandatory 
Effective Date of IFRS 9 and Transition Disclosures, issued  
in December 2011, moved the mandatory effective date  
to 1 January 2015. In subsequent phases, the IASB will  
address hedge accounting and impairment of financial  
assets. The adoption of the first phase of IFRS 9 will have  
an effect on the classification and measurement of the 
Group’s financial assets, but will not have an impact  
on classification and measurement of financial liabilities.  
The Group will quantify the effect in conjunction with  
the other phases, when the final standard including all  
phases is issued.
IFRS 12 Disclosure of Involvement with Other Entities
IFRS 12 includes all of the disclosures that were previously  
in IAS 27 related to consolidated financial statements,  
as well as all of the disclosures that were previously included 
in IAS 31 and IAS 28. These disclosures relate to an entity’s 
interests, where they are material, in subsidiaries, joint 
arrangements, associates and structured entities. The impact 
on the Group is on disclosure in the consolidated financial 
statements only, where summarised information may need  
to be provided. The amendment becomes effective for  
annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014
1
.
Whilst the following standards and interpretations are relevant 
to the Group, they have been assessed as having no financial 
impact or additional disclosure requirements at this time:
 IAS 1 Financial Statement Presentation (Amendment);
 IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures  
(as revised in 2011);
 Amendment to IAS 32 Financial Instruments Presentation;
 IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements;
 IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements; and
 IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement.
1  As the accounts have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union, the adoption date is as per the EU,  
not the IASB.

4 Segment information
For management purposes, the Group is organised into two strategic business units (Hotels & Restaurants and Costa) based 
upon their different products and services:
 Hotels & Restaurants provide services in relation to accommodation and food; and
 Costa generates income from the operation of its branded, owned and franchised coffee outlets.
No operating segments have been aggregated to form the above reportable operating segments.
Management monitors the operating results of its strategic business units separately for the purpose of making decisions about 
allocating resources and assessing performance. Segment performance is measured based on underlying operating profit. 
Included within the unallocated and elimination columns in the tables below are the costs of running the public company. The 
unallocated assets and liabilities are cash and debt balances (held and controlled by the central treasury function), taxation, 
pensions, certain property, plant and equipment, centrally held provisions and central working capital balances.
Inter–segment revenue is from Costa to the Hotels & Restaurants segment and is eliminated on consolidation. Transactions 
were entered into on an arm’s length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.

1  In 2012/13, a net gain of £18.6m was recognised on disposals of property, plant and equipment, the majority of which relates to the sale and leaseback 
agreement for seven properties. In 2011/12, a net gain of £25.6m was recognised on disposals of property, plant and equipment, the majority of which 
related to a sale and leaseback agreement for seven properties. In addition, a provision was raised in relation to properties that reverted to Whitbread 
following difficulties with Southern Cross and a further requirement for a provision on the onerous contract portfolio.
2  In 2012/13, this is the net loss on the sale of the joint venture in Rosworth Investments to the joint venture partner. In 2011/12, there was an impairment 
of an investment in a German hotel (Note 17).
3  During the year Coffeeheaven Hungary was closed and subsequently liquidated. The costs incurred in this process have been classed as loss on 
disposal of business.
4  This is the partial release of a provision, of £13.5m, for an item which had been disputed by HMRC but has now been agreed. Interest which had been 
accrued for the late payment, amounting to £10.8m, has also been released.
5  The interest arising from the unwinding of the discount rate within provisions is included in exceptional interest, reflecting the exceptional nature  
of the provisions created.
6  Following the abolition of Industrial Buildings Allowances for hotel buildings, the Group reviewed and resubmitted prior year capital allowance claims. 
These claims have now been agreed with HMRC.

Net deferred tax liability    106.7  105.9
Total deferred tax liabilities released as a result of disposals during the year was £0.2m (2012: £0.6m).
The Group has incurred overseas tax losses which, subject to any local restrictions, can be carried forward and offset against 
future taxable profits in the companies in which they arose. The Group carries out an annual assessment of the recoverability  
of these losses and does not think it appropriate at this stage to recognise any deferred tax assets. If the Group were to 
recognise these deferred tax assets in their entirety, profits would increase by £6.8m (2012: £5.1m).
The Group considers that receipts of unremitted earnings from overseas entities would be exempt from UK tax and therefore 
the temporary difference in relation to unremitted earnings is £nil.
Tax relief on total interest capitalised amounts to £0.7m (2012: £0.8m).
Factors affecting the tax charge for future years
The Finance Act 2012 reduced the main rate of UK corporation tax to 24% from 1 April 2012 and to 23% from 1 April 2013.  
The effect of the new rate is to reduce the deferred tax provision by a net £8.9m, comprising a credit of £16.8m to the 
Consolidated income statement, a charge of £9.0m to the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income, and a reserves 
movement of £1.1m.
In his budget of 20 March 2013, the Chancellor of the Exchequer confirmed the planned additional reduction in the rate  
of UK corporation tax to 21% from 1 April 2014 and announced a further reduction to 20% from 1 April 2015. These changes  
had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and consequently are not included in these consolidated  
financial statements. The effect of these proposed reductions would be to reduce the net deferred tax liability by £12.3m.

10 Earnings per share
The basic earnings per share figures are calculated by dividing the net profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders, 
therefore before non–controlling interests, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year after 
deducting treasury shares and shares held by an independently managed employee share ownership trust (ESOT).
The diluted earnings per share figures allow for the dilutive effect of the conversion into ordinary shares of the weighted 
average number of options outstanding during the period. Where the average share price for the year is lower than the option 
price the options become anti–dilutive and are excluded from the calculation. The number of such options was nil (2012: nil).
The numbers of shares used for the earnings per share calculations are as follows:
     2012/13 2011/12 
     million million
Basic weighted average number of ordinary shares      177.6  176.4  
Effect of dilution — share options      1.5  0.4 
Diluted weighted average number of ordinary shares     179.1  176.8 
The total number of shares in issue at the year–end, as used in the calculation of the basic weighted average number of ordinary 
shares, was 193.0m less 13.8m treasury shares held by Whitbread PLC and 1.1m held by the ESOT (2012: 192.0m less 14.1m 
treasury shares held by Whitbread PLC and 0.9m held by the ESOT).

Total     177.6  176.8 
The carrying amount of goodwill at 28 February 2013 is comprised of £112.6m for Hotels & Restaurants and £65.0m for Costa. 
The Hotels & Restaurants CGU and the Costa CGU are also operating segments and represent the lowest level within the Group 
at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
There has been a small addition in the year, £0.7m, for the Costa CGU which relates to Coffeeheaven Poland, which acquired 
seven cafés operated by the Costa franchise partner, E–Coffee in Poland, on 15 May 2012. 
The brand intangible asset arose with the acquisition of Coffeeheaven in 2009/10. It is being amortised over a period of 15 years.
The customer relationships asset arose with the acquisition of Coffee Nation in a previous financial year. It is being amortised 
over a period of 15 years.
IT software and technology has been assessed as having finite lives and will be amortised under the straight–line method  
over periods ranging from three to ten years from the date it became fully operational. 
Other intangibles
Other intangibles comprise Costa overseas trading licences and Costa Express operating rights agreements.
The trading licences, which have a carrying value of £1.8m (2012: £1.8m), are deemed to have an infinite life as there is no  
time limit associated with them. The operating rights agreements are being amortised over periods of six years and ten years 
and have a carrying value of £2.3m (2012: £nil). The balance of £0.4m (2012: £0.4m) relates to territory fees which are being 
amortised over 20 years.
Capital expenditure commitments
Capital expenditure commitments in relation to intangible assets at the year–end amounted to £2.6m (2012: £nil).

Capital expenditure commitments for property, plant and equipment  
 for which no provision has been made      50.1  62.0 
In addition to the capital expenditure commitments disclosed above, the Group has also signed agreements with certain third 
parties to develop new trading outlets within the Hotels & Restaurants strategic business unit as part of its pipeline. These 
developments are dependant on the outcome of future events such as the granting of planning permission, and consequently 
do not represent a binding capital commitment at the year–end. The directors consider that developments likely to proceed  
as planned will result in further capital investment of £177.5m over the next five years (2012: £179.3m).
Capitalised interest
Interest capitalised during the year amounted to £2.7m, using an average rate of 4.5% (2011/12: £3.1m, using an average rate  
of 5.4%).
Assets held for sale
During the year, certain property assets with a net book value of £2.1m (2011/12: £nil) were transferred to assets held for sale. 
Property assets sold during the year had a net book value of £0.6m (2011/12: £3.4m), and five trading sites with a combined  
net book value of £1.5m (2011/12: £0.6m) continued to be classified as assets held for sale at the year–end. An impairment loss 
of £0.6m (2011/12: £nil) was recognised in the year.

The Group considers each trading site to be a CGU and each CGU is reviewed annually for indicators of impairment.
In assessing whether an asset has been impaired, the carrying amount of the CGU is compared to its recoverable amount.  
The recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. In the absence of any information 
about the fair value of a CGU, the recoverable amount is deemed to be its value in use. 
The Group estimates value in use using a discounted cash flow model, which applies a pre–tax discount rate of 9.1% in the  
UK (2011/12: 9.3%), 10.2% in China (2011/12: 10.4%) and 10.6% in Poland (2011/12: 10.8%). The future cash flows are based on 
assumptions from the business plans and cover a five–year period. These business plans and forecasts include management’s 
most recent view of medium–term trading prospects. Cash flows beyond this period are extrapolated using a growth rate  
based upon the relevant country’s inflation target, ranging from 2.0% to 3.4% with the UK, the most significant country, being 
2.0% (2011/12: 2.0%).
The events and circumstances that led to the impairment charge of £15.3m are set out below:
Hotels & Restaurants
The impairment of £13.6m at 16 sites in this strategic business unit was driven by a number of factors:
 changes in the local competitive environment in which the hotels are situated;
 the economic climate affecting some key regions; and
 high asset prices in the market at the point of acquisition for acquired sites which also anticipated higher growth rates  
at that time than are now expected.
Costa
Five UK Costa sites, nine sites in Shanghai and nine in the Coffeeheaven business, all with an established trend of poor 
performance against the required capital investment, have been impaired by £1.7m where their expected future cash flows  
have fallen to such a level that their value in use is below carrying value.
Impairment reversals
Following an improvement in trading performance and an increase in amounts of estimated future cash flows of previously 
impaired sites, reversals of £9.9m have been recognised, £9.7m in Hotels & Restaurants and £0.2m in Costa.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions
The level of impairment is predominantly dependent upon judgements used in arriving at future growth rates and the discount 
rate applied to cash flow projections. The impact on the impairment charge of applying different assumptions to the growth 
rates used in the five–year business plans and in the pre–tax discount rates would be an incremental charge of:

    Restaurants Costa Total

Goodwill
Goodwill acquired through business combinations is allocated to groups of CGUs at strategic business unit level, being  
the level at which management monitor goodwill.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In the absence of a recent market 
transaction the recoverable amount is determined from value in use calculations. The future cash flows are based on 
assumptions from the business plans and cover a five–year period. These business plans and forecasts include management’s 
most recent view of medium–term trading prospects. Cash flows beyond this period are extrapolated using a 2.0% growth  
rate (2011/12: 2.0%). The pre–tax discount rate applied to cash flow projections is 9.1% (2011/12: 9.3%).
The resultant impairment review required no impairment of goodwill allocated to either Hotels & Restaurants CGU or the  
Costa CGU.

Maturity analysis is grouped by when the debt is contracted to mature rather than by repricing dates, as allowed under IFRS.
The swaps with maturities beyond the life of the current revolving credit facilities (2016) are in place to hedge against the core 
level of debt the Group will hold.
The carrying amount of the Group’s borrowings is denominated in sterling and US dollars.
At 28 February 2013, the Group had available £405.0m (2012: £373.0m) of undrawn committed borrowing facilities in respect  
of revolving credit facilities on which all conditions precedent had been met.

Onerous contracts
Onerous contract provisions relate primarily to property reversions. Provision is made for rent and other property related  
costs for the period that a sublet or assignment of the lease is not possible.
Where the property is deemed likely to be assigned, provision is made for the best estimate of the reverse lease premium 
payable on the assignment. Where the property is deemed likely to be sublet, the rental income and the timing of the cash 
flows are estimated by both internal and external property specialists and a provision is maintained for the cost incurred  
by the Group.
Onerous lease provisions are discounted using a discount rate of 3.74% (2012: 3.74%) based on an approximation for the time 
value of money. 
The amount and timing of the cash outflows are subject to variations. The Group utilises the skills and expertise of both internal 
and external property experts to determine the provision held.
Provisions are expected to be utilised over a period of up to 25 years.
Other
Other provisions relate to warranties given on the disposal of businesses. These are expected to be used over periods of up  
to four years.

24 Financial risk management objectives and policies
The Group’s principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise bank loans, private placement loans, cash and 
short–term deposits. The Group’s financial instrument policies can be found in the accounting policies in Note 2. The Board 
agrees policies for managing the risks summarised below:
Interest rate risk 
The Group’s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Group’s long–term sterling debt 
obligations. Interest rate swaps are used to achieve the desired mix of fixed and floating rate debt in conjunction with private 
placement loan notes. The Group’s policy is to fix, on a long–term basis, between 35% and 65% of projected net interest cost.  
This policy reduces the Group’s exposure to the consequences of interest rate fluctuations. At the year–end, £310.8m (61.8%)  
of Group debt was fixed for an average of 6.87 years at an average interest rate of 5.1% (2012: £407.4m, 74.8%, for 5.50 years,  
at 5.3%). 
Although the private placement loan notes are US dollar denominated, cross–currency swaps mean that the interest rate risk  
is effectively sterling only.
In accordance with IFRS 7 the Group has undertaken sensitivity analysis on its financial instruments which are affected by 
changes in interest rates. This analysis has been prepared on the basis of a constant amount of net debt, a constant ratio  
of fixed to floating interest rates and on the basis of the hedging instruments in place at 28 February 2013 and 1 March 2012 
respectively. Consequently, the analysis relates to the situation at those dates and is not representative of the years then  
ended. The following assumptions were made:
 balance sheet sensitivity to interest rates applies only to derivative financial instruments, as the carrying value of debt  
and deposits does not change as interest rates move;
 gains or losses are recognised in equity or the income statement in line with the accounting policies set out in Note 2; and
 cash flow hedges were effective.
Based on the Group’s net debt position at the year–end, a 1ppt change in interest rates would affect the Group’s profit before  
tax by approximately £1.9m (2011/12: £1.3m) and equity by approximately £6.6m (2012: £7.8m).
Liquidity risk
In its funding strategy the Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between the continuity of funding and flexibility through 
the use of overdrafts and bank loans. This strategy includes monitoring the maturity of financial liabilities to avoid the risk  
of a shortage of funds.
Excess cash used in managing liquidity is placed on interest–bearing deposit with maturities fixed at no more than three 
months. Short–term flexibility is achieved through the use of short–term borrowing on the money markets. 
The tables below summarise the maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities at 28 February 2013 and 1 March 2012 based 
on contractual undiscounted payments, including interest:

24 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued
Credit risk
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
The Group is exposed to a small amount of credit risk that is primarily attributable to its trade and other receivables. This  
is minimised by dealing with counterparties with high credit ratings. The amounts included in the balance sheet are net of 
allowances for doubtful debts, which have been estimated by management based on prior experience and known factors  
at the balance sheet date which may indicate that a provision is required. The Group’s maximum exposure on its trade and 
other receivables is the carrying amount as disclosed in Note 19.
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents,  
the Group’s exposure arises from default of the counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying value of these 
instruments. The Group seeks to minimise the risk of default in relation to cash and cash equivalents by spreading investments 
across a number of counterparties.
In the event that any of the Group’s banks get into financial difficulties the Group is exposed to the risk of withdrawal of 
currently undrawn committed facilities. This risk is mitigated by the Group having a range of counterparties to its facilities  
and by maintaining headroom.
Foreign currency risk
Foreign exchange exposure is currently not significant to the Group. Although the Group has US dollar denominated loan notes 
these have been swapped into sterling thereby eliminating foreign currency risk. Sensitivity analysis has therefore not been 
carried out.
The Group monitors the growth and risks associated with its overseas operations and will undertake hedging activities as and 
when they are required.
Capital management
The Group’s primary objective in regard to capital management is to ensure that it continues to operate as a going concern  
and has sufficient funds at its disposal to grow the business for the benefit of shareholders. The Group seeks to maintain a ratio 
of debt to equity that balances risks and returns and also complies with lending covenants. See pages 30 to 33 of this report  
for the policies and objectives of the Board regarding capital management, analysis of the Group’s credit facilities and financing 
plans for the coming years.
The Group aims to maintain sufficient funds for working capital and future investment in order to meet growth targets. The 
Group has adopted a framework to keep leverage (debt divided by EBITDAR) on a pensions lease adjusted basis at 3.5 times  
or below which was achieved for the year ended 28 February 2013. This calculation takes account of net debt, pensions deficit 
and the capital value of leases. The management of equity through share buy backs and new issues is considered as part of the 
overall leverage framework balanced against the funding requirements of future growth. In addition, the Group may carry out  
a number of small sale and leaseback transactions to provide further funding for growth.
The Group’s financing is subject to financial covenants. These covenants relate to the measurement of EBITDA against 
consolidated net finance charges (interest cover) and total net debt (leverage ratio, on a not adjusted for pensions and 
property leases basis). The Group has complied with all these covenants.
The above matters are considered at regular intervals and form part of the business planning and budgeting processes.  
In addition, the Board regularly reviews the Group’s dividend policy and funding strategy.
25 Financial instruments
Fair values
As in the prior year the fair value of financial assets and liabilities disclosed in Notes 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 and 26 are considered  
to be approximately the same as their carrying amounts.
The fair value of loan capital and derivative instruments is calculated by discounting all future cash flows by the market yield 
curve at the balance sheet date.

Hierarchical classification of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value
IFRS 7 requires that the classification of financial instruments at fair value be determined by reference to the source of inputs 
used to derive the fair value. The classification uses the following three–level hierarchy:
Level 1
Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2
Other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly  
or indirectly.
Level 3
Techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market 
data.
   Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total

Financial liabilities 
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments    —   26.7   —   26.7 
During the year ended 28 February 2013 there were no transfers between levels 1, 2 or 3 fair value measurements. Derivative 
financial instruments include £7.1m assets (2012: £nil) and £18.7m liabilities (2012: £20.1m) due after one year. There are no 
material differences between the carrying values and fair values of derivative financial instruments.
Derivative financial instruments 
Hedges
Cash flow hedges
At 28 February 2013 the Group had interest rate swaps in place to swap a notional amount of £100.0m (2012: £200.0m) 
whereby it receives variable interest rates based on LIBOR on the notional amount and pays fixed rates of between 5.145%  
and 5.372% (2012: 5.145% and 5.643%). The swaps are being used to hedge the exposure to changes in future cash flows  
from variable rate debt. The Group also had cross–currency swaps in place whereby it receives fixed interest rates of between  
3.92% and 4.86% (2012: 3.92% and 4.86%) on a notional amount of US$210.0m (2012: US$210.0m) and paid an average  
of 4.72% on a notional sterling balance of £158.2m (2012: 4.72% on £158.2m).
The swaps with maturities beyond the life of the current revolving credit facilities (2016) are in place to hedge against the  
core level of debt the Group will hold.
Fair value hedges
At 28 February 2013, the Group had cross–currency swaps in place whereby it received a fixed interest rate of 5.23% (2012: 
5.23%) on a notional amount of US$75.0m (2012: US$75.0m) and paid a spread of between 1.715% and 1.755% (2012: 1.715%  
and 1.755%) over 6m GBP LIBOR on a notional sterling balance of £50.1m (2012: £50.1m).
Cash flow and fair value hedges are expected to impact on the income statement in line with the liquidity risk table shown  
in Note 24.
The cash flow hedges were assessed to be highly effective at 28 February 2013 and a net unrealised gain of £8.3m (2011/12:  
net unrealised loss of £1.0m) has been recorded in other comprehensive income. The fair value hedges were also assessed  
to be highly effective at 28 February 2013 with a credit of £0.4m recorded within finance revenue in the income statement 
(2011/12: £0.7m). During the year, a loss of £7.0m (2011/12: £16.9m) was charged to the income statement in respect of hedged 
items affecting the net finance charge for the year.

At the 2012 Annual General Meeting, the Company was authorised to purchase up to 17.8m of its own shares on the open market. 
During the year no ordinary shares were acquired (2011/12: nil). No shares were cancelled in the year (2011/12: nil).  
The remainder are being held in the treasury reserve (Note 28).
During the year to 28 February 2013 options over 0.2m ordinary shares, fully paid, were exercised by employees under the 
terms of various share option schemes (2011/12: 0.5m).
Shareholders were offered a scrip alternative to the 2011/12 cash final dividend of 33.75p and to the 2012/13 cash interim 
dividend of 19.50p. Ordinary shares issued in respect of this totalled 840,852. The issue of shares in lieu of cash dividends  
is treated as a bonus issue, with the nominal value of the shares being charged against the share premium account.
The total number of shares in issue at the year–end, as used in the calculation of the basic weighted average number of  
ordinary shares, was 193.0m less 13.8m treasury shares held by Whitbread PLC and 1.1m held by the ESOT (2012: 192.0m  
less 14.1m treasury shares held by Whitbread PLC and 0.9m held by the ESOT).

28 Reserves
Share premium
The share premium reserve is the premium paid on the Company’s 76.80p ordinary shares. The issue of shares in lieu of cash 
dividends is treated as a bonus issue, with the nominal value of the shares being charged against the share premium account. 
During the year, shares with a nominal value of £0.6m were issued in lieu of the 2011/12 final and 2012/13 interim cash dividends 
(2011/12: £0.1m).
Capital redemption reserve
A capital redemption reserve was created on the cancellation of the Group’s B and C preference shares (Note 27) and also 
includes the nominal value of cancelled ordinary shares.
Retained earnings
In accordance with IFRS practice, retained earnings include revaluation reserves which are not distributable under UK law.
Currency translation reserve
The foreign currency translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial 
statements of foreign subsidiaries and other foreign currency investments.
Treasury reserve
This reserve relates to shares held by an independently managed employee share ownership trust (ESOT) and treasury shares 
held by Whitbread PLC. The shares held by the ESOT were purchased in order to satisfy outstanding employee share options 
and potential awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) and other incentive schemes.
Merger reserve
The merger reserve arose as a consequence of the merger in 2000/01 of Whitbread Group PLC and Whitbread PLC.

29 Commitments and contingencies
Operating lease commitments
The Group leases various buildings which are used within the Hotels & Restaurants and Costa businesses. The leases are non–
cancellable operating leases with varying terms, escalation clauses and renewal rights. The Group also leases various plant and 
equipment under non–cancellable operating lease agreements.
Contingent rents are the portion of the lease payment that is not fixed in amount but based upon the future amount of a factor 
that changes other than with the passage of time (e.g. percentage of future sales, amount of future use, future price indices, 
future market rates of interest).
Future minimum rentals payable under non–cancellable operating leases on an undiscounted basis are as follows:
     2013 2012 
     £m £m
Due within one year      163.1   132.1  
Due after one year but not more than ﬁve years      554.6  465.5  
Due after ﬁve years but not more than ten years     502.1   393.3  
Due after ten years     1,240.7  996.3 
     2,460.5  1,987.2 
Future minimum rentals payable under non–cancellable operating leases disclosed above includes £123.0m in relation to privity 
contracts (2011/12: £127.7m). Future lease costs in respect of these privity contracts are included within the onerous contracts 
provision (Note 23). Onerous contracts are under constant review and every effort is taken to reduce this obligation.
The weighted average lease life of future minimum rentals payable under non–cancellable operating leases is 14.7 years (2012: 
13.9 years).
Group companies have sublet space in certain properties. The future minimum sublease payments expected to be received 
under non–cancellable sublease agreements as at 28 February 2013 are £11.8m (2012: £16.6m).
Contingent liabilities
In the financial year ended 3 March 2011 the Group received a £4.6m refund of VAT charged on gaming machine income, 
together with associated interest of £0.7m. The refund was made following a ruling that the application of VAT to certain types 
of gaming machine income contravened the European Union’s principle of fiscal neutrality. HMRC have appealed against the 
ruling and if HMRC’s appeal is upheld the refund and associated interest of £5.3m would be repayable.

Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
The LTIP awards shares to directors and senior executives of the Group. Vesting of shares under the scheme will depend  
on continued employment and meeting total shareholder return (TSR), earnings per share (EPS) performance and return  
on capital employed (ROCE) targets over a three–year period. Details of the performance targets for the LTIP awards can  
be seen in the remuneration report on pages 49 to 63.
The awards are settled in equity once exercised.
Movements in the number of share awards are as follows:
     2013 2012

Exercisable at the end of the year      119,293  — 
Deferred equity awards
Awards are made under the Whitbread Leadership Group Incentive Scheme implemented during 2004/05.
The awards are not subject to performance conditions and will vest in full on the release date subject to continued employment 
at that date. If the director or senior executive of the Group ceases to be an employee of Whitbread prior to the release date, 
normally three years after the award, by reason of redundancy, retirement, death, injury, ill health, disability or some other 
reason considered to be appropriate by the Remuneration Committee, the awards will be released in full. If employment ceases 
for any other reason the proportion of awards which vests depends upon the year in which the award was made and the date 
that employment ceased. If employment ceases in the first year after an award is made none of the award vests, between the 
first and second anniversary 25% vests and between the second and third anniversary 50% vests.

Expected volatility reflects the assumption that historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may not necessarily  
be the actual outcome.
The risk–free rate is the rate of interest obtainable from government securities over the expected life of the equity incentive.
The expected dividend yield is calculated on the basis of publicly available information at the time of the grant date which,  
in most cases, is the historic dividend yield.
No other features relating to the granting of options were incorporated into the measurement of fair value.
Employee Share Ownership Trust (ESOT)
The Company funds an ESOT to enable it to acquire and hold shares for the LTIP and executive share option schemes. The 
ESOT held 1.1m shares at 28 February 2013 (2012: 0.9m). All dividends on the shares in the ESOT are waived by the Trustee.

Defined contribution schemes
The Group operates a contracted–in defined contribution scheme under the Whitbread Group Pension Fund. Contributions  
by both employees and Group companies are held in externally invested trustee–administered funds. The Group also has  
a contracted–out defined contribution pension scheme which was wound up during 2012.
The Group contributes a specified percentage of earnings for members of the above defined contribution schemes and 
thereafter has no further obligations in relation to the schemes. The total cost charged to income in relation to defined 
contribution schemes in the year was £4.1m (2011/12: £3.6m).
At the year–end, 2,897 employees (2012: 1,812) were active members of the schemes, which also had 4,104 deferred members 
(2012: 6,777).
Defined benefit schemes
The defined benefit (final salary) section of the principal Group pension scheme, the Whitbread Group Pension Fund, was 
closed to new members on 31 December 2001 and to future accrual on 31 December 2009. The scheme is funded and 
contributions by both employees and Group companies are held in externally invested trustee–administered funds. Members  
of the scheme are contracted out of the State Second Pension.
At the year–end the scheme had no active members (2012: nil), 24,851 deferred pensioners (2012: 25,500) and 16,662 pensions 
in payment (2012: 16,511).
A scheme specific actuarial valuation for the purpose of determining the level of cash contributions to be paid into the 
Whitbread Group Pension Fund was undertaken as at 31 March 2011. A deficit recovery plan and some protection whilst the 
scheme remains in deficit have been agreed with the Trustee. The Group made a £35m payment in 2012/13 and will make the 
following payments to the Fund: £55m in August 2013, £65m in each of August 2014 and August 2015; £70m in August 2016; 
£80m in August 2017 and £75m in August 2018. For the period of the deficit, the Group has agreed to give undertakings to  
the Trustee similar to some of the covenants provided in respect of its banking agreements, up to the value of any outstanding 
recovery plan payments or the remaining deficit, if lower. Until the next valuation the Trustee has also been given a promise  
of participation in increases in ordinary dividends where these exceed RPI and the right to consultation before any special 
distribution can be made. 
In addition to the scheduled deficit contribution payments described above, the Pension Scheme will receive a share of the 
income, profits and a variable capital payment from its investment in Moorgate Scottish Limited Partnership (SLP), which was 
established by the Group in the year ended 4 March 2010 (the share in profits is accounted for by the Group as contributions 
when paid). The partnership interests in Moorgate SLP are held by the Group, the general partner and by the Pension Scheme. 
Moorgate SLP holds an investment in a further partnership, Farringdon Scottish Partnership (SP), which was also established 
by the Group during 2009/10. Property assets with a market value of £221m have been transferred from other Group 
companies to Farringdon SP and leased back to Whitbread Group PLC and Premier Inn Hotels Limited. The Group retains 
control over these properties, including the flexibility to substitute alternative properties. However, the Trustee has first charge 
over the property portfolio and certain other assets with an aggregate value of £228m. The Group retains control over both 
partnerships and as such they are fully consolidated in these consolidated financial statements.

The Pension Scheme is a partner in Moorgate SLP and, as such, is entitled to an annual share of the profits of the partnership 
over the next 12 years. At the end of this period, the partnership capital allocated to the Pension Scheme partner will, 
depending on the funding position of the Pension Scheme at that time, be transferred in cash to the Pension Scheme up to  
a value of £150m (2012: £150m). 
Under IAS 19 the investment held by the Pension Scheme in Moorgate SLP, a consolidated entity, does not represent a plan 
asset for the purposes of the consolidated financial statements. Accordingly the pension deficit position in these consolidated 
financial statements does not reflect the £141m (2012: £141m) investment in Moorgate SLP held by the Pension Scheme. 
During the year the Group agreed to enter into a charge in favour of Whitbread Pension Trustees Limited over properties with  
a market value totalling £180m at that date which was completed on 17 April 2013. The charge was to secure the obligations  
of the Group to make payments to the Pension Fund as part of the recovery plan to reduce the deficit. This together with  
the properties secured as a consequence of the arrangement in the Scottish Limited Partnerships, secures properties totalling 
£408m in favour of the pension scheme.
The total service cost contributions to the Whitbread Group Pension Fund in 2013/14 will be £nil.
The IAS 19 pension cost relating to the defined benefit section of the Whitbread Group Pension Fund is assessed in accordance 
with actuarial advice from Lane, Clark & Peacock and Towers Watson, using the projected unit credit method. As the scheme  
is now closed to future accrual, there will be no service cost in the future.
The principal assumptions used by the independent qualified actuaries in updating the most recent valuation, carried out as  
at 31 March 2011, of the UK schemes to 28 February 2013 for IAS 19 purposes were:
     At At 
     28 February 1 March 
     2013 2012 
     % %
Pre–April 2006 rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions    3.20 3.00 
Post–April 2006 rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions    2.20 2.20 
Pension increases in deferment     3.20 3.00 
Discount rate      4.60 4.65 
Inﬂation assumption      3.35 3.15
The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables which allow for future mortality improvements. The 
assumptions are that a member currently aged 65 will live on average for a further 20.9 years (2012: 20.8) if they are male and 
for a further 23.4 years (2012: 23.3) if they are female. For a member who retires in 2032 at age 65, the assumptions are that 
they will live on average for a further 22.7 years (2012: 22.6) after retirement if they are male and for a further 25.2 years (2012: 
25.1) after retirement if they are female.
The Group employs a building block approach in determining the long–term rate of return on pension plan assets. Historical 
markets are studied and assets with higher volatility are assumed to generate higher returns consistent with widely accepted 
capital market principles. The assumed long–term rate of return on each asset class is set out within this note. The overall 
expected rate of return on assets is then derived by aggregating the expected return for each actual asset allocation for the 
Fund at 28 February 2013 (rounded to the nearest 0.1% per annum).
The amounts recognised in the income statement in respect of the defined benefit scheme are as follows:
Amounts recognised in operating profit for service costs or curtailment are £nil (2011/12: £nil).

During the year the accounting deficit decreased from £598.7m at 1 March 2012 to £541.7m at 28 February 2013. The principal 
reason for this reduction was the actual asset performance being significantly better than expected while actual pension 
increases were also lower than assumed.

As the Group is adopting IAS 19 (2011) from 1 March 2013, there are no expected return on asset assumptions, (and consequently 
no weighted average expected rate of return on the asset base) at 28 February 2013, as these will no longer be required. 
Expected returns will be replaced by recording interest income, calculated by using the discount rate used to measure the 
pension obligation.

Directors’ responsibility for  
the Company financial statements
Statement of directors’ responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the Company financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations. Company law requires the 
directors to prepare Company financial statements for each 
financial year. Under that law the directors have elected to 
prepare the Company financial statements in accordance with 
United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice 
(United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). 
Under company law the directors must not approve the 
Company financial statements unless they are satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the 
Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that 
period. In preparing those Company financial statements,  
the directors are required to:
 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
 make judgements and estimates that are reasonable  
and prudent;
 state whether applicable UK accounting standards  
have been followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the Company financial 
statements; and
 prepare the financial statements on the going concern  
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain  
the Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company 
and enable them to ensure that the Company financial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They  
are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

Independent auditor’s report to the members  
of Whitbread PLC
We have audited the Company financial statements of 
Whitbread PLC for the year ended 28 February 2013 which 
comprise the Balance Sheet and related notes 1 to 11.  
The financial reporting framework that has been applied  
in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice).
This report is made solely to the Company’s members,  
as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so 
that we might state to the Company’s members those matters 
we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for 
no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we 
do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than 
the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our 
audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and of auditor 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation  
of the Company financial statements and for being satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit 
and express an opinion on the Company financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to 
comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards 
for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the Company financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts  
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the Company financial statements 
are free from material misstatement, whether caused  
by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether  
the accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall 
presentation of the Company financial statements. In addition, 
we read all the financial and non–financial information in  
the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with  
the audited Company financial statements. If we become 
aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on Company financial statements
In our opinion the Company financial statements:
 give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s 
affairs as at 28 February 2013;
 have been properly prepared in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
 have been prepared in accordance with the requirements  
of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the  
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
 the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be  
audited has been properly prepared in accordance with  
the Companies Act 2006; and
 the information given in the Directors’ Report for the 
financial year for which the consolidated financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the Company 
financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters 
where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, 
in our opinion:
 adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
Company or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
 the Company financial statements and part of the Directors’ 
remuneration report to be audited are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns; or
 certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified  
by law are not made; or
 we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the consolidated  
financial statements of Whitbread PLC for the year ended  
28 February 2013.

Shareholder FAQs
 
Where can I find information about B and C shares?
As outlined in the original Circulars, the Company made  
two separate purchase offers for the B and C shares. There  
will be no further purchase offers. The Company does have 
the right to convert the B and C shares to ordinary shares  
but there is no current intention to do so. The B and C shares  
will continue to attract an annual dividend payment.
How can I find the current share price?
It is easy to keep up to date with the current share price  
at the Company’s website www.whitbread.co.uk.
I have lost my share certificate, how can I get  
a replacement?
If you have lost your certificate please contact the  
Company registrars, Capita Registrars, on the shareholder 
helpline (0844 855 2327). They will then be able to assist  
you in arranging a replacement.
Warning to shareholders — boiler room scams
In recent years, many companies have become aware that 
their shareholders have received unsolicited phone calls  
or correspondence concerning investment matters. These  
are typically from overseas based ‘brokers’ who target UK 
shareholders, offering to sell them what often turn out to  
be worthless or high risk shares in US or UK investments. 
These operations are commonly known as ‘boiler rooms’. 
These ‘brokers’ can be very persistent and extremely 
persuasive, and a 2006 survey by the Financial Services 
Authority (FSA) reported that the average amount lost  
by investors is around £20,000, with around £200m lost  
in the UK each year.
It is not just the novice investor that has been duped  
in this way; many of the victims had been successfully 
investing for several years. Shareholders are advised  
to be wary of unsolicited advice, offers to buy shares  
at a discount or offers of free company reports. If you  
receive any unsolicited investment advice:
 make sure you get the correct name of the person  
or organisation;
 check that they are properly authorised by the  
FSA before getting involved by visiting  
www.fsa.gov.uk/fsaregister and contact the firm  
using the details on the register;
 report the matter to the FSA either by calling  
0845 606 1234 or visiting  
www.fsa.gov.uk/pages/consumerinformation.
 if the calls persist, hang up; and
 REMEMBER if it sounds too good to be true,  
it probably is!
If you deal with an unauthorised firm, you will not be  
eligible to receive payment under the Financial Services 
Compensation Scheme (FSCS) if things go wrong.  
The FSA can be contacted by completing an online form  
at http:/ /www.fsa.gov.uk/Pages/Doing/Regulated/Law/ 
Alerts/form.shtml.
Details of any share dealing facilities that the Company 
endorses will be included in Company mailings.
More detailed information on this or similar  
activity can be found on the FSA website 
www.fsa.gov.uk/pages/consumerinformation.

Whitbread Annual Report and Accounts 2012/13 124 Our charities
The Costa Foundation 
We don’t just make coffee; we make a difference
We’re committed to looking after coffee–growers and 
that’s why we established the Costa Foundation in 2007. 
Originally it worked under the registration of Charities  
Trust, an independently registered charity with the  
UK Charity Commission. In 2012 the Costa Foundation 
registered as a stand–alone charity.
The Foundation was set up to give something back to 
coffee–growing communities and since 2008, 32 schools  
or school projects have been completed in Colombia,  
Costa Rica, Ethiopia, Guatemala, Uganda and Vietnam.
The Foundation’s objectives are the relief of poverty and 
the advancement of education, health and environmental 
protection within coffee–growing communities and 
surrounding areas.
The money raised through the Foundation has given 
thousands of children access to education and ensured that 
the people who grow coffee receive the long–term support 
needed to ensure sustainable and improved futures.
By 2017 we aim to provide educational facilities to 50,000 
children by building 50 schools or school projects. In order  
to do this we need to raise £5 million in the next five years.  
It’s a huge amount, but with it, we’re able to do a huge 
amount of good.
Help us to continue the good work by donating:

Great Ormond Street Hospital  
Children’s Charity
Raise a smile and help a child
In May 2012, Whitbread Hotels & Restaurants chose  
Great Ormond Street Hospital Children’s Charity (GOSHCC)  
as its new charity partner. 
Each year, Great Ormond Street Hospital responds to  
over 200,000 patient visits from children all over the  
UK who are often suffering from rare, complex and life–
threatening conditions.
The charity needs to raise at least £50 million a year  
to help support the hospital’s work and the very special 
children it cares for. The hospital is in the process of 
redeveloping and replacing some of it’s oldest clinical 
buildings so that families can benefit from world class  
care in 21st century facilities and have more space  
to be together at the bedside. We are hoping to raise  
a significant sum of money that will support this  
wonderful hospital in achieving these aspirations.
Our first national fundraising campaign took place last 
September and a further fundraising drive was held in March, 
giving all our hotels and restaurants the opportunity to get 
involved, have fun and raise money. At the date  
of this Report we have raised £1 million for this very  
special charity.

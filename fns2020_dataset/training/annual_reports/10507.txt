2013 Since 1999 we have been helping 
UK households save money on 
their household bills and finances. 
We help consumers through three 
leading brands: 
MoneySuperMarket, 
TravelSupermarket and 
MoneySavingExpert.
Our strategic priorities
Our strategy is to build on our core 
business of helping customers to 
find the right product. Investing in 
our technology, customer data and 
tools allows us to build deeper 
relationships, delivering more value 
to both customers and providers.
Our performance
We increased the number of 
people engaging with us. This 
helped grow our revenues and 
market shares. Our technology 
investment programme is 
ongoing.
We launched new platforms for 
several of our channels. In the 
late autumn, our new car 
insurance site went into live test. 
Our new platforms leverage 
technology investment across our 
brands and services. 
Our customer account, MyProfile, 
allowed more than 15m 
customers to keep their data up 
to date and use it to save money 
with us. We recruited 2.3m new 
customers who want to do 
business with us. In our Money 
channels we worked hard to get 
market-leading products.
We made significant 
improvements to our CRM  
and organic search capability, 
helping providers reach the right 
customers. 
We take pride in being a 
profitable and efficient company 
that has a clear focus on its 
customers. We delivered on these 
goals in 2014.
BEST SITE
Be the easiest way for 
customers to find providers  
and products.
EARN CUSTOMER 
LOYALTY
Be the destination brand for 
users and customers.
PREFERRED PARTNER
Be the best way for 
providers to acquire 
customers.
CORE VALUES
One team always making 
things better for customers, 
colleagues and providers.
OUR VISION
We help every household make 
the most of their money.
CUSTOMERS
We provide our customers with 
free, easy to use, online services 
so they can search for a wide 
range of products and find the 
product most suited to their 
needs.
HOW DO WE MAKE MONEY?
For the majority of our services, 
we receive a small fee from the 
provider for customers who take 
out a product.

Marketing margin
2015 will see exciting innovation in 
TravelSupermarket, continued 
rollout of new technology to more 
MoneySuperMarket channels and 
new tools for MoneySavingExpert.
The sites need to continually 
adapt to changing customer 
needs. There is a risk that our 
technology takes longer to 
implement than planned, or does 
not deliver the expected benefits 
to customers and returns to the 
Group.
We will continue to add new 
channels to MyProfile. We will 
offer customers a greater range 
of services and analysis-based 
insights to help them save money.
The Group needs to continue to 
invest in its brands and its 
product offerings. There are 
always risks that we make 
mistakes in these. Our 
relationships with our customers 
are dependent on our ability to 
protect the data they choose to 
leave with us. 
We will use our data tools, 
analytics and position as the only 
major independent price 
comparison website to develop 
relationships with providers and 
secure market leading exclusive 
products for customers.
Our business is dependent on 
providers continuing to want to 
acquire new customers and to 
want to use price comparison 
websites for this.
Our strategy focuses on efficiency 
and on our customers. In 2015, 
we will measure ourselves on 
Adjusted Operating Profit rather 
than adjusted EBITDA, reflecting 
our technology investment.
Weakness in the UK economy 
could reduce the range of 
attractive products available for 
our customers, which could 
impact our revenues and 
margins.
Note: The figures for KPIs represent 2014 performance compared to 2013.
Financial Statements General Governance Overview Strategic Report
03 MONEYSUPERMARKET ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2014 With clear trends in our chosen 
markets, we have a strong and diverse 
mix of growth opportunities across
our key markets.
Markets Trends Impact Opportunities Brands affected
Price Comparison Regulatory focus
Greater focus from governmental and 
regulatory bodies (including the Financial 
Conduct Authority) on treating customers 
fairly, transparency of information and 
helping consumers make an informed 
choice.
Regulation will become an increasing 
feature of the price comparison sector.
The Group’s market position and strategy together with its 
systems, controls and infrastructure means it is well placed 
to deal with the impacts of any increase in regulation in 
the price comparison sector and to differentiate itself from 
its competitors through enhanced customer journeys and 
enhanced product offerings.
Insurance Motor insurance premiums
The trend of falling motor insurance 
premiums appears to be ending with 
premiums increasing in the second half of 
2014.
The increase in motor insurance 
premiums may encourage consumers 
to switch their motor insurance 
provider for a better deal.
As one of the leading motor insurance price comparison sites, 
MoneySuperMarket is well placed to benefit from consumers 
seeking to use its services to lower their motor insurance 
premiums and switch their motor insurance policy to a better 
deal.
Money Competition
Increasing competition among financial 
services providers for consumers who 
want credit products such as loans and 
credit cards.
The increasing competition among 
financial services providers to acquire 
consumers looking for credit products 
such as loans and credit cards results 
in an increase in the volume and 
quality of such products.
Consumers are more likely to compare and switch to higher 
quality products and make greater savings through the Group.
Home Services Political and regulatory focus
Increased political and regulatory focus 
on the costs of energy for consumers and 
the level of competition in the energy 
marketplace.
Economic changes
Falling oil prices worldwide leading to  
a fall in wholesale energy costs.
The increased political and regulatory 
focus on energy costs may lead to 
increasing consumer awareness of the 
costs of energy and the benefits of 
switching their energy provider.
Falls in oil prices result in lower energy 
tariffs and may result in greater 
savings for consumers who switch 
their energy product.
MoneySuperMarket is one of the leading energy comparison 
sites and MoneySavingExpert provides its Cheap Energy Club 
and Collective Switches for consumers. The Group is therefore 
well placed to benefit from consumers seeking to reduce their 
energy costs and switch their energy provider.
Travel Household budgets
Consumers with tight household budgets 
looking for the best deal for their holiday.
Consumers are looking to compare the 
costs of holiday components (including 
flights, hotels and car hire) to find the 
best deal on their holiday.
TravelSupermarket continues to focus on building leading 
comparison services for consumers to help them find the 
best deal for their holiday and to benefit from this increasing 
consumer demand.

05 MONEYSUPERMARKET ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2014 Saving Money, Feeling Epic. 
“In the last two months I’ve saved money 
on my insurance at MoneySuperMarket.  
I saved a third on my home insurance  
last month and have just halved my car 
insurance saving me over £300 a year! 
Thank you for saving me time and money!”
Whilst the UK economy is feeling more 
buoyant, we know that our customers still 
feel the pinch with rising bills, and 
stagnating salaries still a concern for 
many. We focus on empowering our 
customers to take control of their own 
household finances.
Choice. We work with as many providers 
as possible to give our customers the 
choices they deserve and the ability to find 
the product that is most suited to their 
needs. This is why we compare up to 30 
credit card and personal loan providers, 
over 50 mortgage providers, over 90 home 
insurance brands and over 150 car 
insurance brands. 
Scale. Our scale helps us negotiate  
great rates across all of our channels  
and work with our providers to deliver 
market-leading deals exclusive to 
MoneySuperMarket that are not  
available elsewhere.
Expertise. We are here for our customers, 
whether through the expert content  
on our website, our online chat service or 
our dedicated phone lines supporting 
those channels, such as energy 
comparison, where that extra bit of help 
can make all the difference to a customer’s 
peace of mind.
Data. Our new customer account, 
MyProfile, helps our customers to keep 
their data up to date and use it to save 
money with us. It also helps us to provide a 
service that is personalised to their needs.
The MoneySuperMarket ‘aggregation 
engine’ is the technology that takes 
customer information and sends it to our 
providers so they can return an accurate 
insurance quote in seconds. In 2014, we 
invested in moving our ‘aggregation 
engine’ to a more scalable technology 
platform with many clear benefits 
including, i) greater efficiency in the 
technology and lower costs to operate, ii) 
a platform for providers to self-serve and 
configure their own products – 
permitting greater agility in getting 
products to market and iii) a scalable 
platform for expansion paving the way 
for further growth.

Getting more for less. Holidays and 
weekend breaks are precious. We 
recognise this and focus our energy on 
getting our customers more holiday for 
their money – be it a cheaper flight, a 
superior hotel or a car hire upgrade for  
the same budget. 
One stop shop. Whilst going on holiday is 
great, booking one can be arduous. So 
much choice. So many variables. So much 
to consider. We do the hard work for our 
customers – comparing over 34 holiday 
providers, over 650 airlines and over 
200,000 hotels in a matter of seconds. 
Investment in a new technology 
architecture for car hire and flights has 
transformed the business for the future, 
helping providers find the right 
customers and significantly improving 
our customers’ experience on our site. 
Across both car hire and flights, the new 
technology offers a range of filtering and 
sorting tools, all of which work equally 
well across any device, making it even 
easier for customers to save money and 
find the right option for them.

to paying for parking at the airport, travel 
insurance or the best travel money

our campaigning stance – it’s what makes us 
‘us’. 
Power to you. More than 10 million people 
have signed up to receive our weekly email, 
empowering people to make better financial 
decisions. With more than 13 million site 
users each month, it has an active and 
passionate community that helps one 
another ― and the collective power of this 
user base has been harnessed to provide 
cheaper deals such as the Cheap Energy 
Club collective switch. 
More than 50% of our users now engage 
with our site via a mobile or tablet device. 
Accessible, unique and easy to 
understand content is at the heart of 
what MoneySavingExpert does so 
ensuring our content and tools are 
responsive for a mobile or tablet device 
has become paramount. Last year 
MoneySavingExpert invested 
considerable technological and editorial 
resources to start its journey to 
becoming a fully responsive, multi-
platform publishing site. More than 70% 
of our guides are now fully responsive, 
with the final 30% due to be completed 
this year. The full impact of this is yet to 
be seen but already it has significantly 
improved browse time and overall 
engagement. We will continue to develop 
our user experience by implementing 
intuitive navigation and empowering 
users to personalise content if required.

11 MONEYSUPERMARKET ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2014 Our three leading brands give us significant 
strength, breadth and diversity, generating 
growth and increasing the predictability of 
the business. All of our brands are consistent 
in their ambition to ‘help every household 
make the most of their money’.
Results and strategic progress
In 2014 the Group’s revenue increased by 
10% from £225.6m to £248.1m and 
adjusted EBITDA increased by 13% from 
£84.0m to £95.2m.
Once again, the Group achieved growth 
across all three brands: 
MoneySuperMarket, TravelSupermarket 
and MoneySavingExpert, with 
TravelSupermarket and 
MoneySavingExpert performing 
particularly well. Within 
MoneySuperMarket, all our business areas 
grew, as customers used our services to 
help them meet their financial needs.
Our three leading brands give us 
significant strength, breadth and diversity, 
generating growth and increasing the 
predictability of the business. All of our 
brands are consistent in their ambition to 
‘help every household make the most of 
their money’.
During 2014, we began a significant 
capital investment programme to 
improve our technology, our data 
capabilities and our customer journeys. 
Early results from the investment in our 
motor insurance channel are encouraging 
and further investment will be made in 
2015 to improve the customer journey in 
home insurance and thereafter in other 
channels. This investment will enable us 
to generate additional growth from the 
business and will further differentiate our 
brands from our competitors.
In parallel, we continued to invest 
significantly in our marketing strategy, 
including the strengthening of our 
digital marketing capability and 
the continuation of our ‘You’re So 
MoneySuperMarket’ advertising campaign, 
both of which helped to drive visitors 
to the Group’s websites. The ‘You’re So 
MoneySuperMarket’ theme has continued 
into the early part of 2015 with the launch 
of our latest advertising campaign.
We continue to maintain a strong financial 
position with good cash generation. Cash 
generated from operations during the year 
was £84m. After repaying £30m of the 
loan facility during 2014, the Group ended 
the year with net cash of £13.1m.
Dividends
Our continued confidence in the underlying 
strength and growth prospects for our 
business is reflected in our progressive and 
sustainable dividend policy.
Having reviewed the cash required by the 
business and the performance of the 
Group, the Company paid an interim 
dividend of 2.31p (2013: 2.16p and a special 
dividend of 12.92p) per ordinary share on 
12 September 2014. The interim dividend 
represented an increase of 7% on the 
interim dividend paid in 2013 (excluding 
the special dividend).
During the year, the business continued to 
generate cash, and with the business 
growing, the Board is recommending a 
final dividend of 5.69p (2013: 5.12p) per 
ordinary share, representing an increase 
of 11% on the final dividend in 2013. 
If approved by shareholders at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting, this 
will bring the total dividend for the year to 
8.00p (2013: 7.28p excluding the special 
dividend) per ordinary share and will be 
paid on 8 May 2015 to all shareholders on 
the register on 27 March 2015. The total 
dividend for the year will represent an 
increase of 10% on the total dividend paid 
in 2013 (excluding the special dividend).
Board composition and diversity
We have a strong and balanced Board, 
with a range of complementary skills to 
support the strategic and operational 
direction of the Group. During the year, we 
appointed Andrew Fisher and Genevieve 
Shore as Independent Non-Executive 
Directors. Both have added to the Board’s 
skills and experience and their 
backgrounds are set out more fully on 
page 31 of this report. We recognise the 
importance of diversity at Board level and 
our Board members represent a wide 
range of business backgrounds. During the 
year, we also further improved the 
representation of women at Board level.
Gerald Corbett retired as Chairman of the 
Board in April 2014 and I would like to 
thank Gerald for his leadership of the 
Group over seven years, from the IPO in 
2007 and through the difficult period of 
the financial crisis. Under Gerald’s 
chairmanship, the Group returned close to 
£300m to shareholders in ordinary and 
special dividends. 
Matthew Price joined the Group as Chief 
Financial Officer in April 2014 and brings 
his diverse career experience to our 
Group, helping us shape our strategy and 
future direction as we become a larger and 
more complex business.
Chairman’s Statement
12 MONEYSUPERMARKET ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2014 At the Annual General Meeting in April, 
Michael Wemms and Robin Klein will step 
down from the Board. Michael joined the 
Board at the IPO and has been our Senior 
Independent Director throughout his time 
on the Board whilst Robin joined the Board 
in 2013. I would like to thank Michael and 
Robin for their significant contributions to 
the Board over the years.
Board effectiveness
As Chairman, I am responsible for the 
leadership of the Board and ensuring its 
effectiveness in all aspects of its role.  
The Board is responsible for setting the 
strategic direction of the Group, monitoring 
the achievement of its business objectives, 
managing the risks inherent in the business 
and maintaining a system of effective 
corporate governance. 
Governance
The Board is committed to high standards 
of corporate governance and supports the 
principles laid down in The UK Corporate 
Governance Code published in September 
2012 by the Financial Reporting Council 
(Code).
Key areas of focus in 2014 included the 
formation of a new Board Risk Committee 
which has established a risk framework for 
the Group and manages the risks in the 
business against a number of risk metrics. 
We also conducted an external Board 
evaluation, with the assistance of SCT 
Consultants, which has helped the Board to 
review how we work, our skills, our 
diversity, our capabilities and how we can 
improve our effectiveness. We will continue 
to focus on Board effectiveness over the 
coming year. 
Given the increasing complexity of the 
Group and the formation of a new Board 
Risk Committee, the Board reviewed the 
membership of all the Committees during 
the year and made a number of changes 
with effect from 1 January 2015 to ensure 
the Committees continue to operate 
effectively. The current membership of the 
Committees are set out in the Corporate 
Governance Report on page 33. 
In line with good corporate governance, 
during the year, I ceased to be a member 
of the Board Committees with the 
exception of the Nomination Committee 
which I chair. The Board agreed that Sally 
James, as Chairman of the Risk Committee, 
should be a member of all the Committees 
to ensure that risk is appropriately 
considered in each Committee.
The Corporate Governance Report 
together with the Audit Committee Report, 
Nomination Committee Report, Risk 
Committee Report and the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report are set out on pages 
32 to 57 and describe how the principles of 
the Code are applied by the Group and 
reports on the Group’s compliance with 
the Code’s provisions.
Employees
Our results this year once again reflect the 
dedication and quality of all our employees 
across the Group. We rely on their skills, 
experience, competence and hard work to 
drive our business forwards. Their 
passion, innovation and performance are 
key assets for the Group and critical to its 
future success. On behalf of the Board, I 
would like to thank all of our employees 
for their significant contribution to the 
performance of the Group. 
Outlook
The new year has begun positively and, whilst 
we remain alert to the continuing uncertainty 
in the wider economic environment, we 
remain confident about our prospects in 
2015. Our great brands, strong market 
positions, experienced people, scale and 
breadth of offering, together with the 
investments we are making to improve our 
technology and customer journeys, will 
remain key strengths in the coming year and 
enable us to continue to differentiate 
ourselves from our competition.

Financial Statements General Governance Overview Strategic Report 2014 has been a successful year for the 
business, with strong second half growth 
building good momentum as we head into 
2015. I am very pleased with what we have 
achieved.
Most importantly however, the business 
has used 2014 to address the key 
components needed to execute our 
growth strategy for the next three  
years of:
• Best site: Be the easiest way for 
customers to find providers and 
products
• Earn customer loyalty: Be a destination 
brand for users and customers
• Preferred partner: Be the best way for 
providers to acquire customers 
Although our strategy has remained pretty 
much unchanged for several years, to 
ensure its continued focus and execution 
required a change in structure, skills and 
investment.
Moneysupermarket is now a Group of 
successful brands united by the common 
purpose of ‘helping every household make 
the most of their money’. We estimate that 
together, MoneySuperMarket, 
TravelSupermarket and 
MoneySavingExpert were visited by an 
average of 22.5m monthly unique visitors. 
Each brand needs to thrive to continue to 
engage its users, whilst of course 
benefiting from shared Group resources.
Therefore I have restructured the 
organisation with leaders of each business 
unit being responsible for engaging users, 
building their brand, working with 
providers, doing the right thing for 
customers and of course delivering against 
their financial targets.
I am determined to keep the Group 
structure responsible for technology, 
talent, finance and strategy lightweight 
and agile.
Our Group technology team work under 
the principle of ‘build once, use across all 
business units’. This means that our 
smaller businesses can benefit from the 
leading edge technology investments in 
MoneySuperMarket, building solid and 
robust infrastructures capable of 
sustaining significant future growth across 
our portfolio of businesses. 
This is particularly relevant as we pioneer 
the implementation of the market leading 
content management systems, future 
proofing the Group for whatever devices 
users choose to access our services in the 
years ahead. Our migration to Cloud 
infrastructure is essential to break free 
from fixed cost old traditional data centre 
architecture, designed for peak loads to a 
world of variable cost based operating 
platforms whose capacity and resources 
flex with customer demand no matter 
what time of day or day of week.
Finally and most importantly, the 
development of a Group enterprise data 
warehouse will support all our businesses 
with a single, secure infrastructure in 
which to keep customer data safe and 
drive superior and innovative 
personalisation and relevancy in real time.
Sharing talent and career development 
across the Group companies is essential 
for our long-term success. We have hired 
the most talented people we could find 
across both our London and Chester 
offices. We are exploring new ways of 
working, including tribes utilising multi-site 
and virtual working tools. 
The right acquisitions are of course a key 
part of our planning, after the successful 
purchase of MoneySavingExpert in 2012. 
Our earlier investment in HD Decisions, 
the data analytics business in 2011, 
pioneered new and exclusive services for 
both MoneySuperMarket and 
MoneySavingExpert through a suite of 
smart search tools and eligibility checker 
services. Our most recent acquisition, 
OnTrees, is a sophisticated account 
aggregation mobile App service. It is 
already benefiting from Group technology 
support whilst retaining its 
entrepreneurial culture and ways of 
working.
I am confident we are now structured for 
success, focused on a clear strategy and 
working hard to continue to hire and grow 
the best and most talented people we can 
find. 
Our brands are saving more people more 
money each year, a mission we intend to 
continue to invest and pioneer towards in 
the years ahead.
Finally, it is worth reflecting on where we 
have come from. When I joined the 
business in 2008, we were a young 
technology business, struggling to work 
closely with providers but passionate 
about using technology to help people 
save time and money when shopping for 
financial services products. For customers 
it was all about finding the cheapest prices. 
We have come a long way. 
Recently, our services have attracted a 
greater attention from our regulators, in 
part due to the growing habit exhibited by 
consumers to use price comparison 
services. The FCA, CMA and OFGEM have 
all taken a closer look at our services and 
ways of working. We have of course 
increased our internal governance and 
focus on doing the right thing for our 
customers. I am sure that like any business 
we have areas where we can do better. 
However, I am very encouraged that the 
overarching theme for our engagement 
with these bodies is that we have helped 
bring new competition to the markets in 
which we operate and that this has been 
good for consumers. 
Looking forward, our ambition is to take 
comparison services beyond price, a plan 
we have shared with our regulators and 
one they are actively encouraging the 
Group to pursue. Reassuringly it is the 
main focus of our current investment 
programme to lead what will be the next 
exciting chapter of ‘helping more people 
save more money’ within the 
Moneysupermarket Group.

Vision, values and strategy
Strategic priorities
Our strategy is to build on our core 
business of helping customers to find the 
right product. Investing in our technology, 
customer data and tools allows us to build 
deeper relationships, delivering more 
value to both customers and providers.
We continue to focus on delivering our 
technology investment and deepening 
our understanding of our customers – to 
help them make the most of their money.
Our new KPIs
As we implement our growth strategy and 
investment programme, we need to 
measure our performance against our 
strategy differently to how we have done 
it before. Measuring our performance 
against our growth strategy is key to our 
future. As part of our evolved strategy, we 
will now focus on a new select number of 
key performance indicators from 2015 
which are set out on page 3. 
Risk management
We recognise that the management of risk 
has a key role to play in the achievement 
of our strategy since risks can hinder or 
help us meet our desired level of 
performance. The relationship between 
our principal risks and our strategy is 
identified in the Principal Risks section of 
this report on pages 24 and 25.

Best site
Be the easiest way for customers to find

What we did in 2014
•  Aggregation engine
During the year, we invested in a new 
aggregation engine that will be the 
platform for our aggregation channels. 
Utilising that new technology, 
TravelSupermarket launched new car 
hire and flights channels in 2014, and 
in the Autumn, MoneySuperMarket’s 
new car insurance site went into live 
test.
•  Customer journey
We spent a great deal of time during 
the year understanding how we can 
improve our customer journeys to 
make it even easier for customers to 
use our services and importantly to 
help them make an informed choice on 
the products that are most suited to 
their needs.
•  Collective switch
In 2014, MoneySavingExpert launched 
the first of its collective switches by 
utilising the power of its loyal users to 
negotiate exclusive market leading 
energy tariffs from energy providers 
and then collectively switching users to 
those tariffs.
What we will do in 2015
We will continue to invest in our 
technology in 2015 and roll out that 
technology to more channels across our 
brands. We will constantly search out new 
opportunities to help our customers 
make an informed choice on the products 
that are most suited to their needs.
02
Earn customer loyalty 
Be a destination brand for users and 
customers
What we did in 2014
•  MyProfile
We continued to invest in our customer 
account, MyProfile, to enable 
customers to securely store their data 
with us and then use it to search for 
different products without having to 
input their details again, making it 
easier and quicker for our customers 
to make the most of their money. 
•  Best price
MoneySuperMarket worked with our 
providers during 2014 to offer our 
customers exclusive market leading 
products or deals that were not 
available elsewhere, including at times 
car insurance quotes that were lower 
than were available through our 
competitors.
•  Mobile optimised
As more of our customers engage with 
us on a mobile device, we have 
continued to invest throughout the 
year in making our brands mobile 
optimised. This included 
MoneySavingExpert where over 70% of 
its guides are now fully responsive on a 
mobile device.
What we will do in 2015
We will continue to focus on our customer 
account capabilities to make it even easier 
for our customers to use their data across 
more of our channels so that they can 
quickly and easily find the right product 
for themselves. We recognise that more 
and more customers want to use our 
services through a mobile device and so 
we will continue to design our customer 
journeys and our content to ensure they 
work well on a mobile device. We will 
continue to work hard with our providers 
to identify opportunities to offer our 
customers exclusive market leading deals.
03
Preferred partner
Be the best way for providers to acquire 
customers
What we did in 2014
•  Customer insights
During 2014, we continued to work 
with our providers through the 
provision of insights about our 
customers to help them understand 
what our customers want so that they 
can improve their products. 
•  Marketing
We made significant improvements to 
our CRM and organic search capability 
during the year which helped our 
providers to get their brands in front of 
more of our customers with their key 
messages.
•  Relationships
As the only major independent price 
comparison site, our commercial 
teams focused throughout 2014 on 
building stronger relationships with 
our providers, with the aim of being 
their partner of choice. We worked 
hard to understand our providers 
objectives and to identify 
opportunities for us to work together 
to help our customers.
What we will do in 2015
We will continue to develop our 
capabilities to offer improved customer 
insights to our providers to help them 
improve their products and by building 
stronger relationships with our providers 
we can help them to identify new 
opportunities. We will also focus on 
developing our CRM and search capability 
to ensure our providers are able to target 
more customers with their key marketing 
messages.

Basis of preparation
The results show the trading results for the years ended 31 December 2014 and 2013 respectively. The following adjustments have been made in arriving at adjusted 
EBITDA:
1 Amortisation of acquisition related intangible assets
 The acquisition of Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited by the Company prior to Listing gave rise to £207.2m of intangible assets. These will be 
written off over a period of 3–10 years with a charge of £17.8m expensed in 2014 (2013: £23.0m). 
 The acquisition of the trade and certain assets of MoneySavingExpert.com and a sole trader business from Martin Lewis (together ‘MSE’) on 21 September  
2012 by the Group gave rise to £12.9m of intangible assets. These will be written off over a period of 3–10 years with a charge of £1.7m included within 2014  
(2013: £1.7m). 
2 Contingent payable in relation to the acquisition of MoneySavingExpert
 The Group has recognised an administrative expense relating to deferred remuneration which is linked to continued employment in the Consolidated Statement 
of Comprehensive Income in 2014 of £3.9m (2013: £8.0m). 
3 Corporate finance fees
 During the prior year, the Group incurred fees of £0.6m in relation to advice relating to a special dividend of £70.0m paid to shareholders in July 2013.
Reference is made below to adjusted cost base and adjusted distribution and administration expenses. These measures represent costs charged to the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, less intangible amortisation relating to acquisitions, costs recognised in respect of the contingent payable in 
relation to the acquisition of MoneySavingExpert and corporate finance fees.

Business Review
18 MONEYSUPERMARKET ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2014 During 2014 the MoneySuperMarket.com business continued to grow with revenues ahead of last year in all business areas. Growth 
was strong in the Insurance and Money businesses. After a period of falling motor insurance premiums, premiums increased, which 
encourages switching. Revenues in the Money vertical increased primarily through demand for comparing unsecured loans and credit 
cards. Growth rates accelerated in the second half of the year as the Group regained its natural search rankings.
TravelSupermarket.com grew its revenues for the full year by 28%. It benefited from focused TV advertising in the key trading months 
and from ongoing investment in technology. 
Revenue in MoneySavingExpert.com was 17% ahead of last year (prior to eliminating intra-group revenues). Growth was driven by 
credit cards and utilities, which has again benefited from the success of the Cheap Energy Club launched in 2013.  
MoneySavingExpert.com contributed £15.2m to Group adjusted EBITDA (2013: £13.3m).
The Group remains committed to its technology development and invested £16.1m in 2014. This investment, as part of a three-year 
programme, focuses on three areas – developing our data asset, building a new aggregation engine, and upgrading our customer 
experience and journey. The investment allows for greater flexibility and scalability across our different channels and any future 
channels. Customers will benefit from better connectivity across channels and be able to seamlessly use different devices to conduct 
the same transaction. The Group believes this investment will allow it to deliver services more effectively to customers, especially on 
mobile devices.
Group gross margins increased from 77.8% to 78.9%, largely as a result of increased volumes of traffic through natural search and the 
continued optimisation of paid search. The proportion of direct to site revenues increased from 75% in 2013 to 79% in 2014. Paid search 
represented 17% of revenue in the year (2013: 20%), with a notable reduction from the second quarter of 2014 onwards. This will affect 
year on year margin improvement comparisons from the second quarter of 2015 onwards.
Distribution costs were 11% higher than 2013, primarily due to higher offline marketing earlier in the year. The Group continued the 
‘You’re So MoneySuperMarket’ campaign on television supported by radio and print campaigns.
Adjusted administrative costs increased by 11% from £67.0m to £74.3m in 2014. Adjusted staff costs (including contract resource) were 
9% higher at £41.9m, largely driven by increased bonus levels. Other administrative costs increased by £2.4m mainly as a result of 
development project work.
Adjusted EBITDA margins increased from 37.2% to 38.4% against the same period last year.
The Group operates across a number of businesses and markets. These are discussed below:

The Directors use key performance indicators (KPIs) to assess the performance of the business against the Group’s strategy. These are 
reviewed on a regular basis. The principal KPIs for the business are as follows:
Visitors – the Group measures the number of visitors to its websites as the number of unique visitors per day, per channel, per device, 
measured on a cumulative basis using cookie-based tracking methodologies.
Transactions – the Group measures transactions at the point in time that the customer leaves the Group’s websites having clicked 
through to a third party website, or in some cases having completed an application form hosted on the Group’s websites.
Revenue per visitor (RPV) – the Group measures the total revenue (including click and other internet revenue) divided by the number 
of visitors defined above.
Revenue per transaction (RPT) – the Group measures the click based revenue divided by the total number of transactions defined 
above.

The Money vertical offers customers the ability to search for and compare products including credit cards, current accounts,

Total revenue increased by 13% from £52.1m to £58.9m and click based revenue by 15% from £49.0m to £56.5m. Visitors to the Money 
vertical were 2% lower than last year.
Revenues from credit products, defined as secured and unsecured loans, credit cards, debt solutions and mortgages but excluding 
impression-based advertising accounted for almost 80% of the growth in the Money vertical.
Trading improved in the second half of the year relative to the first half. Money revenues were 22% ahead in the second half of the year 
against a first half where revenues were 6% ahead, largely driven by the increase in the volume and quality of credit card and loan 
products available on our site, including market-leading and exclusive deals. The Group chose to stop operating in the payday loans 
market in the middle of 2013, reducing revenues in the second half of 2013, thereby improving half on half growth in 2014.
The Group’s non-credit business and in particular its savings revenues have continued to be impacted by the Government’s ‘Funding 
for Lending’ scheme which means financial institutions can borrow from the Bank of England at attractive rates and don’t need to 
compete for retail deposits. The Government announced on 2 December that the scheme was to be extended for a further period to 29 
January 2016. 
Other revenue, which includes revenue from the sale of leads and advertising, fell by £0.7m. The Group has continued to focus upon 
improving its core click based offering, reducing impression-based advertising revenues.
Insurance
The Insurance vertical offers customers the ability to search for and compare insurance products such as breakdown, dental, home, 
life, medical, motor, pet and travel insurance, amongst other things. It also includes elements of the Group’s leads business and 
advisory business together with advertising revenue related to insurance products.

Revenues in the Insurance vertical increased 8% from £127.6m to £138.0m. Click-based revenue increased by 7% from £110.9m to 
£118.4m. Visitors increased by 3% over the period.
Revenues in the second half of the year accelerated compared with the first half whereby revenues were 13% ahead of the 
corresponding second half period, following a 4% first half increase. 
Motor insurance premiums increased in the second half of the year after a period of decline, this encouraged greater interest in 
switching. Home insurance premiums continued to decline. In addition, the Group recovered its natural search rankings after May 
2014.
Travel insurance showed good growth, benefiting from improvements to the site. Life insurance also grew strongly following a redesign 
of the customer journey.

Revenue in the Home Services vertical increased for the full year by 3% from £21.7m to £22.4m. 
The KPIs reported for this vertical used to include the shopping and vouchers business, which would have added revenue of £0.2m and 
7.4m visitors in the year to the table above (revenue of £0.2m and 9.6m visitors in 2013). The shopping and voucher business is not a 
priority for the Group and so is excluded from the table to allow better visibility of the underlying performance of the vertical.
Revenues from utility switching, which account for the majority of revenues within the Home Services vertical, were strong as the 
channel continued to benefit from the popular Cheap Energy Club service launched by MoneySavingExpert.com in 2013. This service 
allows consumers to register for alerts when savings available against their current tariff exceed a predetermined amount set by the 
consumer. In the last quarter of 2014, the Group ran a highly successful collective switch, allowing customers to apply for market-
leading tariffs available exclusively through the Group.
TravelSupermarket.com

Revenues increased by 28% from £17.7m to £22.6m. Click based revenue increased by 24% to £21.1m.
Trading was very strong in the year, particularly in the seasonally stronger first half. The Travel business benefitted from a focused 
television and radio campaign in the important January and July trading periods, which resonated well with consumers.
The Group’s ongoing investment in technology has enabled the business to re-platform a number of its core channels and will allow it 
to make future changes to the customer proposition in a more agile manner.
MoneySavingExpert.com (MSE)
MoneySavingExpert.com generated revenues of £22.8m (2013: £19.5m), of which £16.8m (2013: £13.4m) related to revenues also 
recognised within MoneySuperMarket.com, generated from traffic referred to it by MSE. It contributed £15.2m (2013: £13.3m) to Group 
adjusted EBITDA.
Trading trends have been consistent with those seen by MoneySuperMarket.com with good growth in revenues from borrowing. 
Utilities revenues continued to be driven by the Cheap Energy Club and the collective switch referred to earlier.
The acquisition of the trade and certain assets of MoneySavingExpert.com and a sole trader business from Martin Lewis, included a 
deferred element payable in part against the achievement of certain non-financial metrics over a three year period and in part at the 
Board’s discretion subject to the continued employment of Martin Lewis. The deferred element will be settled on the third anniversary 
of completion in September 2015. The Group has recognised in administrative expenses a charge of £3.9m (2013: £8.0m) in the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income in respect of deferred remuneration linked to continued employment.

Financial Statements General Governance Overview Strategic Report Acquisition of OnTrees
On 14 March 2014, the Group acquired the trade and assets of the OnTrees bank account and credit card aggregation service for £1.5m. 
This web and mobile app allows consumers to see an overview of their finances by connecting their bank accounts and credit cards in a 
single tool. This tool gives a breakdown of all income and expenditure across accounts and helps users see where they are spending 
most, and where they can save.
Disposal of HD Decisions Limited
On 7 May 2014, the Group disposed of its 25% holding in its credit scoring technology associate, HD Decisions Limited, for cash 
consideration of £5.3m, resulting in a profit on disposal of £3.9m. In addition, further contingent consideration of up to £1.9m may 
become payable, dependent upon certain financial targets over a three year earn-out period.
Cash balance and dividend
As at 31 December 2014 the Group had net cash of £13.1m (2013: net debt £21.1m). 
Having reviewed inter alia, the performance of the Group and the cash required by the business, the Board is recommending a final 
dividend, subject to shareholder approval, in respect of the year ended 31 December 2014 of 5.69p per ordinary share.
Together with the interim dividend of 2.31p per ordinary share paid on 12 September 2014, this gives a total normal dividend for the 
year of 8.00p per ordinary share (2013: 7.28p excluding the special dividend paid during that year), reflecting the Board’s confidence in 
the ability of the business to generate cash on an on-going basis.
The Board is committed to a progressive dividend policy, with on-going monitoring of the appropriate capital structure.
The ex-dividend date for the final dividend is 26 March 2015, with a record date of 27 March 2015 and a payment date of 8 May 2015. 
Shareholders will have the opportunity to elect to reinvest their cash dividend and purchase existing shares in the Company through a 
Dividend Reinvestment Plan.
Tax
The Group tax charge of £13.1m in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income represents an effective tax rate of 19.9% 
(2013: 19.5%). This is lower than the prevailing rate of 21.5% (2013: 23.25%) due to the profit on disposal of HD Decisions Limited being 
exempt from corporation tax under the substantial shareholdings exemption.
In future, and once the statutory rate of tax has settled, the Group expects the underlying effective rate of tax to approximate to the 
standard UK corporation tax rate.
Earnings per ordinary share
Basic statutory earnings per ordinary share for the year ended 31 December 2014 was 9.7p (2013: 6.4p). Adjusted basic earnings per 
ordinary share increased from 10.8p to 12.3p per share. The adjusted earnings per ordinary share is based on profit before tax after 
adding back intangible amortisation related to acquisitions, costs related to the contingent consideration payable for 
MoneySavingExpert.com, the profit on disposal of HD Decisions Limited and fees associated with the special dividend paid in the prior 
year. A tax rate of 21.5% (2013: 23.25%) has been applied to calculate adjusted profit after tax.
Business Review
22 MONEYSUPERMARKET ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2014 Key contractual arrangements
Moneysupermarket.com Limited, a subsidiary of the Company, is party to contracts and other arrangements which the Directors judge 
are essential to the Group’s business.
As with any internet business the Group is dependent upon its ability to attract customers to its website either directly or through paid 
search or portal partners, and revenue generated from commercial arrangements with its providers.
The Group uses television advertising to attract customers to its website directly. The Group incurred costs of £28.2m (2013: £25.6m) 
relating to television and other offline advertising. The Group has contracts with a number of media agencies to acquire advertising 
inventory from commercial television companies. The Group typically has a commitment of between 6 and 10 week’s expenditure at 
any one time. Television and other offline advertising costs represent 83% (2013: 83%) of distribution costs.
The Group uses search engines to acquire traffic via paid search. The Group spent £39.1m (2013: £39.1m) on paid search during the 
year. Although there are a number of search engines that operate in the UK, Google is the dominant search engine and accounts for the 
majority of the Group’s spend in this area. The Group has no forward commitment to search engines and manages its spend on a real 
time basis.
The Group has a number of contracts with providers which are based either on a cost per click basis or a cost per application basis or a 
hybrid of the two. It also has a number of commercial arrangements based on the number of page impressions served in the case of 
banner advertising. The Group does not consider it has any material contracts with providers in any one channel. The Group does 
however frequently deal with providers across a range of different channels managed under different contracts, often to different 
parts of the same organisation, and occasionally through third party media agencies. At this consolidated channel level, the largest 
individual provider represented approximately 4% (2013: 3%) of Group revenue in 2014.

Financial Statements General Governance Overview Strategic Report How we mitigate risk
During 2014, the Group has made 
enhancements to the risk management 
framework including embedding risk 
reporting and enhancing management 
information to facilitate customer  
focused outcomes.
Risk Management
In common with all businesses, the Group 
faces risks, the effective management of 
which is necessary to enable it to achieve 
its strategic objectives and secure the 
business for the long term. Risk 
management is critical to the effective 
running of the business and provides a 
greater prospect of achieving the strategic 
objectives, whilst also giving a competitive 
advantage. Risk management is 
considered as part of the Group’s decision 
making processes.
Risk Appetite
Risk appetite is an expression of the 
amount and type of risk the Group is 
willing to accept in order to achieve its 
strategic objectives. The Group’s risk 
appetite influences the business culture 
and operating decisions and is reflected in 
the risk management framework. Risk 
exposures outside of appetite are 
escalated and reported to the Risk 
Committee alongside action plans to 
reduce the risk on a timely basis. 
The tables below summarise, in the opinion of the Board, the principal risks to the Group and how the Group seeks to mitigate them in 
the day-to-day running of the business.
Strategic priority: Best site
Be the easiest way for customers to find providers and products
Risk area Description Risk type Mitigating activities
Competition Loss of market share or reduction in 
margins as a result of channels and 
platforms not delivering expected 
benefits to customers and the Group.
Strategic Risk • The Group continues to focus on 
building market leading propositions 
for its customers including investment 
in new platforms across a range of 
channels which deliver additional 
features and functionality to 
customers.
• Evolution of existing platforms to 
improve customer experience and 
make comparing products easier.
Changing 
consumer 
demand
Reduction in customers if the Group fails 
to adapt to changing customer behaviours 
in using new technologies such as 
increasing use of mobile devices to access 
the internet or social media.
Strategic Risk • Regular engagement with customers 
to understand changes in the way in 
which they utilise the Group’s services.
• The Group has invested significantly 
in technology to allow customers to 
access the Group’s websites across 
multiple devices.
Strategic priority: Earn customer loyalty
Be a destination brand for users and customers
Risk area Description Risk type Mitigating activities
Brand 
strength
Loss of confidence by customers in the 
brands operated by the Group resulting 
in reduced engagement and loyalty from 
customers.
Strategic Risk • Continued investment in advertising 
across a range of media to maintain 
the Group brands in customers’ minds.
Product offering Reduction in customer loyalty with 
existing customers and an inability to 
attract new customers if the business 
fails to maintain a competitive price 
and product offering as a leading price 
comparison business.
Operational/
Conduct Risk
• The Group seeks to build strong 
relationships with providers to develop 
varied product offerings including 
exclusive products and offers and 
competitive pricing.
• The Group undertakes rigorous 
checking of its websites through audit 
and review to maintain the accuracy of 
information displayed.
Customer 
trust
Negative impact on reputation and loss 
of customer trust through impact of an 
operational event such as loss or misuse 
of customer personal data.
Operational/
Conduct Risk
• Investment in flexible systems to put 
customers in control of how personal 
data is held and used.
• Rigorous controls and regular testing 
of the Group’s systems and investment 
in infrastructure will ensure the 
integrity and robustness of the Group’s 
systems.
Principal Risks
24 MONEYSUPERMARKET ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2014 Risk Management Processes
The Group adopts a formal risk 
identification and management process 
designed to ensure that risks are properly 
identified, prioritised, evaluated and 
mitigated to the extent that is possible. 
Risks are reviewed across the Group on a 
regular basis and formally reported to the 
Risk Committee. 
The Risk & Compliance function provides 
challenge to the business in their 
assessment and management of risks with 
particular focus on the actions being taken 
to reduce the risk. Internal Audit and 
Compliance monitoring findings are an 
additional consideration in the assessment 
of risks. 
Each risk is owned by a member of the 
Executive Management Team who review 
the assessment and are responsible for 
delivery of mitigating actions. Possible 
future risks are also considered and 
preventative measures taken as 
appropriate.
Strategic priority: Preferred partner
Be the best way for providers to acquire customers
Risk area Description Risk type Mitigating activities
Relevance 
to partners
Providers may increase their focus 
on customer retention rather than 
acquisition or seek alternative sources 
of customer acquisition outside of price 
comparison websites.
Strategic Risk • The Group seeks to innovate in the 
solutions and benefits it can offer 
to providers and maximise the 
opportunities for providers to acquire 
customers in a cost effective manner.
Core values
One team always making things better for customers, colleagues and providers
Risk area Description Risk type Mitigating activities
Economic 
uncertainty
Weaknesses in the economic environment 
may cause providers to reduce product 
range or tighten acceptance criteria for 
customers seeking to obtain credit. This 
may reduce competition for business, 
customer choice, Group revenue and the 
customer proposition of price comparison 
websites.
Strategic Risk • Commercial arrangements exist with 
a wide range of providers offering 
genuine choice to customers.
• Building strong relationships with 
providers to ensure that the Group is 
able to provide solutions to the needs 
of providers.
• Focus on maintaining control of cost 
base in order that the business is an 
efficient customer acquisition route for 
providers.
Regulation Changes to existing regulation or 
the introduction of new regulatory 
requirements requires changes to the 
core business model in order to comply.
Strategic Risk • The Group seeks to have a strong 
relationship with regulators and shares 
the vision of regulators generally to 
make products more accessible and 
understandable to customers.
• The Group Risk & Compliance function 
works across the business to ensure 
it remains compliant with existing 
regulation and is able to highlight 
where changes may impact business 
processes.

Communities and charities
The Group’s .Community initiative was 
launched in 2008 and has continued to 
develop during 2014. The initiative is 
focused on providing support to charities 
and community groups located within a 
few miles of the Group’s offices in Ewloe, 
so support is targeted primarily in 
Flintshire and Cheshire.
A volunteer group of employees meet 
regularly to review requests for donations 
and to allocate funds according to agreed 
donation guidelines. Employees are also 
active in researching and seeking out local 
good causes that the Group can help 
support. The initiative has been effective 
at harnessing the energy and enthusiasm 
of the Group’s employees to benefit the 
communities in which it operates.
In 2014 the Group made £2,000 per month 
available for the .Community initiative. 
This funding has been channelled via the 
Charities Aid Foundation, enabling the 
Group to make gross donations to 
registered charities.
Over the course of the year the Group has 
supported over 40 charities and 
community groups including:
• Barnados/Flintshire Young Carers 
• Danger Point Talacre
• Ty Nos Homeless Shelter
• Hawarden Rangers 
• Action for Sick Children 
• Wrexham Womens Aid 
In addition to the .Community initiative, 
the Group and its employees continue to 
select and support a Charity of the Year on 
an annual basis.
The 2014 Charity of the Year was Mind. The 
charity provides help and support to those 
affected by mental health problems. Over 
the course of the year the Group’s 
employees raised £66,832 for Mind with 
the Group also donating £31,267 bringing 
the total donated to Mind during the year 
to £98,099.
The 2015 Charity of the Year is the National 
Autistic Society. The charity provides help 
and support to those affected by autism.
The Group launched a volunteering 
scheme in October 2011 through which the 
Group supports a total of 60 volunteering 
days per year to help those who are less 
fortunate, and thereby make a valuable 
contribution to our local community. 
During the year employees volunteered in 
a diverse range of activities including Save 
The Family at Plas Belin Oakenholt and the 
sponsored ‘Kilimanjaro Challenge’.
Environment 
The Group is committed to reducing 
energy and raw material usage to support 
environmental and financial performance 
and have implemented the following 
initiatives to support this aim:
• The installation of solar panels at the 
Group’s Ewloe office resulting in energy 
savings of approximately 5,092kwh 
during 2014
• The installation of LED lighting at the 
Group’s Ewloe office
• The replacement of PCs and printers 
with more energy efficient models
The Group estimates that during 2014 it 
recycled on average over 80% of its 
commercial waste.
Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 
This section includes our mandatory 
reporting of greenhouse gas emissions 
pursuant to the Companies Act 2006 
(Strategic Report and Directors’ Report) 
Regulations 2013. The methodology used to 
calculate our emissions is based on the GHG 
Protocol Corporate Standard. Emissions 
reported correspond with our financial year. 
We have included emissions from both our 
owned and leased assets for which we are 
responsible. Emissions are predominantly 
from gas combustion and electricity use at 
our offices and data centres. We have 
reported on all material emission sources 
which we deem ourselves to be responsible 
for. Emission factors are from UK 
government conversion factor guidance 
current for the year reported.
In order to express our annual emissions 
in relation to a quantifiable factor 
associated with our activities, we have 
used revenue as our intensity ratio as this 
is a relevant indication of our growth and 
is aligned with our business strategy.

Corporate Responsibility Report
26 MONEYSUPERMARKET ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2014 The Group is committed to an equal 
opportunities policy. The Group aims to 
ensure that no employee is discriminated 
against, directly or indirectly, on the 
grounds of colour, race, ethnic and 
national origins, sexual orientation or 
gender, marital status, disability, religion 
or belief, being part time or on the 
grounds of age.
Approximately 57% of our employees are 
male and 43% female. In our senior 
leadership team, approximately 85% of the 
team are male and 15% female whilst on 
our Board, 82% of the Directors are male 
and 18% female.
The Group recognises the importance of 
health and safety and the positive benefits 
to the Group. The Group has a health and 
safety policy which is communicated to all 
employees through a health and safety 
handbook, which is regularly reviewed and 
updated.
Supporting students 
In order to build links between the Group 
and local schools and colleges, work 
experience and placements are offered to 
a number of students. In doing so, the 
Group strives to make work placements 
positive, challenging and relevant to 
participants’ current studies and their 
future job prospects.
Business ethics 
The Group has formal ethics and anti-
bribery policies which incorporate the 
Group’s key principles and standards 
governing business conduct towards our 
key stakeholder groups. We believe we 
should treat all of these groups with 
honesty and integrity.
Employees
The Group actively encourages employee 
involvement and consultation. It places 
considerable emphasis on keeping its 
employees informed of the Group’s 
activities via formal business 
performance updates, regular update 
briefings, regular team meetings, the 
Group’s intranet site which enables easy 
access to the latest Group information as 
well as Group policies, and the circulation 
to employees of relevant information 
including corporate announcements. 
This also helps to achieve a common 
awareness amongst employees of the 
financial and economic factors affecting 
the performance of the Group.
A robust employee engagement survey 
process is also in place to ensure that 
employees are given a voice in the 
organisation and that the Group can take 
action based on employee feedback.

Financial Statements General Governance Overview Strategic Report UK Corporate Governance Code
As a Board of Directors we aspire to establish a governance 
structure for the business which provides effective control and 
oversight of the business without harming the entrepreneurial 
spirit which has been the hallmark of the Group’s success in 
striving to help every household make the most of their money.
Our Corporate Governance Report is set out on pages 32 to 36. 
This section of the Annual Report sets out how we lead the 
Group and comply with the provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. It also outlines any governance initiatives 
undertaken in the year.
Key areas of focus this year included the formation of a new Risk 
Committee to give a specific focus to the risks faced by the Group 
and to ensure that they are appropriately managed by the Group; 
and an external Board evaluation, with the assistance of SCT 
Consultants, which has helped the Board to understand how we 
work, our skills, our diversity, our key strengths and how we can 
improve our effectiveness. We will continue to focus on Board 
effectiveness over the coming year.
Our Statement of Compliance with the UK Corporate Governance 
Code is set out on page 36.
Board effectiveness
As Chairman, I am responsible for the leadership of the Board and 
ensuring its effectiveness in all aspects of its role. The Board is 
responsible for the Group’s strategic development, monitoring 
achievement of its business objectives, oversight of risk and 
maintaining a system of effective corporate governance.
Board and Committee composition
We have a strong and balanced Board, with a range of 
complementary skills to support the strategic and operational 
direction of the Group. During 2014, these skills were further 
strengthened following the appointments of Andrew Fisher in 
August and Genevieve Shore in September as additional 
Independent Non-Executive Directors. Both Andrew and 
Genevieve bring digital, entrepreneurial and technology 
experience from the media and technology sectors to the Board, 
providing valuable challenge and insight during the Board’s 
deliberations.
In April 2014, Matthew Price was appointed Chief Financial Officer, 
succeeding Paul Doughty who stepped down from the Board. 
Matthew brings his diverse career experience to our Group, 
helping us shape our strategy and future direction as we become 
a larger and more complex business.
Given the increasing complexity of the Group and the formation 
of a new Board Risk Committee, the Board reviewed the 
membership of all the Committees during the year and made a 
number of changes with effect from 1 January 2015 to ensure the 
Committees continue to operate effectively. The current 
members of each of the Committees is set out in the Corporate 
Governance Report on page 33.
In line with good corporate governance, during the year, I ceased 
to be a member of each Committee with the exception of the 
Nomination Committee which I chair. The Board also agreed that 
Sally James, as Chairman of the Risk Committee, should be a 
member of all the Board Committees to ensure that risk is 
appropriately considered in each Committee.

Chairman’s Governance Introduction Succession planning and diversity
To maintain an effective Board, it is essential to plan for the future 
and to ensure the right individuals are appointed to the Board 
from a diverse pool of talent. We recognise the importance of 
diversity at Board level. The Board considers itself diverse in 
terms of the background and experience which each individual 
brings to the Board. 
All future appointments will continue to be based on merit, 
however, the Board aspires to achieve a significant level of female 
representation on the Board and I am pleased that we have made 
further progress towards this objective in 2014. More detail on 
our diversity policy can be found in our Nomination Committee 
Report on page 40. Details of the proportion of women on the 
Board, in senior leadership positions and within the whole 
organisation can be found on page 27 of the Corporate 
Responsibility Report. 
Ethics and governance
There is a strong relationship between ethics and good 
governance. We remain committed to operating ethically, 
demonstrating integrity and acting responsibly in our 
undertakings with our customers, our shareholders and our 
wider stakeholders. Further information on ethics and social 
responsibility is contained in our Corporate Responsibility Report 
on pages 26 and 27.
Board operation
We continue to operate a clear line of distinction between 
management, led by Peter Plumb, Chief Executive Officer, who is 
responsible for the day to day running of the business, and the 
Board, acting under my leadership, which provides constructive 
challenge to management ensuring an open culture of debate 
that creates and preserves value for our shareholders.
During 2015 and beyond, I will ensure that the Board continues to 
operate in a constructive and open manner, with honesty and 
integrity as its core principles.

Corporate Governance Report
The Board of Directors (Board) of Moneysupermarket.com Group 
PLC (Company) is committed to high standards of corporate 
governance and supports the principles laid down in The UK 
Corporate Governance Code published in September 2012 by the 
Financial Reporting Council (Code). This Corporate Governance 
Report describes how the principles of the Code are applied by 
the Company and reports on the Company’s compliance with the 
Code’s provisions.
Compliance
The Board considers that the Company has complied with the 
provisions of the Code throughout the year ended 31 December 
2014 and to the date of this report except as set out below.
Board of Directors
The Board currently has eleven members, comprising the 
Non-Executive Chairman, Bruce Carnegie-Brown, six Independent 
Non-Executive Directors, Michael Wemms, Rob Rowley, Sally 
James, Robin Klein, Andrew Fisher and Genevieve Shore, one 
non-Independent Non-Executive Director, Simon Nixon (Deputy 
Chairman), and three Executive Directors, Peter Plumb (Chief 
Executive Officer), Matthew Price and Graham Donoghue. 
Michael Wemms has been designated as the Senior Independent 
Non-Executive Director.
At the Annual General Meeting held on 23 April 2014, Gerald 
Corbett stepped down as Chairman and as a Non-Executive 
Director of the Company, and he was succeeded by Bruce 
Carnegie-Brown as Chairman from that date. Paul Doughty also 
stepped down as an Executive Director at the Annual General 
Meeting on 23 April 2014 and he was succeeded by Matthew Price 
who was appointed an Executive Director on 1 April 2014.
At the Annual General Meeting to be held on 30 April 2015, 
Michael Wemms and Robin Klein will step down as Non-Executive 
Directors of the Company. Rob Rowley will become the Senior 
Independent Non-Executive Director from that date.
The Board normally meets on at least eight occasions in each 
financial year including a two day strategy conference. To 
enable the Non-Executive Directors to more freely discuss the 
performance of the Group’s management, the Chairman meets 
with the Non-Executive Directors at least once each year without 
the Executive Directors present.
The Board considers that all the Directors are able to devote 
sufficient time to their duties as Directors. Biographies of the 
Board are set out on pages 30 and 31 including details of the 
significant commitments of the Chairman. The Board is satisfied 
that these appointments do not conflict with the Chairman’s 
ability to carry out his duties and responsibilities effectively for 
the Group.
The Board has reviewed the recommendations of the Davies 
Review as part of a wider diversity discussion and has endorsed 
a Board Diversity Statement which is set out in the Nomination 
Committee Report on page 40. The Board supports the aims, 
objectives and recommendations of the Davies Review and in line 
with the Code will continue to make Board appointments on 
merit, against objective criteria and with due regard for the 
benefits of diversity on the Board, including gender.
Independence/Non-Executive Directors
The Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors bring wide and 
varied commercial experience to Board and Committee 
deliberations. The practice of the Company is to appoint 
Non-Executive Directors for specified terms of three years, 
subject to a maximum of up to three months’ notice within that 
period and also subject to re-election and to Companies Act 
provisions relating to the removal of a Director. Each of the 
Non-Executive Directors, including the Chairman, currently holds 
a letter of appointment reflecting this.
The Board considers that Bruce Carnegie-Brown was 
independent on appointment as Chairman and considers 
Michael Wemms, Rob Rowley, Sally James, Robin Klein, Andrew 
Fisher and Genevieve Shore to be independent, being 
independent in character and judgement and free from 
relationships or circumstances which are likely to affect, or could 
appear to affect, their judgement. The Board does not consider 
Simon Nixon to be independent.
Conflicts of interest
The Company’s Articles of Association were amended at the 2008 
Annual General Meeting, in line with the Companies Act 2006, to 
allow the Board to authorise potential conflicts of interest that 
may arise and to impose limits or conditions, as appropriate, 
when giving any authorisation. Any decision of the Board to 
authorise a conflict of interest is only effective if it is agreed 
without the conflicted Directors voting or without their votes 
being counted. In making such a decision, the Directors must act 
in a way they consider in good faith will be most likely to promote 
the success of the Company.
The Company has established a procedure for the appropriate 
authorisation to be sought prior to appointment of any new 
Director or prior to a new conflict arising and for the regular 
review of actual or potential conflicts of interest. During the year, 
this procedure was adhered to and operated effectively.

Financial Statements General Governance Overview Strategic Report
Relationship Agreement
The single largest shareholder of the Company is Simon Nixon. The Company and Simon Nixon entered into a relationship agreement 
on 11 July 2007 to regulate the ongoing relationship between them (Relationship Agreement). The principal purpose of the Relationship 
Agreement is to ensure that the Company is capable of carrying on its business independently of Simon Nixon, and that transactions 
and relationships with Simon Nixon are at arm’s length and on normal commercial terms.
The Company and Simon Nixon have agreed in the Relationship Agreement that Simon Nixon is entitled to appoint (such number 
including himself as a Director) one Non-Executive Director for as long as he holds the beneficial interest in at least 15% of the 
ordinary shares of the Company, two Non-Executive Directors for as long as he holds the beneficial interest in at least 30% of the 
ordinary shares of the Company and three Non-Executive Directors for as long as he holds the beneficial interest in at least 50% of 
the ordinary shares of the Company. The Relationship Agreement will terminate if Simon Nixon holds less than 15% of the ordinary 
shares of the Company.
The Relationship Agreement also includes a protocol to be observed in relation to any Non-Executive Director appointed by Simon 
Nixon to deal with potential conflicts of interest and the provision of confidential information.
Division of responsibilities
The positions of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are not exercised by the same individual, ensuring a clear division of 
responsibility at the head of the Company. The division of roles and responsibilities between the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 
is clearly established, set out in writing and has been approved by the Board.
The Chairman is responsible for leadership of the Board, setting its agenda and monitoring its effectiveness. He ensures effective 
communication with shareholders and that the Board is aware of the views of major shareholders. He facilitates both the contribution 
of the Non-Executive Directors and constructive relations between the Executive and Non-Executive Directors.
The Chief Executive Officer is responsible for the day to day running of the Group, carrying out agreed strategy and implementing 
specific Board decisions.
Role of the Board
The Board is collectively responsible for the Group’s performance and meets regularly to review the operation and performance of 
the Group. The Board has a formal schedule of matters reserved to it for decision making and matters delegated to Committees of the 
Board which are available on the investor relations section of the Group’s website at www.moneysupermarket.com. These include the 
Group’s strategy; business plan and annual budget; acquisitions and disposals; and other major investments and capital projects.
There is an established procedure for the preparation and approval each year by the Board of business plans and the annual 
budget. The Board receives reports on performance against the business plan and budget and reviews any significant variances each 
time it meets. This information enables business performance to be monitored, evaluated, discussed and challenged where necessary 
and enables informed, sound decisions to be made. At least one of the Board’s regular meetings each year is devoted to reviewing and 
agreeing the Group’s strategic direction.
Board Committees
The Board has four principal Committees (Audit, Nomination, Remuneration and Risk) to which various matters are delegated. 
The Committees all have formal written terms of reference that have been approved by the Board and are published on the investor 
relations section of the Group’s website at www.moneysupermarket.com. They are also available in hard copy form on application to 
the Company Secretary.
Details of the work of the Audit, Nomination, Remuneration and Risk Committees during the year are given in the reports of those 
Committees on pages 37 to 57.
The Directors who serve on each of the Committees are set out below:
Committee Chairman Members

Nomination Bruce Carnegie-Brown Michael Wemms, Rob Rowley, Robin Klein, Sally James, Andrew Fisher, Genevieve Shore
Remuneration Andrew Fisher Michael Wemms, Sally James, Genevieve Shore

Chairman of the Nomination Committee and he ceased to be a member of the Audit Committee.
With effect from Andrew Fisher’s appointment as a Non-Executive Director on 6 August 2014, Andrew Fisher became Chairman of the

The Executive Directors of the Company may attend meetings of the Committees at the invitation of the Chairman of the respective 
Committee. Bruce Carnegie-Brown attends meetings of the Audit, Risk and Remuneration Committees at the invitation of the Chairman 
of the respective Committees.
Directors
The Company’s Articles of Association require that new Directors appointed by the Board must retire and submit themselves for 
election by shareholders at the next Annual General Meeting following their appointment. The Company’s Articles of Association 
further require that all Directors must retire and submit themselves for re-election at least every three years. In accordance with 
the Code, all of the Directors will retire at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting and, being eligible, will offer themselves for election 
or re-election, with the exception of Michael Wemms and Robin Klein who will be stepping down as Non-Executive Directors at the 
Annual General Meeting.
The Company provides Directors’ and officers’ insurance cover for the benefit of Directors in respect of claims arising in the 
performance of their duties. The Company has also granted indemnities to each of its Directors and the Company Secretary to the 
extent permitted by law and its Articles of Association.
Board evaluation
The formal annual evaluation of the performance of the Board, its Committees and individual Directors was undertaken during the 
year. This consisted of an externally facilitated evaluation undertaken by SCT Consultants Ltd in accordance with the requirements of 
the Code. The evaluation output has been used to identify strengths and development areas and confirmed that the Board and its 
Committees were operating effectively. Particular development areas that will be actioned in 2015 include a greater focus on the 
Group’s talent strategy and a greater focus on effective investment appraisal. 
Individual performance was also appraised, based on one-to-one interviews with the Chairman, or in the case of the Chairman, with 
the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director following consultation with each of the other Directors. 
SCT Consultants Ltd has no other connection or relationship with the Group and has not provided any other services to the Group 
during the financial year ended 31 December 2014. 
Development
The Chairman and Company Secretary are responsible for preparing and co-ordinating an induction programme for newly appointed 
Directors, including business related presentations by senior management below Board level, as well as guidance on their duties, 
responsibilities and liabilities as a Director of the Company. Every Director has access to appropriate training as required following 
their appointment and is encouraged to develop their understanding of the Group. 35 MONEYSUPERMARKET ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2014
Financial Statements General Governance Overview Strategic Report
Information
Board members are given appropriate documentation in a timely 
manner in advance of each Board or Committee meeting. This 
normally includes a detailed report on current trading and 
comprehensive papers on matters where the Board or 
Committee will be required to make a decision or give its 
approval. Specific business related presentations are given by 
senior management below Board level when appropriate.
The Directors have access to the advice and services of the 
Company Secretary. The Company Secretary is responsible for 
ensuring that Board procedures are followed and providing 
advice to the Board on corporate governance. Both the 
appointment and removal of the Company Secretary are matters 
for the Board as a whole.
Directors can, where they judge it necessary to discharge their 
responsibilities as Directors, obtain independent professional 
advice at the Company’s expense. No such advice was sought by 
any Director during the year. Directors have the right to require 
that any concerns they may have are recorded in the appropriate 
Board or Committee minutes.
Shareholder relations
The Board is committed to establishing and maintaining good 
communications with shareholders. Senior executives, including 
the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer regularly 
meet with analysts and institutional shareholders to keep them 
informed of significant developments and to develop an 
understanding of their views which are discussed with the Board. 
Formal presentations are given to analysts and shareholders 
covering the full year and half year results and the Company 
seeks to maintain a dialogue with the various bodies which 
monitor the Company’s governance policies and procedures. 
The Company Secretary generally deals with questions from 
individual shareholders.
The results and results presentations, together with all 
information reported to the market via the regulatory 
information service, press releases and other shareholder 
information, are published on the investor relations section of 
the Group’s website at www.moneysupermarket.com to be 
viewed and accessed by all shareholders.
The Senior Independent Non-Executive Director is available to 
shareholders if they have concerns which contact through the 
normal channels of Chairman, Chief Executive Officer or Chief 
Financial Officer has failed to resolve or for which such contact 
is inappropriate.
All shareholders will have the opportunity to ask questions at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting. The Chairs of the Audit, 
Nomination, Remuneration and Risk Committees will be available 
to answer questions at that meeting. Shareholders may also 
contact the Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer or, if more 
appropriate, the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director to 
raise any issue with one or all of the Non-Executive Directors of 
the Company.
The Company will prepare separate resolutions on each 
substantially separate issue at the forthcoming Annual 
General Meeting. The result of the vote on each resolution 
will be published on the Group’s website after the Annual 
General Meeting and will be announced via the regulatory 
information service. 
Internal control and risk management
The Board has established a continuous process for identifying, 
evaluating and managing the principal risks the Group faces and 
for determining the nature and extent of the principal risks it is 
willing to take to achieve its strategic objectives. The risk 
management framework and a description of the Principal Risks 
is provided on pages 24 and 25.
In addition, the Board is responsible for the Group’s system of 
internal control. The system of internal control is designed to 
manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives and can only provide reasonable and not 
absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Board is responsible for performing an assessment of the 
effectiveness of the risk management framework and the internal 
control system on at least an annual basis.
The key features of the Group’s system of internal control and 
risk management are:
• A comprehensive annual business planning and budgeting 
process, requiring Board approval, against which the Group’s 
actual performance and any significant variances are regularly 
reviewed by the Board.
• An annual two day strategy conference to discuss and approve 
the Group’s strategic direction, plans and objectives and the 
risks to achieving them.
• A schedule of matters reserved for the Board’s approval to 
ensure it maintains control over appropriate strategic, 
financial, organisational, compliance and capital 
investment issues.
• An organisation structure with clearly defined lines of 
responsibility and delegation of authority.
• Formal risk and control policies with supporting procedures 
manuals.
• Regular reviews of the key risks facing the Group to 
ensure key risks are being identified, evaluated and 
appropriately managed.
• A process for the regular assessment of key controls across 
the Group.
• A risk and compliance function responsible for overseeing 
the implementation of the risk management framework.
• An internal audit function providing assurance over key risks, 
processes and controls.
In addition, the Audit Committee receives:
• Reports from the external auditor in relation to the Financial 
Statements and the material financial reporting judgements 
contained in them.
• Reports from the internal and external auditors in relation to 
the system of internal control and the reviews by the internal 
and external auditors of that system.
The Audit Committee has reviewed the effectiveness of the 
Group’s system of internal control and risk management during 
the year. The Board considers that in the context of the control 
environment described above, the Group’s system of internal 
control and risk management is effective and satisfactory.

Compliance with the Code
The Directors consider that during the financial year ended 
31 December 2014 and to the date of this report, the Company 
complied with the Code except as follows:
C.3.1 – During the year, Gerald Corbett was a member of the Audit 
Committee until he stepped down as a Non-Executive Director 
and Chair of the Board on 23 April 2014. Upon his appointment as 
Chair of the Board on 23 April 2014, Bruce Carnegie-Brown 
ceased to be a member of the Audit Committee. Accordingly, with 
effect from 23 April 2014, the Company complied with the Code 
provision C.3.1.
D.2.1 – Bruce Carnegie-Brown continued to chair the 
Remuneration Committee following his appointment as Chairman 
of the Board on 23 April 2014 until he stepped down as a member 
of the Remuneration Committee on 6 August 2014 when Andrew 
Fisher became a Non-Executive Director and Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee. Accordingly, with effect from 6 August 
2014, the Company complied with the Code provision D.2.1.
E.1.1 – As a result of regular feedback provided to the Board by 
the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer following 
their dialogue with major shareholders, the Senior Independent 
Non-Executive Director believes he is aware of the views of major 
shareholders. Unless requested by major shareholders, the 
Senior Independent Non-Executive Director does not attend 
meetings with them.

Audit Committee Report
The Audit Committee presents a separate report in relation to the 
financial year ended 31 December 2014.
Composition of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises five of the Non-Executive 
Directors, Rob Rowley (Chairman), Michael Wemms, Sally James, 
Genevieve Shore and Robin Klein. Michael Wemms, Sally James, 
Genevieve Shore and Robin Klein are considered by the Board to 
be independent. Rob Rowley was considered by the Board to be 
independent on appointment. Biographies of the members of the 
Audit Committee are set out on pages 30 and 31. Rob Rowley is a 
qualified accountant and was formerly finance director of Reuters 
plc and chairman of the audit committee at Prudential plc. He is 
currently chairman of the audit committee at Taylor Wimpey plc 
and Morgan Advanced Materials plc. The Board is satisfied that 
Rob Rowley has recent and relevant financial experience.
Terms of reference
The terms of reference of the Audit Committee are published 
on the investor relations section of the Group’s website at  
www.moneysupermarket.com and are available in hard copy 
form on application to the Company Secretary. These include:
• Monitoring the integrity of the Financial Statements of the 
Company, any formal announcements relating to the 
Company’s financial performance and any significant issues 
and judgements contained therein. 
• Reviewing the Group’s Financial Statements and the material 
financial reporting judgements contained in them. 
• Advising the Board on whether the Committee believes this 
Annual Report and the Financial Statements contained within 
it, when taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and 
understandable and provide the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Group’s strategy, business 
activities and financial performance. 
• Reviewing and monitoring the external auditor’s 
independence and objectivity and the effectiveness of the 
audit process, taking into consideration relevant UK 
professional regulatory requirements. 
• Developing and implementing a policy on the level and 
amount of external auditor non-audit services. 
• Advising the Board on the appointment, re-appointment and 
removal of the external auditor and the remuneration and 
terms of engagement of the external auditor. 
• Monitoring the effectiveness of the Group’s internal financial 
controls and the internal control and risk management 
systems. 
• Reviewing the scope, activities and results of the Group’s 
internal audit function. 
• Reviewing the Audit Committee’s terms of reference, carrying 
out an annual performance evaluation exercise and noting the 
satisfactory operation of the Committee. 
• Reporting to the Board how it has discharged its 
responsibilities.
Operation of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee met on four occasions during the year. 
Details of attendance at Audit Committee meetings is set out in 
the Corporate Governance Report on page 34.
The Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, 
Chief Financial Officer and Company Secretary, together with 
appropriate members of the management team with 
responsibility for risk and internal control, and the external 
auditor, will normally attend meetings at the invitation of the 
Chairman of the Audit Committee. The external auditor is 
regularly invited by the Audit Committee to advise them of any 
matters which they consider should be brought to the Audit 
Committee’s attention without the Executive Directors present. 
The external auditor may also request a meeting with the Audit 
Committee if they consider it necessary.
The Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the Audit 
Committee. The members of the Audit Committee can, where 
they judge it necessary to discharge their responsibilities, obtain 
independent professional advice at the Company’s expense.
Financial Statements and Significant Accounting Matters
The Committee is responsible for reviewing the appropriateness 
of the Group’s half-year reporting and annual financial 
statements. It does this by considering, amongst other things, the 
accounting policies and practices adopted by the Group; the 
correct application of applicable financial reporting standards 
and compliance with broader governance reporting 
requirements; the approach taken by management to report the 
key judgemental areas of reporting and the comments of the 
external auditor on management’s chosen approach.
During the year the Committee considered key accounting issues, 
matters and judgements in relation to the Group’s Financial 
Statements and disclosures relating to:
Revenue
The majority of the Group’s revenue is derived from success-
based commercial deals which compensate the Group for each 
product sold by a provider to a customer referred to it by the 
Group. The Group recognises this revenue at the point at which a 
customer leaves one of the Group’s websites, and clicks through 
to a provider site.
Rob Rowley
Chairman of the Audit Committee 38 MONEYSUPERMARKET ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2014
Governance
Management operates a number of key controls in relation to the 
recording of revenue. A completeness check is performed by 
reconciling all ‘click’ activity on the website and ensuring that an 
invoice has been raised, or revenue has been accrued, where 
appropriate. A review is performed to compare accrued revenue 
at the end of the previous month and actual revenue invoiced 
during the following month, with significant differences 
investigated to provide evidence that revenues are correctly 
stated. In addition a programme of revenue assurance is 
operated by the Group’s internal audit function. This helps 
provide assurance that revenues are correctly stated by 
reviewing provider systems and controls to ensure that sales 
made by providers resulting from referrals made by the Group 
have been correctly identified and allocated in the provider 
systems. In addition management regularly reviews the quantum 
and aging of any accrued revenue balances.
An assessment of the Group’s information system which records 
the clicks, together with the reconciliation of revenue to cash 
receipts, therefore form a key part of the audit. The results of 
KPMG’s testing are included in the audit report prepared for the 
Committee.
Capitalisation of software and development costs
As more fully described on pages 79 to 80 of the Group’s Financial 
Statements the Group holds intangible asset balances arising 
from the capitalisation of certain software and development 
costs. The judgments in relation to software and development 
assets largely relate to the future economic benefits associated 
with the assets and that capitalisation is in accordance with the 
relevant accounting standards. The Committee addressed these 
matters through examining investment appraisals on key IT 
projects received from management outlining the basis for the 
key assumptions used and was comfortable with management’s 
justification. The Committee gains comfort that business plans in 
relation to the capitalised assets have received Board approval. 
This is also a significant risk area for the audit, and therefore 
KPMG provide to the Committee their comments on the approach 
taken by management. During the year ended 31 December 2014 
the Committee critically reviewed the analysis performed on the 
capitalisation of software and development costs and agreed that 
the projected future cash flows from these assets supports their 
carrying values.
Contingent Remuneration
The Group acquired the business and assets of 
MoneySavingExpert.com and a sole trader business from Martin 
Lewis in September 2012. As described more fully in note 3 to the 
Group’s Financial Statements on page 73, the remuneration is 
contingent upon various non-financial performance criteria 
together with a discretionary element and the continuing 
employment for a period of three years of Martin Lewis. The 
judgement involved in estimating the benefit payable relates to 
several aspects of MoneySavingExpert.com’s performance. The 
Committee has reviewed the accounting valuations of the 
contingent remuneration and, in light of the performance to date 
and anticipated future performance reported by management, 
agreed that the amount recorded in the Consolidated Statement 
of Comprehensive Income and the Consolidated Statement of 
Financial Position is appropriate. In addition, since this is an area 
of significant audit risk, the Committee also received reporting 
from KPMG, detailing their views on the judgements which 
management have made.
UK Corporate Governance Code
The Board requested and the Audit Committee has advised that it 
believes that the Annual Report and the Financial Statements, 
taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess 
the Group’s performance, business model and strategy.
External Auditor
The external auditor attends all meetings of the Committee. It is 
the responsibility of the Committee to provide oversight of the 
external audit process and assess the effectiveness, objectivity 
and independence of the external auditor.
The Audit Committee reviewed the following in order to provide 
oversight of the external audit process:
• The terms, areas of responsibility, associated duties and scope 
of the audit as set out in the external auditor’s engagement 
letter for the forthcoming year; 
• The external auditor’s overall work plan for the forthcoming year; 
• The external auditor’s fee proposal; 
• The major issues that arose during the course of the audit and 
their resolution; 
• Key accounting and audit judgements and estimates; 
• The levels of errors identified during the audit; and 
• Recommendations made by the external auditor in their 
management letters and the adequacy of management’s 
response. 
The Audit Committee reviewed the independence of the auditor 
having regards to:
• A report from the external auditor describing their 
arrangements to identify, report and manage any conflicts of 
interest; and 
• The extent and nature of non-audit services provided by the 
external auditor. 
The Audit Committee is responsible for the development, 
implementation and monitoring of policies and procedures on 
the use of the external auditor for non-audit services, in 
accordance with professional and regulatory requirements. 
These policies are kept under review to meet the objective of 
ensuring that the Group benefits in a cost-effective manner from 
the cumulative knowledge and experience of its auditor whilst 
also ensuring that the auditor maintains the necessary degree of 
independence and objectivity. Consequently, any non-audit work 
to be undertaken by the auditor in excess of £50,000 is required 
to be authorised by the Chairman of the Audit Committee and the 
Chief Financial Officer prior to its commencement. Individual 
assignments of less than £50,000 are approved by the Chief 
Financial Officer. The aggregate expenditure with the external 
auditor is reviewed by the Audit Committee.
During the year the value of non-audit services provided by 
KPMG amounted to £0.1m (2013: £0.2m). Non-audit services 
amounted to 66% of the value of the audit. New EU legislation on 
permitted non-audit services will come into effect from 
17 June 2016 which introduces a permitted non-audit services fee 
cap of 70% of the average audit fee over a consecutive 3 year 
period. This cap will come into effect for the Group in the financial 
year ending 31 December 2020. A significant proportion of 
non-audit services relates to the following:
• Reviewing the Group’s half year reporting; 
• The provision of tax compliance services in relation to direct 
taxation; 
• The provision of advice in relation to the preparation and 
submission of claims for Research and Development (R&D) 
Relief; and 
• The provision of regulatory advice in relation to 
documentation and control. 
The assurance provided by the external auditor on the items 
above is considered by the Group as strictly necessary in the 
Audit Committee Report  
continued 39 MONEYSUPERMARKET ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2014
Financial Statements General Governance Overview Strategic Report
interests of the Group. The level of non-audit services offered 
reflects the auditor’s knowledge and understanding of the Group. 
The Group has also continued with the appointment of other 
accountancy firms to provide certain non-audit services to the 
Group in connection with tax and regulatory advice and 
anticipates that this will continue in 2015.
The provision of tax advisory services, due diligence and 
regulatory advice is permitted with the Committee’s prior 
approval in line with the approval limits set out above. The 
provision of internal audit services, valuation work and any other 
activity that could result in the external auditor reviewing and 
relying on its own work and conclusions is prohibited. KPMG was 
not engaged during the year to provide any services which may 
have given rise to a conflict of interest.
The Audit Committee considers the effectiveness of the external 
audit process on an annual basis, reporting its findings to the 
Board as part of its recommendation. This process is completed 
through completion of a detailed questionnaire (which includes 
consideration of the audit partner, the approach, communication, 
independence, objectivity, and reporting). This is completed by 
members of the Committee and senior members of the finance 
team who regularly interact with the external auditor. The results 
of the questionnaire are reported to and discussed by the 
Committee. It also assessed the cost effectiveness and value for 
money aspect of the audit.
The Audit Committee holds private meetings with the external 
auditor at least twice each year after committee meetings to 
review key issues within their sphere of interest and responsibility.
KPMG have acted as the auditor to the Group since 2004 and 
were appointed as the auditor to the Company on its flotation in 
2007. The lead audit partner rotates every five years to ensure 
independence. The KPMG audit partner, Stuart Burdass, will be 
rotated off the audit on 30 April 2015 and the new audit partner’s 
five-year term will end in 2020, in accordance with the FRC’s Ethics 
Standard 3 (Revised). The Committee considered the length of 
KPMG’s tenure and the results of the detailed questionnaire when 
assessing their continued effectiveness, independence and 
re-appointment. The Committee continues to consider KPMG to 
be independent and when considering the most suitable timing 
for a future audit tender, took account of FRC guidance 
concerning the alignment of the tender date with the rotation of 
the audit partner and new EU legislation, which requires 
mandatory rotation of the audit firm every ten years.
The Committee continues to remain satisfied with the work of 
KPMG and that they continue to remain independent and 
objective. The Committee has therefore recommended to the 
Board that a resolution is put to shareholders recommending 
their reappointment together with their terms of engagement 
and remuneration at the Annual General Meeting of the 
Company. This will continue to be assessed on an annual basis.
Internal Control
The Audit Committee monitors and reviews each year the 
effectiveness of, and the framework for, the Group’s system of 
internal control and risk management.
The Audit Committee undertook a review of the effectiveness of, 
and the framework for, the Group’s system of internal control and 
risk management, including financial, operational and compliance 
controls during the year. In addition to this review, the external 
auditor provided the Audit Committee with comprehensive 
reports of the results of their controls testing as part of the 
external audit.
Internal Audit
The Group has an internal audit function which reviews financial, 
operational and regulatory matters. The Group has continued to 
invest in this area during 2014 and will continue to do so in 2015 
recognising that regulation in particular, as price comparison 
continues to become an ever more important part of the 
distribution chain of financial services, will become more 
important. The Group is committed to fully meeting its regulatory 
obligations. A rolling twelve month internal audit plan is reviewed 
and approved by the Committee at each meeting, and defines the 
scope of the work which the internal audit function will undertake. 
The results of this work are reported to the Committee at each 
meeting, and will typically include an update against the audit plan, 
results from audits performed since the last meeting including any 
unsatisfactory audit findings and related action plans, and 
progress against findings from previous audits.
In addition the Committee meets with the head of internal audit 
throughout the year as necessary.
Compliance
The Group has a compliance function which reviews the Group’s 
standards and values together with regulatory matters in relation 
to the various bodies that regulate a number of the areas that the 
Group operates in. These include the Financial Conduct Authority 
(FCA), the Office of Fair Trading (OFT), the Information 
Commissioners Office and the Office of Gas and Electricity 
Markets (OFGEM) which operates a voluntary code relating to 
energy price comparison that the Group subscribes to.
In April 2014 those areas of the business previously under the 
regulatory regime of the OFT, namely unsecured lending 
including credit cards and personal loans, came under the 
regulatory control of the FCA, in addition to those areas, namely 
the Group’s insurance businesses, that were already regulated by 
the FCA.
An annual compliance plan is reviewed and approved by the 
Committee and defines the scope of the work that the compliance 
team will undertake. The results of the work are reported to the 
Committee at each meeting and will typically include an update 
against the compliance plan and the results of the work 
performed since the last meeting.
The Group recognises that regulation in general, and in particular 
the regulatory regime imposed by the FCA, will become an 
increasing feature of the price comparison market. The Group has 
invested, and will continue to invest, in additional skills and 
resources in this area in 2015.
Risk Committee
The Group established a separate risk function in 2014 headed by 
the Chief Risk Officer (CRO). A separate Risk Committee was also 
established in 2014 which is chaired by Sally James. The Risk 
Committee operates separately but alongside the Audit 
Committee. A separate report of the work and responsibilities of 
the Risk Committee is set out on pages 41 and 42. 
Audit Committee Effectiveness
The Board, as part of its general review of its overall ffectiveness, 
concluded that the Audit Committee was working effectively.

Operation of the Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee met on four occasions during the 
year. Details of the attendance at Nomination Committee 
meetings are set out in the Corporate Governance Report on 
page 34.
The Nomination Committee’s duties include:
• Evaluating the balance of skills, knowledge, experience and 
independence of the Board. 
• Reviewing the size, structure and composition of the Board, 
including Board diversity. 
• Where necessary, considering and recommending to the 
Board persons who are appropriate for appointment as 
Directors. 
• Ensuring that succession planning for the Board is in place. 
The Nomination Committee has a formal, rigorous and 
transparent procedure for the appointment of new Directors to 
the Board. The process involves the Nomination Committee 
interviewing suitable candidates who are proposed by either 
existing Board members or by an external search firm.
Careful consideration is given to ensure proposed appointees 
have enough time available to devote to the role and that the 
balance of skills, knowledge and experience on the Board is 
maintained.
When the Nomination Committee has identified a suitable 
candidate, the Chairman of the Nomination Committee will make 
a recommendation to the Board with the Board making the final 
decision. 
When dealing with the appointment of a successor to the 
Chairman, the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director will 
chair the Nomination Committee instead of the Chairman.
During the year, the Nomination Committee reviewed the balance 
of skills, knowledge and experience of the Board together with 
the size, structure and composition of the Board including Board 
diversity, and reviewed the succession plans for the Board.
The Nomination Committee, having followed the procedure 
outlined above for the appointment of new Directors to the Board, 
recommended to the Board during the year the appointment of 
Andrew Fisher and Genevieve Shore as additional Independent 
Non-Executive Directors. In connection with these appointments, 
the Company used Russell Reynolds as the external search firm. 
Russell Reynolds has no other connection with the Company.
At the invitation of the Chairman of the Nomination Committee, 
the Chief Executive Officer, Human Resources Director and 
Company Secretary may attend meetings of the Nomination 
Committee. The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the 
Nomination Committee.
The members of the Nomination Committee can, where they 
judge it necessary to discharge their responsibilities, obtain 
independent professional advice at the Company’s expense.
The terms of reference of the Nomination Committee are 
published on the investor relations section of the Group’s website 
at www.moneysupermarket.com and are available in hard copy 
form on application to the Company Secretary.

“The Board of Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC welcomed the 
publication in February 2011 of the Davies Review on Women on 
Boards. Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC is committed to 
ensuring that any Board vacancies arising are filled by the most 
qualified candidates and recognises the value and importance of 
diversity in the composition of the Board. When Board positions 
become available, the Company will remain focused on ensuring 
that a diverse range of candidates are considered whilst ensuring 
that appointments continue to be based on merit, measured 
against objective criteria and the skills and experience the 
individual offers. The Board has targeted a minimum female 
representation on the Board of 25% by 2016.”
As at the date of this report, 18% of the Board are female.

effective manner. In addition, the Committee works with the 
Remuneration Committee to ensure that risk is properly 
considered in setting the Group’s remuneration policy and the 
Chairman is a member of the Remuneration Committee.
Terms of Reference
The Committee is responsible for assisting the Board in its 
oversight of risk within the Group, including risk appetite, risk 
tolerance and the risk management framework.
The Committee operates under formal terms of reference which 
are reviewed annually and are published on the investor relations 
section of the Group’s website at www.moneysupermarket.com 
or are available in hard copy form on application to the Company 
Secretary. The principal responsibilities are:

function and ensuring it has adequate resources and 
appropriate access to information to enable it to perform its 
function effectively and in accordance with relevant 
professional standards. The Risk Committee also ensures the 
function has adequate independence and is free from 
management and other restrictions.
Operation of the Risk Committee
The Risk Committee met on four occasions during the year. 
Details of attendance at Risk Committee meetings are set out in 
the Corporate Governance Report on page 34.
The Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, Chief 
Financial Officer, Chief Product Officer and Company Secretary, 
together with the Chief Risk Officer and other members of the 
management team with responsibility for risk management and 
regulatory matters normally attend meetings at the invitation of 
the Chairman of the Risk Committee. 
The Risk Committee holds private meetings with the Chief Risk 
Officer at least once a year after Committee meetings to review 
key issues.
The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Risk Committee. 
The members of the Risk Committee can, where they judge it 
necessary to discharge their responsibilities, obtain independent 
professional advice at the Company’s expense.
Principal activities in 2014
The Committee has an annual schedule of work, developed from 
its terms of reference, with standing items that it considers at 
each meeting in addition to any specific matters upon which the 
Committee has decided to focus. This schedule of work is 
expected to evolve to reflect the Group’s strategy and changes to 
the economic and regulatory environment in which the Group 
operates. The Risk Committee receives regular reports from the 
Chief Risk Officer, the Chief Executive Officer and the Company 
Secretary on current and emerging risks and issues arising in 
connection with the Group’s activities.

continued
During 2014, significant progress has been made in developing 
and improving the Group’s risk appetite and risk management 
framework, supported by enhancements to the reports and 
management information which the Committee receives. The 
Risk Committee activities have included the following:
• Overseeing the risk management framework across the 
Group, including the assessment of key risks to the Group, 
analysis of the potential impact and resulting management 
actions. Specific consideration has been given to the Risk 
Management and Internal Control requirements of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code. Further details of the Group’s 
risk management practices are provided in the Principal Risks 
on pages 24 to 25.
• Overseeing the implementation of the Treating Customers 
Fairly and Conduct framework across the Group.
• Assessing the identification and management of risks 
connected to the Group’s capital investment programme.
• Monitoring the interactions and relationship between the 
Group and regulatory bodies, in particular assessing the 
requirements arising from and management’s response to the 
FCA Thematic Review of Price Comparison Websites issued in 
July 2014.
• Receiving presentations on aspects of the business, for 
example, assessing the identification and management of IT 
risks across the Group, including data security.
The Board is committed to enhancing the risk management 
framework across the Group and the efforts and progress made 
during 2014 will continue.
Risk & Compliance Function
The Group has a Risk & Compliance function, headed by the Chief 
Risk Officer, which provides oversight of strategic, financial and 
operational risk matters. This responsibility includes regulatory 
matters in relation to the various bodies that regulate a number 
of the areas in which the Group operates. These include the 
Financial Conduct Authority, the Information Commissioners 
Office and the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets which 
operates a voluntary code relating to energy price comparison to 
which MoneySuperMarket subscribes. In April 2014, responsibility 
for the regulation of consumer credit transferred from the Office 
of Fair Trading to the Financial Conduct Authority. This brought 
the Group’s activities in respect of credit cards and personal 
loans under the regulatory control of the Financial Conduct 
Authority alongside those areas, namely the Group’s insurance 
and mortgage businesses, which are already regulated by the 
Financial Conduct Authority.
A six-monthly Risk & Compliance plan is reviewed and approved 
by the Risk Committee and defines the work that the Risk & 
Compliance team will undertake. The results of the work are 
reported to the Risk Committee at each meeting.
The Group recognises that regulation in general, and in particular 
the Financial Conduct Authority regulatory regime, will become 
an increasing feature of the price comparison market. The Group 
has invested and will continue to invest, in additional skills and 
resources in this area in 2015.

Directors’ Remuneration Report  
Annual Statement
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present the Directors’ Remuneration Report for 
the year ended 31 December 2014.
During the year, the Remuneration Committee has continued to 
focus on ensuring that our policies and procedures balance the 
incentives for our Executives to create long-term value for our 
shareholders with a commitment to effective risk management.
The Executive team has continued to focus this year on further 
strengthening the organisation and ensuring the effective 
execution of our growth strategies.
Pay for performance in 2014
We believe in rewarding our Executives based on their individual 
performance and on the value created for our shareholders. 
During 2014, the variable elements of executive remuneration 
were focused on simple and transparent measures of market 
share growth, adjusted EBITDA growth, total shareholder return 
and key strategic objectives. Our bonus and long-term incentive 
plan (LTIP) awards in 2014 were based on challenging targets, 
which we believe are in line with market best practice. These are 
outlined on pages 52 and 53 and were reviewed in 2014 to ensure 
they are appropriately challenging and relevant for the markets in 
which we operate.
2014 has been a good year for the Group with revenue increasing 
by 10% to £248.1m and adjusted EBITDA increasing by 13% to 
£95.2m. Our Executives performed well against their stretching 
individual performance targets and are entitled to receive a bonus 
for their performance of between 110% and 158% of their basic 
salary (which represents between 73% and 92% of the maximum).
Our 2012 LTIP award, which was based on a combination of 
compound annual growth in adjusted EBITDA and comparative 
total shareholder return, will vest at 98% of the maximum in June 
2015, reflecting the achievements of the Executives over the three 
years since the award was made. Our growth in total shareholder 
return of 154.3% was upper quartile against the FTSE 250 and we 
achieved 16.6% compound annual growth in adjusted EBITDA.
Board changes
During the year, Paul Doughty stepped down as an Executive 
Director and left the Group. The Committee agreed his leaving 
arrangements in accordance with the remuneration policy. He 
received a payment of £60,473 in respect of two months of his 
unworked notice period. In recognition of his contribution to the 
Group, the Committee determined that he would be treated as a 
good leaver for the purposes of his unvested 2012 LTIP award. His 
2012 LTIP will vest on the normal vesting date, reduced pro-rata 
for time and based on the achievement of the performance 
conditions. His 2013 LTIP award lapsed in full. He will receive a 
pro-rata bonus payment for the 2014 financial year to reflect the 
portion of 2014 worked by him and the two months of his 
unworked notice period.
Approach to remuneration in 2015
The Remuneration Committee continually reviews the Senior 
Executive remuneration policy to ensure it promotes the 
attraction, motivation and retention of the high quality executives 
who are key to delivering the Company’s strategy, sustainable 
growth and shareholder returns.
During 2015, we are proposing to make a number of changes to 
our executive remuneration including:
• The introduction of malus and clawback provisions into the 
annual bonus and LTIP arrangements which will allow the 
Committee to cancel unvested awards or seek to reclaim paid 
or vested annual bonus or LTIP awards for a period of two 
years following payment or vesting in certain circumstances;
• A change to the annual bonus measures from adjusted EBITDA 
to adjusted operating profit to better align our annual bonus 
with our business strategy;
• A change to the LTIP measures from growth in adjusted 
EBITDA to growth in adjusted earnings per share to better 
align our long-term incentives with the creation of 
shareholder value; and
• Annual base salary increases for the Executive Directors of 
2%, below the average increase across the Group (which are 
approximately 2.5%).
There will be no change to the maximum bonus or LTIP award 
levels in 2015.
Although the performance measures are changing, we remain 
committed to the use of stretching annual and long-term targets 
to deliver the Company’s strategy and sustainable growth in 
shareholder returns. The adjusted earnings per share target 
range for the 2015 LTIP award will be 7% to 17% per annum.
Our current remuneration policy was approved at the 2014 AGM 
and the Committee had intended this policy to remain in place 
for three years. However, the changes proposed above cannot 
be implemented under the current policy. Therefore, we will be 
seeking shareholder approval for a revised remuneration policy 
at this year’s AGM in order to allow us to implement these 
changes and to provide greater flexibility around the 
Andrew Fisher
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee Governance

Directors’ Remuneration Report  
continued
performance measures to allow the Committee to adjust the 
framework appropriately for our prevailing strategy, whilst at 
the same time providing sufficient clarity and safeguards 
for shareholders. There are no other major changes to the 
revised policy.
Alignment with shareholders
We are mindful of our shareholders’ interests and are keen to 
ensure a demonstrable link between reward and value creation. 
The introduction of malus and clawback arrangements into our 
annual bonus and LTIPs for awards made in 2015 and beyond 
together with the existing shareholding guidelines all foster an 
ongoing commitment to the business from our Executives and 
continued alignment of shareholder and executive objectives.
We are pleased with the support we have received in the past 
from shareholders, with 95.02% approval for our remuneration 
policy last year. We look forward to receiving your continued 
support at the forthcoming AGM.

Directors’ Remuneration Policy
At the Annual General Meeting held on 23 April 2014 shareholders approved the current remuneration policy which has operated since 
23 April 2014. The Remuneration Committee is proposing changes to the performance measures relating to the Company’s annual bonus 
and long-term incentive plan, and as a result, shareholder approval is being sought for a revised remuneration policy. In formulating the 
revised remuneration policy, full consideration has been given to the principles set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code and the 
Committee regularly reviews the policy to ensure it takes due account of best practice and the particular circumstances of the Company. 
The revised Directors’ remuneration policy which will operate from 30 April 2015, will be put to a binding shareholder vote and become 
formally effective at the 2015 Annual General Meeting.
Policy overview
The Company aims to provide a remuneration structure that is aligned with shareholder interests and, as such, is competitive in the 
marketplace to attract, retain and motivate Executive Directors of superior calibre in order to deliver continued growth of the business.
Company policy is that performance related components should form a significant portion of the overall remuneration package, with 
maximum total potential rewards being earned through the achievement of challenging performance targets based on measures that 
reflect the best interests of shareholders.
Consideration of shareholder views
The Committee will consider shareholder feedback received in relation to the Annual General Meeting each year at its next meeting 
following the Annual General Meeting. This feedback, plus any additional feedback received during any meetings from time to time, will 
then be considered as part of the Company’s annual review of remuneration policy. In addition, the Committee engaged directly with 
major shareholders and their representative bodies in advance of the changes to this remuneration policy.
Details of votes cast for and against the resolution to approve last year’s remuneration report and any matters discussed with 
shareholders during the year are set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group
The Committee does not formally consult employees in relation to remuneration policy for Executive Directors. However, the Company 
regularly carries out engagement surveys which enable employees to share their views with management. To the extent that 
employees are shareholders, they can vote on this policy at the Annual General Meeting.
Summary remuneration policy
The table below summarises the Directors’ remuneration policy for 2015 onwards:
Base salary
Purpose and  
link to strategy
To provide competitive fixed remuneration 
To attract and retain Executive Directors of superior calibre in order to deliver growth for the business 
Intended to reflect base salaries paid to senior management of comparable companies
Operation The basic salary for each Executive Director is reviewed annually by the Remuneration Committee
Individual salary adjustments take into account each Executive Director’s performance and experience in 
role, changes in responsibility and the Group’s financial performance, as well as comparing each 
Executive Director’s base salary to the external market
Maximum There is no prescribed maximum base salary. Increases for senior management are ordinarily in line with 
the broader employee population but on occasions may need to recognise, for example, an increase in 
the scale, scope or responsibility of the role and developments in the wider competitive market 
Current base salary levels are set out on page 50
Performance targets No specific targets although the Committee will take into account individual performance when 
considering salary increases Governance

Notes
(1) A description of how the Company intends to implement the policy set out in this table for 2015 is set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration on page 50.
(2) The following differences exist between the Company’s policy for the remuneration of Executive Directors as set out above and its approach to the payment of 
employees generally:
 •  A lower level of maximum annual bonus opportunity as a percentage of base salary may apply to employees other than the Executive Directors and certain 
senior executives.
 •  Benefits offered to other employees generally comprise a car allowance where required for the role or to meet market norms.
 •  Participation in the LTIP is limited to the Executive Directors and certain selected senior managers. Other employees are eligible to participate in the 
Company’s share plans, details of which are provided on page 47.
 • A lower level of pension rate applies to employees other than the Executive Directors and certain senior executives.
 In general, these differences arise from the development of remuneration arrangements that are market competitive for the various categories of roles. They 
also reflect the fact that, in the case of the Executive Directors and senior executives, a greater emphasis tends to be placed on performance related pay.
(3) The choice of the performance metrics applicable to the annual bonus scheme reflects the Committee’s belief that any incentive compensation should be 
appropriately challenging and aligned to the Group’s strategy and the creation of shareholder value.
(4) The adjusted earnings per share and comparative total shareholder return performance conditions applicable to the LTIP (further details of which are provided 
on page 51) were selected by the Remuneration Committee on the basis that they reward the delivery of long-term returns to shareholders and the creation of 
shareholder value.
(5) The Committee operates share plans in accordance with their respective rules and in accordance with the Listing Rules and HMRC where relevant. The 
Committee, consistent with market practice, retains discretion over a number of areas relating to the operation and administration of certain plans.
(6) All employee share plans do not operate performance conditions. 
(7) The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office (including exercising any discretions available to it in 
connection with such payments) notwithstanding that they are not in line with the policy set out above where the terms of the payment were agreed (i) before 
the policy came into effect or (ii) at a time when the relevant individual was not a Director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was 
not in consideration for the individual becoming a Director of the Company. For these purposes “payments” includes the Committee satisfying awards of variable 
remuneration and, in relation to an award over shares, the terms of the payment are “agreed” at the time the award is granted.
(8) The Committee may make minor amendments to the policy (for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative purposes or to take account of a change in 
legislation) without obtaining shareholder approval.

(3) The on-target level of bonus is taken to be 135% of base salary in the case of Peter Plumb, 110% of base salary in the case of Matthew Price and 100% of base 
salary in the case of Graham Donoghue. The maximum level of bonus is taken to be 185% of base salary in the case of Peter Plumb, 165% of base salary in the 
case of Matthew Price and 150% of base salary in the case of Graham Donoghue.
(4) The on-target value of vesting under the LTIP is taken to be 67% of the maximum.
(5) No share price appreciation or depreciation has been assumed in calculating the value of the LTIP.
Service contracts for Executive Directors
The service agreements of the Executive Directors are not fixed term and are terminable by either the Company or the Director on 
twelve months’ notice and make provision, at the Board’s discretion, for early termination by way of payment of salary in lieu of twelve 
months’ notice. Incidental expenses may also be payable where appropriate. In calculating the amount payable to a Director on 
termination of employment, the Board would consider the circumstances on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the relevant 
contractual terms, the circumstances of the termination, any applicable duty to mitigate and the commercial interests of the Company. 
The Remuneration Committee reviews the contractual terms for new Executive Directors to ensure these reflect best practice.
Provision Detailed terms
Notice period 12 months
Termination payment Up to 12 months’ salary
Remuneration entitlements A bonus may be payable (pro-rated where relevant) and outstanding share awards may vest 
(pro-rated where relevant) subject to performance conditions
Change of control No Executive Director’s contract contains additional provisions in respect of change of control
Approach to leavers
Annual bonus may be payable with respect to the period of the financial year served (pro-rated for time where relevant) and paid at the 
normal date. Any share-based entitlements granted to an Executive Director under the Company’s share plans will be determined 
based on the relevant plan rules. The default treatment under the LTIP plan is that any outstanding awards lapse on cessation of 
employment. However, in certain prescribed circumstances, such as death, ill health, disability, retirement, redundancy or other 
circumstances at the discretion of the Committee, ‘good leaver’ status may be applied. For good leavers, awards will normally vest 
on their normal vesting date, subject to the satisfaction of the relevant performance conditions and reduced pro-rata where relevant to 
reflect the proportion of the performance period actually served. However, the Remuneration Committee has discretion to disapply 
time pro-rating. Governance
50 MONEYSUPERMARKET ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2014
Directors’ Remuneration Policy continued
Approach to recruitment and promotions
The remuneration package for a new Executive Director – i.e. base salary, benefits, pension, annual bonus and long-term incentive 
awards – would be set in accordance with the terms of the Company’s prevailing approved remuneration policy at the time of 
appointment and would reflect the experience of the individual. Annual bonus potential will be limited to 200% of salary and long-term 
incentives will be limited to 200% of salary. In addition, the Committee may offer additional cash and/or share-based elements when it 
considers these to be in the best interests of the Company (and therefore shareholders) to take account of remuneration relinquished 
when leaving the former employer and would where appropriate reflect the nature, time horizons and performance requirements 
attaching to that remuneration. Shareholders will be informed of any such payments at the time of appointment.
For an internal Executive Director appointment, any variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior role may be allowed to pay 
out according to its terms. In addition, any other ongoing remuneration obligations existing prior to appointment may continue, 
provided that they are disclosed to shareholders in the next following Directors’ Remuneration Report.
For external and internal appointments, the Committee may agree that the Company will meet certain relocation and/or incidental 
expenses as appropriate.
Other appointments
The Executive Directors may accept outside appointments, with prior Board approval, provided these opportunities do not negatively 
impact on the individual’s ability to perform his duties at the Company. Whether any related fees are retained by the individual or are 
remitted to the Company will be considered on a case by case basis.
Non-Executive Directors
Non-Executive Directors are appointed under arrangements that may generally be terminated by either the Company or the Director 
on up to three months’ notice and their appointment is reviewed annually.

Annual bonus
The maximum bonus potential for the year ending 31 December 2015 will remain at 185% of base salary for the Chief Executive Officer, 
165% of base salary for the Chief Financial Officer and 150% of base salary for any other Executive Director. Awards are determined 
based on a combination of both the Group’s financial performance, being growth in revenue and adjusted operating profit, and the 
Executive Directors’ performance against specific personal objectives. Maximum bonus will only be payable when revenue and 
adjusted operating profit have significantly exceeded expectations.
Long-term incentives
The LTIP award levels in 2015 will be: 200% of base salary for the Chief Executive Officer, 165% of base salary for the Chief Financial 
Officer and 150% of base salary for any other Executive Director.
The extent to which LTIP awards which will be granted in 2015 will vest will be dependent on two independent performance conditions 
as follows:
Metric Performance condition Threshold Maximum
Compound annual growth in 
adjusted earnings per share 
(70% of the award) 
Compound annual growth in adjusted earnings per share over the 
three year performance period. 20% vesting at threshold performance 
of compound annual growth in adjusted earnings per share of 7% and 
100% vesting at maximum performance of compound annual growth 
in adjusted earnings per share of 17% or above. Vesting is on a straight 
line between threshold and maximum.
7% 17%
Comparative total shareholder 
return (30% of the award)
Comparative total shareholder return against the constituents of the 
FTSE 250 Index. 20% vesting at median performance and 100% vesting 
at upper quartile performance or above. Comparative total shareholder 
return measured over the three year performance period. Vesting is on 
a straight line between threshold and maximum.
Median Upper quartile
Non-Executive Directors
With effect from 1 January 2015, a fee of £1,500 will be paid to each Non-Executive Director for each Board Committee that he or she is 
a member of to reflect the increasing time commitment of the Board Committees. The fees for the Non-Executive Directors will

Notes
(1) Taxable benefits 
Benefits for the Executive Directors incorporate all benefits and expense allowances arising from employment which relate to the provision of a car allowance. 
Benefits for Gerald Corbett related to an annual allowance of £25,000 for a motor vehicle and associated costs. 
(2) Pension 
Pension payments reflect defined contributions and/or salary supplement arrangements where the pension contributions exceed the limits set by HMRC. 
(3) Annual bonus payments 
Maximum bonus entitlements for the year ended 31 December 2014 as a percentage of base salary were 185% for Peter Plumb, 165% for Paul Doughty, 165% for 
Matthew Price and 150% for Graham Donoghue for the achievement of stretching targets for adjusted EBITDA and market share as well as specific individual and 
strategic objectives. 
The actual adjusted EBITDA performance for the year ended 31 December 2014 was £95.2m, against a threshold performance target of £85m, and a maximum 
performance target of £97m. The targets for market share were met in full. The personal targets were set individually for each Executive Director based on the key 
objectives for the year in their area of responsibility. These included a focus on areas such as delivery of the new technology architecture and aggregation engine, 
delivery of new personal customer journeys, for motor insurance, flights and car hire, and optimisation of MoneySavingExpert for mobile and tablet devices. The 
Committee assessed the personal targets and deemed they were partially met. Further detail on the underlying targets is commercially sensitive and cannot be 
disclosed.
As a result, 158% of base salary for Peter Plumb, 148% of base salary for Paul Doughty, 151% of base salary for Matthew Price and 110% of base salary for Graham 
Donoghue will be payable. The bonus for Matthew Price and Paul Doughty has been pro-rated for 2014.

profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the Group and 
Company Financial Statements, the Directors are required to:
• Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently. 
• Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent. 
• For the Group Financial Statements, state whether they have 
been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU.
• For the Company Financial Statements, state whether 
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in 
the Company Financial Statements. 
• Prepare the Financial Statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the 
Company will continue in business. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure 
that its Financial Statements comply with the Companies Act 
2006. They have general responsibility for taking such steps as 
are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the 
Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also 
responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, Directors’ Report, 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance 
Report that complies with that law and those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ 
from legislation in other jurisdictions.
The Board considers that the Annual Report and Financial 
Statements, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable 
and provide the information necessary for shareholders to assess 
the Group’s performance, business model and strategy.
Directors’ responsibilities statement pursuant to Disclosure 
and Transparency Rules 4.1.12R
Each of the Directors whose names and functions are set out on 
pages 30 and 31 confirms that, to the best of their knowledge:
• The Financial Statements, prepared in accordance with the 
applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or 
loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole. 
• The management report, which comprises the Directors’ 
Report and the Strategic Report, includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business and the 
position of the Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of 
the principal risks and uncertainties that they face. 
Management report
The Directors’ Report and Strategic Report comprises the 
‘management report’ for the purposes of the Financial Conduct 
Authority’s Disclosure and Transparency Rules (DTR 4.1.8R).
Internal control
The Corporate Governance Report on pages 32 to 36, the Audit 
Committee Report on pages 37 to 39 and the Risk Committee 
Report on pages 41 and 42 includes the Board’s assessment of 
the Group’s system of internal controls.
Employees
The Group places considerable value on the involvement of its 
employees and uses a number of ways to engage with employees 
on matters that impact them and the performance of the Group. 
These include formal business performance updates by members 
of the executive management team for all employees, regular 
update briefings for all employees, regular team meetings, the 
Group’s intranet site which enables easy access to the latest

Financial Statements General Governance Overview Strategic Report
Group information as well as Group policies, and the circulation 
to employees of results announcements and other corporate 
announcements. This also helps to achieve a common awareness 
amongst employees of the financial and economic factors 
affecting the performance of the Group.
A robust employee engagement survey process is also in place to 
ensure that employees are given a voice in the organisation and 
that the Group can take action based on employee feedback.
All employees are able to participate in the Company’s Share 
Incentive Plan and Save As You Earn Scheme which gives 
employees the opportunity to purchase ordinary shares in the 
Company. This helps to encourage employee interest in the 
performance of the Group.
Equal opportunities
The Group is committed to providing equality of opportunity to 
all employees without discrimination and applies fair and 
equitable employment policies which seek to promote entry into 
and progression within the Group. Appointments are determined 
solely by application of job criteria, personal ability, behaviour 
and competency.
Disabled persons
Disabled persons have equal opportunities when applying for 
vacancies, with due regard to their skills and abilities. Procedures 
ensure that disabled employees are fairly treated in respect of 
training and career development. For those employees becoming 
disabled during the course of their employment, the Group is 
supportive so as to provide an opportunity for them to remain 
with the Group, wherever reasonably practicable.
In the opinion of the Directors, all employee policies are deemed 
to be effective and in accordance with their intended aims.
Borrowings
During the period, the Group’s available loan facility decreased 
from £70m to £60m. As at 31 December 2014, the Group had 
net cash of £13.1m. Under the terms of the facility, the amount 
available will reduce to £50m on 31 May 2015.
Financial risk management
It is the Group’s objective to manage its financial risk so as to 
minimise the adverse fluctuations in the financial markets on the 
Group’s profitability and cash flow. The specific policies for 
managing each of the Group’s main financial risk areas are set out 
in note 17 to the Group Financial Statements on pages 82 and 83.
Political donations
During the financial year ended 31 December 2014, the Group did 
not make any political donations (2013: £nil).
Environmental matters
Information on the Group’s greenhouse gas emissions is 
disclosed in the Corporate Responsibility Report on page 26 and 
is incorporated into this Directors’ Report by reference.
Disclosure of information to auditor
The Directors who held office at the date of this report confirm 
that, so far as they are each aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s auditor is unaware; and each 
such Director has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken 
as a Director to make himself aware of any relevant audit 
information, and to establish that the Company’s auditor is aware 
of that information.

Opinions and conclusions arising from our audit:
1 Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified
We have audited the financial statements of Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC for the year ended 31 December 2014 set out on 
pages 65 to 92. In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 December 
2014 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the European Union;
• the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with UK Accounting Standards; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006; and, as regards the 
Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
2 Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements the risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our 
audit were as follows:
• MoneySavingExpert.com contingent remuneration payable 
(Consolidated Statement of Financial Position accrual £15.3 million, Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income 
charge £4.2 million, of which £0.3 million relates to interest unwind)
	 R e f e r	t o	p a g e	3 8	( A u d i t	C o m m i t t e e	R e p o r t ) ,	p a g e	7 0	(a c c o u n t i n g	p o l i c y )	a n d	p a g e	8 1	( fi n a n c i a l	d i s c l o s u r e s ) .
 T h e	r i s k	– The quantum of contingent remuneration arising from the MoneySavingExpert.com acquisition in 2012 is dependent upon 
achievement of a number of non-financial measures and is in part at the discretion of the Board, subject to continued employment 
over a 3 year period. The judgemental nature of the estimate is considered a significant audit risk.
 O u r	r e s p o n s e	– Our audit procedures included, among others, comparing the relevant non-financial measures of MoneySavingExpert.
com at 31 December 2014, as reported to the Board, to the requirements set out in the Share and Purchase Agreement. Data 
analytics were used to review the measurement bases and we challenged the Group’s assessment of the potential outcomes with 
reference to the actual performance of each measure as at the year end, including reviewing management’s sensitivity analysis of 
potential outcomes. 
 In respect of the discretionary element, we inspected board minutes and received a specific Board Representation to confirm that 
the estimate is consistent with the current expectations of the Board.
 We considered the sufficiency and adequacy of the Group’s disclosures in respect of the estimate of the contingent remuneration 
recognised, particularly the method of estimation, significant assumptions used and degree of estimation uncertainty, as required 
by relevant accounting standards.
• Capitalised software and development costs (£15.9 million)
	 R e f e r	t o	p a g e	3 8	( A u d i t	C o m m i t t e e	R e p o r t ) ,	p a g e	7 1	(a c c o u n t i n g	p o l i c y )	a n d	p a g e s	7 9 - 8 0	( fi n a n c i a l	d i s c l o s u r e s ) .
 T h e	r i s k	– The Group has incurred significant software and development project costs in the year in respect of the technology reset 
program including, platform aggregation, TravelSupermarket and mobile optimisation. These are capitalised to the extent that 
future economic benefits are expected to be generated by these projects. This requires judgements as to the successful completion 
of projects and whether sufficient revenue and profitability will be generated to ensure the recoverability of the cost being 
capitalised. The key inputs in the Directors’ return on investment calculations, specifically customer conversion rates, ability to cross 
sell products, revenue growth and timing and amount of capital expenditure, all require significant estimation and judgement. The 
Directors also apply judgement in the classification of spend as development in nature rather than on-going operational 
expenditure. Given the significant value of the software and development assets, and in light of the early stage of the projects, this 
is considered to be an area of significant audit risk.
 O u r	r e s p o n s e	– Our audit procedures included detailed testing of the inputs into the Group’s project forecasts, assessment of the 
historical accuracy of the Directors’ forecasting and interviews with key operational personnel to obtain a breadth of different views 
about project progress. For the key inputs we critically assessed the reasonableness of the assumptions with reference to internal 
data. We assessed whether costs had been appropriately capitalised in respect of significant projects by comparison to the 
recognition criteria of relevant accounting standards for a statistically selected sample. We evaluated the adequacy of the Group’s 
disclosures in respect of the risks inherent in the projects as at the year end date.

Financial Statements General Governance Overview Strategic Report
• Revenue (£248.1 million)
	 R e f e r	t o	p a g e	3 7	( A u d i t	C o m m i t t e e	R e p o r t ) ,	p a g e	7 0	(a c c o u n t i n g	p o l i c y )	a n d	p a g e	8 0	( fi n a n c i a l	d i s c l o s u r e s ) .
 T h e	r i s k	– Revenue is recognised predominantly from internet lead generation (click based revenues). Revenue accruals are made 
based on an estimation of the likely number of successful conversions. Revenue recognition, including the existence of revenue, is 
considered to be a significant audit risk because of the inherent complexities of the click recording system and the judgements 
made to estimate unbilled revenue at the period end.
 O u r	r e s p o n s e	– Our audit procedures included testing the general IT control environment of the Group’s information system, where 
click activity is recorded, to assess whether general IT controls were in place and were operating effectively across the period. This 
assessment supported the level of detailed testing by our own IT specialists to assess whether the system was recording clicks in the 
correct period, and that the number of clicks on which the Group is basing its revenue accrual estimate were derived from a system 
that is operating effectively. This detailed testing involved re-performance of click-throughs in the live environment.
 We selected a statistical sample of the year end revenue accruals and agreed these to confirmatory evidence, which included cash 
receipts and confirmation of successful applications from the end providers, which allowed us to make an assessment of the validity 
and accuracy of the total revenue accrual.
 We compared total revenue recognised to our expectations based on cash receipts and movement of trade receivables and revenue 
accruals. We analysed movements in revenue at an operating segment level based on changes in visitor numbers and transactions, 
and investigated unusual trends.
 We also considered the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures in respect of click-based revenue recognition.
 We continue to perform work over the carrying value of goodwill and intangibles. However, in light of improved performance at both 
the Group and individual cash generating unit level, resulting in the underlying assumptions used in the Group’s calculations not 
being sensitive to changes in key inputs, we have not assessed this as one of the risks that had the greatest effect on our audit and, 
therefore, it is not separately identified in our report this year.
3 Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit
The materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole was set at £5.0 million (2013: £5.1 million), determined with reference to a 
benchmark of Group profit before tax, normalised to exclude MoneySavingExpert.com contingent remuneration costs and profit on 
the sale of HD Decisions, of £66.3 million. Materiality represents 7.5% of normalised Group profit before tax (2013: 2.3% of Group 
revenue (2014: 2.0% of Group revenue)). The change in the benchmark used is due to the business now being well established, having 
reduced profit volatility and the integration of the MoneySavingExpert.com acquisition being complete.
We report to the Audit Committee any corrected or uncorrected identified differences exceeding £0.25 million, in addition to other 
identified misstatements that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
The Group consists of nine components which are all audited by one audit team at the Group’s head office. 98% of the Group revenues 
are generated from the main trading component, Moneysupermarket.com Limited. Moneysupermarket.com Limited’s component 
materiality is £4.5 million. We audit the remaining components to materiality ranging from £0.6 million to £4.5 million. The Group audit 
scope covers 100% of Group revenues, 100% of Group profit before taxation, and 100% of total Group assets.
4 Our opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 is unmodified
In our opinion:
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006; and
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the financial statements. Governance

5 We have nothing to report in respect of the matters on which we are required to report by exception
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required to report to you if, based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we have 
identified other information in the annual report that contains a material inconsistency with either that knowledge or the financial 
statements, a material misstatement or fact, or that is otherwise misleading.

they consider that the annual report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides 
the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, business model and strategy; or
• the Audit Committee Report does not appropriately address matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
• the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
• the Directors’ statement, set out on page 59, in relation to going concern; and
• the part of the Corporate Governance Statement on pages 32 to 36 relating to the company’s compliance with the ten provisions of 
the 2012 UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review.
We have nothing to report in respect of the above responsibilities.
Scope and responsibilities

preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. A description of the scope of an audit 
of financial statements is provided on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at www.frc.org.uk/auditscopeukprivate. This report is 
made solely to the company’s members as a body and is subject to important explanations and disclaimers regarding our 
responsibilities, published on our website at www.kpmg.com/uk/auditscopeukco2014a, which are incorporated into this report as if set

1. Corporate information
The Consolidated Financial Statements of Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC (‘Company’), a company incorporated in England, and its 
subsidiaries for the year ended 31 December 2014, were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 
2 March 2015. The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (‘Adopted IFRSs’). The Company has elected to prepare its Company 
Financial Statements in accordance with UK GAAP; these are presented on pages 87 to 92.
2. Summary of significant accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The Financial Statements are prepared on the historical cost basis. Comparative figures presented in the Financial Statements 
represent the year ended 31 December 2013. The Financial Statements are prepared on a going concern basis, which the Directors 
deem appropriate, given the Group’s positive cash position, low level of debt, continued growth and forecast profitability.
Use of estimates and judgements
The preparation of Financial Statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the 
application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from 
these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the 
period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
The most significant areas of estimation uncertainty, and areas where critical judgements are made in applying accounting policies that 
have a material effect on the Financial Statements, are listed below. The uncertainties encountered, and judgements made, are 
described in more detail in the relevant accounting policies and accompanying notes:
• Note 3  contingent consideration and remuneration on acquisitions
• Note 12 goodwill and other intangibles, including the capitalisation of software and development costs
• Note 13 revenue recognition
Basis of consolidation
These Consolidated Financial Statements incorporate the Financial Statements of the Company and its subsidiaries and equity account 
the Group’s interest in associates.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group has power over the investee, exposure or rights to 
variable returns and the ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns. The Financial Statements of subsidiaries are 
included in the Consolidated Financial Statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies. 
Significant influence is presumed to exist when the Group holds between 20% and 50% of the voting power of another entity. 
Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method and are recognised initially at cost. The Consolidated Financial 
Statements include the Group’s share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of equity accounted investees, after 
adjustments to align the accounting policies with those of the Group, from the date that significant influence commences until the date 
that significant influence ceases.
Accounting for business combinations
From 1 January 2010 the Group has applied IFRS 3 Business Combinations (2008) in accounting for business combinations. The change 
in accounting policy has been applied prospectively.
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is 
transferred to the Group. Control is the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from 
its activities. In assessing control, the Group takes into consideration potential voting rights that currently are exercisable.
Acquisitions on or after 1 January 2010
For acquisitions on or after 1 January 2010, the Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as:
• the fair value of the consideration transferred; plus 
• the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree; plus 
• if the business combination is achieved in stages, the fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree; less 
• the net recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. 
When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships. Such amounts are 
generally recognised in profit or loss.
Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurs in 
connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred.

Financial Statements 70 MONEYSUPERMARKET ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2014
Financial Statements
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Any contingent amount payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. If the contingent amount is classified as equity, it is 
not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent 
amount are recognised in profit or loss. Where the contingent amount is dependent on future employment, it shall be treated as a cost 
of continuing employment, and therefore is recognised as an expense over the relevant period.
Acquisitions between 22 June 2007 and 1 January 2010
For acquisitions between 22 June 2007 and 1 January 2010, goodwill represents the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the 
Group’s interest in the recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the 
acquiree. When the excess was negative, a bargain purchase gain was recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Transaction costs, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurred in connection with 
business combinations were capitalised as part of the cost of the acquisition.
The Group was established via a series of transactions that occurred concurrently on 22 June 2007. These comprised the incorporation 
of the Company with Simon Nixon as sole shareholder, the acquisition by the Company using a share for share exchange of Simon 
Nixon’s 45% interest in Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited and the acquisition by the Company of all other shares in 
Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited from third parties. The acquisition of Simon Nixon’s shares was between two parties, 
being Simon Nixon and the Company, who were under common control at the time of the transaction. The acquisition was of an 
interest in a company which gave the investor a significant influence in the company and it was concluded that this arrangement was a 
common control transaction and not within the scope of IFRS 3 Business Combinations. As a result the Company accounted for this 
45% interest in Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited at original carrying value rather than fair value at the date of the 
acquisition. The acquisition of the remaining shares in Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited was accounted for in 
accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations applying the accounting guidance for a business combination achieved in stages. This 
resulted in the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group 
Limited being recognised in full and the goodwill in respect of the acquisition from third parties being recognised.
Foreign currency
The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in sterling, which is the Company’s functional and presentation currency.
The functional currency of the foreign subsidiary icero GmbH is the euro. The income and expenses of the foreign operation are 
translated into sterling at an average exchange rate for the period in which the activity occurred. The assets and liabilities of the foreign 
operation are translated into sterling using exchange rates ruling as at the balance sheet date. The exchange difference arising upon 
translation is taken directly to a separate component of equity.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are retranslated to the functional currency at 
the exchange rate at that date. Foreign currency differences arising on retranslation are recognised as a profit or loss.
Revenue
The Group generates fees from internet lead generation (click based revenue), commissions from brokerage sales and advertising 
through a variety of contractual arrangements. The Group recognises click based revenues and associated costs in the period that the 
lead is generated. Brokerage commissions are recognised at the point of completion of the transaction with the customer. Advertising 
revenue is recognised in the period when an advertisement is delivered to the end user.
Revenue is recognised net of value added tax.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of 
property, plant and equipment.
Depreciation is charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of each part 
of an item of property, plant and equipment. Land is not depreciated. Assets under construction are not depreciated until brought into 
use. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
Buildings 50 years
Plant and equipment (including IT equipment) 3 years
Fixtures and fittings 5 years
Office equipment 5 years
The useful lives and depreciation rates are reassessed at each reporting date.

Intangible assets
Goodwill
Goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses, with the carrying value being reviewed for impairment at least 
annually, and whenever there is an indication that the carrying value may be impaired.
Other intangible assets
The cost of other intangible assets acquired in a business combination is fair value as at the date of acquisition. After initial recognition, 
intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. All the Group’s intangible 
assets (other than goodwill) have been identified as having finite useful lives. As such, they are amortised on a straight-line basis over their 
useful economic life and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The 
amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life, is reviewed at least at each financial year 
end. The amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the 
expense category consistent with the function of the intangible asset. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
Market-related 10 years
Customer relationships 7 years
Non-compete agreement 4 years
Customer lists 3 years
Technology 3 years
Market-related intangible assets are defined as those that are primarily used in the marketing or promotion of products and services, 
for example trademarks, trade names and internet domain names.
Customer-related intangible assets consist of customer lists, customer contracts and relationships, and non-contractual customer 
relationships. For accounting purposes, customer relationships and customer lists have been identified separately. Relationships with 
high-profile customers provide the Group with prominence in the marketplace, create volume and traffic on the website, and enhance 
the reputation of the brand. Customer lists allow the Group to undertake targeted marketing activities.
Technology-based intangible assets relate to innovations and technical advances such as computer software, patented and unpatented 
technology, databases and trade secrets.
Impairment
The carrying amounts of the Group’s assets are reviewed annually to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If such 
indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable 
amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
For the purposes of impairment reviews, the recoverable amount of the Group’s assets is taken to be the higher of their fair value less 
costs to sell and their value in use.
Research and development
Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining technical knowledge and understanding, is charged to 
the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income when incurred. Development expenditure is capitalised when it meets the 
criteria outlined in IAS 38. Expenditure that does not meet the criteria is expensed directly to the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand are included as a 
component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose only of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
Employee benefits
Defined contribution plans
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income as incurred.
Share-based payment transactions
The Group’s share schemes allow certain Group employees to acquire ordinary shares in the Company. The fair value of share awards 
made is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at award date and 
spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the awards. The fair values of the share awards 
are measured using the Monte Carlo method for options subject to a market-based condition and the Black-Scholes model for all 
others, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the awards were made. The amount recognised as an expense is 
adjusted to reflect the number of share awards expected to vest. 72 MONEYSUPERMARKET ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2014
Financial Statements
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Short-term employee benefits
Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income as the related service is provided.
A provision is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit sharing plans if the Group has a 
present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can 
be estimated reliably.
Advertising costs
The Group incurs costs from advertising via a number of different media. Costs associated with the production of adverts are 
recognised as an expense in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income only once the advert is available to the Group in a 
format ready for use, having been approved for airing or displaying. The cost of airing or displaying the advert is taken as an expense in 
the period in which the advert is aired or displayed.
Finance income
Finance income comprises interest receivable, which is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as it 
accrues using the effective interest method.
Finance costs
Finance costs comprise of interest charged on borrowings, and the unwind of the discount on contingent remuneration. Borrowings 
are recognised initially at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs. The effective interest rate method is then used for 
subsequent re-measurement of borrowings at amortised cost. The unwind of the discount on contingent remuneration is charged to 
the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as an interest expense.
Operating leases
Rental payments under operating leases are charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight-line basis 
over the term of the relevant lease except where another more systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which 
economic benefits from the lease asset are consumed. Lease incentives and rent-free periods are amortised through the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income over the term of the relevant lease.
Dividends
Dividends payable to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability and deducted from shareholders’ equity in the period in 
which the shareholders’ right to receive payment is established.
Taxation
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates in force for the year, and any adjustment to 
tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting 
purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition 
of goodwill; the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business 
combination; and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable 
future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of 
assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the 
asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised at the expected future tax rate of the value of the intangible assets with finite lives which are 
acquired through business combinations representing the tax effect of the amortisation of these assets in future periods.
These liabilities will decrease in line with the amortisation of the related intangible assets, with the deferred tax credit recognised in the 
Statement of Comprehensive Income in accordance with IAS 12.
Research and development tax credits are accounted for in accordance with IAS 20 as a government grant. The credit is recognised 
once a reasonable estimate of the amount can be made.

Group management of capital
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are:
• to safeguard the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and 
benefits for other stakeholders; and 
• to provide an adequate return to shareholders by pricing products and services commensurately with the level of risk. 
The Group sets the amount of capital in proportion to risk. The Group manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of 
changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets. In assessing the level of capital all components of equity 
are taken into account, i.e. share capital, retained earnings and reserves (where applicable), as well as unvested share options and awards.
In line with internal capital management requirements, the Group manages its cash balances by where possible depositing them with a 
number of financial institutions to reduce credit risk. The Group has made a net repayment of £30m on its revolving credit facility in the 
year, with £30m remaining drawn down on the facility at 31 December 2014. The Group is subject to externally imposed quarterly 
covenants as a result of this facility which are based on EBITDA, interest and net debt. None of these covenants were breached in the 
year, nor are expected to be breached within 12 months of the date of these Financial Statements. Management of capital focuses 
around the Group’s ability to generate cash from its operations. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may 
adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, or sell assets to raise funds. The 
Group believes it is meeting its objectives for managing capital as funds are available for reinvestment where necessary as well as 
being in a position to make returns to shareholders where this is felt appropriate.
There were no changes to the Group’s approach to capital management during the year.
Standards, amendments and interpretations adopted during the period
The Group has adopted the following standards, amendments and interpretations which have not had a significant impact on the 
Group’s results:
• IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated financial statements (2011)’
• IFRS 11 ‘Joint ventures (2011)’
• IFRS 12 ‘Disclosure of interest in other entities (2011)’ 
• IAS 27 ‘Separate financial statements (revised 2011)’
• IAS 28 ‘Investments in associates and joint ventures (revised 2011)’
• IAS 36 ‘Recoverable amount disclosures for non-financial assets’
Standards, amendments and interpretations issued but not yet effective
A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations have been issued but are not yet effective, and therefore 
have not yet been adopted by the Group. These are not expected to have a material impact on the Group’s accounts when adopted, 
except where stated.
IFRS 9 ‘Financial instruments’ (2010) — On 28 October 2010, the IASB published a revised version of IFRS 9 ‘Financial instruments’. The 
revised standard retains the requirements for classification and measurement of financial assets that were published in November 
2009 but adds guidance on the classification and measurement of financial liabilities. As part of its restructuring of IFRS 9, the IASB also 
copied the guidance on derecognition of financial instruments and related implementation guidance from IAS 39 ‘Financial 
instruments: recognition and measurement to IFRS 9’. On 19 November 2011, the IASB issued ‘Mandatory effective date and Transition 
Disclosures.’ IFRS 9 has not yet been adopted by the EU and the effective date is currently unknown.
IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customer’ (2014)  — The standard applies to an entity’s first annual statements beginning on or 
after 1 January 2017.
3. Acquisitions
MoneySavingExpert.com (MSE)
On 21 September 2012, the Group acquired certain trade and assets from Martin Lewis and his company MoneySavingExpert.com. 
Additional amounts of up to £27.0m may become payable on the third anniversary of the completion of the acquisition. The amount 
payable depends in part upon the achievement of a number of non-financial performance measures specified in the purchase 
agreement and is, in part, at the discretion of the Company’s Board, subject to the continued employment of Martin Lewis.
The arrangement to pay these additional amounts has been accounted for separate to the business combination as remuneration as 
their payment is linked to the continued employment of Martin Lewis.
The benefit payable will be charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income over the period in which services are 
provided (the earnout period) as an employment expense. Management has estimated the benefit payable by assessing, amongst 
other things, the performance of the acquired business since acquisition, against the measures specified in the purchase agreement. 
Measurement is inherently subjective due to the nature of the earnout variables, for which, in one case the measurement period has 
not yet started, or is in the early stages for other variables. Due to this subjectivity, the eventual amount payable could be different 
depending upon a number of outcomes. However, the amount accrued at December 2014 is currently management’s best estimate of 
the likely outcome at this stage. During the year £3.9m (2013: £8.0m) has been charged to the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income as an employment expense, and £0.3m (2013: £0.6m) has been recognised as an expense within net finance 
costs, being the unwinding of the discount rate applied. 74 MONEYSUPERMARKET ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2014
Financial Statements
3. Acquisitions continued
OnTrees
On 14 March 2014, the Group acquired the trade and assets of OnTrees for consideration of £1.5m paid in cash. Accordingly £1.5m of 
goodwill has been recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position in relation to the acquisition. OnTrees is a bank 
account and credit card account aggregation service provider. 
4. Segmental information
Business segments
In applying IFRS 8 — Operating segments, the Group has disclosed five reportable segments, being Money, Insurance, Travel, Home 
Services and MoneySavingExpert.com. Money, Insurance and Home Services operate under the brand name MoneySuperMarket.com, 
and Travel under the brand name TravelSupermarket.com, however, all four segments are reported separately. MoneySavingExpert is 
disclosed as a separate operating segment, with revenue generated by Financial Services Net Limited, Local Daily Deals Limited, and 
the shopping and vouchers channel reported within ‘Other’. This disclosure correlates with the information which is presented to the 
Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker, the Company Board, which reviews revenue by segment. The Group’s costs, finance income, 
tax charges and net assets are only reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker at a consolidated level, with the exception of 
MoneySavingExpert.com, and therefore have not been allocated between all segments in the analysis below. All of the Group revenue 
of £248.1m (2013: £225.6m) reported in 2014 was generated in the UK.

reductions to 21% (effective from 1 April 2014) and 20% (effective from 1 April 2015) were substantively enacted on 2 July 2013. This will 
reduce the Company’s future current tax charge accordingly and reduces the deferred tax liabilities at 31 December 2014 which have 
been calculated based on the rate of 20% substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
9. Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share
Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the profit or loss for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of the 
Company, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per share
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the profit or loss for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of 
the Company, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of 
ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.
Earnings per share
Basic and diluted earnings per share has been calculated on the following basis:
2014 2013

On an annual basis, or where an indication exists, the Group is required to assess its goodwill and intangible assets for impairment.
During 2007 the Group employed the services of an appropriately qualified and experienced independent third party to value the 
intangible assets acquired from Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited. This valuation was used as the initial carrying value for 
these assets. Following the impairment in 2008, the market capitalisation of the Group approximated to the total carrying value of the 
goodwill, intangible and other non-current assets of the Group. At 31 December 2014 the market capitalisation exceeded the carrying 
value of the goodwill, intangible and other non-current assets, and net current assets by more than 100% (2013: more than 100%).
On adoption of IFRS 8 the Group was required to allocate goodwill between its cash generating units (CGU) that represent the lowest level 
within the Group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes, but are not larger than an operating segment as 
defined by IFRS 8. These CGUs are the five operating segments Insurance, Money, Travel, Home Services and MoneySavingExpert.com. 
The Group has performed impairment testing at a CGU level. For the original four segments, the goodwill was allocated on 1 January 2009 
based on estimates of the relative values of the operating segments at that date with £30.7m allocated to Insurance, £15.5m to Money, 
£6.6m to Travel and £2.2m to Home Services. The balances at 31 December 2014 are inline with those at 1 January 2009. Goodwill 
impairment for MSE has been considered separately from the four operating segments outlined above and the Group.
Impairment review by vertical and Group
For the current year, the recoverable amount of the assets was taken to be their value in use and was calculated by reference to the 
forecast cash flows.
The present value of the future cash flows has been calculated with the following key assumptions:
• Cash flows for year 1 for each CGU represent management’s best estimate of future cash flows as at 31 December 2014, and are 
based upon the Group’s approved budget for 2015 incorporating cost of sales, advertising and an allocation of overhead costs. The 
main assumptions underlying the 2015 budget relate to visitor volumes, source of visitors, revenue per transaction/visitor and 
marketing spend, which incorporate past experience. The forecast assumes continued growth during the course of 2015, broadly in 
line with that seen in 2014, driven by new media campaigns, exploitation of the Group’s data asset and further investments made 
during 2014 in the core technology underpinning the Group’s key channels. 
• Cash flows for the second and third years assume revenue growth of approximately 10% per annum in the Money and Travel 
segments, with a higher rate of growth in the Home Services segment, and a lower rate of growth in the Insurance segment. 
Costs are expected to grow broadly in line with revenues. Cash flows after three years assume no growth. 
• Cash flows into perpetuity have been incorporated into the calculations. 
• A pre-tax discount rate of 13.5% (2013: 13.5%) has been used in the forecast for the Travel, Insurance, Money and Home Services segments. 
A different set of assumptions may be more appropriate in future years dependent on changes to the macro-economic environment.
The analysis performed calculates that the recoverable amount of the assets allocated to the Insurance, Money, Travel and Home 
Services segments exceeds their carrying value by in excess of 100%, and as such, no impairment was identified. No reasonably 
possible change to a key assumption would result in an impairment. 80 MONEYSUPERMARKET ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2014
Financial Statements
12. Intangible assets continued
As explained in note 4, whilst the Group is able to allocate revenue between the Insurance, Money, Travel and Home Services operating 
segments, its cost base is reviewed by the Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker at a Group rather than segmental level, and a 
number of the significant costs which the Group incurs cannot be allocated either directly or on a reasonable and consistent basis to 
the CGUs that are each operating segment. Therefore the cash flows estimated for these segments include all of the Group’s forecast 
revenues and an allocation of the Group’s forecast costs.
The Group has therefore also performed a further impairment test for the Group as a whole, in a manner consistent with previous 
years. In these calculations the Group is treated as one group of CGUs, and the test compared the carrying amount, including goodwill 
and other corporate assets, to the recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount has been estimated based on the present value of its future cash flows, which has been calculated with a set 
of assumptions consistent with those set out above in relation to the individual operating segment calculations.
The analysis performed calculates that the recoverable amount of the Group’s assets exceeds their carrying value by £656m (2013: 
£444m), and as such, no impairment was identified.
With regard to the Group level impairment testing, no reasonably possible change to a key assumption would result in an impairment 
(2013: same).
At an asset category level, management believe that the assumptions relating to each intangible asset remain applicable, and that no 
adjustment is required to their valuation, nor their useful economic lives. In relation to the spend on technology related assets, 
management believe that the expenditure incurred will generate future economic benefits for the Group. They consider that the assets 
are not yet sufficiently mature to assess their carrying amount at anything other than the carrying value shown in the financial 
statements, being cost less accumulated depreciation which is charged to write off the assets over a three year period.
Acquisition of certain trade and assets of Martin Lewis and MoneySavingExpert.com
The recoverable amount has been estimated based on the present value of its future cashflows using the following key assumptions:
• Cash flows for year 1 represent management’s best estimate of future cash flows as at 31 December 2014, and are based upon the 
Group’s approved budget for 2015. The main assumptions underlying the budget relate to visitor numbers, the amount of revenue 
generated per visitor, and the staff resource required to run the business. The forecast assumes an improvement during 2015, 
driven by investments in technology and search engine optimisation. 
• Cash flows for the first three years assume an average 10% per annum increase in revenue, with costs expected to grow at around 
10% per annum. Cash flows after three years assume no growth. 
• Cash flows into perpetuity have been built into the model.
• A pre-tax discount rate of 16.2% (2013: 16.2%) has been used in the forecast. 
The analysis performed calculates that the recoverable amount of the assets exceeds their carrying value by £51m (2013: £24m), and  
as such, no impairment was identified. The discount rate would need to increase to 28% (2013: 22%) with all other assumptions held 
constant, to give a value in use of MSE’s assets equal to the carrying value. Similarly, a decrease in the annual cash flows of £9.0m  
(2013: £4.0m) with all other assumptions held constant, would also give a value in use equal to the carrying value.

All receivables fall due within one year.
As a result of click based revenue being recognised in the period that the lead is generated, there is an element of subjectivity in 
calculating a revenue accrual as a result of estimating the number of successful applications on the provider’s website in the period 
between the last date of billing and the latest provider data being made available. This revenue accrual can typically represent 
approximately one month’s revenue. The accrued revenue is estimated by considering the volume of clicks that have passed from the 
Group’s websites through to provider websites in the period, the historic conversion of such clicks into completed product purchases, 
and contracted revenue per transaction. From historical experience and post year end confirmation, the Group expects any differences 
between the amounts accrued at year end and those amounts subsequently billed to be not materially different.
At 31 December 2014, trade receivables are shown net of a provision for doubtful debts of £213,000 (2013: £122,000), which represents 
a judgement made by management of which receivables balances are unlikely to be recovered taking into consideration the ageing of 
the debt, evidence of poor payment history or financial position of a particular debtor.

29,970 70,668
Contingent remuneration relates to additional amounts of up to £27.0m which may become payable on the third anniversary of the 
completion of the acquisition of MoneySavingExpert.com. The amount payable depends in part upon the achievement of a number of 
non-financial performance measures specified in the purchase agreement and is, in part, at the discretion of the Company’s Board, 
subject to the continued employment of Martin Lewis.
The arrangement to pay these additional amounts has been accounted for separately to the business combination as remuneration as 
their payment is linked to the continued employment of Martin Lewis.
The benefit payable will be charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income over the period in which services are 
provided (the earnout period) as an employment expense. Management has estimated the benefit payable by assessing, amongst 
other things, the performance of the acquired business since acquisition, against the measures specified in the purchase agreement. 
During the year £3.9m (2013: £8.0m) has been charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as an employment 
expense, and £0.3m (2013: £0.6m) has been recognised as an expense within net finance costs, being the unwinding of the discount 
rate applied.
The Group made a net repayment of £30m on its bank facility in the year (see note 17), which is held at amortised cost, resulting in an 
outstanding balance of £30m at 31 December 2014.

employees (see note 18).
17. Financial instruments
Interest rate risk
The Group invests its cash in a range of cash deposit accounts with UK banks. Interest earned therefore closely follows movements  
in Bank of England base rates. A movement of 1% in this rate would result in a difference in annual pre-tax profit of £99,000  
(2013: £303,000) based on Group cash, cash equivalents and financial instruments at 31 December 2014. At the balance sheet date, 
£43,031,000 was invested with Lloyds Banking Group, this being the most invested with any one bank.

Cash and cash equivalents 0.75% 43,146 0.74% 38,935
Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in a financial loss to the Group. The 
Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with credit worthy counterparties as a means of mitigating risk of financial loss from 
default. The Group’s exposure is continuously monitored by the credit control team and finance management.
Of the top 75% of the Group’s providers by revenue, approximately 50% (2013: 50%) of these are UK quoted companies with the 
remainder being a mixture of larger UK independent companies and overseas owned or quoted companies. At the balance sheet date, 
the five largest trade receivables, by provider, accounted for 15% (2013: 19%) of the total trade receivables balance of £27,526,000 
(2013: £21,907,000) and the largest individual balance was £2,160,876 (2013: £2,045,484).
Fair values
The Group’s financial assets and liabilities are principally short-term in nature, and therefore their fair value is not materially different 
from their carrying value. The valuation method for the Group’s financial assets and liabilities can be defined as follows:
Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as 
prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
All financial assets and liabilities are valued at amortised cost. There have been no transfers between levels in the year.
The Directors consider that the carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded at amortised cost in the financial 
statements approximate their fair values.
Liquidity risk management
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves and banking facilities by continuously monitoring forecast and actual 
cash flows. Details of additional undrawn facilities that the Group has at its disposal to further reduce liquidity risks, are set out below:

18. Share-based payments
Share Incentive Plan scheme (SIP)
Upon listing, the Company granted £3,000 of ordinary shares at the price of £1.70 per ordinary share to each eligible employee free of 
charge. If an employee left within one year of listing, all of these ordinary shares were forfeit; between one and two years of listing, 
50% were forfeit; between two and three years of listing, 20% were forfeit; and after three years of listing, none were forfeit. 948,184 
shares were issued under the Share Incentive Plan scheme in 2007. On 31 July 2010 eligible employees became entitled to receive their 
allocation of free shares. 33,225 (2013: 18,409) shares have been withdrawn from the trust by employees during the period and a 
further 62,227 remain held in trust (2013: 95,452).
Long Term Incentive Plan scheme (LTIP)
During 2011, conditional awards were made over 3,945,803

Incentive Plan scheme to senior employees (‘2011 LTIPs’). Under this scheme, up to 50% of the shares were to vest at the end of a three 
year period dependent upon the absolute total shareholder return of the Company against a target set at the start of the period, and 
up to 50% of the shares were to vest at the end of a three year period dependent upon the total shareholder return of the Company 
relative to a comparator group of defined companies. On 9 March 2014 the awards vested in full following full achievement of the

actual awards made.
Sharesave scheme
During 2011, the Group established an HMRC approved savings scheme available to all employees. The scheme allows employees to 
save an amount of their net pay into a savings account each month, and at the end of the three year period, choose to either receive 
back their savings or use them to buy ordinary shares in the Company at a discounted exercise price. The exercise price for the 2011 
Sharesave scheme was fixed at 89.6p per share. On 1 November 2014 the awards vested, enabling participants to buy shares at the 
exercise price of 89.6p. The market price of a share on 1 November 2014 was 200.0p.
During 2012, the Group established a further HMRC approved scheme available to all employees, on the same basis as the scheme 
established in 2011. The exercise price for the 2012 Sharesave scheme was fixed at 107.6p per share.
During 2013, the Group established a further HMRC approved scheme available to all employees, on the same basis as the schemes 
established in 2011 and 2012. The exercise price for the 2013 Sharesave scheme was fixed at 137.5p per share.
During 2014, the Group established a further HMRC approved scheme available to all employees, on the same basis as the schemes 
established in 2011, 2012 and 2013. The exercise price for the 2014 Sharesave scheme was fixed at 149.5p per share.

1. Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The Financial Statements are prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom 
accounting standards.
No profit and loss account is presented for the Company as permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006. The loss after tax for the 
Company was £10,468,000 (2013: profit of £187,483,000). No dividends were received or paid in the year (2013: £200,000,000 received).
The auditor’s remuneration for audit and other services is disclosed in note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Company has taken the exemption in FRS 1 5(a) and consequently no cash flow statement is presented for the Company.
Use of estimates and judgements
The preparation of Financial Statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the 
application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from 
these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the 
period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
The most significant areas of estimation uncertainty, and areas where critical judgements are made in applying accounting policies that 
have a material effect on the Financial Statements, are listed below. The uncertainties encountered, and judgements made, are 
described in more detail in the accompanying notes:
• Note 4 contingent consideration and remuneration
Investments
Investments are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, including 
direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in profit or loss using the effective interest method and are added to the 
carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Intangible Assets
Goodwill
Goodwill is recognised on the acquisition of trade and assets, representing any excess of the fair value of the consideration given over 
the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired. The amounts are capitalised and written off on a straight-line basis over 
its useful economic life, which is five years. Provision is made for any impairment.
O t h e r	I n t a n g i b l e	A s s e t s
The cost of other intangible assets acquired in a business combination is fair value at the date of acquisition. Where this can be 
measured reliably after initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated 
impairment losses. All of the Company’s intangible assets have been identified as having finite useful lives. As such they are amortised 
on a straight-line basis over their useful economic life and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible 
asset may be impaired. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
Customer lists 3 years
For accounting purposes, customer lists have been identified separately. Customer lists allow the Company to undertake targeted 
marketing activities.
Share-based payment transactions
The Group’s share schemes allow certain Group employees to acquire ordinary shares in the Company. The fair value of share awards 
made is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at award date and 
spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the awards. The fair value of the awards made 
is measured using an option valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the awards were made. The 
amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of share awards expected to vest. Subsidiaries are recharged for 
the amount recognised as share-based payments relating to awards to their employees. The fair value of the recharge is recognised 
over the vesting period.
Dividends
Dividends receivable are recognised when the Company’s right to receive payment is established. Dividends payable to the Company’s 
shareholders are recognised as a liability and deducted from shareholders’ equity in the period in which the shareholders’ right to 
receive payment is established.

Financial Statements General Governance Overview Strategic Report
1. Accounting policies continued
Taxation
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the profit and loss account except to the 
extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates in force for the year, and any adjustment to 
tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is recognised, without discounting, in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation 
and accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required by FRS 19. The 
amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and 
liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date.
2. Share-based payments
The analysis and disclosures in relation to share-based payments are given in the Consolidated Financial Statements in note 18.
3. Staff numbers and cost
The average number of persons employed by the Company (including Directors) during the year, analysed by category, was as follows:

In addition to the above, these persons received a bonus of £1,538,000 (2013: £1,220,000) in relation to the reporting period.
4. Acquisitions
MoneySavingExpert.com (MSE)
On 21 September 2012, the Company purchased trade and certain assets from Martin Lewis for an initial consideration of £64.5m. The 
initial consideration of £64.5m was settled by a cash payment of £34.0m and £30.5m of equity represented by 22.1m ordinary shares in 
the Company. In addition, a contingent amount of up to £27.0m, payable in part against the achievement of certain non-financial 
metrics and in part at the discretion of the Company Board, is dependent on the continued employment of Martin Lewis for three years 
following the acquisition. Part of this payment is due to individuals who were employed by MSE at the point of acquisition and who 
remain in employment at the end of the earnout period, with the remainder payable to Martin Lewis.
The amounts due to MSE employees have been accounted for separate to the business combination as remuneration. The fair value of 
this element will be charged to the Company profit and loss account over the earnout period. At the balance sheet date the fair value of 
the contingent amount was £1.3m (2013: £1.7m) and £0.3m (2013: £0.6m) has been charged to the Company profit and loss account 
during the period as an employment expense.
In accordance with FRS 7 (Fair values in acquisition accounting) the fair value of the remaining contingent amount is included in the cost 
of acquisition. At the balance sheet date management have calculated the fair value of this as £18.5m (2013: £23.2m). This will be 
reviewed at each balance sheet date.
During 2014 the business contributed revenue of £14.8m (2013: £13.2m) and a net loss of £8.1m (2013: £8.8m) to the Company profit 
and loss account for the year. 90 MONEYSUPERMARKET ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2014

In September 2012, the Company purchased certain trade and assets from Martin Lewis for consideration of up to £91.5m with an 
initial consideration of £64.5m paid on completion, and contingent amounts of up to £27.0m payable, dependent in part on the 
achievement of certain non-financial performance criteria and in part at the Company’s discretion.
The acquisition gave rise to £90.0m of goodwill, which is being amortised over a period of five years.
As required by FRS 7 (Fair values in acquisition accounting), management have reviewed the fair value of the contingent amounts 
expected to be payable in the future at the balance sheet date. This has resulted in a £5.1m (2013: £0.8m) reduction in the fair value of 
the contingent amounts and a corresponding £5.1m (2013: £0.8m) reduction in goodwill recognised on acquisition.

 Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2011 3 Where we invest
Ashmore’s experienced team and local presence in the 
Emerging Markets allows wide coverage of the investible 
universe of close to 60 countries, the scope of which 
differs in emphasis between different asset classes.

Eastern Europe
Offered greatly contrasting 
macro dynamics and exposure to 
movements in global currencies 
via Euro proxies. Ashmore played 
Eastern European currencies in 
corporate and sovereign dollar 
debt through resources plays in 
former Soviet Republics.
  Ashmore investment ofﬁ ces
Istanbul, Turkey
Latin America
Strong growth was supported by 
tight commodity markets, FDI 
inflows, and a commitment in most 
countries to stable macro-economic 
policies. Upside was captured mainly 
through currency appreciation and 
tactical trading of local rates as well 
as corporate exposures and active 
management of high beta positions 
in external debt.
Asia Pacific
Increasingly turned to domestic 
demand-led growth amidst 
intra-regional reserve diversification 
to further extend the region’s 
already strong resilience to slower 
G10 growth. The region offered 
considerable upside to currency 
longs, special situations, and selective 
alpha calls in equities and local rates.
Middle East and Africa
Healthy external balances, low 
debt levels and strong sovereign 
support transformed Middle Eastern 
credits into attractive safe-haven 
destinations in volatile global 
markets. Quasi-sovereign and 
corporate exposures offered 
significant spread tightening and 
yield compression following the 
Nakheel scare of late 2009.

6 Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Significant progress 
in phase 2 this year
In terms of diversification, the 
acquisition of a dedicated emerging 
markets equity investment manager 
was a significant step toward our 
stated ambition of being the 
pre-eminent, specialist, emerging 
markets investment manager 
covering all asset classes. 
The further development of the 
Ashmore distribution platform and 
new product developments were  
also advanced and there is a much 
increased proportion of retail sourced 
AuM as a result. 
Distribution platform
The distribution team has been 
deepened with the headcount 
increasing to 32 from 21 a year earlier. 
The team is organised to provide 
expertise aligned to the specific needs 
of the institutional and retail client 
segments across the areas of business 
development, client/account 
management and service delivery. 
This structure is in place throughout 
our principal global distribution 
locations: 
 –London – Singapore
 – New York – Beijing
 –Tokyo – Melbourne
All organised as a single, centrally 
managed, but globally located team. 
Product

The investment themes into  
which all funds and accounts are 
organised have been reclassified 
going forward, driven by our desire 
to align the reporting and marketing

Our investment philosophy is primarily top down with an 
analytically driven selection process used for instrument 
selection. The style is active and macro-based with a strong 
focus on liquidity management.
We believe that the best way to 
gain exposure to strong medium 
and long-term trends in emerging 
markets is to employ specialist 
managers using an active 
approach. We believe our portfolio 
managers have the technical skills 
and an understanding of the asset 
class gained over many years of 
experience which fits in well with 
our rigorous and proven 
investment approach. 
We have developed our own 
investment process, largely 
unchanged since 1992 and based 
on long experience, which is 
rigorously followed. Our two  
main skills are strong macro-risk 
management and seeking  
value from special situations 
(incorporating distressed debt  
and private equity). Our portfolio 
construction approach is to create 
portfolios that we feel will best 
take advantage of long-term trends 
and structural changes in emerging 
markets and we express these 
views across all of the sub-themes 
we manage.

Chairman’s statement
“ The increasing inflow of new 
assets and the continuing levels 
of good investment performance 
are impressive testaments to the 
team’s success.”
I am very pleased to be able to report upon another year of real 
progress at Ashmore. 
In financial terms, we have reached new highs, in terms of AuM 
levels and profits. This has been achieved primarily through organic 
growth and also by acquisition, with AuM reaching a closing level of 
US$65.8 billion, an increase of 86% for the year. This has provided 
the foundation for the management fee income growth which, 
when combined with another good year for performance fees,  
has produced record income and profit levels.
Operationally I am extremely pleased to have seen the completion, 
during the period, of the acquisition of Emerging Markets 
Management LLC, a business similar to Ashmore’s, focused entirely 
on the emerging markets. The combination of their equities 
investment history with ours, principally in debt, has created the 
largest independent dedicated emerging markets multi-asset class 
investment manager. On behalf of the whole Board I should like to 
extend a warm welcome to the team at AshmoreEMM and we look 
forward to working with them and seeing the results from our new 
equities business.
As the Company’s business grows and prospers, the Board continues 
to give significant priority to ensuring that the highest standards of 
corporate governance and codes of best practice are followed 
throughout its worldwide operations.
Recognising the financial performance achieved in the year, taken 
together with the Board’s confidence in the prospects for future 
growth, the Directors are recommending a final dividend of 
10.34 pence per share for the year ended 30 June 2011 which, 
subject to shareholder approval, will be paid on 2 December 2011  
to shareholders on the register on 4 November 2011. This makes a 
total dividend for the year of 14.5 pence per share (FY2009/10: 13.0p).
Once again I would like to thank the whole Ashmore team for their 
tremendous efforts in achieving another successful year for the 
Company including the promotion into the FTSE-100 index effective 
next week. The increasing inflow of new assets and the continuing 
levels of good investment performance are impressive testaments to 
the team’s success and will allow the Company to build upon its 
existing strong and solid business. It is clear that the team’s complete 
focus on understanding and interpreting the events of the emerging 
markets is core to its success and this focus will continue with  
a clarity and certainty.
Global events in recent months and the continuing market volatility 
highlight the ongoing repositioning of emerging and developed 
world markets. I am confident that the Group, with its experience 
gained over many economic and market cycles, will continue to 
manage their investment strategies successfully as world events 
unfold. I also remain confident that the opportunity for the 
emerging markets is a significant one and that Ashmore is well 
positioned to capture it.

Chief Executive Officer’s statement
The financial year ended 30 June 2011 was broadly a good one  
for the Group. Ashmore achieved strong growth in assets under 
management (“AuM”), from both outperformance and net 
subscriptions, and resultant good financial performance in the 
management company. At the same time we managed to make 
progress with regard to our future growth plans by achieving some 
initial success in two major strategic plans – the development of  
a broader and deeper distribution platform and the acquisition  
of an emerging markets equities manager, Emerging Markets 
Management LLC (“EMM”) (see section below).
AuM development and financial performance 
During the year AuM increased by 86% from US$35.3 billion to 
US$65.8 billion, comprising net subscriptions of US$15.5 billion, 
investment performance of US$5.1 billion and US$9.9 billion 
through the EMM acquisition. 
Overall gross subscriptions totalled US$23.0 billion with the 
highlights including a very successful take-up of an Asian retail 
multi-strategy fund in the first half, good levels of subscriptions  
into local currency and external debt from a very broad range of 
investors during the second half, and further currency overlay 
inflows throughout the year.
The absolute levels of gross redemptions increased to US$7.5 billion 
(FY2009/10 US$3.7 billion) reflecting of course our absolute growth 
in scale, but also in part the increase in retail originated AuM where 
turnover rates are typically higher than from institutionally sourced 
assets. Additionally, the natural maturity profile of special situations 
investments has contributed somewhat as asset realisations from 
sales of investments at this point in the cycle returned US$0.5 billion 
capital to investors over the year from a total of US$3.4 billion 
invested at the start of it. However, all in all our firm wide 
redemption rate of 16% per annum remains relatively low.
Financial performance
Net revenue in the year increased by 17% to £333.8 million driven 
by a 31% growth in management fee income and a second 
successive year of record performance fees. We increased our 
operating cost base as intended in line with our growth plans with 
modest net headcount increases, before adding a further 70 people 
through the EMM acquisition. Variable compensation for the year,  
as a percentage of earnings before variable compensation, interest 
and tax (“EBVCIT”), remained exactly in line with our planned level 
of 19% (FY2009/10: 18%). As a result, our operating margins have 
reduced slightly to 72%, and as our target remains consistent – to 
maintain an industry leading operating margin whilst growing the 
scale of the business – we were delighted to record a fifth successive 
year in the “70s”. However, given our growing scale and the 
acquisition, which has historically operated on lower margins, we 
would expect this to finally enter the “60s” in the year to come,  
as long anticipated.
For more information on our ﬁnancial performance see 
p24 to p28
 
 
Strategic progress
This has been a year of significant progress in both distribution and 
product development and through the acquisition of the dedicated 
emerging markets equities asset manager, EMM. 
Last year we outlined the process underway in building a broader 
distribution platform, and this is an initiative on which we have 
continued to focus. Firstly, we have deepened the distribution team, 
increasing the headcount further from 21 to 32. The team is being 
reorganised to provide expertise aligned to the specific needs of the 
institutional and retail client segments with hiring across all areas  
of business development, client/account management and service 
delivery. This structure is in place throughout our principal global 
distribution locations – London, New York, Tokyo, Singapore, Beijing 
and Melbourne – with further dedicated distribution staff within  
our local asset management businesses in Brazil and Turkey – all 
organised as a single centrally managed, but globally located team. 
Added to their increased scale in headcount terms, our New York, 
Tokyo and Beijing operations have become further licensed during 
the year by local regulators providing us with the platform to 
increase our distribution from these centres to a wider range of 
investors. The coming year is expected to see us complete the 
reorganisation of our distribution platform.

In line with these developments, the period has seen the launch of 
many new funds and segregated accounts as conduits for asset 
raising and we expect this trend to continue this year. This included 
the launch in December 2010 of our first sponsored suite of US  
SEC registered 40 Act funds for US institutional and retail investors 
providing by the year end a full range of global emerging markets 
debt and equities funds. We aim to grow these by partnering with 
financial intermediaries including private banks, broker/dealers  
and other retail distributors and as we develop track records in  
these conduits, expect to see steady and significant assets from 
these channels.

Acquisition
In line with our stated strategy of increasing the scale of our public 
equities theme we announced in February our intention to acquire a 
62.9 per cent stake in EMM, a long established dedicated emerging 
markets equities manager, and following a strong level of support 
from their investors and our shareholders the transaction was 
completed on 31 May 2011. 
(1) Strategic rationale
Simply expressed, our stated ambition is to be the pre-eminent, 
specialist, emerging markets investment manager covering all asset 
classes. We recognise that our most significant gap remains a lack of 
scale within the equities theme and the acquisition of EMM provides 
this scale and proven investment capability in a dedicated emerging 
markets equities business. The transaction, with a proportion of  
the consideration in the form of an earnout over three years post 
completion, and the deepening of equity ownership across a 
broader number of their staff, was structured to align our interests 
with the team at EMM.
(2) Activities to date
The business was rebranded AshmoreEMM immediately  
on completion.
Clients have all received confirmation that this reflects our strategic 
objectives and the scale benefits of a larger house providing all 
investment management products to customers, whilst providing 
confidence in the continuity in investment philosophy and process at 
AshmoreEMM which will not change. Furthermore, AshmoreEMM  
has now become responsible for the investment management of all 
centrally managed equity products within the Group through a unified 
management structure and Investment Committee, incorporating all 
global equities investment professionals in the Group. 
The global Ashmore distribution team has now incorporated the 
existing AshmoreEMM product range on to our distribution platform 
and has ensured that the appropriate local account management 
engagement occurs for all clients and we have begun to develop 
products to take advantage of the Group’s wide range of existing 
clients. The physical integration of the AshmoreEMM business  
on to the core portfolio management and fund accounting systems 
used across the Group has also begun with the client relationship 
management and general ledger systems being the first to become 
fully integrated. We would expect to have completed the necessary 
level of systems integration with AshmoreEMM within the financial 
year to 30 June 2012. 
(3) Going forward.
Now we have to make it work. The investment managers have to 
outperform, distribution have to raise assets and technology and 
operations areas have to deliver the systems and process improvements 
needed. Understandably, the efforts involved in the migration over to 
new technology systems and processes will be significant, but we are 
very confident in the combined talents of the operations, technology 
and other support teams to deliver these projects between now and the 
end of the financial year to 30 June 2012. 
In line with the reorganisation undertaken we will report progress 
going forward within the equities theme of our global asset 
management business. 
“ A year of significant progress in 
both distribution and product 
development and through the

Chief Executive Officer’s statement continued
Theme reclassification
In line with the Group’s steady evolution, the investment themes 
into which all funds and accounts are organised have been 
reclassified going forward. This process is driven by our desire to 
align the reporting of our business in a manner with which the 
investment community is familiar and looks to allocate assets, as 
well as being satisfied that a particular theme attains critical mass 
and is not correlated in performance terms exactly with another 
existing theme. 
The first reclassification is the separate identification of a dedicated 
investment theme of emerging markets blended debt, where such 
mandates specifically combine external, local currency and corporate 
debt. This reflects the significant demand we see from institutional 
investors seeking returns benchmarked against blended indices 
comprised typically of external debt and local currency, with in  
some cases a corporate debt component. In such mandates, clients 
expect to see a blend of debt themes at all times, although of 
varying weighting, and we are measured against tailor-made 
blended indices reflecting a client’s strategic commitment to the 
three themes and their neutral view of the appropriate weighting  
of the three themes. The decisions we make are tactical variations 
around this. In contrast, going forward, the existing external debt 
theme contains funds and accounts benchmarked against a single 
sovereign emerging markets external debt index, although some 
mandates may include an ability to off index/cross-over invest into 
other themes such as local currency, corporate and special situations 
assets, with the firm’s flagship EMLIP fund having invested in this 
manner since its inception in 1992. Irrespective of the ability to 
invest across the debt themes, such accounts are usually majority 
external debt as allocations to other debt themes are always seen  
as tactical rather than strategic.
Secondly, we have reclassified the real estate and infrastructure 
funds organised currently within the “other” theme in combination 
with our special situations assets to create an overall alternatives 
theme. This recognises the similarity in nature of these strategies’ 
investments, in particular their long term and less liquid nature, and 
hence of fund structure and investment process across them,  
as well as reflecting how they are viewed by distributors and  
other intermediaries. 
Thirdly, given the scale of AuM within currency overlay/hedging,  
we have created a dedicated currency overlay/liquidity theme 
recognising the different nature and risk profile of these products 
which results in a different revenue margin profile. 
People and culture
In a period when dramatic economic events in the developed 
world were arising so frequently, given our exclusive focus on 
the emerging markets, our cultural sense of identity is, I believe, 
stronger than ever. 
The year has seen the recognition of our investment professionals’ 
performance with an award from European Pensions as Emerging 
Markets Manager of the Year, an Investment Excellence award from 
Global Investor for Emerging Markets Fixed Income and the Asian 
Investor Investment Performance Award for Best Emerging Markets 
Debt Manager. Given the significant increase in competition across 
emerging markets fund management as others progressively share 
our vision, it is particularly satisfying to be recognised for our 
ongoing outperformance in this way. I should like to thank everyone 
at Ashmore for the huge efforts that went into achieving the year’s 
investment, financial and operational results. Whilst the distribution 
and acquisition developments described in detail above were two 
key strategic targets undertaken in the year, there is much more 
hard work ahead of us all in order to allow us to take maximum 
advantage of the opportunity presented through these and other 
initiatives. In the year to come, and reflecting the investments we 
have made in both, we have to become a leading performer in 
equities, as well as maintain that in external, local currency and 
corporate debt, foreign exchange and alternatives, and our 
distribution team has to deliver upon raising assets across a broader 
range of products. I am confident that we will rise to these 
challenges and achieve further success across the Ashmore business.

Outlook
In the new financial year, unaudited annual performance fees for  
the funds with performance years ended 31 August 2011 were 
£18.8 million (August 2010: £43.5 million). 
The major recent economic events in the developed markets,  
Greek debt restructuring and the raising of the US debt ceiling,  
were predictable given the deleveraging still required to occur across 
the highly indebted developed world. What was not so obvious  
was the degree of political chaos and irresponsibility that ultimately 
led to the US rating downgrade. It is now no longer the emerging 
economies that should be described as the homes of default and 
fiscal irresponsibility, although some home country bias will of 
course persist amongst developed world politicians and investors. 
The global sell off resulting from these events has further reinforced 
the fundamental attractiveness across the emerging markets asset 
classes. Emerging markets external sovereign debt is now relatively 
safer than it was compared to US treasuries and as a result we 
anticipate spreads over those treasuries will tighten significantly in 
the coming year. Local currencies are set to rise against the US dollar 
in the next six months as we expect central banks to steadily use 
currency appreciation to control domestic inflation. The opportunity 
for generating alpha through active management continues in this 
area given the variations of monetary and exchange rate policy 
being undertaken by different countries reflecting their different 
cycles. Corporate debt in emerging markets is continuing to grow 
strongly as companies want tenor not available from bank lending 
and will increasingly turn to the bond markets. Our long developed 
expertise in this asset class should continue to provide strong 
investment outperformance.
Emerging markets equities valuations suggest the upcoming quarter 
may represent a good entry point with earnings forecast to grow 
strongly over the medium term. Our alternatives theme is one of 
much activity at present as we continue to realise investments, find 
some very interesting new opportunities as a result of tightening 
balance sheets worldwide, within our special situations funds, as 
well as making new investments in our real estate joint venture 
funds in China and Russia. At the same time we are looking to 
replicate our real estate and infrastructure initiatives in other emerging 
economies where demand for such assets is of course significant.
The key attributes for success in asset management are of course  
to consistently outperform and to raise and keep assets whilst 
running an effective and scaleable operational platform. Our strong 
investment performance has continued so far, but must be 
maintained, and we will also need to utilise our increased product 
breadth and global distribution capacity on an ever more robust 
technology and operations platform to succeed.
The opportunity for raising AuM from both developed country and 
emerging markets sources as they increasingly come to realise the 
attractiveness of the emerging markets asset classes over developed 
market alternatives, remains a compelling one. We want to be a 
major participant in both. To that end in the coming year, we would 
like to further develop our strategic plans in local asset management 
operations within the emerging markets themselves. 
There remains much to do to build our Company, but we are up for 
the challenge.

Key performance indicators
The Group’s progress towards achieving its strategic 
objectives is monitored by reference to a number of 
key performance indicators, as set out below:
Measure
 
Year end AuM/ 
Average AuM
Average net 
management fee 
margins (bps)
Definition 
The movement between opening and 
closing AuM provides a good indication 
of the overall success of the business 
during the period, both in terms of net 
subscriptions/redemptions and 
investment performance. 
The average AuM balance during the 
period, along with the average margins 
achieved, determine the level of 
management fee revenues. The AuM 
and margin trends are lead indicators 
for short-term profitability.
The average net management fee 
margin is calculated in US dollars,  
and is assessed after management fee 
rebates. The average is affected by 
changes in the product and investor 
mix. Certain themes attract higher  
gross fee levels, generally where 
investment return opportunities  
are higher.
Relevance to strategy
Ashmore’s strategy as a specialist 
emerging markets fund manager is to 
grow AuM; firstly by establishing the  
asset class, secondly by diversifying 
developed world capital and thirdly by 
mobilising emerging markets capital.
Ashmore aims to maintain high revenue 
margins reflecting the specialist 
characteristics of many of the investment 
themes it manages.

Ashmore has continued to grow its AuM 
from a diverse range of geographies and 
clients over the last five years. AuM from 
developed world investors has increased 
from US$26.4 billion to US$52.5 billion and 
that from emerging markets sources, initially 
principally from the largest pools of capital 
in those markets, from US$5.2 billion to 
US$13.3 billion.
The average management fee margin 
expanded from 2007 to 2009 largely due  
to the increase in the proportion of higher 
margin special situations AuM. Thereafter, 
business mix effects, including the increase 
in the scale of the larger segregated 
mandates and the growth in the lower 
margin currency overlay strategy, have 
reversed this. Ashmore has been successful 
over the long term in achieving investment 
outperformance and product innovation  
to enable it to maintain its high 
revenue margins. Business review Governance Financial statements

Operating  
profit margin
Variable compensation 
(VC)/EBVCIT
Year end  
headcount
The operating profit margin measures 
total operating profits against net 
revenues. Net revenues are calculated 
after deducting distribution costs and 
any rebates. Included within total 
operating costs are both fixed and 
variable personnel expenses, and  
other operating expenses.
The Group’s variable compensation 
represents the majority of the overall 
personnel expenses payable, and is 
assessed as a percentage of profit 
before variable compensation,  
interest and tax. The amount includes 
performance related bonuses, and 
share-based payments and associated 
social security costs.
The Group analyses its headcount by 
function (investment vs support) and by 
business (global asset management vs 
local asset management subsidiaries).
Ashmore’s stated strategy is to maintain 
an industry leading operating margin 
whilst growing the scale of the business.
The Group maintains a tightly controlled 
cost structure, with a low proportion of 
recurring costs and a large proportion of 
variable performance related costs. This 
enables the Group to achieve its targeted 
industry leading operating margin.
The year end headcount highlights the 
overall scalability of the business platform. 
The local asset management headcount  
is a vital part of the third phase of the 
Group’s strategy – mobilising emerging 
markets capital managed domestically.

Ashmore has maintained an operating 
margin above seventy per cent for each  
of the last five years.
The Group has consistently kept VC/EBVCIT 
at between 18% and 19% over the five 
years, except during FY2008/09 when it 
reduced it to 14% following the reduction 
in performance clearly demonstrating the 
strong alignment of variable compensation 
to returns experienced by fund investors 
and shareholders.
Over the last five years the headcount 
increases have been experienced in  
both the global asset management and 
local asset management businesses.  
These have demonstrated the expansion  
of the investment professional team, the 
development of a more robust support 
infrastructure and over the last three  
years the extensive developments in the 
distribution platform. Ashmore continues to achieve growth in assets 
under management underpinning its long term 
revenue and profitability growth.
Assets under management 
Over the last five years Ashmore has increased its AuM  
by 108%. In line with our historic experience over a 
number of cycles, the credit crisis in 2008 saw AuM 
redemptions peak and overall AuM levels fall by over  
one third. Thereafter, we have seen strong AuM growth 
momentum resume.
Assets under management bridge
During the year AuM increased by 86% from  
US$35.3 billion to US$65.8 billion, comprising net  
inflows of US$15.5 billion, investment performance  
of US$5.1 billion and AuM through the acquisition of 
EMM of US$9.9 billion. Subscriptions were received  
into the asian multi-strategy fund in the first half,  
currency overlay and blended debt themes throughout  
the year and into the external debt and local currency 
themes in the second half of the year.

Ashmore Group result
The Group recorded an operating profit before tax for the year 
ended 30 June 2011 of £239.4 million (FY2009/10: £209.3 million), 
giving rise to an operating margin of 72 per cent (FY2009/10:  
73 per cent); a profit before tax of £245.9 million (FY2009/10: 
£217.2 million); and a profit after tax of £190.2 million (FY2009/10: 
£160.6 million). The financial results are analysed further below.
Acquisition of Emerging Markets Management LLC
The Group acquired an effective 62.9 per cent stake in Emerging 
Markets Management LLC on 31 May 2011. This entity has 
subsequently been renamed AshmoreEMM LLC (“AshmoreEMM”).
The results of AshmoreEMM for the period from 1 June to 30 June 
are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income. AuM on acquisition, totalling US$9.9 billion, has been 
classified within the equities theme.
The detailed accounting for the acquisition is described below and  
in the accompanying note 27 to the accounts.
Assets under management and fund flows
During the year AuM increased by 86% from US$35.3 billion  
to US$65.8 billion, comprising net inflows of US$15.5 billion, 
investment performance of US$5.1 billion and AuM through 
acquisition of US$9.9 billion. 
The year saw strong levels of gross subscriptions overall, which 
totalled US$23.0 billion (FY2009/10: US$11.3 billion), particularly 
into the more liquid themes. Good levels of institutional 
subscriptions were received into the currency overlay and blended 
debt themes throughout the year. Subscriptions in external debt  
and local currency were strong in the second half in both Ashmore 
sponsored funds and segregated institutional mandates. Retail flows 
into the multi-strategy theme regained momentum in the final 
quarter – after a strong first half the Asian retail-focused fund 
temporarily reached capacity at the end of the second quarter. 
The absolute levels of gross redemptions increased to US$7.5 billion 
(FY2009/10: US$3.7 billion) in line with our absolute growth in 
scale. These levels of redemptions also partly reflect the increase  
in retail originated AuM where turnover rates are typically higher 
than institutionally sourced assets, even early in a fund life. 
Redemptions in special situations funds reflect monies being 
returned to investors as planned following realisations. 
New funds and accounts
The year saw further launches of new funds, which contributed 
significantly to the increase in AuM. Fourteen new public funds  
were launched, including six US 40 Act Funds within the local 
currency theme (Local Currency Fund, Local Currency Bond Fund), 
external debt theme (Sovereign Debt Fund), corporate debt theme 
(Corporate Debt Fund), blended debt theme (Total Return Fund)  
and equities theme (Equity Fund). A further five SICAV sub-funds 
were launched within the local currency theme (Investment Grade 
Local Currency Fund, Inflation Linked Bond Fund), corporate debt 
theme (Local Currency Corporate Debt Fund), blended debt theme 
(Total Return Fund) and overlay/liquidity theme (Sterling Liquidity 
Fund). In addition, within the Group’s local asset management 
subsidiaries, a Colombian infrastructure fund and a Brazilian 
long-short equities fund were also launched.
There were also eight new segregated and white label funds won 
during the year, within the external debt, local currency, corporate 
debt and blended debt themes. 22 Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2011

Subsequent quarterly AuM statements, interim and full year results will be reported on this revised basis.
As outlined in the Chief Executive Officer’s statement, in line with 
the Group’s long term evolution, the investment themes into which 
all funds and accounts are organised will be restructured going 
forward with three principal changes. 
Firstly, the creation of a dedicated investment theme of emerging 
markets blended debt, to combine external, local currency and 
corporate debt. This reflects the significant demand from investors, 
particularly to begin with larger segregated mandates, seeking 
returns benchmarked against blended indices comprised typically  
of external debt and local currency indices, with in some cases a 
corporate debt component. In contrast, the external debt theme 
that remains is where funds and accounts are benchmarked against 
a single sovereign emerging markets external debt index.
Secondly, capturing the real estate and infrastructure funds currently 
organised within the “other” theme and combining these with  
our special situations assets to create an alternatives theme which 
recognises the similarity of fund structure and investment process 
across these strategies as well as reflecting how they are viewed by 
distributors and other intermediaries. 
Thirdly, given the scale of AuM within currency overlay/hedging, the 
creation of a dedicated currency overlay/liquidity theme recognising 
the different nature of the investment process for these products 
which results in a different revenue margin profile.

AuM – as invested
Notwithstanding the changes to the theme classifications mentioned 
above, there remains an alternative analysis of AuM. Here we  
report “as invested” by underlying asset class which adjusts from 
“as classified by mandate” to take account of the allocation into 
underlying asset classes of multi-strategy, blended debt and, where 
possible, the currency overlay themes; and of cross-over investment 
from within certain external debt funds. This analysis demonstrates 
the greater significance of the local currency and corporate debt 
themes, which have both grown further in the period reflecting  
the allocation of funds invested into these themes. The charts  
below illustrate the impact of moving between the “as classified by 
mandate” and the “as invested” analysis as at 30 June 2011,

Investor profile – type and geography
The Group’s AuM are sourced from a diverse range of investors, 
which remain predominantly institutional in type (30 June 2011: 
84%; 30 June 2010: 92%), including pension providers, government 
agencies, banks and insurers. In line with the stated distribution 
strategy the period has seen a marked increase in funds where  
the underlying investor is more retail in nature. In these situations, 
typically the Group distributes the products via intermediaries such 
as private banks, brokers and other retail distributors. The largest of 
these products was the Asian retail multi-strategy fund, for which 
there were strong inflows in the first half and, after temporarily 
reaching capacity at the end of the second quarter, further inflows 
were received in the final quarter of the year.
Within the institutional investor profile, the most significant 
categories of investor remain government agencies, corporate and 
public pension plans which together account for 60% of all AuM. 
During the period, significant further fund inflows were received 
within the government category, which include those from emerging 
markets central banks, reserve managers and sovereign funds as part 
of the third phase of the Group’s strategy – mobilising emerging 
markets capital. The proportion of total assets managed for each of 
the major institutional investor types has remained reasonably stable 
measured from one year end to the other, with absolute increases  
in the corporate and public pensions categories being driven by the 
AshmoreEMM acquisition, since this type of client represented the 
majority of their AuM.

Investor geography
The region demonstrating the strongest growth in AuM overall is Asia Pacific, in line with strong inflows into the Asian retail-focused 
product and government category. There were also continued inflows from the Middle East. The AuM of US$9.9 billion arising from the 
acquisition of AshmoreEMM is largely sourced from developed markets, principally the US and Europe.

1.   The equities theme includes US$9.9 billion of AuM resulting from the acquisition of EMM which has a revenue margin of 65 bps. The AuM was only included in the 
theme for the final month of the period.
Management fees
Net management fee income in Sterling terms increased by 31%  
to £249.3 million as a function of increased levels of average AuM 
(FY2010/11: US$46.6 billion; FY2009/10: US$31.3 billion), stable 
GBP/USD foreign exchange rates (FY2010/11: 1.59 effective; 
FY2009/10: 1.58 effective) offset by a reduction in average 
management fee margins (FY2010/11: 86 bps; FY2009/10: 95 bps). 
This reduction has been partly driven by a change in the mix 
between the themes arising from strong inflows into the lower 
margin overlay/liquidity theme. This theme attracts a lower 
management fee reflecting the hedging rather than active 
management nature of the mandate. Margins on the acquired 
AshmoreEMM business were also below the average margin,  
which also contributed to the overall margin reduction. There was 
some reduction in margin in the external debt and local currency 
themes driven by some re-pricing of SICAV products during the  
year and the impact of tiered pricing on institutional mandates.
Performance fees
Total performance fee income for the year increased by 3% to  
£85.4 million (FY2009/10: £82.9 million) being earned across the 
investment themes. The majority of these fees were annual 
performance fees from funds having August, December and  
April year ends with the balance being made up of other annual 
performance fees and crystallised fees arising on redemptions  
during the period.
It is the Group’s policy to maintain a good balance between those 
funds where the Group is eligible to earn performance fees and 
those that generate revenues for the Group solely through 
management fees. At the year end the Group was eligible to earn 
performance fees on 38% of AuM (30 June 2010: 56%), or 43%  
of funds (30 June 2010: 63%). Of this AuM, 41%, whilst able to 
generate performance fees in the future, was ineligible to do so in 
FY2010/11 either as a result of such fees only being available at the 
end of the multi-year fund life, such funds not earning a fee in the 
performance year, or as a result of rebate agreements.  The following graphs demonstrate Ashmore’s 
investment outperformance in relation to both 
benchmarks and peers for each of the four 
principle composites in external debt, local 
currency, and equities for 1, 3, 5 and 10 year 
periods as at 30 June 2011.

from operations.”
Business review continued
Operating costs and operating margin
The Group has maintained its tightly controlled cost structure,  
with a low proportion of recurring costs and a large proportion of 
variable performance related costs. Headcount increased from  
165 at 30 June 2010 to 246 at 30 June 2011, of which 67 related  
to the AshmoreEMM acquisition. The increase in wages and salaries  
to £11.5 million (FY2009/10: £9.7 million) is in line with this 
headcount increase, taking into account the fact that the additional 
AshmoreEMM headcount is only included for one month. There has 
been continued recruitment to support the future growth of the 
business, particularly to support the development of our distribution 
and investment teams. 
Variable compensation costs represent the majority of overall 
personnel expenses and consist of performance related bonuses, 
share-based payments and associated social security costs.  
Variable compensation is calculated as a percentage of profit  
before variable compensation, interest and tax. The rate of variable 
compensation applied in the year to 30 June 2011 was increased  
to 19% (FY2009/10: 18%) reflecting the strong levels of AuM 
subscriptions and good investment performance.
The overall total for other expenses for the year to 30 June 2011 
was £22.9 million (FY2009/10: £18.1 million) with key drivers for the 
year-on-year rise being increased professional fees of £5.5 million 
(FY2009/10: £3.5 million), largely resulting from acquisition-related 
costs. Other costs have increased reflecting the inclusion of one 
month’s expenses for AshmoreEMM, together with the geographic 
expansion of the business and increased distribution activity. 
The five year trend graphs of total employee numbers and total 
employment costs are shown together below. These demonstrate 
how the Group’s operating model has been maintained during a 
period of significant growth:
Taxation 
The vast majority of the Group’s profit is subject to UK taxation.  
The Group’s effective tax rate for the year is 22.7% (FY2009/10: 
26.1%). The tax rate for the year is less than the blended UK 
corporation tax rate of 27.5% principally as a result of deductions  
in respect of share-based awards vesting during the period.
There is a £17.9 million deferred tax asset on the Group’s balance 
sheet at 30 June 2011, as a result of timing differences in the 
recognition of the accounting expense and actual tax deductions in 
connection with share price appreciation on share-based awards. 
Balance sheet management and cash flow
It is the Group’s policy to maintain a strong balance sheet in order  
to support regulatory capital requirements, to meet the commercial 
demands of current and prospective investors, and to fulfil 
development needs across the business which include funding 
establishment costs of distribution offices and local asset 
management ventures, seeding new funds, trading or investment  
in funds or other assets and other strategic initiatives.
As at 30 June 2011, total equity attributable to shareholders of  
the parent was £498.5 million, as compared to £370.5 million  
at 30 June 2010. There is no debt on the Group’s balance sheet.

Cash
The Group’s cash and cash equivalents balance increased by 
£24.6 million in the year to £369.0 million. The Group continues  
to generate significant cash from operations, totalling £253.4 million 
in the year (FY2009/10: £250.9 million), from which it paid the 
following significant items: £93.7 million in cash dividends 
(FY2009/10: £82.6 million); £62.1 million of taxation (FY2009/10: 
£52.9 million); £12.5 million for net new seed capital investments 
(FY2009/10: £26.9 million); £10.9 million for purchase of own 
shares to satisfy share awards (FY2009/10: £34.0 million); and 
£41.2 million to acquire EMM (FY2009/10: £2.3 million, in respect 
of an associate).
The Group’s cash balances are invested with the objective of 
optimising returns within a strict framework which emphasises 
capital preservation, security, liquidity and counterparty risk. Cash is 
invested only with institutions and liquidity funds with approved 
credit ratings of A or better. Typically during the financial year these 
have been short-term cash deposits with banks and investments in 
the Group’s S&P AAA rated money market liquidity funds. Based on 
the level of cash balances at 30 June 2011, a 1 per cent change in 
UK interest rates over the year would have a £3.7 million impact on 
the Group’s profit before tax.
Seed capital investments
As at 30 June 2011 the amount invested was £80.1 million (at cost), 
with a market value of £91.1 million. During the period the largest 
seed capital investments were in respect of the launch in December 
2010 of our first sponsored suite of US SEC registered 40 Act funds 
for US institutional and retail investors. In addition the period saw 
the seeding of further funds managed by the Group’s local asset 
management subsidiaries and associates. Some of the seed capital 
investments made in earlier periods were able to be recycled profitably.
Purchase of own shares
The Group purchases and holds shares through an Employee Benefit 
Trust (“EBT”) in anticipation of the exercise of outstanding share 
options and the vesting of share awards. At 30 June 2011 the EBT 
owned 24,555,042 (30 June 2010: 36,007,445) ordinary shares.
Acquisition of Emerging Markets Management LLC
The Group acquired an effective 62.9 per cent stake in Emerging 
Markets Management LLC on 31 May 2011. 
Ashmore paid initial consideration totalling £64.9 million  
(US$106.9 million). This consisted of £49.5 million (US$81.5 million) 
cash and £15.4 million (US$25.4 million) in Ashmore Group plc 
shares. Further consideration is potentially payable at December 
2011, December 2012 and December 2013, dependent on the  
level of management fee revenues. This has been treated as 
contingent consideration on acquisition and valued at £28.1 million 
(US$46.1 million). Total consideration is £93.0 million  
(US$153.0 million).
On acquisition, 19.2% of AshmoreEMM shares were fully vested 
and held by the employees and management of AshmoreEMM. 
Employees and management also held unvested shares representing 
17.9%. As the unvested shares have performance conditions related 
to continued employment, these are accounted for as share-based 
payments in accordance with IFRS 2 Share-Based Payment, which 
will result in an annual charge to the income statement in the period 
to vesting of £5.4 million (US$8.6 million).
Goodwill and intangible assets
At the acquisition date, AshmoreEMM had tangible net assets of 
£13.8 million (US$22.7 million) with intangible assets valued at 
£41.3 million (US$68.0 million). The principal intangible assets 
identified were fund management relationships £39.5 million 
(US$65.0 million) and trade name £1.8 million (US$3.0 million). 
Estimated useful lives of 8 years and 10 years respectively were 
ascribed to these assets. The non-controlling interest was valued  
at £12.9 million (US$21.2 million) giving rise to goodwill of  
£50.8 million (US$83.5 million) recognised on the acquisition date. 
The goodwill and intangible assets are denominated in US dollars, 
the functional currency, and were translated into Sterling at the 
exchange rate at the date of the transaction (GBP1.00:1.6448).
Deferred acquisition costs (DAC)
As in prior years, the Group carries on its balance sheet unamortised 
deferred acquisition costs of £6.9 million (FY2009/10: £9.3 million) 
in respect of the launch of Ashmore Global Opportunities Limited 
(“AGOL”), a publicly listed closed-ended investment company 
incorporated in 2007. 
During 2011, the shares of AGOL have traded at a discount to the 
net asset value of its balance sheet and, as previously, where this 
discount is in excess of 10 per cent for 12 consecutive months, an 
EGM is required to consider whether AGOL should be wound up. 
The EGM was held on 18 April 2011, with over 92 per cent of the 
voting shareholders voting against winding up. Should the discount 
continue to exceed 10 per cent for a further 12 consecutive months, 
an EGM will once again be required.
Should, as a result of any future vote, AGOL be wound up, this 
would not result in an acceleration or recognition of these deferred 
acquisition costs. An early termination of AGOL would instead 
trigger the full recovery of the initial set-up costs including the 
portion of £7.5 million amortised to 30 June 2011.
Foreign exchange management
The Group’s long-standing policy is to hedge up to two-thirds of the 
foreign exchange exposure in connection with its net management 
fee cash flows, using either forward foreign exchange contracts or 
options for up to two years forward with at least 25% coverage for 
the first 12 month period. The GBP/USD exchange rate to 30 June 
2011 ranged between GBP1.00:1.4945 – 1.6707USD.
The Group experienced an overall foreign exchange loss for the  
year to 30 June 2011 of £7.4 million (FY2009/10: £7.0 million gain), 
comprising a loss of £9.2 million (FY2009/10: gain of £11.8 million) 
on the translation of non-Sterling denominated assets and liabilities, 
partially offset by a gain of £1.8 million (FY2009/10: loss of  
£4.8 million) on realised and unrealised hedging transactions. 
The level of foreign exchange hedges in place at 30 June 2011 is 
US$215.0 million. This consists of options (US$154.5 million) and 
forwards (US$60.5 million) in respect of FY2011/12 and FY2012/13 
net management fee cash flows. Of the hedges, US$161.5 million 
relate to FY2011/12 and US$53.5 million relate to FY2012/13.
The options effectively operate as a collar and, together with the 
forwards, protect the Sterling value of US$215.0 million of the 
Group’s forecast management fee revenue cash flows for FY2011/12 
and FY2012/13 from being impacted by currency movements 
(outside the contracted ranges for the collars).  28 Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2011
Business review continued
The options and forwards have been marked-to-market at the year 
end rate of GBP1:1.6053USD. 
As designated hedges the mark-to-market movement in the value of 
the options and forwards will be taken through reserves, until such 
time as they and the associated hedged revenues mature, so long as 
the hedges are assessed as being effective. If assessed as ineffective, 
the mark-to-market of the options and forwards will be taken 
through the income statement.
Regulatory capital
As a UK listed asset management group, Ashmore is subject to 
regulatory supervision by the Financial Services Authority (FSA)  
under the Prudential Sourcebook for Banks, Building Societies and 
Investment Firms. The Group has one UK-regulated entity, Ashmore 
Investment Management Limited (“AIML”), on behalf of which half 
yearly capital adequacy returns are filed. AIML held surplus capital 
resources relative to its requirements at all times during the period 
under review.
Further, since 1 January 2007, the Group has been subject to 
consolidated regulatory capital requirements, whereby the Board is 
required to assess the degree of risk across the Group’s business,  
and hold sufficient capital against these.
The Board has assessed the amount of Pillar II capital required to 
cover such risks as £59.7 million. Thus, given the considerable 
balance sheet resources available to the Group, the Board is  
satisfied that the Group is adequately capitalised to continue its 
operations effectively. 
Further information regarding the Group’s capital adequacy status 
can be found in the Group’s Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment 
Process (ICAAP) and Pillar III disclosures, which are available on our 
website at www.ashmoregroup.com.
Risk
Risk is inherent in all businesses and is therefore present within the 
Group’s activities. The Group seeks to effectively identify, monitor 
and manage each of its risks and actively promotes a risk awareness 
culture throughout the organisation. The ultimate responsibility for 
risk management rests with the Board. However, from a practical 
perspective some of this activity is delegated.
The key risks, their mitigants, and their delegated owners are set out 
on the facing page for each of the four risk categories that Ashmore 
considers most important: strategic and business, investment, 
operational, and treasury – with reputational risk being a common 
characteristic across all four categories.
During the year the Group’s risk control framework has been 
enhanced to take account of changing business and market 
conditions. This included reviews conducted by the Group’s Internal 
Audit function. There has also been specific focus on the further 
refinement of the Group Risk Matrix, which seeks to identify the key 
risks to the Group, as well as current mitigants and forward-looking 
action plans.
Risk management and control
Risk management and control is one element of the Group’s overall 
system of internal controls within its corporate governance 
framework – incorporating risk, compliance and internal audit. 
Further details of the Group’s internal control environment are 
described in the corporate governance report on pages 37 to 41.
Dividend
In recognition of the financial performance during the period, and 
our confidence in the Group’s future prospects, the Directors are 
recommending a final dividend of 10.34 pence per share for the 
year ended 30 June 2011 which, subject to shareholder approval, 
will be paid on 2 December 2011 to all shareholders who are on  
the register on 4 November 2011. 
An interim dividend for the six-month period to 31 December  
2010 of 4.16 pence (2009: 3.66 pence) was paid on 4 April 2011. 
Together, these result in a full-year dividend of 14.5 pence (2010: 
13.0 pence), an increase of 11.5%.

Directors’ conflicts of interests
Since October 2008, the Companies Act 2006 has imposed upon 
directors a new statutory duty to avoid unauthorised conflicts of 
interest with the Company. The Company has adopted revisions  
to its Articles of Association which enable Directors to approve 
conflicts of interest and which also include other conflict of interest 
provisions. The Company has implemented processes to identify 
potential and actual conflicts of interest. Such conflicts are then 
considered for approval by the Board, subject, where necessary,  
to appropriate conditions.
Executive Directors do not presently hold any external appointments 
with any non-Ashmore related companies.

the Company must also comply with the Listing Rules and the 
Disclosure and Transparency Rules issued by the United Kingdom 
Listing Authority (UKLA). Listed companies are expected to comply 
as far as possible with the Financial Reporting Council’s UK

Creditor payment policy
The Group’s policy and practice in the UK is to follow its suppliers’ 
terms of payment and to make payment in accordance with those 
terms subject to receipt of satisfactory invoicing. Unless otherwise 
agreed payments to creditors are made within 30 days of receipt of 
an invoice. At 30 June 2011, the amount owed to the Group’s trade

auditors
The Directors who held office at the date of approval of this 
Directors’ report confirm that, so far as they are each aware, there is 
no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditors are 
unaware, and each Director has taken all the steps that they ought 
to have taken as Directors to make himself or herself aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s 
auditors are aware of that information.
Resolutions will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting to 
reappoint KPMG Audit Plc as auditors and to authorise the Directors 
to agree their remuneration. Note 6 to the financial statements sets 
out details of the auditors’ remuneration.
2011 Annual General Meeting

business risks successfully. Further information regarding the Group’s 
business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future 
development, performance and position is set out on pages 14 to 29.
After making enquiries, the Directors are satisfied that the Company 
and the Group have adequate resources to continue to operate  
for the foreseeable future and confirm that the Company and the 
Group are going concerns. For this reason they continue to adopt 
the going concern basis in preparing these financial statements.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and 
the Group and parent company financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and parent 
company financial statements for each financial year. Under that  
law they are required to prepare the Group financial statements in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable law and 
have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements on 
the same basis.
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the Group and parent company and of their 
profit and loss for that period. In preparing each of the Group and 
parent company financial statements, the Directors are required to:
 – select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
 – make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
 – state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs 
as adopted by the EU; and
 – prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the 
parent company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the parent company and enable them to ensure 
that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. 
They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are 
reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group  
and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also 
responsible for preparing a Directors’ report, Directors’ remuneration 
report and corporate governance statement that comply with that 
law and those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation  
in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement of the Directors in respect 
of the annual financial report
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
 – the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the 
applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view  
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole; and
 – the Directors’ report includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the issuer and 
the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties 
that they face.

12 September 2011 Business review Governance Financial statements
 Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2011 35
The Group recognises the importance of corporate social 
responsibility (CSR) incorporating transparency, fairness, 
accountability and integrity, and believes that these principles are 
fundamental to the Group’s operations. The Group continues to 
monitor developments in all relevant areas of CSR, including 
environmental management, employees, health and safety, suppliers 
and the community to ensure that it meets best practice and sees 
CSR as a continually evolving process. 
Investment
The Group believes that its reputation as an ethical, trustworthy 
provider of investment services is essential to its core purpose of 
helping its clients to build their financial security. Ashmore seeks  
to establish and maintain long-term relationships with its clients  
and intermediaries. The Group believes this to be a fundamental  
pre-requisite for the growth of the business. 
Ashmore’s Board of Directors seeks to maintain a strong corporate 
culture employing high standards of integrity and fair dealing in the 
conduct of the firm’s activities, compliance with both the letter and 
the spirit of relevant laws and regulations, and standards of good 
market practice in all jurisdictions where the firm’s business is  
carried out. The Board’s aim is to enable Ashmore to demonstrate 
that the firm is fit and proper to undertake its business, to  
safeguard the legitimate interests of Ashmore clients and protect 
Ashmore’s reputation.
Ashmore believes that social, ethical and environmental (SEE) criteria 
tend to be focused primarily on equity investing because of the 
influence which shareholder interests are able to exert on the 
management of a particular company. In May 2011 Ashmore 
acquired majority ownership of Emerging Markets Management  
LLC, a long established US-based investment management firm 
focusing entirely on the emerging markets public equities theme. 
AshmoreEMM believes that the way in which companies manage 
their relations with stakeholders can have an impact on business 
performance. These stakeholders encompass employees, local 
communities, wider society, governments, supply chains, customers 
and the natural environment. There is a wide range of environmental 
and social issues which could be relevant for a company depending 
on the industry in which it operates and its specific business profile. 
Environmental and social issues can become new sources of risk  
or opportunity for companies, and a company’s ability to respond  
to these issues can therefore act as an early signal of long-term 
competitiveness. To the extent practicable, AshmoreEMM monitors 
the environmental, social and corporate governance performance  
of the companies in which they invest through ongoing company 
visits and other information channels. Generally, companies disclose 
corporate governance practices through corporate policies, stock 
market listings (for example, Brazil has a separate category for 
companies committed to state of the art corporate governance 
practices), and market press releases. They disclose environmental 
and social practices in annual reports and other reports to investors.
Ashmore believes that good corporate governance helps to align the 
interests of Company management with those of its shareholders. 
Where possible, we seek to maintain constructive dialogue with 
Company management. We consider whether companies have 
corporate governance frameworks that are in line with applicable 
country codes and serve shareholder interests. Views on corporate 
governance do not constrain investment decisions, however; often 
the best investments can be in companies where we anticipate an 
improvement in corporate governance practices. In many 
jurisdictions, and to the extent consistent with our fiduciary duty  
to our clients, we exercise our voting rights as a means to signal  
our views to Company management. We have developed detailed 
guidelines to guide our voting decisions, but will, as appropriate, 
consider resolutions on a case-by-case basis taking into account all 
available information. 
Ashmore’s special situations business involves its funds taking 
significant controlling stakes in investee companies and in such 
circumstances Ashmore is in a position to positively engage with the 
management of these companies. In many cases Ashmore believes  
it to be beneficial to its investors to be proactive in promoting the 
Ashmore brand locally by improving the livelihoods of the employees 
in the companies where the Group has a controlling stake. 
Ashmore aims to avoid investing in companies that do not:
 – respect human rights; and
 – comply with local environmental, ethical or social legislation.
Ashmore does not invest in companies that manufacture or  
trade arms.
Ashmore also aims to ensure that any investments which it makes 
comply with the relevant industry standards and best practice, treat 
their employees fairly, have active community programmes and 
operate with sensitivity to the environment. Ashmore has made 
investments in a number of renewable energy projects in different 
countries including hydro-electricity, geothermal energy and 
sugar-based ethanol production, which reflect its overall approach  
to combining ethical investing with sound business practice on 
behalf of clients. 
Additionally, Ashmore funds and segregated accounts each  
have specific investment mandates which set out the parameters  
for investment which may include requirements to screen for 
geographic, sector and stock-specific restrictions. Stock-specific 
restrictions may include securities which meet clients’ own  
CSR criteria. 
The majority of our assets continue to be invested in either external 
debt (the majority of which is sovereign) or local currencies. In the 
case of external debt investments, our ability to have an influence  
is generally limited to a decision whether or not to invest, however, 
at a country level we believe that we are able to exert an influence 
through dialogue with governments and central banks.
Details on how, and the extent to which, Ashmore complies with the 
principles of the UK Stewardship Code are described separately on 
the Ashmore website at: www.ashmoregroup.com.
The Ashmore Foundation
Consistent with the Group’s commitment to responsible corporate 
citizenship, the Ashmore Foundation was created in 2008 and is 
funded by personal financial contributions from employees of the 
Group. The Foundation reflects Ashmore’s overall philosophy that 
we can and should make a positive difference in communities  
in which Ashmore operates, in countries which contribute to 
Ashmore’s income and profitability. The Foundation therefore  
seeks to provide financial grants to worthwhile causes within the 
emerging markets in order to enhance human welfare, opportunities 
and capabilities, particularly for those that are vulnerable and at the 
lower end of the socio-economic spectrum. 
Corporate social responsibility 36 Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2011
The Foundation’s grant-making policy is wide-ranging but has  
a particular focus on education and healthcare, the former in 
particular being seen as the best way to help the long-term 
self-development of emerging markets countries. The Foundation  
is also interested in supporting sustainable livelihoods and social 
enterprise as a method of reducing poverty in a manner that 
empowers people to help themselves.
Regular updates on the activities of The Foundation are published  
on The Ashmore Foundation section of our website at

Employees
At year end Ashmore employed 246 people in eleven countries 
worldwide. Ashmore’s people have always been its most important 
asset, at the heart of everything it does. Ashmore has many talented 
people and it remains a priority to develop, manage and retain  
this talent in order to deliver the potential of the organisation. 
Ashmore wants to be an employer which the most talented people 
aspire to join wherever it operates.
Ashmore seeks to ensure that its workforce reflects, as far as 
practicable, the diversity of the many communities in which it is 
located. Ashmore also recognises the diverse needs of its employees 
in managing the responsibilities of their work and personal lives,  
and believes that achieving an effective balance in these areas is 
beneficial to both the Company and the individual. 
Ashmore encourages employees to act ethically and to clearly 
uphold the standards of practice which its clients have come to 
expect. It also means ensuring that its employees understand the 
strategic aims and objectives of the Group and are clear about their 
role in achieving them.
The Group recognises that the involvement of its employees is key  
to the future success of the business and adopts a practice of 
keeping employees informed on significant matters affecting them, 
via email and in meetings arranged for the purpose. The Group has 
consistently operated a remuneration strategy that recognises both 
corporate and individual performance.
The Group is also committed to following good practice in 
employment matters, recognising the part this plays in attracting 
and retaining staff. The Group promotes the importance of high 
ethical standards to all employees and staff have the opportunity to 
voice any concerns they may have, either direct with management 
or on a confidential basis via the whistle-blowing process.
Equal opportunities
The Group is committed to ensuring that all employees are treated 
fairly and with dignity and respect. This commitment is reflected in 
the Staff Handbook that all employees receive on joining. 
The policies and practices in place within the Group to deter acts  
of harassment and discrimination are regularly monitored. 
It is the Group’s policy that no employee shall be treated less 
favourably on the grounds of their age, sex, sexual orientation,  
race, religion, nationality or marital status or on the grounds of 
disability. This policy applies, without limitation, to promotion, 
training, placement, transfer, dismissal, remuneration, grievance  
and disciplinary procedures and decisions. This policy also applies  
to persons from outside the workplace and the treatment of 
contract workers.
Health and Safety
The Group has in place a global health and safety policy which can 
be accessed by all staff via an internal database. The aim of this 
policy is to provide both staff and visitors with a safe and healthy 
working environment. The Group is committed to adhering to  
the high standards of health and safety set out by its policies and 
procedures and to providing training as necessary.
Environment
As an investment manager, Ashmore has a limited direct impact 
upon the environment and there are few environmental risks 
associated with the Group’s activities. Ashmore moved into its 
premises at 61 Aldwych, London in May 2008 and occupies a  
single floor of approximately 19,000 square feet in a nine storey 
multi-tenanted building. Water and gas supplied into the building 
are metered centrally by the building management and costs 
apportioned to each tenant pro-rata according to floor occupancy. 
As part of its ongoing commitment to the environment, Ashmore 
throughout its operations has adopted policies and programmes to 
promote energy conservation and the avoidance of waste through  
a number of initiatives, such as the recycling of paper, glass and 
other waste and the use of “green” energy. Electricity usage is 
separately monitored by floor with renewable energy accounting  
for a minimum of 10 per cent of supply. Energy-efficient lighting  
is installed in the building with sensors which turn lights off when 
no movement is detected. The building has received an Energy 
Performance Certificate with an Asset Rating of 98. Utilities are  
not monitored by the building management in terms of carbon 
emissions as no accurate data is available on the consumptive quality 
of each item. The registration and reporting obligations under the 
Carbon Reduction Commitment (CRC) Energy Efficient Scheme do 
not apply to the Company.
Ashmore endeavours to make maximum use of available technology 
such as video conferencing; however, its business model as an 
investor in emerging markets inevitably requires that its investment 
professionals and other members of staff travel frequently to these 
countries to assess and monitor opportunities. 
Ashmore provides obsolescent computers to Computer Aid 
International (“Computer Aid”), a UK registered charity that aims  
to reduce poverty through practical ICT solutions, and has in place 
recycling programmes for waste paper, photocopier toners and 
other disposable materials.
Ashmore has published a separate corporate responsibility report 
which can be found on its website at www.ashmoregroup.com.

Directors
The Board of Directors comprises two Executive Directors and four 
Non-executive Directors. The two Executive Directors are Mark 
Coombs, the Chief Executive Officer, and Graeme Dell, the Group 
Finance Director. The Non-executive Directors are Michael Benson, 
Chairman; Nick Land, Senior Independent Director; Jonathan 
Asquith and Melda Donnelly. All Directors served throughout  
the year. 
The Board has a schedule of matters specifically reserved to it for 
decision and approval, which include, but are not limited to:
 – the Group’s long-term commercial objectives and strategy;
 – major acquisitions, disposals and investments;
 – the Group’s annual and interim reports and financial statements;
 – interim dividend and recommendation of final dividend;
 – annual budgets and forecast updates;
 – significant capital expenditure; and
 – the effectiveness of internal controls. 
The roles of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are separate, 
clearly defined and have been approved by the Board. The Chairman 
is responsible for the effective conduct of the Board, while the Chief 
Executive Officer is responsible for execution of strategy and for the 
day-to-day management of the Group. 
In considering Non-executive Director independence, the Board has 
taken into consideration the guidance provided by the Combined 
Code. The Board considers Michael Benson, Nick Land, Jonathan 
Asquith and Melda Donnelly to be independent. Nick Land is the 
Senior Independent Director.
During the year under review the Group complied with the 2010 
Code requirement that at least half of the Board consist of 
independent Directors (excluding the Chairman).
Biographical details of the Directors are given on page 30. 
The Board met six times during the year to review financial 
performance and strategy and to follow the formal schedule of 
matters reserved for its decision. Comprehensive Board papers, 
comprising an agenda and formal reports and briefing papers,  
are sent to Directors in advance of each meeting. Throughout  
their period in office, Directors are continually updated by means  
of written and verbal reports from senior executives and external 
advisors on the Group’s business, and the competitive and  
regulatory environments in which it operates, as well as on legal, 
corporate governance, corporate social responsibility and other 
relevant matters.
In addition to its formal business, the Board received a number of 
briefings and presentations from executive management during the 
year covering a wide range of topics across the range of the Group’s 
business. All Directors have access to independent professional 
advice, if required, at the Company’s expense as well as to the 
advice and services of the Company Secretary. New Directors 
appointed to the Board will receive advice as to the legal and  
other duties and obligations arising from the role of a director of  
a UK listed company within a full, formal and tailored induction 
programme. The Company Secretary, under the direction of the 
Chairman, is responsible for maintaining an adequate continuing 
education programme, reminding the Directors of their duties and 
obligations on a regular basis, ensuring good information flows 
between the Board, its committees and management and assisting 
with Directors’ continuing professional development needs. 
The Company’s Nominations Committee considers the appointment 
and replacement of Directors subject to the rules set out in the 
Articles, a summary of which is set out below. 
Under the Articles, the minimum number of Directors shall be two 
and the maximum shall be nine. Directors may be appointed by  
the Company by ordinary resolution or by the Board. A Director 
appointed by the Board must offer himself for election at the next 
Annual General Meeting of the Company following his appointment 
but he is not taken into account in determining the Directors or the 
number of Directors who are to retire by rotation at that meeting. 
The Directors to retire by rotation must be those who held office at 
the time of the two preceding Annual General Meetings and did not 
retire at either of them or if they have held office with the Company 
for a continuous period of nine years or more at the date of the 
Annual General Meeting. The office of Director shall be vacated in 
other circumstances, including where (i) that Director resigns or is 
asked to resign; (ii) they are or have been suffering from mental ill 
health; (iii) they are absent without permission of the Board from 
meetings of the Board for six consecutive months; (iv) they become 
bankrupt or compound with their creditors generally; or (v) they  
are prohibited by law from being a Director. Notwithstanding these 
provisions the Board has adopted provision B.7.1 of the 2010 Code 
and the Directors will therefore all retire and seek re-election at the 
Annual General Meeting on 27 October 2011.
Powers of the Directors
Subject to the Company’s Articles, the Companies Acts and any 
directions given by the Company by special resolution, the business 
of the Company is managed by the Board, who may exercise all 
powers of the Company, whether relating to the management of 
the business of the Company or not.
Corporate governance report
In May 2010 the FRC published a new edition of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code (“the 2010 Code”) 
which applies to financial years beginning on or 
after 29 June 2010. 
The Company has been in compliance with the 
predecessor Combined Code since Admission to 
listing on the London Stock Exchange on 17 October 
2006, except where the Directors consider that in 
particular limited circumstances, departure may be 
justified and explained. 
No departures from the 2010 Code occurred during 
the year under review.
This report describes the Company’s corporate 
governance arrangements, explaining how it has 
applied the principles of the Combined Code.

Annual performance evaluation
The Board has established a formal process, led by the Chairman 
and assisted by the Company Secretary, for the annual evaluation  
of the performance of the Board, its appointed committees and 
each Director, to ensure that they continue to act effectively and 
efficiently and to fulfil their respective duties, and to identify any 
training requirements. In doing so the Board has concluded that 
both the Board and its committees are functioning effectively.
Meetings were held between the Chairman and each individual 
Director in which issues and developments over the year were 
discussed and performance was considered by reference to the 
objectives of the Board and its committees. Each Director also 
completed a formal questionnaire and responses were collated  
by the Company Secretary. The results and issues raised were 
subsequently discussed by the Board together with progress against 
last year’s evaluation. The Board also evaluated the Chairman’s 
performance and this process was led by the Senior 
Independent Director.

invited to attend meetings of such Committees as necessary.
Board committees
The Board has appointed Audit, Remuneration and Nominations 
Committees to assist in the execution of its duties.
All of these committees operate within written terms of reference, 
which are reviewed annually. In order to strengthen and enhance the 
Audit Committee’s oversight on risk matters the terms of reference 
and agenda for the committee were revised from September 2011, 
and the committee was changed to the Audit and Risk Committee in 
order to reflect this role. The terms of reference of the Remuneration 
Committee have also been revised to give due regard to the 
provisions and recommendations of the FSA’s Remuneration Code. 
The chairman of each committee reports regularly to the Board. 
Each of the committees is authorised, at the Company’s expense, to 
obtain external legal or other professional advice to assist in carrying 
out its duties. Only the members of each committee are entitled to 
attend its meetings but others, such as senior management and 
external advisors, may be invited to attend as appropriate.
Current membership of the committees is shown in the relevant 
sections below. The composition of these committees is reviewed 
annually, taking into consideration the recommendations of the 
Nominations Committee.
Audit Committee
During the year under review the Audit Committee comprised 
the following Non-executive Directors and was fully compliant 
with the Combined Code:
Nick Land (Chairman)  
Melda Donnelly

Nick Land, Jonathan Asquith and Melda Donnelly had and have 
recent and relevant commercial and financial knowledge and 
experience to satisfy the provisions of the Combined Code.  
Nick Land and Melda Donnelly are Chartered Accountants and 
Jonathan Asquith has previously served as Chief Financial Officer  
of Schroders plc and Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.
A report on the activities of the Audit Committee is set out below.

made, are fair to the individual and the Company, that failure is 
not rewarded and that the duty to mitigate loss is fully recognised.
Details of the activities of the Remuneration Committee are set out

The terms of reference for the Committee take into account the 
requirements of the Code and are available for inspection at the

The terms of reference for the Nominations Committee include: 
 – reviewing the structure, size and composition (including the skills,

 – reviewing annually the time required from each Non-executive 
Director, using performance evaluation to assess whether the

work, taking into account the challenges and opportunities facing 
the Company and what skills and expertise are needed on the 
Board in the future; and

Directors receive a formal letter of appointment setting out  
clearly what is expected of them in terms of time commitment,

During the year the activities of the Nominations Committee have 
included reviewing the requirements for potential independent

for re-election of Directors at the Annual General Meeting, and 
reviewing its terms of reference. The number of Nominations 
Committee meetings and their attendance by the Directors are  
set out in the table on page 38.
Relations with shareholders
The Company places great importance on communication with its 
investors and aims to keep shareholders informed by means of 
regular communication with institutional shareholders, analysts  
and the financial press throughout the year. 
Annual and interim reports and trading updates are widely 
distributed to other parties who may have an interest in the Group’s 
performance. These documents are also made available on the 
Company’s website where formal regulatory information service 
announcements are also posted. The Chief Executive Officer and 
Group Finance Director make regular reports to the Board on 
investor relations and on specific discussions with major shareholders 
and the Board receives copies of all research published on the Company. 
The 2011 Annual General Meeting will be attended by all Directors, 
and the Chairmen of the Audit, Nominations and Remuneration 
Committees will be available to answer questions. Private investors 
are encouraged to attend the Annual General Meeting. 40 Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2011
Corporate governance report continued
The Senior Independent Director is available to shareholders if  
they have concerns which contact through the normal channels  
of Chairman, Chief Executive Officer or Group Finance Director  
has failed to resolve or for which such contact is inappropriate.  
The Company continues to offer major shareholders the opportunity 
to meet any or all of the Chairman, the Senior Independent Director 
and any new Directors. 
The Group will announce via a regulatory information service the 
number of proxy votes cast on resolutions at the Annual General 
Meeting and any other general meetings.
Internal control and risk management
In accordance with the principles of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code 2010, the Board is ultimately responsible for the Group’s  
risk management and internal control systems and for reviewing 
their effectiveness. Such systems and their review are designed to 
manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives, and can only provide reasonable and not absolute 
assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Within the Group’s over-arching corporate governance framework, 
through which the Board aims to maintain full and effective control 
over appropriate strategic, financial, operational and compliance 
issues, an internal control framework has been established, against 
which the Company is able to assess the effectiveness of its risk 
management and internal control systems. The Group’s system  
of internal control is embedded within its routine operations,  
and a strong control culture is combined with clear management 
responsibility and accountabilities for individual control. The internal 
control framework provides an ongoing process for identifying, 
evaluating and managing the Group’s significant risks, and has been 
in place for the year under review and up to the date of approval of 
the annual report and accounts. The process is regularly reviewed by 
the Board, and accords with the guidance in the document “Internal 
Control: Revised Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code, 
October 2005” (“Turnbull Guidance”) published by the Financial 
Reporting Council.
The Executive Directors oversee the key risks and controls and the 
risk management process on a day-to-day basis, and have put in 
place an organisational structure with clearly defined lines of 
responsibility and delegation of authority. 
The Group’s Risk and Compliance Committee (“RCC”), which meets 
monthly, is responsible for maintaining a sound risk management 
and internal control environment and for assessing the impact of  
the Group’s ongoing activities on its regulatory and operational 
exposures. The RCC is chaired by the Head of Risk Management  
and Control – the other members are the Chief Executive, the  
Group Finance Director, the Head of Technology, Operations and 
Performance, the Head of Compliance, the Head of Information 
Technology, the Head of Legal and Transaction Management and  
the Group Financial Controller. Responsibility for risk identification  
is shared amongst these senior management personnel, with each 
such individual being responsible for day-to-day control of risk in 
their business area.
There are established policies and procedures to enable the Board, 
through its regular meetings, to monitor the effectiveness of the risk 
management and internal control systems, which cover all significant 
identified internal and external strategic, operational, financial, 
compliance and other risks, including the Group’s ability to comply 
with all applicable laws, regulations and clients’ requirements.  
The Board has continued to receive regular financial and other 
management information related to the control of expenditure 
against budget and the making of investments, and for monitoring 
the Group’s business and its performance, and regular compliance 
and risk reports. 
Through the Audit Committee, the Board has conducted an annual 
review and assessment of the effectiveness of the risk management 
and internal control systems, and has identified no significant 
failings or weaknesses during this review. In conducting this review, 
the Board has considered the periodic reports received throughout 
the year on compliance and risk matters, including reports provided 
by the internal audit function, and the annual report on risk 
management and internal control processes from the Risk and 
Compliance Committee. The Board is satisfied that appropriate 
planned actions continue to be effective in improving controls as the 
Group develops, and its overall assessment of the control framework 
continues to be satisfactory.
The main features of the Group’s risk management and internal 
control systems are as follows:
Policies
 – core values and policies together comprising the Group’s high 
level principles and controls, with which all staff are expected  
to comply;
 – manuals of policies and procedures, applicable to all business 
units, with procedures for reporting weaknesses and for 
monitoring corrective action;
 – a code of business conduct, with procedures for reporting 
compliance therewith; and
 – a defined operational framework and organisational structure 
with appropriate delegation of authority with accountability that 
has regard to acceptable levels of risk.
Processes
 – a planning framework is maintained, which incorporates a Board 
approved strategic plan, with objectives for each business unit;
 – regular business reviews of the Company and its subsidiaries are 
performed by senior management, which consider the ongoing 
effects of change and the short, medium and long-term 
operational requirements;
 – quarterly senior management systems and controls reviews are 
undertaken by the Group Finance Director with the Head of 
Compliance, and the Head of Risk Management and Control in 
which the Chief Executive Officer participates at least annually, 
which include evaluation of the potential impact and likelihood of 
identified risks and possible new risk areas; Business review Governance Financial statements
 Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2011 41
 – a matrix of top risks identifies key business, operational, financial 
and compliance risks, and considers the likelihood of those risks 
crystallising and the resultant impact. The inherent risk within 
each business activity has been identified, with the adequacy and 
mitigating effect of existing processes being assessed to determine 
a current residual risk level for each such activity. On the basis that 
further mitigants may be employed over time, a target residual 
risk for each activity after one to two years has been defined;
 – key risk indicator (“KRI”) statistics are reported to and analysed by 
the RCC. The KRI’s indicate trends in the Group’s risk profile, assist 
in the reduction of errors and potential financial losses and seek  
to prevent exposure by proactively dealing with a potential risk 
situation before an event actually occurs; 
 – there are well-defined procedures governing the appraisal and 
approval of corporate investments, including seeding of funds and 
purchase of own shares, with detailed investment and divestment 
approval procedures, incorporating appropriate levels of authority 
and regular post-investment reviews;
 – the Group has secure information and communication systems 
capable of capturing relevant and up to date information by 
relevant personnel; 
 – strong financial controls are maintained to ensure accurate 
accounting for transactions, appropriate authorisation limits to 
contain exposures, and reliability of data processing and integrity 
of information generated;
 – an in-depth annual budget is reviewed and approved by the  
Board and is regularly subject to update through a formal 
re-forecasting process;
 – oversight and management of the Group’s foreign currency cash 
flows and balance sheet exposures are the responsibility of the FX 
Management Committee which determines the appropriate level 
of hedging required and appropriate accounting treatment;
 – Board members receive monthly management accounts and other 
relevant reports, which highlight actual financial performance 
against budget/forecast and prior year period;
 – detailed investment reports are prepared and discussed at  
each of the sub-committee meetings of the Group’s Investment 
Committee, which take place weekly or monthly depending  
on investment theme, with following actions agreed and 
implemented within a strict operational framework;
 – oversight of the valuation methodologies used for clients’ fund 
investments that cannot be readily externally priced is the 
responsibility of the Group’s Pricing Methodology Committee 
(“PMC”) which meets monthly to review the current valuation 
methodology for each of these investments and to propose an 
updated valuation methodology where appropriate; 
 – the Group compliance function, whose responsibility is to ensure 
that the Group at all times meets its regulatory obligations, and  
to integrate regulatory compliance procedures and best practices 
within the Group, undertakes an ongoing compliance monitoring 
programme covering all the relevant areas of the Group’s 
operations, to seek to identify any breach of compliance with 
applicable financial services regulation, which includes real-time 
investment restrictions monitoring of client mandate 
requirements. Results of the compliance monitoring programme 
are reported to the RCC in support of the overall risk 
management framework; and
 – the development of new products is an important part of the 
Group’s business in responding to clients’ needs and changes in 
the financial markets, and is the responsibility of the New Products 
Committee which approves new product launches.
Verification
 – the external auditors are engaged to express an opinion on the 
annual financial statements, and also independently and 
objectively review the approach of management to reporting 
operating results and financial condition;
 – the internal audit function undertakes a programme of reviews  
as determined by the Board, reporting the results together with 
their advice and recommendations to the Audit Committee.  
The internal audit function is currently provided under an 
outsourcing arrangement by Ernst & Young – this arrangement  
will be subject to periodic review;
 – annual reports are reviewed independently by the Group’s external 
auditors pursuant to the Statement of Auditing Standards No. 70, 
type II (“SAS 70”); and 
 – the Board, through the Audit Committee, receives half-yearly 
updates from the Group’s external auditors which include any 
control matters that have come to their attention.

Report from the Chairman  
of the Audit Committee
The composition and summary terms of reference of the Audit 
Committee are set out on pages 38 and 39.
The principal activities of the Audit Committee through the year 
were as follows:
Financial statements 
The Audit Committee reviewed the 2011 Annual Report, Interim 
Results, Preliminary Results and reports from the external auditors, 
KPMG Audit Plc, on the outcome of their reviews and audits  
in 2011.
External auditors 
The Committee met with the external auditors during the year to 
review the scope of their audit and findings thereon for the interim 
and year end financial statements.
The Committee received a comprehensive presentation from the 
auditors demonstrating to its satisfaction how their independence 
and objectivity is maintained when providing non-audit services. 
The Committee has agreed the types of permitted and non-
permitted services and those which require explicit prior approval.  
All contracts for non-audit services in excess of £25,000 must be 
notified to the Chairman of the Audit Committee and approved by 
him. During the year the value of non-audit services provided by 
KPMG amounted to £0.4 million (2010: £0.4 million). The range  
of permitted non-audit services included reporting on our half year 
financial statements, providing assurance reports to the FSA, the 
provision of tax compliance services, acting as reporting accountant 
in appropriate circumstances provided there is no element of 
valuation work involved, and reports on internal controls as  
required under SAS 70 pursuant to investment management 
industry standards. 
The provision of tax advisory services, due diligence/transaction 
services and litigation services may be permitted with the 
Committee’s prior approval. The provision of internal audit services, 
valuation work and any other activity that may give rise to any 
possibility of self-review are not permitted under any circumstance. 
During the year there were no circumstances where KPMG were 
engaged to provide services which might have led to a conflict  
of interests. 
The Committee is satisfied that the external auditors remain 
independent and has recommended to the Board that a resolution 
be put to shareholders for the re-appointment of the auditors, and 
their remuneration and terms of engagement, at the Annual General 
Meeting of the Company.
From time to time during the year the Non-executives met with the 
external and internal auditors without the Executive Directors being 
present so as to provide a forum to raise any matters of concern  
in confidence. The Committee also received a report from the 
independent KPMG team responsible for the audits of the Ashmore 
publicly traded funds. 
Internal controls and risk management 
The Committee reviewed and evaluated the system of internal 
controls and risk management operated within the Company. 
Further details can be found on pages 28 to 29 and 40 to 41.
Internal audit
Ernst & Young were appointed as internal auditors effective 1 July 
2009 reporting directly to the committee. The Committee has 
received regular reports on its findings and programme of reviews  
at each of its meetings during the course of the year. Further details 
can be found in the internal control section of the corporate 
governance report on pages 40 to 41. 
Audit Committee effectiveness
The members of the Committee conducted a review of its 
effectiveness and concluded that it was working effectively.

Introduction
This report has been prepared on behalf of the Board in accordance 
with Schedule 8 to the Large and Medium Sized Companies and 
Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 and the UK 
Corporate Governance Code. This report sets out the Company’s 
remuneration policy and gives details of the compensation of 
Directors for the year ended 30 June 2011.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises three Non-executive 
Directors. Throughout the year Jonathan Asquith served as 
Chairman with Michael Benson and Nick Land as members. 
The Remuneration Committee meets as often as required to 
discharge its duties and met four times during the period from 1 July 
2010 to 30 June 2011. Details of attendance at all meetings for the 
financial year under review are contained in the table on page 38  
of the corporate governance report. The Chief Executive Officer, 
Group Finance Director, Company Secretary and the Head of Human 
Resources attended all or part of the meetings at the invitation of 
the Remuneration Committee but took no part in the determination 
of their own remuneration.
The primary role of the Remuneration Committee is to make 
recommendations to the Board as to the Company’s framework or 
broad policy for the remuneration of the Chairman, the Executive 
Directors of the Board, the Company Secretary and employees 
identified as Code and Control staff for purposes of compliance  
with the Financial Services Authority (“FSA”) remuneration code 
(“Code”). The Code defines Code staff as staff who have a material 
impact on the firm’s risk profile, including a person who performs  
a significant influence function for a firm, senior managers  
(as defined) and risk takers. Control staff are those employed in 
Control functions such as Compliance, Risk and Internal Audit.  
The Remuneration Committee decides on total individual 
remuneration packages for these positions. In addition the 
Remuneration Committee is responsible for ensuring that the 
Company’s remuneration policy for all staff is compliant with  
the Code.
Remuneration policy
The key objectives of the Company’s remuneration policy are to 
ensure that:
 – levels of remuneration are relative to the Company’s market and 
sufficient to attract and retain Executive Directors and employees 
of the quality required to run the Company successfully;
 – the Executive Directors and employees receive sufficient incentives 
to motivate enhanced performance; 
 – Executive Directors and employees are fairly rewarded for their 
individual contributions to the Company’s overall performance; 
and 
 – effective risk management is promoted and encouraged by 
Executive Directors and employees.
In determining this policy, the Remuneration Committee takes into 
account a broad range of factors including the interests of the 
shareholders, the financial and commercial health of the Company 
and guidance provided by the FSA or other relevant bodies. 
In addition, the Heads of Risk and Compliance actively contribute to 
the annual reviews of all employees, and their feedback is taken into 
consideration when determining employee remuneration.
The terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee are available 
on the Company website at www.ashmoregroup.com.
Advisors
The Remuneration Committee was advised, when considered 
appropriate, by Hewitt New Bridge Street (a trading name of Aon 
Hewitt Limited) throughout the period 1 July 2010 to 30 June 2011. 
The Company participates in the McLagan Partners compensation 
survey from which relevant data is provided to the Remuneration 
Committee.
Neither of the above has any connection with the Company other 
than providing compensation advice and/or information.
Service agreements
Each Executive Director has entered into a service agreement with 
the Company. The service agreements do not have a fixed term but 
include provisions for termination on 12 months’ notice by either 
party. Service agreements contain no contractual entitlement to 
receive bonus payments or to participate in the Company’s share 
plans. Participation in these arrangements is discretionary and 
subject to approval by the Remuneration Committee.
Non-executive Directors are appointed for an initial three year 
period. Their continued engagement is subject to the requirements 
of the Company’s Articles relating to the retirement of Directors  
by rotation.
The Company has maintained directors’ and officers’ liability 
insurance cover throughout the period.
The table below provides details of the Directors’ service 
agreements/letters of appointment for current Directors and  
Directors who served during the year.

Executive Directors are permitted to serve as Non-executive Directors of other companies where there is no competition to the Company’s 
business activities and where these duties do not interfere with the individual’s ability to perform his duties for the Company. In the reporting 
year neither Mark Coombs nor Graeme Dell held any Non-executive Directorships. 
Remuneration report 44 Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2011
Remuneration report continued
There are no provisions for compensation of Executive Directors on 
early termination save as described below:
(a)  the contracts for Mr Coombs and Mr Dell contain provisions 
entitling the Company to terminate employment without notice 
subject to making 12 monthly payments thereafter equivalent to 
monthly basic pay and benefits; and
(b)  all Directors’ contracts entitle the Company to give pay in lieu  
of notice.
Executive remuneration components
The Company rewards exceptional performance and so emphasises 
the variable components of the remuneration package.
The pay model adopted for the Executive Directors is similar to  
that of employees more generally within the Group, and the 
Remuneration Committee considers the levels and principles 
applying to the remuneration of other employees of the Group 
when determining Directors’ remuneration. 
All employees are subject to capped salaries and participate in a 
Group-wide bonus pool. Since performance-related pay is based on 
the principle of profit sharing, all employees share in the success  
of the business with remuneration rising and falling as a result of 
Group profit performance. The extent that each individual shares in 
the actual profit of the Group varies by individual performance and 
the role undertaken within the business. Part of individuals’ bonuses 
are deferred for a period of 5 years for the majority of employees 
through participation in the Company’s long-term incentive plans.
Fixed compensation
Fixed compensation components comprise basic salary and benefits 
in kind. Basic salaries are capped, as it is the Company’s policy to 
maintain its fixed cost base at a low level.
Periodic reviews are undertaken in terms of an appropriate level at 
which to cap maximum annual salary. Both the Chief Executive 
Officer and Group Finance Director earn a basic salary of £100,000. 
There have been no increases to their base salary levels during the 
year under review.
Variable compensation
The Company’s discretionary variable compensation provides for 
both an annual cash bonus, which is non-pensionable, and deferred 
share awards. The total variable compensation is determined by 
reference to the individual’s performance against agreed criteria, the 
profitability of the Company and the external market. Performance 
criteria are established appropriate to the individual’s role, to include 
such measures as growth in assets under management (“AuM”), 
profitability where appropriate, an assessment of the individual’s 
adherence to the Company’s risk and compliance principles and 
culture and other key areas of individual performance.
The Company’s intention is to pay to members of staff an amount  
in total of up to 25% of earnings before variable compensation, 
interest and tax (“EBVCIT”) in respect of its total variable 
compensation comprising cash bonus, including social security 
obligations thereon, and share-based payments, including fair value 
and social security costs in this respect. For the financial year ended 
30 June 2011 the provision for variable compensation is at 19% of 
EBVCIT. In view of the stringent salary controls which the Group 
operates the Remuneration Committee does not consider it 
necessary or appropriate to set a cap on individual discretionary 
bonus awards, although such awards will be made within the  
overall provision for variable compensation as set out above.
40% of any discretionary variable compensation earned by Executive 
Directors is received in the form of a restricted share or restricted 
phantom share award (at the prevailing share price without 
enhancement) which is deferred and vests after a period of five 
years subject to achieving a relative total shareholder return (“TSR”) 
performance target. In addition, the opportunity exists to commute 
up to 50% of the annual cash bonus that would otherwise be 
earned into the Company’s shares or phantom shares (also at the 
prevailing share price without enhancement) or to take the entire 
remaining bonus as cash. If a deferral of bonus is voluntarily elected, 
the deferral period is also five years with deferred shares then 
subject to a matching award that is currently of equal value to the 
bonus deferred. Matching awards are subject to the same relative 
TSR performance condition. Full details of share awards and the  
TSR performance target are set out below on page 46 and 47. 
The Remuneration Committee has considered the final rules on 
remuneration in financial companies issued by the FSA as applied to 
the Company as a ‘tier 4’ firm, and in particular its emphasis on the 
need to ensure that remuneration plans do not incentivise excessive 
risk taking and short-termism. The Committee believe that the 
nature of the variable remuneration plans in place have been 
structured appropriately in light of the Company’s business model 
and risk profile, the proportion of variable remuneration of Executive 
Directors and senior staff across the business which is deferred  
(a minimum of 40% of any bonus earned for a five-year period),  
the length of the deferral period (five years being well ahead of the 
period required by the FSA for firms in tiers 1-3 and other relevant 
guidance) and the performance conditions attached to the deferred 
awards (i.e. the part of the bonus that is converted into a restricted 
share award is subject to a TSR performance condition that acts as  
a form of ‘claw-back’ in that the shares will not ultimately vest in  
full unless the Company’s TSR is at upper quartile measured against 
other global investment management firms over a five-year period). 
In addition, the Remuneration Committee has the authority to 
clawback part or all of the deferred remuneration of Executive 
Directors during its five-year restricted period, in the exceptional 
event that either the remuneration was awarded on the basis of 
materially misstated results, or an Executive Director commits gross 
misconduct. The authority to apply clawback applies with effect 
from remuneration awarded in respect of 2010-2011 performance. 
Where an Executive Director has waived deferred variable 
compensation in return for the Remuneration Committee 
considering a contribution to charity, and the Remuneration 
Committee has approved such a contribution, the Remuneration 
Committee will not apply clawback to the amount waived to charity, 
but has the discretion to reduce present or future year variable 
compensation by equivalent amounts. 
Until the year ended 30 June 2009, for reasons related to Rule 9 of  
the Takeover Code, Mark Coombs chose to waive any shares offered 
to him as part of his variable remuneration as the issuance of further 
shares to him would have increased his existing shareholdings to the 
extent that it would trigger a mandatory bid for all shares. During prior 
years he therefore asked the Remuneration Committee to consider an 
appropriate equivalent donation to be made to a charity or charities 
nominated by him and the Remuneration Committee has agreed to 
this. Any equivalent donation made to a charity is paid to the charity 
annually in instalments of one fifth of the value of the award over a 
period equivalent to the five-year vesting period, which would have 
otherwise applied to a share award. Ongoing payments to the charity 
are dependent on Mark Coombs’ continued employment.  Business review Governance Financial statements
 Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2011 45
Mark Coombs’ performance measures include targets for EBIT and 
AuM growth as well as the progression of strategic opportunities 
and operational development. The committee is fully satisfied that 
these performance measurements were met or exceeded in the year 
ended 30 June 2011. Similar measurements will be applied in the 
financial year ending 30 June 2012.
Graeme Dell’s performance measurements are a basket of 
operational, strategic and compliance related targets pertaining to 
his areas of responsibility, including finance, technology, compliance, 
operations, Ashmore’s overseas operations and investor relations. 
The committee is satisfied that key targets were met in the year 
ended 30 June 2011. Similar performance measures will be applied 
to the financial year ending 30 June 2012.
The balance between the fixed and variable elements of total 
compensation for each of the Executive Directors for the year ended 
30 June 2011 is shown in the table below prior to any waivers made 
to charity and prior to any elections made to commute cash bonus 
into bonus shares or bonus phantom shares.
Total compensation Fixed

Mark Coombs 1% 59% 40% 100%
Graeme Dell 8% 55% 37% 100%
Mark Coombs has requested to waive 20% of any total bonus that 
would otherwise be awarded to him. He asked the Remuneration 
Committee to consider an appropriate equivalent donation to  
be made to a charity or charities nominated by him and the 
Remuneration Committee has agreed to this. 50% of the amount 
waived will be donated to the Ashmore Foundation, more details of 
which can be found in the corporate social responsibility section of 
this report on pages 35 to 36, and 50% to a charity or charities of 
his choice.
Long term share award plans
As a business which is completely reliant upon the intellectual capital 
of its people, the Board considers it essential to have in place share 
incentive arrangements which provide a significant element of  
“at risk” compensation and which are designed to attract, motivate 
and retain highly qualified executives, investment management 
professionals, and other key employees who are critical to our 
long-term success and to align their interests with those of our 
clients and shareholders. 
The overall limits operated under the live plans described below, 
which were established prior to the listing of the Company, are 
designed to fulfil these objectives. The number of shares which  
may be issued in aggregate under any employee share plan of the 
Company over any ten-year period following Admission is limited  
to 15% of the Company’s issued share capital at that time.  
The Company’s obligations under the share plans can be met by 
newly issued shares in the Company or shares purchased in the 
market by the trustees of an employee benefit trust (“EBT”).  
During the period all of the awards that vested were met by shares 
from the EBT. As detailed in note 23 of the accounts, the EBT 
continues to make market purchases of shares to satisfy current  
and future awards.
At 30 June 2011 the Company had issued 3.6% of the Company’s 
issued share capital under employee share plans to its staff. 
The Company operates three share award plans. All employees, 
including Executive Directors, are eligible to receive awards under 
the share award plans. 
The Company Executive Omnibus Incentive Plan (“Omnibus Plan”) 
This plan was adopted on 11 October 2006.
As described in the variable compensation section above, employees 
routinely receive a proportion of their remuneration in the form  
of restricted shares, which vest after five years but qualify for 
dividends from the date of award. Employees who receive an award 
of restricted shares under the Omnibus Plan may also be given  
the opportunity to commute cash bonus that would otherwise  
be awarded into bonus shares. Should employees take up this 
option, the Company may match the award with matching shares. 
Bonus and matching awards are eligible for dividends or equivalent 
from the date of award. All share awards for employees who remain 
employed by the Company cliff vest at five years.
In the case of Executive Directors restricted and matching share 
awards will be subject to Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) 
performance conditions. Bonus shares will not be subject to a  
TSR performance condition as the Executive Directors will have 
waived cash bonus in order to receive them.
Awards under the Omnibus Plan are subject to good and bad leaver 
provisions. Should an award holder leave employment for reasons 
that would categorise them as a bad leaver, all restricted and 
matching share awards will be forfeited. Should an award holder 
leave employment for reasons that would categorise them as a  
good leaver, then restricted and matching share awards would 
generally vest on a pro-rated basis. Bonus shares will vest and be 
transferred to the award holder free of restrictions upon termination 
of employment for any reason other than dismissal for cause or 
personal bankruptcy.
The Omnibus Plan also allows the issue of option and share awards 
of different types. No options have been issued under this plan 
during the year and this is not current policy for Executive Directors.
The Omnibus Plan includes individual limits in respect of option and 
share awards made to Executive Directors in any annual period 
whereby an award will be limited and take effect so that (a) no 
participant who is an Executive Director of the Company is granted 
market value options, discounted options or premium cost options 
in any annual period over more than 2,000,000 ordinary shares  
of 0.01 pence each, and (b) no participant who is an Executive 
Director of the Company is granted restricted share or restricted 
phantom share awards (or equivalent conditional rights to shares)  
in any annual period over more than 1,000,000 ordinary shares of 
0.01 pence each (such annual limits not including bonus shares  
or matching shares). If there are exceptional circumstances that  
the Remuneration Committee considers justify making awards  
in excess of these limits, the Remuneration Committee may, in 
respect of the relevant participant, apply double the limits above. 
Bonus shares represent mandatorily or voluntarily waived annual 
bonus entitlement and the Omnibus Plan also contains a limit on  
the ratio of matching shares to bonus shares of three to one.  
The match applied to all awards made to date has been one to  
one and this ratio will be used for awards relating to the year ended  
30 June 2011.
The Ashmore First Discretionary Share Option Scheme  
(“Option Scheme”)
This scheme was established on 23 October 2000. Subsequent to 
the Company’s Admission in October 2006, it is not intended to 
issue any further options under this scheme. 46 Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2011

In relation to these awards, Mark Coombs requested to waive 30% of any total bonus awarded to him. He asked the Remuneration 
Committee to consider an appropriate equivalent donation to be made to a charity or charities nominated by him and this was agreed  
by the Remuneration Committee. The figures shown are gross of this waiver.
Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) performance measure
Relative TSR is used as the performance measure for long-term 
incentive awards at Ashmore.
The Remuneration Committee has established a comparator group 
against which to measure TSR performance in respect of share 
awards to Executive Directors under CSOP and the Omnibus Plan 
(for both awards of restricted shares, matching shares, restricted 
phantom shares and matching phantom shares). Share awards will 
not vest at below median performance. 25% of share awards will 
vest for median performance rising to full vesting at upper quartile 
performance, with straight-line proportionate vesting between these 
two points. The performance period for awards under the Omnibus 
Plan is five years. 
TSR is considered appropriate as a well established and recognised 
performance measure which aligns the interests of the Executive 
Directors with those of the shareholders choosing to invest in other 
similar global investment management firms. In the absence of  
any other dedicated emerging markets investment management 
companies, a comparator group of 19 companies has been selected 
from global investment management companies of a similar size 
that are established and actively trading on stock markets. 
The Remuneration Committee decided to increase the number of 
companies used for TSR comparison purposes on 10 September 
2009 from the original 16 comparator companies. This was 
prompted by the suspension from trading or acquisition of three  
of the original comparator group companies. The Remuneration 
Committee felt that in order to ensure that a sustainable peer group 
was selected; the group should be increased for awards made in 
relation to the year ended 30 June 2009 forward. Since the increase 
of the comparator group to 19 companies, one has delisted thus 
reducing the comparator group to 18. There have been no other 
changes to the comparator group this year.
In measuring the extent to which the Company’s TSR performance 
has met the relevant targets, the Remuneration Committee instructs 
its independent remuneration consultants to prepare a report for it 
to use as the basis for approving vesting of performance related 
share awards.
TSR performance graph
The graph below shows the growth in the Company’s share price 
since Admission against the FTSE 250 (both on a TSR basis).  
The FTSE 250 index has been selected as the index in which the 
Company is currently listed.
The Company Approved Share Option Plan (“CSOP”) 
This plan was adopted on 11 October 2006 and approved by HMRC 
on 1 June 2007. The CSOP provides for the granting of options up 
to a market value limit of £30,000 to each individual on the date of 
grant. No awards have been made under this plan to date.
During the financial year share awards were granted to Graeme Dell 
from the Omnibus Plan on 21 September 2010 as set forth in the 
table below and as reported in the remuneration report for the year 
ended 30 June 2010.

Notes to the financial statements 
1) Significant accounting policies 
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently to all years presented in dealing with items which are considered material in 
relation to the Group and Company financial statements, with the exception of new standards and interpretations which have been adopted 
with effect of 1 July 2010 as disclosed in policy note (a) below.  
(a) Basis of preparation – Group and Company 
The financial information has been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU, and applied in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006. Based on these adopted IFRS, the Directors have selected the accounting policies to be applied, which are set out below. 
The financial information has been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for the measurement at fair value of derivative financial 
instruments and certain financial assets that are held as available-for-sale.  
The Company is taking advantage of the exemption in section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 which allows it not to present its individual 
statement of comprehensive income and related notes.  
With effect from 1 July 2010, the Group adopted the following new standards and interpretations: 
IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held-for-Sale and Discontinued Operations 
IFRS 5 was amended to specify the required disclosures for non-current assets (or disposal groups) classified as held-for-sale or discontinued 
operations. The adoption of this amendment has not had a material impact on the financial performance or position of the Group. 
IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows 
IAS 7 was amended to state explicitly that only expenditure that results initially in the recognition of an asset may be classified as a cash flow 
from investing activities. The adoption of this amendment has not had a material impact on the financial performance or position of the Group. 
IAS 17 Leases – Classification of leases of land and buildings  
The adoption of this standard has not had a material impact on the financial performance or position of the Group. 
IAS 36 Impairment of Assets 
IAS 36 was amended to state that the largest unit to which goodwill is allocated is at the operating segment level as defined in IFRS 8 before 
applying aggregation criteria of IFRS 8.12. The adoption of this amendment has not had a material impact on the financial performance or 
position of the Group. 
IAS 38 Intangible Assets 
Measuring the fair value of an intangible asset acquired in a business combination. Amendments clarify the description of valuation techniques 
commonly used to measure fair value of intangible assets acquired in a business combination for which no active market exists. The adoption  
of this amendment has not had a material impact on the financial performance or position of the Group. 
IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement  
Scope exemption for business combination contracts. The adoption of this exemption has not had a material impact on the financial 
performance or position of the Group. 
IAS 39 was amended to state that gains or losses on a hedged instrument should be reclassified from equity to profit or loss during the period 
that the hedged forecast cash flows affect profit or loss. The adoption of this amendment has not had a material impact on the financial 
performance or position of the Group. 
IFRS 3 Business Combinations – Measurement of non-controlling interests 
IFRS 3 was amended to limit the accounting policy choice to measure non-controlling interests (NCI) upon initial recognition either at fair value 
or at the NCI’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets to instruments that give rise to a present ownership interest and 
entitle the holder to a share of net assets in the event of liquidation. The adoption of this amendment has not had a material impact on the 
financial position of the Group. 
IFRS 3 Business Combinations – Unreplaced and voluntarily replaced share-based payment awards 
IFRS 3 contains guidance on how to apportion the market-based measure of an acquirer’s share-based payment awards that are issued in 
exchange for acquiree awards between consideration transferred and post-combination cost when an acquirer is obliged to replace the 
acquiree’s existing awards. IFRS 3 was amended so that the guidance for such awards also applies to voluntarily replaced acquiree awards and 
introduces attribution guidance for acquiree awards that are not replaced. The adoption of this amendment has not had a material impact on 
the financial performance or position of the Group. 
IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements 
Transition requirements for amendments made as a result of IAS 27 (2008) to IAS 21, IAS 28 and IAS 31. This has not had a material impact  
on the financial performance or position of the Group. 
(b) Basis of consolidation  
(i) Subsidiaries 
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company. Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the 
financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing control, potential voting rights that presently 
are exercisable or convertible are taken into account. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial 
statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases. The results of subsidiaries acquired during the year  
are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income from the effective date of acquisition. 
(ii) Transactions eliminated on consolidation 
Intragroup balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions, are eliminated in 
preparing the consolidated financial statements.  Business review Governance Financial statements

(iii) Associates 
Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence. Significant influence exists when the Group has the power to participate 
in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but does not control those policies. 
Associates are accounted for using the equity method as described under IAS 28, whereby the investment is initially recognised at cost and 
adjusted thereafter for the post-acquisition change in the Company’s share of net assets of the investee. 
(iv) Employee Benefit Trust 
An Employee Benefit Trust (“EBT”) acts as an agent for the purpose of the employee share-based compensation plans. Accordingly, the EBT  
is included within the Group’s consolidated financial statements.  
(c) Business combinations 
Under the requirements of IFRS 3 Business Combinations, all business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method (acquisition 
accounting). The cost of a business combination is the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred  
or assumed and equity instruments issued by the acquirer. The fair value of a business combination is calculated at the acquisition date by 
recognising the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that satisfy the recognition criteria, at their fair values at that 
date. The acquisition date is the date on which the acquirer effectively obtains control of the acquiree. The cost of a business combination in 
excess of the fair value of net identifiable assets or liabilities acquired, including intangible assets identified, is recognised as goodwill. Costs  
of issuing debt or equity instruments are accounted for under IAS 32 and IAS 39. All other costs associated with acquisitions are expensed. 
(d) Foreign currency translation  
The Group’s financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling (“Sterling”), which is the Company’s functional and presentation currency. 
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment 
in which the entity operates (the functional currency). 
(i) Foreign currency transactions 
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to Sterling at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign 
exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.  
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at 
the date of the transaction.  
(ii) Financial statements of foreign operations 
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated into Sterling 
at the foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated into Sterling at 
rates approximating to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are 
recognised directly in other comprehensive income. 
(e) Financial instruments 
The Group’s accounting policy on fair value measurements is in accordance with IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures and is discussed in 
Note 16. 
(i) Derivatives 
The Group uses foreign exchange forward contracts and options to manage its foreign currency exposures.  
Except when hedge accounting is applied, derivatives are initially recognised at cost on the date on which a contract is entered into unless fair 
value at acquisition is different to cost, in which case the fair value is recognised. Subsequently they are measured at fair value with gains and 
losses recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. Transaction costs are recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive 
income. The fair value of the derivatives is their quoted market price at the balance sheet date.  
All derivatives are carried as current assets when the fair value is positive and as current liabilities when the fair value is negative. 
(ii) Financial assets 
The Group may, from time-to-time, invest in funds where an Ashmore Group subsidiary is the Investment Manager or an Advisor (‘seeding’). 
Where the holding in such investments is deemed to represent a controlling stake and is acquired exclusively with a view to subsequent disposal 
through sale or dilution, these seed investments are recognised as non-current assets held-for-sale in accordance with IFRS 5. The Group 
recognises 100% of the investment in the fund as a “held-for-sale” asset and the interest held by other parties as a “liability held-for-sale”. 
Where control is not deemed to exist, and the assets are readily realisable, they are recognised as available-for-sale financial assets. Where  
the assets are not readily realisable, they are recognised as non-current asset investments. The recognition policy for the three categories is set 
out below: 
•  Non-current asset investments 
Non-current asset investments, relating to closed-end funds, are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. Fair value is 
assessed by taking account of the extent to which potential dilution of gains or losses may arise as a result of additional investors subscribing  
to the fund where the final close of a fund has not occurred. 
•  Financial assets held as non-current assets held-for-sale 
Non-current assets held-for-sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell except where measurement 
and re-measurement is outside the scope of IFRS 5. The relevant policy is set out above. Where investments that have initially been recognised  
as non-current assets held-for-sale, because the Group has been deemed as holding a controlling stake, are subsequently disposed of or diluted 
such that the Group’s holding is now insufficient to be deemed a controlling stake, the investment will subsequently be reclassified as an 
available-for-sale financial asset. Any such reclassification will crystallise any gain or loss previously recognised through other comprehensive 
income within profit for the year as part of comprehensive income. Subsequent movements will be recognised in accordance with the Group’s 
accounting policy for the newly adopted classification.   60 Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2011
Notes to the financial statements continued 
1) Significant accounting policies continued 
•  Financial assets held as available-for-sale 
For available-for-sale financial assets, gains and losses arising from changes in their fair value are recognised in other comprehensive income, 
until the asset is disposed of or is impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is 
included in profit for the year as part of comprehensive income.  
(iii) Trade and other receivables and payables 
Trade and other receivables and payables are initially recorded at fair value plus transaction costs. The fair value on acquisition is normally the 
cost. Impairment losses with respect to the estimated irrecoverable amount are recognised through the statement of comprehensive income 
when there is appropriate evidence that trade and other receivables are impaired. However, if a longer-term loan or receivable carries no 
interest, the fair value is estimated as the present value of all future cash payments or receipts discounted using the Group’s weighted average 
cost of capital. The resulting adjustment is recognised as interest expense or interest income. Subsequent to initial recognition these assets and 
liabilities are measured at amortised cost less any impairment. 
(iv) Hedge accounting 
The Group applies cash flow hedge accounting when the transactions meet the specified hedge accounting criteria. To qualify, the following 
conditions must be met: 
– Formal documentation of the relationship between the hedging instrument(s) and hedged item(s) must exist at inception; 
– The hedged cash flows must be highly probable and must present an exposure to variations in cash flows that could ultimately affect profit 
and loss; 
– The effectiveness of the hedge can be reliably measured; and 
– The hedge must be highly effective, with effectiveness assessed on an ongoing basis. 
For qualifying cash flow hedges, the change in fair value of the effective hedging instrument is initially recognised in other comprehensive 
income and is released to profit for the year as part of comprehensive income in the same period during which the relevant financial asset  
or liability affects profit or loss.  
Where the hedge is highly effective overall, any ineffective portion of the hedge is immediately recognised in profit and loss. Where the 
instrument ceases to be highly effective as a hedge, or is sold, terminated or exercised, hedge accounting is discontinued. 
(f) Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment includes office equipment and is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.  
Depreciation is charged to the statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item 
of property, plant and equipment. The useful life of office equipment is estimated to be five years. The residual values and useful lives of assets 
are reviewed at least annually. 
(g) Intangible assets 
•  Goodwill 
Goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. Goodwill is 
tested at each balance sheet date for impairment and stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill and intangible assets held 
by subsidiaries and denominated in a foreign currency are translated at the closing balance sheet rate. Any gain or loss on translation is included 
in other comprehensive income. 
IFRS3 and IAS36 require goodwill to be allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. The Group is considered to 
have one cash-generating unit and all goodwill has been allocated to this cash generating unit. 
•  Other intangibles 
Intangible assets, such as management contracts and trade names acquired as part of a business combination, are capitalised where it is 
probable that future economic benefits attributable to the assets will flow to the Group and the fair value of the assets can be measured reliably. 
Both management contracts and brand names are recorded initially at fair value and then amortised, if appropriate, over their useful lives which 
have been assessed as being between 31 months and 10 years. The fair value at the date of acquisition is calculated using the discounted cash 
flow methodology and represents the valuation of the net residual revenue stream arising from the management contracts and brand name in 
place at the date of acquisition. These are included in the balance sheet as intangible assets. Other intangible assets held by subsidiaries and 
denominated in a foreign currency are retranslated at the closing balance sheet rate. Any gain or loss on translation is included in other 
comprehensive income. 
(h) Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.  
For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above. 
(i) Deferred acquisition costs 
Costs that are directly attributable to securing an investment management contract are deferred if they can be identified separately and 
measured reliably and it is probable that they will be recovered. Deferred acquisition costs represent the contractual right to benefit from 
providing investment management services and are charged as the related revenue is recognised.  Business review Governance Financial statements
 Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2011 61
1) Significant accounting policies continued 
(j) Impairment 
The carrying amounts of the Group’s assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of 
impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. For goodwill, the recoverable amount is estimated  
at each balance sheet date. An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount. 
Impairment losses are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. 
The recoverable amount of assets is the greater of their fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated 
future cash flows are discounted to their present value using the Group’s weighted average cost of capital. For an asset that does not generate 
largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. 
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change  
in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount 
does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had  
been recognised. 
(k) Dividends payable 
Interim dividends are recognised when paid and final dividends when approved by shareholders. 
(l) Employee benefits 
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the statement of comprehensive income 
when payable in accordance with the scheme particulars. 
(m) Share-based payments  
The Group issues share awards to its employees under share-based compensation plans. The awards are accounted for in line with IFRS 2 Share-
Based Payment. Phantom awards are classified as cash settled under IFRS2 Share-Based Payment. All other awards are classified as equity settled. 
For equity settled awards the fair value of the amounts payable to employees is recognised as an expense with a corresponding increase  
in equity. The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the vesting period. The fair value of equity settled awards is measured using 
an appropriate valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the instruments were granted.  
For cash settled awards the fair value of the amounts payable to employees is recognised as an expense with a corresponding liability on the 
Group’s balance sheet. The fair value is measured at the end of each reporting period and spread over the vesting period. The fair value of cash 
settled awards is measured using an appropriate valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the instruments 
were granted.  
(n) Equity shares 
The Company’s ordinary shares of 0.01 pence each are classified as equity instruments. Ordinary shares issued by the Company are recorded  
at the fair value of the consideration received or the market price at the day of issue. Direct issue costs, net of tax, are deducted from equity 
through share premium. When share capital is repurchased, the amount of consideration paid, including directly attributable costs, is recognised 
as a change in equity. 
(o) Own shares 
Own shares are held by the EBT. The holding of the EBT comprises own shares that have not vested unconditionally to employees of the Group. 
In both the Group and Company, own shares are recorded at cost and are deducted from retained earnings.  
(p) Treasury shares 
Treasury shares are recognised in equity and are measured at cost. Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, 
with any difference between the proceeds from the sale and original cost being taken to retained earnings. 
(q) Revenue 
Revenue comprises management fees, performance fees and other revenue. Revenue is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income 
as and when the related services are provided. Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the 
Group and the revenue can be reliably measured. Specific revenue recognition policies are: 
(i) Management fees 
Management fees are accrued over the period for which the service is provided. Where management fees are received in advance these are 
recognised over the period of the provision of the asset management service, which is estimated based on experience of average holding 
periods for investments.  
(ii) Performance fees 
Performance fees relate to the performance of funds managed during the period and are recognised at the balance sheet date when the 
quantum of the fee can be estimated reliably and it is probable that the fee will crystallise. This is usually at the end of the performance period. 
(iii) Other revenue 
Other revenue includes transaction, structuring and administration fees, and reimbursement by funds of costs incurred by the Group.  
This revenue is recognised when the related services are provided.  
(r) Distribution costs 
Distribution costs are cost of sales payable to third parties and are recognised over the period for which the service is provided.   62 Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2011
Notes to the financial statements continued 
1) Significant accounting policies continued  
(s) Operating leases  
Payments payable under operating leases are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the term of the 
lease. Lease incentives received are recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term and are recorded as a reduction in premises costs.  
(t) Finance income  
Finance income includes interest receivable on the Group’s cash and cash equivalents and gains on available-for-sale/held-for-sale assets.  
Gains on available-for-sale/held-for-sale assets recognised in the year arose either as a result of crystallisation on the disposal of an available- 
for-sale asset or upon reclassification of financial assets previously held as non-current assets held-for-sale as described in policy note (e)(ii).  
(u) Taxation  
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income except to 
the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity. 
(i) Current tax 
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet 
date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. 
(ii) Deferred tax 
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets 
and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following differences are not provided for:  
– goodwill not deductible for tax purposes; and  
– differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.  
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and 
liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can  
be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised. 
(v) Segment reporting 
A segment is a distinguishable component of the Group that is engaged either in providing products or services (business segment), or in 
providing products or services within a particular economic environment (geographical segment), which is subject to risks and rewards that  
are different from those of other segments.  
Management regard the Group’s services as comprising one business segment (being provision of investment management services) and that  
its operations are not run on a discrete geographic basis. 
(w) Accounting estimates and judgements 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that 
affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions 
are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which 
form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  
Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in 
which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both 
current and future periods. 
Judgements made by management in the application of IFRS that have significant effect on the financial statements and estimates with  
a significant risk of material adjustment are described in note 33. 
(x) Adopted IFRS not yet applied 
The full impact of these IFRSs and IFRIC Interpretations is currently being assessed by the Group; other than IFRS 9 Financial Instruments none of 
these pronouncements are expected to result in any material adjustments to the financial statements. The Group continues to evaluate the 
potential impact of IFRS 9 on its financial statements.  
Company 
In addition to the above accounting policies, the following specifically relate to the Company. 
(y) Investment in subsidiaries  
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company. Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the 
financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing control, potential voting rights that presently 
are exercisable or convertible are taken into account. 
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less, where appropriate, provisions for impairment. 
(z) Financial guarantees 
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its group, the Company 
considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such. In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a 
contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee or that 
guarantee expires for any reason.   Business review Governance Financial statements
 Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2011 63
2) Revenue 
Management fees are accrued throughout the period in line with fluctuations in the levels of assets under management. Periodic performance 
fees are recognised only if performance hurdles have been achieved in a period. The Group is not considered to be reliant on any single source 
of revenue. During the year, two of the Group’s funds provided 5.3% and 10.3% of total revenue through management fees. Three of  
the Group’s funds provided 19.7%, 10.3% and 5.4% of total revenue in the year respectively when considering management fees and 
performance fees on a combined basis.

This change became substantially enacted on 29 March 2011 and therefore the effect of the rate reduction has been reflected in the  
figures above. 
8) Earnings per share 
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit after tax for the financial year attributable to equity holders of the parent of  
£189.0 million (2010: £160.0 million) by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year. 
Diluted earnings per share is calculated as for basic earnings per share with an adjustment to the weighted average number of ordinary shares  
to reflect the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. There is no difference between the profit for the financial year attributable to equity 
holders of the parent used in the basic and diluted earnings per share calculations.

9) Share-based payments 
Group and Company share-based compensation plans 
The following share-based compensation plans were in operation during the reporting year. 
The Ashmore First Discretionary Share Option Scheme (“Option Scheme”) 
The Option Scheme was set up in October 2000. Options issued under the Option Scheme typically have a life of 10 years and vest after 5 years 
from date of grant. The pro rata proportion of the fair value of options at each reporting year end has been accounted for on an equity-settled 
basis. No further options will be issued under the Option Scheme. 
The Executive Omnibus Incentive Plan (“Omnibus Plan”) 
The Omnibus Plan was introduced prior to the Company listing in October 2006 and provides for the grant of share awards, market value 
options, premium cost options, discounted options, linked options, phantoms and/or nil cost options to employees. The Plan will also allow 
bonuses to be deferred in the form of share awards with or without matching shares. These elements can be used singly or in combination. 
Awards granted under the Omnibus plan typically vest after 5 years from date of grant, with the exception of bonus awards which vest after  
the shorter of 5 years from date of grant or on the date of termination of employment. Awards under the Omnibus Plan are accounted for as 
equity settled, with the exception of phantoms which are classified as cash settled. 
The Approved Company Share Option Plan (“CSOP”) 
The CSOP was also introduced prior to the Company listing in October 2006 and is an option scheme providing for the grant of market value 
options to employees with the aggregate value of outstanding options not exceeding £30,000 per employee. The CSOP qualifies as a UK tax 
approved company share option plan and approval thereto has been obtained from HMRC. To date, there have been no awards made under 
the CSOP.

The fair value of awards granted under the Omnibus Plan is determined by the average Ashmore Group plc share price for the five business days 
prior to grant. 
Where the grant of restricted and matching share awards is linked to the annual bonus process the fair value of the awards is spread over  
a period including the current financial year and the subsequent five years to their release date when the grantee becomes unconditionally 
entitled to the underlying shares. Of the total outstanding share awards of 25,555,448 as at 30 June 2011 (17,784,317 as at 30 June 2010) the 
amount of 19,630,824 (2010: 15,217,490) were restricted and matching shares granted as part of the Group’s variable compensation process. 
The fair value of the remaining awards is spread over the period from date of grant to the release date.  Business review Governance Financial statements

10) Dividends 
An analysis of dividends is as follows: 
Group and Company 2011 2010 
Dividends declared/proposed in respect of the year: 
Interim dividend declared per share (p) 4.16 3.66
Final dividend proposed per share (p) 10.34 9.34
 
Dividends paid in the year: 
Interim dividend paid (£m) 29.1 25.0
Interim dividend per share (p) 4.16 3.66
 
Final dividend paid (£m) 64.3 57.2
Final dividend per share (p) 9.34 8.34
In addition to the £93.4 million (2010: £82.2 million) of dividends paid to equity holders of the parent, the Group also paid £0.3 million  
(2010: £0.4 million) of dividends to non-controlling interests. 
Dividends are recognised in the accounts in the year in which they are paid, or in the case of a final dividend when approved by the 
shareholders.  
On 12 September 2011 the Board proposed a final dividend of 10.34p per share for the year ended 30 June 2011. This has not been recognised 
as a liability of the Group at the year end as it has not yet been approved by shareholders. Based on the number of shares in issue at the year 
end which qualify to receive a dividend, the total amount payable would be £72.2 million (2010: £64.3 million).

Goodwill 
Goodwill represents the amount by which the fair value of consideration paid for an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net identifiable 
assets of the acquired business on the acquisition date. Consideration represents the fair value of assets given, equity instruments issued and 
liabilities incurred on the acquisition date. 
Goodwill is carried in the balance sheet at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill has an indefinite useful life, is not subject to 
amortisation and is tested for impairment annually or whenever there is an indication that the carrying amount may not be recoverable based  
on management’s judgements regarding the future prospects of the business, estimates of future cash flows and discount rates. 
The goodwill balance within the Company at the beginning and the end of the year was £4.1 million and related to the acquisition of the 
business from ANZ in 1999. Additional goodwill arising in the Group at the beginning of the year relates to the Dolomite acquisition in 2008. 
The significant addition to goodwill during the year resulted from the acquisition of Ashmore EMM LLC on 31 May 2011 which is described  
The business of the Group is managed as a single unit, with asset allocations, research and other such operational practices reflecting the 
commonality of approach across all fund themes. Therefore, no further split into smaller cash-generating units is possible, and the impairment 
review is conducted for the Group as a whole. 
The annual impairment review of goodwill was undertaken at 30 June 2011. No impairments were deemed necessary. When assessing the 
appropriateness of the carrying value of goodwill at year end, the recoverable amount is based on value in use calculations. The calculation is 
based on the forecast future profitability and cash flow projections. 
As the AshmoreEMM acquisition was made only one month prior to the balance sheet date, the valuation model used for the acquisition  
was also the basis of the value in use calculation. The key assumptions of the model, on which management based their 5 year projections,  
were a long-term growth rate of 2.5%, reflecting the expected fund flows and growth of the AuM, and a discount rate of 13.0%.  
Management reviewed the key assumptions used in the model and consider them to remain valid as at 30 June 2011. 
There has been no gross impairment of goodwill to date. 
in further detail in note 27. This addition of £50.8 million (US$83.5 million) arising on the acquisition is attributable principally to value   
expected to be derived from the acquired platform through future growth and additional business from new clients, and the value of the  
assembled workforce.  Business review Governance Financial statements
 Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2011 71
12) Goodwill and intangible assets continued 
AshmoreEMM fund management relationships and the AshmoreEMM brand name 
The AshmoreEMM fund management relationships and the AshmoreEMM brand name are separately identifiable intangible assets acquired  
as part of the acquisition of AshmoreEMM (note 27). 
Ashmore engaged an independent third party valuation expert to value these assets as part of the acquisition. They were valued at the present 
value of the expected future cash flows resulting from the assets over their useful lives and were discounted using the Group weighted average 
cost of capital of 13.0%. They are being amortised over their useful lives which were also estimated based on the work of the valuation expert. 
Their estimated useful lives are 8 years for the fund management relationships and 10 years for the AshmoreEMM brand name. The fund 
management relationships intangible comprises the profit expected to be earned from existing clients of AshmoreEMM. The AshmoreEMM 
brand name is being actively used through the co-branding of the subsidiary since its acquisition. The carrying amounts of the assets in the 
balance sheet are based on their historic costs less amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. 
Other intangible assets 
In addition, in order to incentivise Amundi, who were formerly a shareholder in EMM, to retain existing AuM within AshmoreEMM and to 
further increase AuM there is an incentive fee payable after three years tied to the level of such AuM at that time. As the purpose of this is to 
benefit the Group going forward rather than being a payment for past services, it has been treated as a separate purchased intangible asset 
rather than as part of the acquisition.

On 23 March 2011 the Chancellor announced the reduction of the main rate of UK corporation tax to 26% with effect from 1 April 2011.  
This rate reduction became substantially enacted on 29 March 2011 and as such creates a reduction in the deferred tax assets and liabilities 
included in the figures above. 
The Chancellor also proposed changes to further reduce the main rate of UK corporation tax by 1% per annum reducing the rate to 23% by  
1 April 2014. As these changes have not been substantially enacted they have not been included in the figures above. The overall effect of 
further tax reductions from 26% to 23%, if applied to the deferred tax balance above at 30 June 2011, would be to further reduce the Group 
deferred tax assets by approximately £1.9 million and the Company deferred tax assets by approximately £2.1 million.  Business review Governance Financial statements

16) Fair value hierarchy of financial assets 
The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of inputs used in making the measurements.  
– Level 1: Valuation is based upon a quoted market price in an active market for an identical instrument.  
– Level 2: Valuation techniques are based upon observable inputs, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).  
– Level 3: Valuation techniques use significant unobservable inputs.  
The fair value hierarchy of financial assets as at 30 June can be analysed as follows: 
 
2011 
Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total 
2010 
Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total 
Non-current assets held-for-sale (net of non-current liabilities held-for-sale) – 46.2 – 46.2 – 26.7 – 26.7

The fair value of non-current asset investments was assessed using level 2 inputs under the three-level hierarchy introduced by IFRS 7. 
18) Non-current assets and non-current liabilities held-for-sale 
Where Group companies inject seed capital into funds operated and controlled by the Group, the fund is classified as being held-for-sale. 
Typically, if the fund remains under the control of the Group for more than one year from the original investment date it will cease to be 
classified as held-for-sale, and will be consolidated line by line. In determining whether to execute the reclassification, the Group will have  
regard to the proximity of loss of control, and the extent to which consolidation of the fund on a line by line basis would be material to the 
presentation of the Group’s financial statements.

The Group’s maximum exposure to credit, liquidity, interest rate, foreign exchange and price risk in respect of these assets and liabilities is 
represented by their carrying value. The fair value of non-current asset and liabilities held-for-sale was assessed using level 2 inputs under the

Level 1 inputs were used to assess the fair value of the Group’s listed equities. 
20) Fair value of financial instruments 
There is no material difference between the carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and their fair values.  
The fair value of derivative financial instruments is determined by reference to published price quotations (Level 2 inputs).   74 Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2011
Notes to the financial statements continued 
21) Financial instrument risk management  
Group 
The Group is subject to business and strategy, investment and operational risk throughout its business as discussed in the business review. 
Specific areas of financial instrument risk include credit, liquidity, interest rate, foreign exchange and price risk. The effectiveness of the Group’s 
risk management process is, therefore, critical to its soundness and profitability and considerable resources are dedicated to this area. 
Risk management is the direct responsibility of the Group’s senior management. The Ashmore Group Risk Management and Control 
department and the Group’s Risk and Compliance Committee (“RCC”) are responsible for monitoring the overall risk environment. The Group 
has established a control environment which seeks to ensure that risks are reviewed regularly and that all risk controls operating throughout the 
Group are in accordance with regulatory requirements. In addition, as a regulated business the Group is responsible for maintaining appropriate 
capital and performing regular calculations of capital requirements, including the development of an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment 
Process (“ICAAP”), based upon the Financial Services Authority’s methodologies under the Capital Requirements Directive. An overview of the 
ICAAP can be found on our website at www.ashmoregroup.com.  
• Credit risk 
The Group has exposure to credit risk from its normal activities where the risk is that a counterparty will be unable to pay in full amounts when 
due. The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying value of its financial assets. 
Financial assets subject to credit risk at 30 June 2011 and 30 June 2010 are as follows:

Total excluding trade and other receivables  469.4 420.2
Trade and other receivables 14 68.2 45.7
Total   537.6 465.9
At 30 June 2011 there were nil overdue trade and other receivables (2010: nil). All trade and other receivables are considered to be fully 
recoverable. 
Management has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis.  
Trade and other receivables at amortised cost 
Financial assets at amortised cost principally comprise fee debtors, which are all less than 90 days old. 
Fee debtors arise principally within the Group’s investment management business and amounts are monitored regularly. Historically, default 
levels have been insignificant, and, unless a client has withdrawn funds, there is an ongoing relationship between the Group and the client. 
There is no significant concentration of credit risk in respect of fees owing from clients. 
Financial assets – available-for-sale 
Such assets comprise cash and cash equivalents, and debt and equity instruments in seeded funds. 
The Group’s cash and cash equivalents are short-term deposits with banks and liquidity funds which have credit ratings ranging from  
A to AAAm as at 30 June 2011 (2010: A to A+). 
Financial assets and liabilities held at fair value 
Such assets comprise derivative financial instruments with positive and negative fair values. 
• Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group cannot meet its obligations as they fall due or can only do so at a cost. In order to manage inherent 
liquidity risk there is a liquidity policy within the Group to ensure that there is sufficient access to funds to cover all forecast committed 
requirements for the next 12 months.  
The table below analyses the Group’s financial assets and liabilities. The amounts disclosed are the contractual undiscounted cash flows and are 
all due within one year, except for commitments which are greater than one year.

• Interest rate risk 
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market 
The principal interest rate risk is the risk that the Group will sustain a reduction in interest revenue through adverse movements in interest rates. 
This relates to bank deposits held in the ordinary course of business.  
At 30 June 2011, if interest rates over the year had been 200 basis points higher or 40 basis points lower (2010: 200 basis points higher  
or 45 basis points lower) with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year would have been £7.5 million higher/£1.5 million 
lower (2010: £6.6 million higher/£1.5 million lower), mainly as a result of higher/lower interest on cash balances. 
The assumption that the fair value of assets and liabilities will not be affected by a change in interest rates was used in the model to calculate 
the effect on post-tax profits.

The Group’s revenue is almost entirely denominated in US dollars, while the Group’s cost base during the year is largely Sterling-based. 
Consequently, the Group has an exposure to movements in the US$/£ exchange rate. 
The Group’s policy is to hedge this net foreign exchange exposure by using a combination of forward foreign exchange contracts and/or options 
for up to two years forward. The Group also sells US dollars at spot rates when opportunities arise.  
At 30 June 2011, if the US dollar had strengthened/weakened by 10 cents against Sterling with all other variables held constant, profit before 
tax for the year would increase/decrease by £3.5 million/£3.1 million respectively (2010: £11.1million/£9.7 million). 
The Group also holds a number of seed capital investments, as shown on the balance sheet, which are denominated in Brazilian Real or  
US dollars. Any such seed investments give rise to foreign exchange risk. Foreign exchange gains and losses arising on the Group’s seed capital 
investments are taken to equity along with the mark-to-market movements in the period. At 30 June 2011, if the Brazilian Real and US dollar 
had, in aggregate, strengthened/weakened by one per cent against Sterling with all other variables held constant, the impact on net assets  
as a result of the Group’s seed capital positions would be an increase/decrease of £0.9 million/£0.9 million (2010: £0.6 million/£0.6 million).  
The impact on profit before tax would be nil (2010: nil).  Business review Governance Financial statements

• Price risk 
Price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of market changes. 
The Group’s direct exposure to price risk is in respect of the seed capital investments it holds on its balance sheet. These can be either debt or 
equity instruments, where the Group’s exposure is restricted to the carrying value of the assets or liabilities. At 30 June 2011, a 5% movement 
in the fair value of these investments would have a £4.4 million (2010: £3.3 million) impact on net assets. The impact on profit before tax would 
be nil (2010: nil). 
There is also indirect price risk in connection with the Group’s AuM and its associated management and performance fees. These are diversified 
across a range of investment themes and not measurably correlated to any single market indices in emerging markets. Based on the year end 
assets under management of US$65.8 billion, and a sensible medium-term average net management fee rate of 80bps, a 5% movement in 
assets under management would have a US$26.3 million impact on management fee revenues. Performance fee revenues could be reduced  
in severe market conditions, however, throughout Ashmore’s history the policy of having funds with year ends staged throughout the financial 
year has meant that in periods of steep market decline, some performance fees have still been recorded. The profitability impact is likely to be 
less than this, as cost mitigation actions would apply, including the reduction of the variable compensation paid to employees.  
• Hedging activities 
Included within the realised and unrealised hedging gains of £1.8 million (note 3) recognised at 30 June 2011 (£4.8 million loss at  
30 June 2010) are: 
– A £1.3 million gain in respect of foreign exchange hedges covering net management fee income for the financial year ending  
30 June 2011 (2010: £1.6 million loss); and 
– A £0.5 million gain in respect of crystallised foreign exchange contracts (2010: £3.1 million loss). 
Financial year ending 30 June 2012 foreign exchange options and forward contracts 
The options and forward contracts have been assessed as effective cash flow hedges at 30 June 2011. Time value in relation to the Group’s 
hedges is excluded from being part of the hedging item and, as a result, a net unrealised gain arising on the hedges of £1.3 million (2010:  
£1.6 million loss) has been recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year ended 30 June 2011, being the 
movement in the time value of the hedges in the financial year. 
The £0.1 million intrinsic loss (2010: £0.6 million loss) on the Group’s hedges has been recognised through other comprehensive income.  
Nil intrinsic value (2010: nil) was reclassified from equity to the statement of comprehensive income in the year. The cumulative fair value of  
the outstanding foreign exchange hedges liability at 30 June 2011 was £0.6 million (2010: £1.8 million).  
This treatment will continue so long as the hedges and forward contracts are assessed as being highly effective. Intrinsic value gains and losses 
are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as the corresponding hedged cash flows crystallise. 
The hedges protect a proportion of the Group’s revenue cash flows from foreign exchange movements and occur consistently throughout the 
year. The maturity profile of the Group’s outstanding hedges is shown below.

27) Acquisitions 
Emerging Markets Management LLC 
On 31 May 2011 the Group acquired an effective 62.94% stake in Emerging Markets Management LLC which was subsequently renamed 
Ashmore EMM LLC (“AshmoreEMM”) an emerging markets equity investment management company established in 1987 and based in 
Arlington, Virginia (close to Washington DC). 
The acquisition was in line with Ashmore’s strategy to grow its equity investment theme which at the year end represented approximately 15% 
of the combined AuM. AshmoreEMM expands and diversifies Ashmore’s product offerings, revenue streams and client base both by geographic 
location and client type. 
The total fair value of purchase consideration was £93.0 million (US$153.0 million), consisting of an upfront cash payment of £49.5 million 
(US$81.5 million), satisfied from Ashmore’s existing cash resources, the issue of 4,359,437 new Ashmore ordinary shares valued at £15.4 million 
(US$25.4 million) and contingent consideration valued at £28.1 million (US$46.1 million). The number of shares issued as part of the initial 
consideration, which are subject to certain trading restrictions for three years, was fixed at 31 May 2011 based on the average trade price over 
the previous ten days. Issue costs of the shares were negligible. 
The contingent consideration represents a potential earnout payable in three annual instalments in December of 2011, 2012 and 2013, 
dependent on AshmoreEMM management fee revenues for those years. The potential undiscounted value of all future payments that the  
Group could be required to make under this arrangement is between nil and a maximum of £73.8 million (US$118.4 million). The fair value  
of the contingent consideration was calculated by reference to possible scenarios, weighted according to management’s estimates of their 
probabilities and discounted using the Group’s weighted average cost of capital of 13.0%. The undiscounted value of the estimated payments  
is £33.4 million (US$55.0 million). At maturity, contingent consideration will be settled using a combination of cash and new Ashmore ordinary 
shares at the prevailing market price. Ashmore have the option to pay up to 25% of such consideration as equity. 
Acquisition related expenses of £1.3 million (US$2.2 million) have been charged to the income statement in the period to 30 June 2011 and 
included in other expenses – professional fees (note 6). 
Tangible net assets acquired had a fair value of £13.8 million (US$22.7 million) on acquisition. No fair value adjustments were made to the 
carrying value of the tangible net assets. Trade receivables have not been discounted as they largely represent accrued management fees which 
are considered fully recoverable. 
The goodwill of £50.8 million (US$83.5 million) arising on the acquisition is principally attributable to the value expected to be derived from the 
acquired platform through future growth, additional business from new clients, and the value of the assembled workforce. No goodwill has 
been allocated to the non-controlling interest. 
Of the goodwill arising on acquisition, £18.4 million (US$30.3 million) is deductible for tax purposes in the United States over a fifteen year 
period. This amount excludes the goodwill resulting from contingent consideration. To the extent that further consideration becomes payable, 
further goodwill will be recognised for tax purposes and amortised over the remaining part of the 15 year life of the goodwill. The deduction  
for the month (and year) ended 30 June 2011 was £0.1 million (US$0.2 million). 
On acquisition, 19.2% of AshmoreEMM shares were fully vested and held by the employees and management of AshmoreEMM. Employees 
and management also held unvested shares representing 17.9%. As the unvested shares have performance conditions related to continued 
employment, these are accounted for as share-based payments in accordance with IFRS2 Share-Based Payment, which will result in an  
annual charge to the income statement in the period to vesting of £5.4 million (US$8.6 million). The NCI of £12.9 million (US$21.2 million) on 
acquisition represents the share of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired attributable to the vested shares held by the employees and 
management of AshmoreEMM. The recognition of share-based payment charges over the five year period to vesting will lead to an increase  
of the NCI to 37.06%, although the actual percentage held by the NCI may vary as a result of the sale of vested NCI shares, the forfeiture of 
unvested units or the issue of further awards of unvested shares in line with the Group’s longstanding equity compensation culture. 
The discount applied to the contingent consideration will unwind until the time when the final payment is made in December 2013.  
The amount charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year ended 30 June 2011 was £0.5 million  
(US$0.7 million). This unwind of the discount will result in a charge to the income statement of £3.7 million in FY2011/12, £1.2 million  
in FY2012/13 and £0.2 million in FY2013/14. 
The revenue included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income since 1 June 2011 contributed by AshmoreEMM was  
£3.9 million. AshmoreEMM also contributed profit before tax of £2.1 million over the same period. 
Had AshmoreEMM been consolidated for the full financial year from 1 July 2010 to 30 June 2011, the consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income would show total revenue across the Group of £382.3 million and profit after tax of £208.1 million. 
Subsequent Adjustment 
Under IFRS 3, a measurement period of up to one year can be utilised to assess the valuation of net assets acquired as the result of the 
acquisition. Separate to the contingent consideration, there is a contracted adjustment to the initial share consideration scheduled for  
30 September 2011, which is the only adjustment to initial consideration, goodwill and assets currently anticipated. This “true up” mechanism is 
designed to align the upfront purchase price paid with the revenue earning capability of the underlying AuM that existed at the acquisition date.  82 Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2011

The Group held 50.0% of the equity of an associate, VTB-Ashmore Capital Holdings Limited as at 30 June 2011 (2010: 0%) 
The Group held 30.0% of the equity of an associate, Everbright Ashmore, as at 30 June 2011 (2010: 30%). 
The Group’s share of net assets of the associates is currently below the carrying value of the investment reflected on the consolidated balance 
sheet. This is considered to be a temporary position which has arisen as the associates progress through an initial establishment phase.  
No permanent impairment is believed to exist and as such the carrying value of the investment in associates has not been adjusted.  
No profit has been recognised in the Group’s consolidated statement of comprehensive income in respect of its share of associates profit for  
the year as a result of the net asset position of the associates. This treatment will continue to be applied until the Group’s share of associates’ 
net assets returns to a level greater than the carrying value of the investment. 
The Group has undrawn capital commitments of £21.6 million (2010: £15.1 million) to investment funds managed by the associates.

32) Post-balance sheet events 
There were no post-balance sheet events that required adjustment of or disclosure in the financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2011. 
33) Accounting estimates and judgements 
Estimates and judgements used in preparing the financial statements are continually evaluated and are based upon management’s assessment 
of current and future events. The principal estimates and judgements that have a significant affect on the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities are discussed below. 
The Group tests goodwill and intangible assets annually for impairment. The recoverable amount is determined based upon value in use 
calculations prepared on the basis of management’s assumptions and estimates. The carrying value of goodwill and intangibles on the Group’s 
balance sheet at 30 June 2011 was £103.2 million (2010: £6.7 million). 
The Group assesses the recognition of performance fees to determine whether receipt of the fees is considered probable and the amount 
reliable. The assessment is made using management’s judgement of the circumstances relevant to each performance fee entitlement.  
There were no outstanding performance fees receivable at 30 June 2011 (2010: none).  
The Group assesses the expected payments to be made under earnout arrangements to determine whether the estimates are reasonable based 
on current information. The assessment is made using management’s judgement of the likelihood of the conditions of the earnout being met. 
The combined liability of all earnout arrangements on the Group’s balance sheet at 30 June 2011 was £32.0 million. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
It is possible that this document could or may contain forward looking statements that are based on current expectations or beliefs, as well as 
assumptions about future events. These forward looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate only to historical or 
current facts. Forward looking statements often use words such as anticipate, target, expect, estimate, intend, plan, goal, believe, will, may, 
should, would, could or other words of similar meaning.  
Undue reliance should not be placed on any such statements because, by their very nature, they are subject to known and unknown risks and 
uncertainties and can be affected by other factors that could cause actual results, and the Group’s plans and objectives, to differ materially from 
those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements. There are several factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from 
those expressed or implied in forward looking statements. Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those 
described in the forward looking statements are changes in the global, political, economic, business, competitive, market and regulatory forces, 
future exchange and interest rates, changes in tax rates and future business combinations or dispositions. The Group undertakes no obligation 
to revise or update any forward looking statement contained within this document, regardless of whether those statements are affected as a 
result of new information, future events or otherwise. 86 Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2011

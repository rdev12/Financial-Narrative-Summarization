Chairman’s and Chief Executive Officer’s statement
Strategy
We are pleased to report that we 
have made good progress during the 
year towards our vision of becoming 
a leading North West service provider 
and one of the best UK water and 
wastewater companies, as we aim to 
deliver the best service to customers, 
at the lowest sustainable cost and in a 
responsible manner. We have delivered 
a third year-on-year improvement in 
customer satisfaction, underpinned by 
good operational and environmental 
performance and remain on course to 
deliver our regulatory outperformance 
targets. We do, however, recognise that 
we have more to do to achieve our vision 
and we see considerable opportunities 
to deliver further improvements.
The UK Government’s reform agenda 
for our sector is providing new 
opportunities for the company. The 
adoption of private sewers, which almost 
doubled the size of our wastewater 
network, went well. In anticipation of 
this change we revised our approach to 
management of our wastewater network 
and this has delivered higher levels 
of customer satisfaction at a slightly 
lower cost than originally estimated. We 
are also active in the expanding retail 
water market for business customers; 
we have won customers in Scotland 
and have a significant pipeline of 
further opportunities. Water and sludge 
trading are both opportunities that we 
are exploring with our regulators in 
discussions aimed at developing ideas 
tabled under the UK Government’s 
reform agenda.
The North West presents a unique set of 
challenges for the company, containing 
areas of outstanding natural beauty, a 
long coastline supporting tourism and 
a significant proportion of the UK’s 
remaining industrial base. Our plans 
must maintain a challenging balance 
between the needs of our customers 
and the natural environment. We 
recognise that we operate in a region 
characterised by high levels of socio-
economic deprivation and that our 
future plans must take account of our 
customers’ ability to pay a fair price 
for our services, particularly in these 
difficult economic times. Increasingly, 
our plans will be delivered through 
partnerships such as ‘Turning Tides’; a 
partnership between the company, the 
Environment Agency, local authorities 
and other stakeholders to address 
improvements in North West bathing 
water quality to meet new European 
standards.
A fair deal for customers
We have continued to invest in our 
people, assets, systems and processes 
to improve the service our customers 
can expect of us. We expect to 
reinvest around £200 million of capital 
expenditure outperformance over the 
2010‒2015 period for the benefit of our 
customers and the environment.
We have implemented active pressure 
management in our water network to 
reduce bursts and leakage, helping us 
to meet or outperform our leakage 
target again. Should we have a burst, the 
additional investment completed during 
the year in strategic mains refurbishment 
and connectivity has improved the 
capability of our water network to 
maintain supply. We have again achieved 
a high level of water quality compliance 
throughout the year.
Whilst the North West did not 
experience the hosepipe bans seen 
elsewhere in the country last spring, 
rainfall across the region was much 
lower than expected. We were able 
to benefit from our investment in an 
integrated regional water network to 
keep customers supplied throughout the 
dry period. We are considering extending 
our integrated network to include 
the north west of Cumbria thereby 
improving security of supply to this area.
In contrast, the latter half of 2012 was 
characterised by a large number of 
exceptionally high rainfall events and 
this proved to be a testing time for 
our wastewater assets. We continued 
to invest heavily in schemes designed 
to mitigate the risk of flooding of our 
customers’ homes and to improve river 
and bathing water quality, such as our 
£100 million+ project in Preston. Our 
operational and environmental focus is 
delivering results and we were pleased 
to achieve our best performance for 
Dr John McAdam, Chairman
Steve Mogford, Chief Executive Officer
“We have delivered 
a third year-on-year 
improvement in 
customer satisfaction, 
underpinned by 
good operational 
and environmental 
performance and 
remain on course to 
deliver our regulatory 
outperformance 
targets”

many years in the Environment Agency’s 
operational performance metrics. Our 
wastewater network will continue to 
benefit from significant investment 
going forward as we adapt to weather 
patterns likely to result from climate 
change. 
The North West contains over half of 
the one per cent most deprived areas in 
England and we recognise the financial 
difficulties many of our customers 
face. We are supporting customers in 
these tough economic times through 
a portfolio of measures to help those 
struggling to pay their water bills, 
including £5 million per year investment 
in our charitable trust. Our support 
measures and emphasis on helping 
customers back onto manageable 
payment plans has enabled us to contain 
levels of bad debt and so decrease the 
cost burden on all our customers. 
We have continued to develop our 
systems and processes to deliver the 
experience our customers seek when 
they need to contact us, including multi-
channel contact centre technology. 
We have delivered a number of 
improvements throughout the year and 
were pleased to see this reflected in a 
significant improvement in customer 
satisfaction for the third successive 
year. 
We were also pleased to see the results 
of our brand tracker survey which rated 
us highly against 10 leading service 
providers operating in the North West. 
Notwithstanding good progress, we 
could have done more to prevent the 
need for unnecessary contacts from our 
customers and we will continue in our 
efforts to improve further our service 
and responsiveness. 
Investing for performance
Capital investment in our assets was 
accelerated in 2012/13 to deliver a 
number of beneficial projects early 
and reduce the risk associated with 
projects due to be delivered in the 
last two years of the 2010‒15 period. 
Investment of £787 million in the year is 
up on last year’s spend of £680 million. 
We have now invested over £2 billion 
in the first three years of the 2010‒15 
period, and we remain on track to deliver 
our planned five-year investment 
programme.
 
Our investment programme represents 
a significant contribution to the 
North West economy. Our capital 
investment of around £3.5 billion 
over the 2010‒15 period provides 
an estimated £7 billion boost to the 
region’s economy, supporting 9,000 jobs, 
and securing a legacy for the future. 
As we look ahead to the next price 
review, we are actively engaging with 
our customers and stakeholders to help 
address their needs and to shape our 
plans for the period 2015 to 2020.
Attractive deal for shareholders
Good underlying operational 
performance, effective capital 
programme delivery and improving 
levels of customer satisfaction are 
delivering value for our shareholders. 
Revenue increased by 4.5 per cent to  
£1.64 billion and underlying operating 
profit was up 2.2 per cent to  
£607 million in the continuing difficult 
economic conditions. Underlying 
earnings per share increased by 
11 per cent to 39.1 pence. We remain 
on track to deliver operating 
expenditure outperformance against 
the regulatory allowance.
We are committed to delivering our 
dividend policy of RPI+2 per cent  
per annum through to at least 
2015 while delivering significant 
improvements for customers and the 
environment. In line with this policy, the 
board is proposing a final dividend of 
22.88 pence per ordinary share making 
a total of 34.32 pence per share for the 
2012/13 financial year. This represents 
an increase of 7.2 per cent compared 
with last year. The final dividend is 
expected to be paid to shareholders on  
2 August 2013. 
A changing regulatory landscape
The UK Government published a draft 
Water Bill in July 2012, proposing 
the expansion of retail competition 
and the introduction of wholesale, or 
upstream, competition. We, along with 
various interested parties, submitted 
our response to these proposals to the 
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 
(Efra) Select Committee and we await 
publication of the UK Government’s 
Water Bill with interest. 
Following a period of constructive 
dialogue with Ofwat, we were pleased to 
accept the revised licence modification 
proposals which were published by the 
regulator on 21 December 2012. These 
revised licence proposals focus on 
the changes required to facilitate the 
forthcoming 2014 price review (PR14).
Ofwat published its PR14 methodology 
consultation in January 2013 and we 
submitted our response to Ofwat in 
March.

Chairman’s and Chief Executive Officer’s statement continued
In preparation for this more competitive 
environment and to align with the 
separated price controls, with effect 
from April 2013 we have revised our 
structure and activities around three 
business areas: Wholesale; Domestic 
Retail; and Business Retail.
Our employees
The people in United Utilities are key 
to the delivery of the highest levels 
of service to our customers and we 
would like again to thank them for their 
dedication and continued hard work 
during the year. 
We strive to continuously improve our 
safety culture and we have implemented 
a number of initiatives throughout the 
year. We launched our employee guide 
for health and safety responsibilities and 
introduced a set of behavioural standards 
at our main office sites, called the ‘Safety 
Six’ .  Health and safety will remain a 
significant area of focus for us.
A committed, capable and motivated 
workforce is central to delivering our 
vision and we remain fully focused on 
maintaining high levels of employee 
development and engagement. We are 
always looking for the best and the 
brightest talent and we are pleased to 
say that we extended our apprentice 
programme during the last year. We 
currently employ over 80 apprentices 
and plan to recruit up to 40 apprentices 
each year through to at least 2015. 
Alongside this, we are continuing to 
expand our graduate recruitment 
scheme, with plans to add over  
20 graduates in 2013/14 in addition  
to more than 35 we currently employ.
Our board
Our plc structure and governance 
standards ensure that our board and non-
executive directors continue to provide 
sound and prudent oversight in full 
compliance with the principles of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code. In addition, 
we are the only UK water company to 
have achieved and retained ‘World Class’ 
status in the Dow Jones Sustainability 
Index over the last five years, reflecting 
our high standards of governance. Indeed, 
we are one of only two water companies 
globally to reach this high standard. 
On behalf of the board, we say thank 
you and farewell to Paul Heiden who will 
stand down at this year’s annual general 
meeting after over seven years as a non-
executive director. We wish Paul all the 
best for the future.
We are pleased to welcome Brian May 
to the board as a non-executive 
director following his appointment last 
September. Brian is also finance director 
at Bunzl plc. His expertise will be an 
asset to the board and he will replace 
Paul as chair of both the audit and risk 
committee and the treasury committee.
Outlook
We believe that our sustained focus on 
customer satisfaction and operational 
performance is delivering results for 
customers, shareholders and our other 
stakeholders. We continue to be on track 
to meet our regulatory outperformance 
targets, with substantial financing and 
operating outperformance already 
secured. Our capital structure remains 
robust and we have a sustainable 
dividend policy that targets real growth 
through to at least 2015. 
Looking ahead, our focus remains centred 
on driving further customer satisfaction, 
alongside operational and environmental 
improvements and we believe there is 
still plenty of scope to achieve this. We 
are now preparing our business plan 
for the next Price Review, as we aim to 
address the needs of our stakeholders, 
support the environment and our regional 
economy, while recognising the need to 
keep bills affordable for our customers.

Responsible business
As a board we are responsible to our shareholders, customers and other 
stakeholders for the performance and long-term success of our company. The 
way in which we operate, we believe, reflects the highest standards of corporate 
governance. 
We continue to listen to the views of all our stakeholders and endeavour to 
develop, manage and operate in an environmentally sustainable, economically 
beneficial and socially responsible manner. In recognition of the company’s 
continued focus on responsible business, we retained our ‘World Class’ rating, as 
measured by the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for 2012, attaining our highest 
ever score. We also retained our ‘Platinum Big Tick’ ranking in Business in the 
Community Corporate Responsibility Index and were awarded membership of the 
FTSE 350 Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index. We are proud that we are one of 
only four FTSE 100 companies to hold all three awards.
The communities in which we operate are of great importance to our business and 
we have continued our investment in these communities of the North West both 
financially and in terms of employee time through volunteering. For example, our 
‘Pathways’ volunteering scheme, delivered by our employees, provides practical 
help and support to people who have struggled to find work.

Our business
Our industry
Every day, over 50 million household and 
non-household consumers in England 
and Wales receive water and wastewater 
services. There are currently 10 licensed 
companies which provide both water 
and wastewater services to consumers 
in their respective regions. Additionally, 
there are licensed companies which 
provide water only services and tend 
to be smaller in size. As each company 
in the water sector operates as a 
regional monopoly for the majority of its 
services, they are subject to regulation 
in terms of both price and performance.
The privatisation of the industry 
over two decades ago has been 
widely perceived as a success. It has 
led to improvements in the quality 
of services provided to customers, 
higher environmental standards and 
superior quality drinking water at lower 
estimated costs to customers than if the 
water sector was still owned by the UK 
Government. The water sector economic 
regulator, Ofwat, estimates that water 
bills are on average more than £100 
lower per annum than they otherwise 
would have been. The water industry 
currently invests around £80 million 
a week in maintaining and improving 
assets and services.
Our customers
We provide services to approximately 
three million households in our region 
and this generates around two-thirds 
of our total revenues. We also serve 
approximately 200,000 businesses, 
ranging in size from large manufacturing 
companies down to small shops.
Our households pay just over £1 per day 
on average for the combined water and 
wastewater services we provide. Over the 
2010‒15 period, our customers’ average 
annual bill will fall by £9 before the impact 
of inflation. Our objective is to continue to 
provide our customers with high quality 
drinking water to meet all their daily 
needs and environmentally responsible 
wastewater collection and treatment at a 
price to customers that represents good 
value for money.
We are continuing to invest in our assets 
and systems for the benefit of our 
customers. During the five-year period 
to 2015, we have a capital investment 
programme of approximately £3.5 billion. 
We would again expect a substantial 
investment programme for the 2015‒20 
period as we strive to further improve 
service and meet stringent environmental 
obligations. Capital investment in the 
2015‒20 period will help us deliver our 
five promises to our customers: 
  to provide great water; 
  to remove wastewater;
  to protect and enhance the 
environment;
  to provide customer service they can 
rely on; and
  to deliver value for money.
Water and wastewater operations
Almost 2,000 million litres of water is 
supplied every day to approximately  
3.2 million homes and businesses. Water 
is collected from catchment land and 
other sources and stored in reservoirs 
before being treated and then delivered 
via a network of pipes to homes and 
industry. A large proportion of the water 
supplied flows freely by gravity and does 
not need to be pumped, reducing energy 
consumption and the carbon impact on 
the environment.
Wastewater is collected using a network 
of sewers and treated before being 
returned safely to the environment. 
A by-product of the treatment of 
wastewater is sewage sludge, which 
is treated further to produce an end 
product suitable for safe disposal while 
providing renewable energy generation.

Our business model and strategy continued
Regulatory environment
As services in England and Wales are not 
provided in competitive markets, with 
only large business customers currently 
able to choose their supplier, the 
industry is subject to regulation.
Economic regulation
Economic regulation is the responsibility 
of an independent body, Ofwat, whose 
primary duties are:
  to protect the interests of 
consumers, wherever appropriate by 
promoting effective competition; 
  to ensure that companies properly 
carry out their functions; and
  to ensure that companies can finance 
their functions. 
As part of its periodic review Ofwat sets 
limits on the average annual increase 
in charges that a water company can 
impose across each price control period 
(usually five years).
The regulatory capital value (RCV) of 
a water company is a measure of its 
capital base which is used when Ofwat 
sets price limits. Capital expenditure 
to enhance and maintain the network 
as well as inflation is added to the RCV, 
while depreciation is deducted.
An allowed return on the RCV is set by 
Ofwat to ensure water companies can 
secure a reasonable return on their 
capital in order to finance their functions. 
Operating costs (subject to an efficiency 
target) as well as depreciation and tax 
are added to this allowed return. In 
addition, adjustments depending on each 
company’s relative performance are 
added or deducted to derive the allowed 
revenue for each water company.
Based on each company’s calculated 
allowed revenue across the regulatory 
period, Ofwat publishes annual price 
limits in its final price determination. The 
price limits for each company are set 
by reference to inflation as measured 
by the retail prices index (RPI), plus an 
adjustment factor known as ‘K’ . 
Ofwat’s approach to setting price limits 
for the 2010 - 2015 regulatory period.

Our current price limits (published in November 2009) 
UUW’s profile of price limits for the five-year period 1 April 2010 to 31 March 2015 
is set out below:  
Y ear 2010/11 2011/12 2012/13 2013/14 2014/15
K factor -4.3% -0.2% +0.6% +1.0% +1.2%
A company’s annual ‘K’ factor therefore 
shows the amount by which it is allowed 
each year to change its price above or 
below inflation.
Price cap regulation in the UK is 
performance-based and companies 
are incentivised to be efficient in 
terms of their operating costs, capital 
programmes and financing. The benefit 
of any efficiency savings achieved 
through effective management is 
retained by the companies for a period 
of up to five years, after which time the 
benefit is passed to the customers via 
the subsequent price setting process. 
The cost of any under-performance, 
or failure to deliver specified output 
requirements, due to poor management 
is borne by the company. Companies 
are also incentivised to provide high 
standards of service and can be 
penalised if these standards are not 
achieved, primarily by means of an 
adjustment to the ‘K’ factor at the 
subsequent price review.
Ofwat’s final determination of price 
limits for UUW was based on: 
  a capital investment programme of 
approximately £3.5 billion; 
  12 per cent, or approximately  
£900 million, real growth in the RCV 
over the five years;
  an average annual underlying 
operating efficiency improvement 
of 1.2 per cent for the water service 
and 2.4 per cent for the wastewater 
service; and
  a return on capital of 4.5 per cent 
(post-tax, real).
Every year, all water companies are 
required to publish details of their annual 
financial and operational performance. 
Ofwat uses this information and other 
data to monitor and compare companies’ 
performance both individually and 
relative to the other water companies 
across a wide range of measures. This 
includes key performance indicators such 
as Service Incentive Mechanism (SIM), 
Serviceability and Leakage (see page 19). United Utilities Group PLC

Our business model and strategy continued
Environmental and quality regulation
The water and wastewater industry in the 
UK is subject to substantial domestic and 
European Community regulation, placing 
significant statutory obligations on water 
and wastewater companies with regard 
to, amongst other factors, the quality 
of treated water supplied, wastewater 
treatment and the effects of their 
activities on the natural environment. 
All water and wastewater companies 
have a general duty to exercise 
their powers to protect and, where 
appropriate, enhance the natural 
environment and to promote the efficient 
use of water. Environmental regulation 
is the responsibility of the Secretary of 
State for Environment, Food and Rural 
Affairs together with: 
  the Environment Agency (EA), which 
is responsible for conserving and 
redistributing water resources and 
securing their proper use, including 
the licensing of water abstraction. 
The EA also regulates discharges 
to controlled waters. The EA 
produces a composite assessment 
measuring the relative annual 
environmental performance of the 
10 water and wastewater companies. 
This is included as one of our key 
performance indicators, see page 19;
  the Drinking Water Inspectorate, 
which enforces drinking water quality 
standards; and
  Natural England, which is responsible 
for the protection of designated sites 
for nature conservation, e.g. Sites of 
Special Scientific Interest. There is 
a statutory requirement to manage 
these sites to protect and enhance 
biodiversity. 
Future regulation
In January, Ofwat published its 
methodology statement which provides 
a roadmap for the 2015‒20 price review 
period. This statement confirmed that 
there will be separate price controls 
for water companies’ wholesale water, 
wholesale wastewater, retail household 
and retail business operations, whereas 
currently there is only one overall price 
control.
Separate retail price controls aim to 
provide retail businesses with greater 
incentives and focus on delivering 
efficient service to business customers 
as competition expands and also to 
household customers under a new 
average cost to serve approach. This 
proposed retail household model 
allows water companies to only charge 
its customers an amount based on 
the average costs of the industry, 
although the details of how this will be 
implemented are still being discussed. 
Ofwat is safeguarding investment in the 
sector by protecting the existing asset 
base of companies, allocating all RCV to 
the wholesale business. It is also 
 refining the way companies’ operating 
and capital costs are assessed to 
encourage companies to utilise the most 
efficient, sustainable solutions under a 
new ‘ totex’ model.
Greater emphasis is being placed on 
customer views and we are already 
embracing this approach, actively 
engaging with our customers to shape 
our business plan to meet their needs. 
Ofwat is also encouraging more flexible 
and sustainable use of water by 
increasing the incentives to trade  
water between regions as there has 
been little water trading between 
companies to date.
We, along with other stakeholders, 
submitted a response to Ofwat’s 
methodology consultation in March. 
A final methodology statement is 
expected to be published by Ofwat this 
summer. We are already in the process of 
preparing our draft business plan for the 
2015‒20 period and we are scheduled 
to present this to Ofwat in December 
2013. Ofwat is planning to publish its 
final determination for the 2015‒20 
period by the end of 2014.
Further developments in the 
environmental and quality regulatory 
regime are expected to take effect in 
the next few years, in particular as a 
result of European Union environmental 
initiatives (including the Water 
Framework Directive and the revised 
Drinking Water Directive). The Water 
Bill, announced in the Queen’s speech  
on 8 May 2013, will also affect the 
regulatory environment in which  
we operate. 
Regulatory risks
Given the complex legal and regulatory 
environment within which we operate, 
there are a range of risks to which we 
are exposed. Risks can be in the form of 
possible non-compliance with existing 
laws or regulations or failure to meet 
the terms of our current 2010‒15 
regulatory contract. We also face risks 
in relation to potential future changes 
in legislation or regulation, particularly 
with regard to the 2015‒20 price review 
period. See pages 32‒37 for more 
details in respect of these risks.
Customer views help shape the future
Customers and wider stakeholders across the North West are helping shape our 
plans for the future. We have sought the views of almost 13,000 customers to 
understand their needs and priorities and this has generated a set of customer 
promises which will drive the benefits our business can deliver for them, the 
environment and the regional economy over the next 25 years.
Those views and opinions are also influencing and shaping what we need to do 
now, over the next five-year business plan period, from 2015‒2020, as part of 
the water sector’s price review process. This is focusing what we invest in for 
the customers we serve and making sure that is balanced with the cost of that 
service, so our customers think their bills are reasonable. The quality of our 
customer engagement and how well we develop a plan based on those priorities 
and needs is being independently verified by a Customer Challenge Group. Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 unitedutilities.com

Competitive environment
Competitors
One of our fundamental medium to long-
term goals is to become one of the best 
UK water and wastewater (or sewerage) 
companies (WaSC). Our main competitors 
are the other nine WaSCs which operate 
across England and Wales. As the diagram 
to the right shows, we are the second 
largest WaSC based on regulatory capital 
value and we, along with these other nine 
companies, comprise the vast majority of 
the total water and wastewater sector.
Although their relative sizes are 
generally far smaller than the water 
and wastewater companies, the 
remaining water only companies are also 
important competitors as their relative 
performances are included in Ofwat’s 
published comparative information. 
In line with our aspiration to be one of 
the leading service providers in the 
North West, we benchmark our customer 
service performance against other 
large service providers in the region. In 
addition, as a publicly listed FTSE 100 
company, the other UK and European 
listed utilities are competitors from an 
investment perspective.
Direct competition
Aside from comparative competition, 
there are two main forms of direct 
competition in the water and wastewater 
industry: new appointments or variations 
and water supply licensing. 
New appointments or variations
A new appointment or variation is made 
when an existing undertaker is replaced 
by a new undertaker as the supplier 
of water and/or wastewater services 
for a defined area. Instances of new 
appointments or variations have been 
relatively rare, with less than 50 granted 
across the industry since privatisation 
in 1989.
Water supply licensing
Water supply competition was opened 
up in December 2005, when very large 
non-household customers (those with  
an annual consumption of at least  
50 megalitres of water a year at each 
site) were allowed to choose their water 
supplier. A water undertaker is obliged 
to allow a licensed water supplier to use 
its network for this purpose, subject 
to payment of charges and certain 
conditions and rights of refusal. 
In December 2011, this market was 
opened up further, with the threshold 
being reduced to five megalitres a 
year. To date very few customers have 
switched supplier in England and Wales. 
Future competition
Looking ahead, the UK Government’s 
Draft Water Bill, published in July 
2012, proposed that the water supply 
threshold will be reduced further to 
zero for non-household customers and 
also be expanded to include sewerage 
as well as water services, with a target 
date of 2017 at the earliest. This will 
effectively open up retail competition 
for all business customers. The UK 
Government has not expressed any 
intention to expand competition to 
include household customers.
We are exploiting the opportunity 
presented by the expansion of retail 
competition for business customers 
and have already assembled a strong 
team. We have applied for and secured 
a licence to operate in Scotland and 
we have won our first customers there. 
We have a strong pipeline of further 
opportunities and look forward to 
developing our position outside of our 
region as the market opens in England.
 For more details on our performance 
go to page 20.
The Draft Water Bill also proposed the 
future introduction of wholesale, or 
upstream, competition (for example 
the input of raw or treated water into a 
water company’s network or the removal 
of wastewater for treatment). Scrutiny 
of the draft bill by the Efra Select 
Committee provided the opportunity 
for all interested parties to comment 
on the draft bill’s provisions. The Select 
Committee published its report on the 
draft bill in February 2013 and we now 
await the Government’s Water Bill with 
interest.

Economic environment
UK gross domestic product has continued 
to stagnate during 2012/13 and the 
equity markets experienced another 
volatile year, albeit boosted as concerns 
over the European debt crisis have 
abated somewhat recently. Bond yields 
have remained at relatively low levels 
throughout 2012/13.  This has been 
beneficial to our future cost of debt 
as in March 2013 UUW raised a new  
£100 million, 10-year index-linked bank 
loan and as we continued with our 10-
year rolling interest rate hedge strategy.
While RPI inflation has come down 
from the very high levels seen over the 
previous two financial years (peaking 
at 5.6 per cent in September 2011), it 
has remained higher than the long-term 
trend. Our revenues and asset base are 
linked to inflation (as explained in the 
economic regulation section on page 
10), so the high recent levels of inflation 
have increased our reported revenue 
and RCV. We also have a large quantity 
of index-linked debt which means our 
finance costs increase as inflation rises, 
providing a partial economic offset to 
revenue, although it should be noted that 
both revenues and financing costs are 
based on differing lagged measures of 
inflation and so do not provide a perfect 
hedge. Higher RPI inflation can also 
lead to operating cost pressures as a 
number of our costs have either direct or 
indirect links to inflation. 
The North West of England continues 
to face a particularly tough economic 
environment. The North West 
unemployment rate, having increased 
by more than any other UK region in 
2011/12, remained above the national 
average, at 8.0 per cent for the quarter 
ending March 2013, compared to 7.8 per 
cent nationally. A report ‘Department 
for Communities and Local Government, 
Indices of Deprivation 2010’ , published 
in March 2011, highlighted that the 
North West had more of the most 
deprived areas in England than any 
other region. 
Commercial volumes have shown 
a downward trend in recent years, 
impacted by the persisting tough 
economic climate.  Bad debt also 
remains a risk to which we are exposed, 
although Ofwat currently recognises 
this through a special factor allowance. 
Debt management continues to be a 
significant area of focus for us as we 
seek to use best practice in the recovery 
of debt and in helping customers back 
into making regular payment through 
use of manageable payment plans.

continues to be a 
significant area of 
focus for us”

Our approach to doing business
We believe that responsible business 
should be embedded within everything 
we do and this should be evident across 
all of our activities. 
We are committed to delivering our 
services in a responsible way and our 
approach to responsible business 
practice is set out in our Business 
Principles document. This states that 
for United Utilities, being a responsible 
business means:
Providing a great service to our 
customers
Working to protect and enhance 
our environment
Actively supporting our local 
communities
Supporting our employees to 
achieve their full potential in a 
safe workplace
Delivering good value to our 
stakeholders and managing our 
supply chain fairly
We’ve explained these in more detail 
below:
Customers: Our aim is to protect public 
health and provide excellent services 
to our customers. This means removing 
the need for customers to contact us 
unnecessarily to taking ownership of 
queries, satisfactorily resolving them 
as quickly as possible and keeping our 
customers informed along the way. We 
aim to provide bills that represent good 
value for money.
Environment: Whether it’s treating 
and delivering drinking water for 
our customers or returning treated 
wastewater to rivers and the sea, we’re 
acutely aware of our responsibility to 
the environment. We continue to invest 
to protect and, where appropriate, 
enhance the natural environment 
of the North West. We continue to 
consider the impacts of climate change 
on the services we deliver and adapt 
accordingly.
Communities: The communities in which 
we operate are of great importance 
to our business ‒ it is where our 
customers and employees live and 
work. We continue to invest in our 
local communities both financially and 
through employee volunteering. We 
recognise the effect that our operations 
can have upon the community and invest 
in programmes that support affected 
areas or help tackle current social 
issues.
Employees: Health and safety is 
paramount and we strongly focus on 
our health and safety performance. 
High employee engagement is a key 
contributor to our performance and 
we place significant emphasis on 
maintaining and strengthening levels of 
engagement. Our policies on maternity, 
paternity, adoption, personal and 
special leave go beyond the minimum 
required by law. For disabled applicants 
and existing employees, we are 
committed to fulfilling our obligations in 
accordance with the relevant legislation. 
Applicants with disabilities are given 
equal consideration in the application 
process. 
Disabled colleagues have equipment and 
working practices modified for them as 
far as possible and wherever it is safe 
and practicable to do so.
Delivering good value: We are 
committed to honouring our 
responsibility to our shareholders, 
credit investors and those who provide 
us with goods and services. We aim to 
operate as effectively as possible at the 
lowest sustainable cost and to retain a 
robust and sustainable financial profile 
to provide enduring shareholder value. 
We work with suppliers whose business 
principles, conduct, and standards 
align with our own. Our key suppliers 
have committed to our Sustainable 
Supply Chain Charter, supporting us in 
the delivery of wider social, economic 
and environmental benefits. More 
detail on the regulatory environment in 
which we operate is provided on pages 
10‒12. This annual report provides a 
comprehensive financial and operational 
review to help inform our investors of 
our performance.
Running our business with integrity
Given the long life of our infrastructure, 
we take a long-term view of our 
operations and our aim is to deliver our 
strategic objectives in a responsible, 
sustainable way. Acting responsibly is 
fundamental to the manner in which we 
undertake our business and the group 
has for many years included corporate 
responsibility (CR) factors as a strategic 
consideration in its decision making. 
Our board-level CR committee (see 
page 44) develops and oversees our 
CR strategy and this continuing focus 
helped the group retain our Dow Jones 
Sustainability Index ‘World Class’ rating 
and our ‘Platinum Big Tick’ ranking in the 
Business in the Community CR Index. 
Details of our responsible business 
performance for the year can be found 
on pages 24‒25, with further detailed 
information in our Business Principles 
document and in our CR report on our 
website at:

Our business model and strategy continued
Key value drivers
We create value principally by 
delivering our regulatory contract. This 
means meeting Ofwat’s allowances 
on operating, financing and capital 
expenditure and achieving our required 
customer outcomes while avoiding 
penalties. In the current 2010‒15 
period, we are delivering a substantial 
capital investment programme of 
approximately £3.5 billion, providing 
benefits for our customers and the 
environment. This, along with RPI 
inflation, grows the RCV or asset base of 
our business. 
Outperforming the regulatory contract, 
by delivering the requirements for less 
than Ofwat has allowed, creates further 
value. Conversely, poor performance, 
such as not delivering the requirements 
on time to specification or in an 
inefficient manner, can reduce the  
value creation.
Growth in shareholder value is a 
combination of share price appreciation 
and dividends paid. Share price 
appreciation relates to growth in 
the RCV. Our disciplined investment 
approach in growing the RCV helps 
support the retention of a robust capital 
structure and sustainable real growth in 
the dividend.
Operating in the North West region, 
the number of customers we serve is 
relatively stable. The main driver to 
revenue is the allowed change in price 
we charge our customers, which is 
determined by Ofwat’s price control 
model (as explained in the economic 
regulation section on pages 10‒11). 
There will also be some impact due 
to changes in consumption from our 
metered customers and over recent 
years, in the persisting tough economic 
conditions, consumption has shown a 
downward trend, particularly for our 
business customers.
We aim to deliver customer benefits 
and long-term shareholder value by 
providing the best service to customers, 
at the lowest sustainable cost and in a 
responsible manner.
Best service to customers
It is important for our business to 
perform well operationally and customer 
focus is one of our core values. Providing 
the best service to our customers will 
help us to strengthen our reputation and 
help us improve our efficiency. It will 
also ensure we are in a strong position 
to compete as the business market for 
retail customers evolves. Ofwat can also 
apply financial incentives or penalties 
depending on our performance, both 
absolute and relative to our peers, such 
as its customer service measure, SIM. 
The regulator can also require us to 
incur additional unfunded expenditure 
if, for example, we are not adequately 
sustaining our assets through its 
serviceability assessment. 
Ofwat’s SIM measure   
‒ key value driver
Our customer experience programme, 
first established in 2010/11, has 
helped us to better understand the 
needs and issues of our customers 
and we have introduced a range of 
initiatives to drive performance 
improvements in this area and we 
have many more in the pipeline. 
Having been in last place of the 
water companies under Ofwat’s SIM 
measure at the start of the regulatory 
period, we are targeting a top 
quartile position in the medium-term. 
2013/14 is the final year of three 
over which companies’ SIM scores 
will be measured for the purpose 
of penalties or rewards at the next 
price review and we are committed 
to achieving the best position we can 
by the end of this final measurement 
year.
Innovative ideas to reduce costs and 
customer disruption
As part of our ‘Future Concept of Design and Assembly’ we have moved the 
construction of some of the key parts of our capital projects away from a 
traditional construction site. Instead, these assets are manufactured in a 
controlled environment in one of our factories or workshops before being 
transported to site. As well as being less disruptive for our customers, this is 
also saving on production time as well as time on site, reducing our overall costs. 
It also allows us to maintain a consistently high quality of asset and reduces the 
risk of employee accidents. Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 unitedutilities.com

Lowest sustainable cost
As the price control mechanism restricts 
revenues, not profits, this encourages 
us to control or reduce our costs to the 
lowest possible sustainable levels with 
the aim of outperforming efficiency 
targets set by Ofwat.
Operating costs are the largest expense 
to our company and minimising our 
costs across areas such as employee 
costs, power, materials, property 
rates and service costs is important 
in order to add value to our company. 
However, minimising costs needs to 
be done on a sustainable basis and not 
to the detriment of customer service 
or long-term value. We have a strong 
focus on innovation to help optimise 
the management of our assets and 
networks, which helps us identify and 
resolve operational issues before they 
impact the customer, thereby also 
improving our efficiency.
In terms of financing costs, Ofwat allows 
all water companies an industry-wide 
fixed return on debt over the regulatory 
period in order to efficiently finance 
their businesses. For the 2010‒15 
period, this was set at 3.6 per cent plus 
inflation (pre tax). We can generate 
financing outperformance by locking-
in a lower cost of borrowing than this 
assumed rate. At each price review, 
Ofwat takes account of the rates at 
which companies have raised debt, along 
with other factors. At the last price 
review in 2009, Ofwat reduced allowed 
returns, which is providing a beneficial 
impact on customer bills during the 
current regulatory period.
Outperformance of regulatory 
contract ‒ key value driver
Through an efficient capital structure, 
supporting a solid A3 credit rating 
from rating agency Moody’s, we aim 
to secure debt at a lower average rate 
than Ofwat’s cost of debt allowance 
for the 2010‒15 period.  
Through the effective 
implementation of our cost control 
measures, we are targeting operating 
expenditure outperformance over 
the 2010‒15 period on top of a tough 
£150 million efficiency challenge 
from Ofwat.
Through our disciplined investment 
approach, we aim to achieve capital 
expenditure outperformance 
compared to the 2010‒2015 
regulatory allowance.  
Responsible manner
We are acutely aware of our 
responsibility to the environment and 
we are committed to delivering our 
services in a responsible and sustainable 
manner. This approach not only provides 
environmental benefits, but is important 
for our reputation and helps the delivery 
of sustainable profits. Our regulators 
can require us to incur additional 
unfunded expenditure if, for example, 
we fail to meet our leakage targets or 
can issue fines if we fail to meet certain 
environmental targets.
We know that the success of our 
business is driven by the talent, 
engagement and commitment of our 
employees. We respect the rights of our 
people and enable everyone to make 
their best contribution. We provide 
competitive rewards to attract and 
retain employees and recognise high 
achievement alongside investing in our 
employees’ learning and development.
Leakage performance  
‒ key value driver
Our strong, year round operational 
focus on leakage has enabled us again 
to meet our annual leakage target, 
as set by Ofwat, making us one of 
the best performers in the industry. 
As well as the water resource and 
customer supply benefits, this 
has ensured we have avoided any 
unfunded expenditure requirements 
from our regulators and we are 
targeting to continue to meet this 
leakage target every year going 
forward. United Utilities Group PLC

Key performance indicators
We focus on a range of financial and operational KPIs to help assess our performance. We believe that the KPIs defined below 
provide a rounded view as to how we are performing against our primary objectives, helping us on our path to reaching our long-
term vision. These KPIs encompass the important areas of customer service and environmental performance, as well as financial 
indicators, taking into consideration the interests of all our stakeholders.
Financial KPIs
In respect of our financial KPIs, we use underlying profit measures as these enable more meaningful comparisons of the 
year-on-year performance of our business.

the stripping out of fair value movements. Underlying taxation strips out any prior year adjustments, 
exceptional tax or any deferred tax credits or debits arising from changes in the tax rate from reported 
taxation. A reconciliation between profit after taxation and underlying profit after taxation is shown on

Operational performance
Supporting our drive to improve 
operational performance, last year 
we put in place a revised management 
structure with a strong focus on 
accountability and delivery. We moved 
from our previous functional structure, 
to an organisational structure where 
managers are responsible for end-to-
end delivery of capital projects and 
operational performance within their 
respective regions, providing a more 
integrated approach. We have refined 
our organisational structure further 
in preparation for a more competitive 
environment and to align with the 
separated price controls that will apply 
at the 2014 price review. With effect 
from April 2013, we have revised our 
structure and activities around three 
business areas: Wholesale; Domestic 
Retail; and Business Retail.
We continue to make good progress 
towards our objective of becoming a 
leading North West service provider 
and one of the best UK water and 
wastewater companies. We are pleased 
to have been consistently ranked third 
out of 10 leading organisations in the 
North West, through an independent 
brand tracker survey which is undertaken 
quarterly. We are behind Marks & 
Spencer and John Lewis, but ahead 
of seven other major organisations 
covering utilities, telecoms, media and 
banking services. We have made further 
operational improvements during the 
year and have improved our performance 
relative to our water sector peers.
United Utilities aims to deliver long-
term shareholder value by providing:
The best service  
to customers
At the lowest  
sustainable cost
In a responsible manner
Best service to customers
We believe in delivering a fair deal for 
our customers and have continued to 
invest in our people, assets, systems 
and processes to improve the service 
our customers can expect of us.  In 
addition, we expect to reinvest around 
£200 million of capex outperformance 
over the 2010-15 period for the benefit 
of our customers and the environment.
Robust water supply and reliability – 
We have implemented active pressure 
management in our water network to 
reduce bursts and leakage, helping us to 
meet or outperform our leakage target. 
Should we have a burst, the additional 
investment completed during the year 
in strategic mains refurbishment and 
connectivity has improved the capability 
of our water network to maintain supply.  
Whilst the North West did not 
experience the hosepipe bans seen 
elsewhere in the country last spring, 
rainfall across our region was much 
lower than expected. We were able 
to benefit from our investment in an 
integrated regional water network to 
keep customers supplied throughout the 
dry period. 
Overall, our customers continue to 
benefit from our robust water supply 
and demand balance and high levels of 
water supply reliability. We have again 
achieved a high level of water quality, 
with mean zonal compliance continuing 
to be over 99.9 per cent. 
Major scheme in Preston to improve  
river and bathing waters
We are undertaking a £100 million+ project in Preston, which is designed to 
improve both river water and bathing water quality. The project involves building 
a 3.5 kilometre storm water storage tunnel and the construction of shafts to 
divert storm water flows, helping to retain large volumes of water during heavy 
rainfall. It will reduce the number of spills to the River Ribble from combined 
sewers and should deliver significant improvements to North West bathing 
waters and the Ribble Estuary in the Blackpool area. This is one of our largest 
projects in the 2010-15 period and is now nearing completion. United Utilities Group PLC

Performance continued
Investing to mitigate sewer flooding –  
The latter half of 2012 was 
characterised by a large number of 
exceptionally high rainfall events 
and this proved to be a testing time 
for our wastewater assets. We were 
disappointed to miss our Ofwat target in 
respect of the number of sewer flooding 
incidents, but have continued to invest 
heavily in schemes designed to mitigate 
the risk of flooding of our customers’ 
homes. Our wastewater network will 
continue to benefit from significant 
investment going forward as we adapt 
to weather patterns likely to result from 
climate change.
Improving customer service 
performance – We have continued to 
develop our systems and processes to 
deliver the experience our customers 
seek when they need to contact 
us, including multi-channel contact 
centre technology. This has helped 
us deliver further improvements in 
our performance on Ofwat’s service 
incentive mechanism (SIM), reflecting 
our continuing strong focus on dealing 
with customer enquiries. The number 
of customer complaints made to the 
Consumer Council for Water (CCW) 
in 2012/13 has reduced by a further 
11 per cent, compared with 2011/12. 
We are pleased to report that the 
total number of escalated complaints 
assessed by the CCW was zero in the 
2012/13 financial year, which is the first 
time we have achieved this. This has 
helped us improve our SIM performance 
further, as detailed in the KPIs section 
to the right, although our qualitative SIM 
score for the last quarter of 2012/13 
saw us slip back against the trend 
achieved in the first three quarters. 
We ended the year in 14th place in the 
sector on this measure, up two places 
on the previous year. Encouragingly, we 
have recently received our qualitative 
SIM score for the first quarter of 
2013/14 and we achieved 10th position 
out of the 21 water companies. 
Asset serviceability – We have a 
range of actions to help support the 
serviceability of our assets. We are 
improving the robustness of our water 
treatment processes, refurbishing 
service reservoir assets, continuing 
with our comprehensive mains cleaning 
programme and are optimising water 
treatment to reduce discoloured 
water events. To help reduce sewer 
flooding, the actions include incident 
based targeting to focus on areas 
more likely to experience flooding, 
effective intervention in cleaning and 
rehabilitation or refurbishment of 
sewers and advising customers about 
items not suitable for sewer disposal. 
Our programme also includes 
defect identification through CCTV 
sewer surveys, along with continual 
improvement of wastewater reporting 
systems to enable real time operational 
information to be made visible at all 
management levels and promote early 
intervention. Our comprehensive range 
of actions has helped us meet our 
water and wastewater serviceability 
standards, as detailed in the KPIs 
section opposite.
Retail competition for business 
customers – We have been building 
our capability to help ensure we are 
in a strong position to compete as the 
business market for retail customers 
evolves. We secured a water supply 
licence in 2012 to compete in Scotland 
and have built a team with a deep retail 
background in the utility and commercial 
sectors. Although the financial benefits 
from retail activities are relatively small 
at this stage, the market will evolve 
and business customers are looking 
for services over and above meter 
reading and billing. We are delivering a 
range of value-added services, such as 
on-site engineering solutions and water 
efficiency advice. We are pleased to 
have extended our presence and have 
now won several business customers 
outside of our region. We also have a 
significant pipeline of opportunities, 
a number of which are multi-site 
customers. 
Improving customer service remains 
a significant area of continued 
management focus and we see plenty of 
opportunity to deliver further benefits 
for our customers.
Key performance indicators:
  Serviceability – Long-term 
stewardship of assets is critical 
and Ofwat measures this through 
its serviceability assessment 
(Ofwat defines serviceability 
as the capability of a system of 
assets to deliver a reference level 
of service to customers and to 
the environment now and in the 
future). Our range of actions has 
helped us return our wastewater 
infrastructure assets to a ‘stable’ 
rating, from a ‘marginal’ rating, 
and we are now meeting our 
serviceability standards. We are 
currently assessed as ‘improving’ 
for our wastewater non-
infrastructure assets and ‘stable’ 
for our water infrastructure, water 
non-infrastructure and wastewater 
infrastructure assets. The aim is to 
continue to hold at least a ‘stable’ 
rating for all four asset classes, 
which is aligned with Ofwat’s 
target.
  Service incentive mechanism 
(SIM) – UU made significant 
progress on Ofwat’s combined 
SIM assessment for 2011/12, 
moving up five places to 16th of 
the 21 water companies, compared 
with 2010/11. This represented 
the largest overall SIM score 
improvement in the industry. 
Further progress has been made 
in 2012/13, with a quantitative 
score of 179 points, representing 
a further 34 per cent improvement 
compared with 2011/12. On 
the qualitative measure, UU has 
improved its 2012/13 average 
score by 0.25 points to 4.43 points, 
moving up two further places to 
14th position, which represents 
sixth place among the 10 water and 
sewerage companies. Our continued 
progress is encouraging, as we aim 
to move to the first quartile in the 
medium-term. Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 unitedutilities.com

Lowest sustainable cost
We are continuing to implement a wide 
range of initiatives to help optimise our 
performance and deliver sustainable 
efficiencies.
Materials – Our asset optimisation 
programme continues to provide the 
benefits of increased and more effective 
use of operational site management to 
optimise power and chemical use and 
the development of more combined heat 
and power assets to generate renewable 
energy. 
Proactive network management – We 
are implementing a more proactive 
approach to asset and network 
management, with the aim of improving 
our modelling and forecasting to enable 
us to address more asset and network 
problems before they affect customers, 
thereby reducing the level of reactive 
work and improving efficiency.
Energy costs – We have substantially 
locked in the cost of our power 
requirements through to 2014/15, via 
hedging, securing outperformance. 
Although power unit costs for 2013-15 
have been secured at higher levels than 
those for 2011/12, this still delivers 
additional outperformance versus the 
regulatory contract.
Debt collection – We are continuing 
to enhance our proactive approach to 
debt collection and are implementing 
a detailed action plan. The North West 
faces a particularly tough economic 
environment, with unemployment having 
increased at a faster rate than any other 
UK region in 2011/12, particularly in 
the second half, resulting in an adverse 
impact on customers' ability to pay this 
year. 
Although North West unemployment 
improved in 2012/13, it remains higher 
than the position at March 2011 and 
is still above the national average. We 
recognise the financial difficulties 
facing many of our customers and 
provide a range of options to help our 
customers who are struggling to pay 
their bills, including our charitable trust, 
and we have helped many customers 
back onto manageable payment plans. 
Despite the tough economic climate, 
our range of actions have helped us 
to again deliver a good performance 
and we have sustained bad debts at 
2.2 per cent of regulated revenue for 
2012/13, consistent with last year.
Pensions – UU placed its pension 
provision on a more sustainable footing 
in 2010 and has subsequently taken 
additional steps to de-risk the pension 
scheme further, with the group now 
benefiting from a small pension surplus. 
Further details on the group’s pension 
provision are provided in the pensions 
section on page 29.
Capital delivery – The business is 
strongly focused on delivering its 
commitments efficiently and on time 
and has a robust commercial capital 
delivery framework in place for the 
2010-15 period. We have improved 
our internal Time: Cost: Quality index 
(TCQi) score from around 50 per cent in 
2010/11 to approximately 90 per cent 
in 2012/13. This means we have met our 
target two years ahead of schedule and 
we are firmly focused on sustaining this 
substantial improvement. This helped 
us accelerate our capital programme 
to help optimise capital delivery and 
reduce risk towards the end of the 
regulatory period. Regulatory capital 
investment in 2012/13, including  
£161 million of infrastructure  
renewals expenditure, was £787 million, 
an increase of 16 per cent compared  
with last year. This increase of over  
£100 million means that our cumulative 
investment across the first three years 
of the 2010-15 period is now just over 
£2 billion, reflecting a smoother and 
more effective investment profile 
than the previous five-year cycle. We 
remain on track to deliver the five-
year programme within the regulatory 
allowance of around £3.5 billion 
and we are reinvesting any capex 
outperformance to deliver further 
customer benefits. We expect to 
deliver around £800 million of capital 
investment in 2013/14.
Regulatory commitments – Delivering 
our regulatory commitments is key, not 
only in terms of service to customers 
and the environmental impact, but 
also in respect of shareholder value. 
UU received a shortfalling revenue 
penalty of over £80 million at the last 
price review in 2009. Shortfalling is 
effectively where a company fails to 
deliver agreed requirements on time or 
to specification. We are strongly focused 
on meeting our regulatory commitments, 
as we aim to avoid, or at least minimise, 
any shortfalling revenue penalties at the 
2014 price review. We are making good 
progress and we have delivered all of our 
capital investment Environment Agency 
commitments this year. This represents 
a much improved performance, so far, 
compared with the 2005-10 regulatory 
period, and we will continue to treat this 
as a priority area. 
Private sewers – The transfer of private 
sewers around 18 months ago has gone 
well and is now embedded within our 
‘business as usual’ activities. The volume 
of work and the level of expenditure 
continues to be a little below our 
expectations. The mix of work continues 
to relate more to enhancement capex 
than opex, compared with what we 
initially expected at the onset. 
Our operating model has evolved 
to reflect the revised work scope 
and volumes. In addition to routine 
maintenance activity, we are enhancing 
the quality of the assets where 
appropriate. This will bring the private 
sewer infrastructure more in line with 
our asset standards and will reduce 
the risk of future problems for our 
customers. In 2012/13, we spent 
£8 million on opex, £11 million on 
infrastructure renewals expenditure and 
£14 million in relation to enhancement 
capex. Although spend rates remain a 
little lower than we anticipated, we are 
still only 18 months into the transfer 
so we are not changing our 2011-15 
total cost estimate of £160 million 
(£40 million opex, £60 million 
infrastructure renewals expenditure and 
£60 million enhancement capex) at this 
stage. This lower rate of spend and the 
mix of work continues to be positive for 
both our customers and our investors. United Utilities Group PLC

Key performance indicators:
  Financing outperformance – UU 
has secured over £300 million 
of financing outperformance 
across the 2010-15 period, when 
compared with Ofwat’s allowed 
cost of debt of 3.6 per cent real, 
based on an average RPI inflation 
rate of 2.5 per cent per annum.  
We expect to reinvest around 
£40 million of our financing 
outperformance in unfunded 
private sewers costs.
  Operating expenditure 
outperformance – The business 
is targeting total operating 
expenditure outperformance over 
the 2010-15 period of at least 
£50 million, or approximately 
two per cent, compared with the 
regulatory allowance.  This is in 
addition to the base operating 
expenditure efficiency targets set 
by Ofwat, which equate to a total 
of approximately £150 million 
over the five years.  We have now 
delivered cumulative operating 
expenditure outperformance of 
around £50 million in the first 
three years of the regulatory 
period and are ahead of schedule. 
  Capital expenditure 
outperformance – UU is 
continuing to deliver significant 
efficiencies in the area of capital 
expenditure and expects to 
meet Ofwat’s allowance after 
adjusting, through the regulatory 
methodology, for the impact 
of lower construction output 
prices.  We expect to reinvest 
around £200 million of capital 
expenditure outperformance for 
the benefit of our customers and 
the environment.
Performance continued
Responsible manner
Acting responsibly is fundamental to 
the manner in which we undertake our 
business and the group has for many 
years included corporate responsibility 
factors as a strategic decision in its 
decision making. 
Leakage – We were pleased to beat our 
regulatory leakage target in 2012/13. 
This reflects our year round operational 
focus and the implementation of a 
range of initiatives, such as active 
pressure management. Our leakage 
performance, alongside the network 
resilience improvements we are making, 
are helping us to maintain a robust 
water supply and demand balance and 
deliver high levels of reliability for our 
customers.
Improving rivers and bathing water 
quality – We have a range of capital 
projects which are delivering significant 
customer and environmental benefits. 
Our Liverpool wastewater treatment 
works expansion project, at around 
£200 million, is our largest capital 
programme in this regulatory cycle. The 
project will enhance the capacity of the 
works so it can treat up to 11,000 litres 
of wastewater per second. The project 
is progressing well and the higher 
standards of treatment will continue 
the rejuvenation of the River Mersey 
and improve bathing waters across 
the river on the Wirral. It also provides 
a significant contribution to the local 
economy. The extended works are 
expected to come online in early 2016.
Reducing our carbon footprint – We 
are committed to reducing our carbon 
footprint and increasing our generation 
of renewable energy. Our carbon 
footprint for 2012/13 was 524,264 
tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, a 
minor increase of 0.4 per cent compared 
with last year. This was as a result of 
an increase in the amount of electricity 
purchased as we undertook additional 
pumping activity. Not only did we 
experience one of the wettest years 
on record, resulting in significantly 
more wastewater in our sewers and 
treatment works, the year began and 
ended with a prolonged dry spell, so we 
needed to pump additional volumes of 
water around our integrated network. 
We were pleased to retain the Certified 
Emissions Measurement and Reduction 
Scheme certification for our carbon 
accounting methodology. We remain on 
track to meet our target of a 21 per cent 
reduction in carbon emissions by 2015 
(measured from a 2005/06 baseline).  
UU has consistently generated around 
100 GWh of renewable electricity 
annually for the past four years, 
principally from sludge processing.  
By 2014, we expect to have finished 
commissioning an innovative  
£100 million+ recycling and energy plant 
at one our largest wastewater treatment 
works at Davyhulme, near Manchester. 
By treating sludge that is left over at 
the end of the wastewater treatment 
process, we can generate enough 
electricity from biogas to power the 
Davyhulme site. Sludge is also converted 
into a valuable agricultural fertiliser. 
Environmental performance – This is a 
high priority for UU and we were pleased 
to report the lowest number of major 
pollution incidents of the 10 water and 
wastewater companies, per kilometre  
of pipe, for 2011/12 (the latest 
available assessment). Our operational 
and environmental focus is delivering 
results and we were pleased to achieve 
our best performance for many years in 
the Environment Agency’s performance 
metrics, where we have been rated as an 
‘above average performer’ , as detailed in 
the KPIs section on the next page.
Employees – A committed, capable 
and motivated workforce is central 
to delivering our vision and we remain 
strongly focused on high levels of 
employee development and engagement. 
We continue to be successful in 
attracting and retaining people and 
we were pleased to also extend our 
apprentice programme during the 
last year. We currently employ over 
80 apprentices and plan to recruit up 
to a further 40 apprentices each year 
through to 2015. Alongside this, we 
are continuing to expand our graduate 
recruitment scheme, with plans to add 
more than 20 graduates in 2013/14. This  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 unitedutilities.com

is in addition to over 35 graduates we 
currently employ. As part of our health 
and safety improvement programme, 
we implemented a number of initiatives 
throughout the year and launched a 
set of behavioural standards at our 
main office sites, called the ‘Safety 
Six’ . Health and safety will continue to 
be a significant area of focus for the 
company, as we strive for continuous 
improvement.
Communities – We continue to support 
community partnerships, which help 
in meeting our company objectives. 
For example, our partnership with UTV 
Media takes an online programme into 
schools to enable them to create a radio 
advert (part of the national curriculum) 
linked to one of our key campaigns, 
such as water efficiency or reservoir 
safety. With an emphasis on promoting 
the adverts through social media, this 
provides an innovative way for our 
key messages to reach our customers. 
Education is an integral part of our 
community approach and our new 
outreach education partnership started 
this year and has already reached  
139 schools and 4,754 children. 
Where we cause disruption as part of 
our major capital works, we invite local 
community groups to apply for small 
scale grants to support their work. Last 
year we contributed to 116 groups in  
10 locations across the North West. We 
also contributed approximately  
£2 million supporting local communities 
providing debt advisory services 
and undertook over 26,000 hours of 
employee volunteering.
Leading credentials – Our environmental 
and sustainability performance across 
a broad front has received external 
recognition. UU continues to be 
rated ‘World Class’ in the Dow Jones 
Sustainability Index and has retained 
the highest ranking, ‘Platinum Big Tick’ , in 
Business in the Community’s Corporate 
Responsibility Index. In addition, UU 
holds membership of the FTSE 350 
Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index. UU 
is one of only four FTSE 100 companies 
to hold all three awards. 
Key performance indicators:
  Leakage – UU met its economic 
level of leakage rolling target 
for the seventh consecutive year  
in 2012/13, with a performance 
of 457 megalitres per day 
versus the regulatory target of 
464 megalitres per day. The aim 
is to meet our regulatory leakage 
target each year.
  Environmental performance – On 
the Environment Agency’s latest 
assessment, which covers a broad 
range of operational metrics, 
UU has been rated as an ‘above 
average performer’ .  UU has three 
areas highlighted as ‘Green’ , four 
as ‘Amber’ , and, importantly, no 
areas highlighted as ‘Red’ on the 
traffic light reporting matrix.  
This would indicate third position 
among the 10 water and sewerage 
companies.  Although the EA has 
revised its performance measure, 
UU was in seventh position on the 
EA ’s composite assessment for the 
previous year, so this represents 
good progress against the 
medium-term goal of being a first 
quartile company on a consistent 
basis.
  Corporate responsibility – UU 
has a strong focus on corporate 
responsibility and is the only UK 
water company to have a ‘World 
Class’ rating as measured by the 
Dow Jones Sustainability Index.  
The group aims to retain this 
‘World Class’ rating each year.
Sustainable abstraction scheme restores 
Lancashire rivers
We have recently launched a pioneering scheme in conjunction with the 
Environment Agency (EA), which is restoring two rivers in the Trough of Bowland 
in Lancashire. This joint EA and UU project – one of the first of its kind in the 
country – will help the rivers prosper by only taking water from the rivers when 
it is plentiful, using two new abstraction plants. By restoring a more natural flow, 
there is a greater opportunity to enhance and protect fish and other habitats. 
To make up for any shortfall of water for homes in the Blackburn area, we are 
building a new £12 million pipeline to connect the local water treatment works to 
a nearby service reservoir.  United Utilities Group PLC

Performance continued
Financial performance
Revenue
UU has delivered a good set of 
financial results for the year ended 
31 March 2013. Revenue increased by  
£71 million to £1,636 million, principally 
reflecting a 5.8 per cent nominal  
(0.6 per cent real price increase plus  
5.2 per cent RPI inflation) regulated 
price increase, partially offset by 
reduced volumes and the ongoing impact 
of customers switching to meters. The 
impact of meter switching was in line 
with our expectations while commercial 
and domestic volumes continued to 
be impacted by the persisting tough 
economic climate. We would expect to 
recover a substantial element of any 
regulated revenue shortfall through the 
regulatory methodology.
Operating profit
Underlying operating profit increased by 
two per cent to £607 million, primarily 
as a result of an increase in revenue, 
largely offset by an expected increase 
in depreciation alongside higher 
infrastructure renewals expenditure, 
power and other operating costs. 
Reported operating profit increased by 
two per cent to £605 million.
Investment income and finance expense
The underlying net finance expense of 
£253 million was £14 million lower than 
last year, principally reflecting lower RPI 
inflation in respect of the group’s index-
linked debt with an eight-month lag. The 
indexation of the principal on index-
linked debt amounted to a net charge in 
the income statement of  
£86 million, compared with a net charge 
of £100 million last year. The group had 
approximately £2.9 billion of index-
linked debt as at 31 March 2013. The 
lower RPI indexation charge contributed 
to the group’s average underlying 
interest rate of 4.9 per cent being lower 
than the rate in 2011/12 of 5.5 per cent.
Reported investment income and 
finance expense of £300 million was 
£11 million lower than in 2011/12, 
principally reflecting a reduction in the 
underlying net finance expense. The  
£42 million net fair value loss in the year 
is largely due to losses on the regulatory 
swap portfolio, resulting from a further 
decrease in sterling interest rates during 
the period. The group uses these swaps 
to fix interest rates on a substantial 
proportion of its debt to better match 
the financing cash flows allowed by the 
regulator at each price review. The group 
fixed the majority of its non index- 
linked debt for the 2010-15 financial 
period, providing a net effective  
nominal interest rate of approximately 
five per cent.
Profit before taxation
Underlying profit before taxation was 
£354 million, £27 million higher than 
last year due to the £13 million increase 
in underlying operating profit and the  
£14 million reduction in underlying 
finance expense. This underlying 
measure adjusts for the impact of  
one-off items, principally from 
restructuring and reorganisation within 
the business, and fair value movements 
in respect of debt and derivative 
instruments. Reported profit before 
taxation increased by £24 million to 
£305 million. 
Taxation
The current taxation charge was 
£74 million in the year and the current 
taxation effective rate was 24 per cent. 
This compares with 16 per cent in 
the previous year which included a 
£16 million credit following agreement 
with the UK taxation authorities of 
prior years’ taxation matters. 
The group has recognised a net  
deferred taxation credit of £52 million 
for the year, which primarily relates to  
a £53 million credit in respect of the 
change substantively enacted by the  
UK Government on 3 July 2012 to reduce 
the mainstream rate of corporation 
taxation from 24 per cent to 23 per cent 
with effect from 1 April 2013. A 
net deferred taxation credit of 
£77 million was recognised in the 
previous year, which included a 
£105 million credit reflecting a two 
per cent staged reduction in the rate of 
corporation taxation.
An overall taxation charge of £22 million 
has been recognised for the year ended 
31 March 2013. Excluding the deferred 
taxation impact relating to the future 
reduction in the corporation taxation 
rate, the total taxation charge would 
have been £75 million or 25 per cent 
compared with a £74 million charge 
or 26 per cent in the previous year. 
This reduction is principally due to the 
decrease in the mainstream rate of 
corporation taxation from 26 per cent 
for 2011/12 to 24 per cent for 2012/13.
The taxation benefit of £16 million 
relating to pension contributions for 
deficit funding has been recorded in the 
statement of comprehensive income, 
rather than the income statement, as 
the actuarial movements giving rise to 
the deficit were previously recorded 
there. Deferred taxation movements 
of £26 million are also included in the 
statement of comprehensive income. 
The comparative prior year figures were 
a current taxation benefit of £33 million 
and a £29 million deferred taxation 
charge.
The group made cash taxation payments 
during the year of £55 million. This was 
higher than the group’s net taxation 
payment of £5 million in 2011/12 
primarily reflecting a £35 million cash 
taxation inflow last year relating to 
prior years’ taxation matters and also 
reflecting the higher levels of pension 
contributions made last year.
Profit after taxation
Underlying profit after taxation of  
£266 million was £25 million higher than 
the previous year, principally reflecting 
the increase in underlying profit before 
taxation. Reported profit after taxation 
was £282 million, compared with  
£311 million last year, as the increase in 
underlying profit was more than offset 
by a decrease in deferred taxation 
credits associated with the enactment 
of the reductions in corporation taxation 
rates between the two years. Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 unitedutilities.com
Governance Shareholder Information Business Review Financial Statements
22027.04      30/05/2013      Proof 5
27
Earnings per share
Underlying earnings per share increased 
from 35.3 pence to 39.1 pence. This 
underlying measure is derived from 
underlying profit after taxation. This 
includes the adjustments for the 
deferred taxation credits in both 
2012/13 and 2011/12, associated 
with the reductions in the corporation 
taxation rate. Basic earnings per share 
decreased from 45.7 pence to  
41.4 pence, mainly due to the higher 
deferred taxation credit in 2011/12. 
Dividend per share
The board has proposed a final dividend 
of 22.88 pence per ordinary share in 
respect of the year ended 31 March 
2013. Taken together with the interim 
dividend of 11.44 pence per ordinary 
share, paid in February, this produces  
a total dividend per ordinary share  
for 2012/13 of 34.32 pence. This is  
an increase of 7.2 per cent, compared 
with the dividend relating to the 
previous year, in line with group’s 
dividend policy of targeting a 
growth rate of RPI+2 per cent per 
annum through to at least 2015. The 
inflationary increase of 5.2 per cent 
is based on the RPI element included 
within the allowed regulated price 
increase for the 2012/13 financial 
year (i.e. the movement in RPI between 
November 2010 and November 2011). 
The final dividend is expected to be 
paid on 2 August 2013 to shareholders 
on the register at the close of business 
on 21 June 2013. The ex-dividend date is 
19 June 2013.
Cash flow 
Net cash generated from continuing 
operating activities for year ended 
31 March 2013 was £631 million, 
compared with £560 million last year. 
This mainly reflected a reduction in the 
total pension contribution payments 
between the two years. The group’s net 
capital expenditure was £642 million, 
principally in the regulated water and 
wastewater investment programmes. 
This excludes infrastructure renewals 
expenditure which is treated as an 
operating cost under International 
Financial Reporting Standards. 
Net debt including derivatives at 
31 March 2013 was £5,451 million, 
compared with £5,076 million at 
31 March 2012. This expected increase 
reflects expenditure on the regulatory 
capital expenditure programmes and 
payments of dividends, interest and 
taxation, alongside the accelerated 
pension deficit repair payments and an 
increase in the principal of our index-
linked debt, partly offset by operating 
cash flows. 
Debt financing and interest rate 
management
Gearing (measured as group net debt 
divided by UUW’s regulatory capital 
value adjusted for actual capital 
expenditure) marginally increased to 
60 per cent at 31 March 2013, compared 
with 59 per cent at 31 March 2012, and 
is in the middle of Ofwat’s 55 per cent to 
65 per cent assumed gearing range. The 
group now has a small pension surplus of 
£15 million, on an IFRS basis, compared 
with a deficit of £92 million as at 
31 March 2012.

Performance continued
At 31 March 2013, UUW had long-term 
credit ratings of A3/BBB+ and United 
Utilities PLC had long-term credit 
ratings of Baa1/BBB- from Moody’s 
Investors Service and Standard & Poor’s 
Ratings Services respectively. The split 
rating reflects differing methodologies 
used by the credit rating agencies. In 
December 2012, Standard & Poor’s 
put both the group’s ratings on positive 
outlook, citing improving financial 
metrics and operational performance. 
Cash and short-term deposits at  
31 March 2013 amounted to 
£202 million. In March 2013, UUW 
arranged a new £100 million, 10-year 
index-linked loan with an existing 
relationship bank. The group also 
renewed £150 million of existing bank 
facilities in the period. The group 
has headroom to cover its projected 
financing needs into 2015.
The group has access to the 
international debt capital markets 
through its €7 billion euro medium-term 
note programme which provides for the 
periodic issuance by United Utilities 
PLC and UUW of debt instruments on 
terms and conditions determined at the 
time the instruments are issued. The 
programme does not represent a funding 
commitment, with funding dependent 
on the successful issue of the debt 
securities.
Long-term borrowings are structured or 
hedged to match assets and earnings, 
which are largely in sterling, indexed to 
UK retail price inflation and subject to 
regulatory price reviews every five years. 
Long-term sterling inflation index-linked 
debt is the group’s preferred form of 
funding as this provides a natural hedge 
to assets and earnings. At 31 March 
2013, approximately 52 per cent of  
the group’s net debt was in index-linked 
form, representing around 31 per cent  
of UUW’s regulatory capital value, 
with an average real interest rate of  
1.7 per cent. The long-term nature of 
this funding also provides a good match 
to the company’s long-life infrastructure 
assets and is a key contributor to the 
group’s average term debt maturity 
profile which is approximately 25 years.
Where nominal debt is raised in a 
currency other than sterling and/or 
with a fixed interest rate, to manage 
exposure to long-term interest rates, 
the debt is generally swapped to create 
a floating rate sterling liability for 
the term of the liability. To manage 
exposure to medium-term interest 
rates, the group fixed interest costs for 
a substantial proportion of the group’s 
debt for the duration of the 2010-15 
period at around the time of the price 
review. 
Following the 2009 price review, the 
group reassessed its interest rate 
hedging policy with a view to further 
reducing regulatory risk. T o help address 
the uncertainty as to how Ofwat may 
approach the setting of the cost of 
debt allowance at the next price review 
in 2014, UU revised its interest rate 
management strategy to extend its fixed 
interest rate hedge out to a 10-year 
maturity on a reducing balance basis. The 
intention is that the effective interest 
rate, on the group’s nominal debt, in any 
given year will, over time, be a 10-year 
rolling average interest rate. UU believes 
that this revised interest rate hedging 
policy, which provides for a longer fixing 
of interest rates, will put the company 
in a more flexible position to respond to 
whatever approach Ofwat adopts to the 
industry cost of debt in future.

Liquidity
Short-term liquidity requirements are 
met from the group’s normal operating 
cash flow and its short-term bank 
deposits and supported by committed 
but undrawn credit facilities. In addition 
to its €7 billion euro medium-term note 
programme, the group has a €2 billion 
euro-commercial paper programme, 
both of which do not represent funding 
commitments. 
In line with the board’s treasury policy, 
UU aims to maintain a robust headroom 
position. Available headroom at  
31 March 2013 was £336 million based 
on cash, short-term deposits and 
medium-term committed bank facilities, 
net of short-term debt. This headroom is 
sufficient to cover the group’s projected 
financing needs into 2015.
UU believes that it operates a prudent 
approach to managing banking 
counterparty risk. Counterparty risk, 
in relation to both cash deposits and 
derivatives, is controlled through the 
use of counterparty credit limits. UU’s 
cash is held in the form of short-term 
(generally no longer than three months) 
money market deposits with either 
prime commercial banks or with triple A 
rated money market funds.
UU operates a bilateral, rather than 
a syndicated, approach to its core 
relationship banking facilities. This 
approach spreads maturities more 
evenly over a longer time period, thereby 
reducing refinancing risk and providing 
the benefit of several renewal points 
rather than a large single refinancing 
requirement. 
Pensions
As at 31 March 2013, the group had 
an IAS 19 net retirement benefit, 
or pension, surplus of £15 million, 
compared with a net pension deficit of 
£92 million at 31 March 2012. This  
£107 million positive movement 
principally reflects payments of 
£65 million in respect of accelerated, 
previously agreed, deficit repair 
contributions, payments under 
the inflation funding mechanism 
and investment returns exceeding 
expectation. Following the accelerated 
deficit repair contributions paid in 
the first half of 2012/13, the group 
completed early all scheduled deficit 
repair payments through to March 2015.
The group has sought to adopt a more 
sustainable approach to the delivery 
of pension provision and prior to the 
start of the 2010-15 period amended 
the terms of its defined benefit pension 
schemes. UU stated previously that it 
would continue to evaluate its pensions 
investment strategy to de-risk further 
its pension provision and introduced 
an inflation funding mechanism, which 
facilitates a move to a lower risk 
investment strategy. 
This allowed UU to reduce the allocation 
of its pension assets to approximately 
25 per cent in equities and other high 
risk assets, down from 48 per cent at  
31 March 2010. In addition, UU has 
adopted the use of more prudent 
longevity assumptions. Over the last 
two financial years, the group also 
progressively increased its interest 
rate hedge and this has now been 
extended to around 90 per cent of the 
pension scheme liabilities. Although any 
additional payments under the inflation 
funding mechanism would reduce 
financing outperformance, there would 
be a positive benefit to the pensions 
surplus or deficit position.
From an accounting perspective, IAS 19 
treats the inflation funding mechanism 
as a schedule of contributions rather 
than a pension scheme asset. This means 
that the liabilities position can change to 
reflect a change in market expectations 
of long-term inflation, without a 
commensurate movement in assets. This 
accounting treatment means that there 
is likely to be a degree of volatility in 
future IAS 19 pension valuations.
The last actuarial valuations of the 
United Utilities Pension Scheme and 
the United Utilities PLC Group of the 
Electricity Supply Pension Scheme 
were carried out as at 31 March 
2010. The valuations are performed 
on a triennial basis and, therefore 
discussions will take place over the 
coming months between the group and 
the trustees regarding the basis of the 
31 March 2013 valuations. The actuarial 
valuations are based on scheme specific 
factors which may result in a different 
assessment of the pension schemes' 
position to the IAS 19 numbers reported 
in the group's financial statements.

(obligations)') of these consolidated

Principal risks and uncertainties
We manage risk through line management supported by our corporate risk management framework which aims for continuous 
improvement. With an overarching mandate from and commitment by the group board, the framework consists of four key areas: 
governance; approach; guidance; and process.
The application of our framework involves regular review of internal and external risk environments, the assessment of factors 
that will limit or prevent the achievement of our company objectives and the prioritised implementation of controls and 
mitigation to manage the exposure and build resilience.
The audit and risk committee regularly reviews the framework’s effectiveness and our compliance with it. There is also twice 
yearly formal reporting of the most significant risks and profile summary to the executive and the group board. These activities 
facilitate the determination of the nature and extent of those risks we are willing to take in pursuing our objectives and accord 
with good corporate governance practice.

Key developments during the year
Regulatory related risks have featured 
prominently in our risk profile over the 
last 12 months with key areas of focus 
typically being the Government’s market 
reform agenda and Ofwat’s proposals 
for future price limits. 
In addition, the risk of potential change 
in RPI methodology with the potential 
impact to RCV and income continues to 
exist but is a reduced risk for the group. 
This risk was highlighted in our half year 
accounts but the Office of National 
Statistics has now recommended no 
change to the methodology. 
There are two ongoing pieces of material 
litigation worthy of note but, based on 
the facts and matters currently known 
to us and the provisions carried in the 
group’s statement of financial position, 
our directors are of the opinion that 
the possibility of the disputes having a 
material adverse effect on the group’s 
financial position is remote. Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 unitedutilities.com

Strategic 
Government market reform agenda Control/mitigation
The Government’s White Paper (Water for Life) highlighted 
key policy priorities for the water industry. A draft Water 
Bill was published on 10 July 2012 and incorporates changes 
to legislation that would be required to enable many of the 
changes set out in the White Paper. These include measures 
to introduce competition and the removal of barriers to 
entry (see 'Competitive environment' on page 13). The scale 
and impact of retail and upstream competition will depend 
on the mechanisms set out in an expected new draft bill and 
what ultimately becomes legislation. As a result and until this 
publication, there is significant uncertainty about the potential 
impacts; however, these could include: increased costs, reduced 
income and reduced confidence in the RCV mechanism leading 
to a rise in future costs of borrowing. 
We have been fully engaged, as has the whole industry, 
in all Government and Ofwat consultations in relation to 
competition and industry reform. 
We are also making determined efforts to retain customers 
in area, win out of area customers and prepare for a more 
competitive environment and the potential opportunities that 
this may bring. 
Future price limits and the price control review 2014 Control/mitigation 
In May 2012, Ofwat published a document setting out the key 
principles it expects to follow in future price reviews. Ofwat 
then undertook a lengthy and ongoing consultation over its 
proposals for reform of the methodology and approach for 
setting prices from 2015, the most recent of which was the 
draft methodology issued on 28 January 2013. The principal 
decision to date is that Ofwat will set two binding retail price 
controls (one for household and one for non-household) 
and two binding wholesale controls (one for water and one 
for wastewater). Other proposals include: household/non-
contestable retail cost recovery based on an average cost 
to serve; the introduction of a new ‘T otex’ menu approach to 
assessing cost assumptions; the setting of a lower cost of 
capital and the potential for different approaches to sharing 
the benefits of outperformance between shareholders and 
customers (see 'Future regulation' on page 12). These areas 
contribute to a wider risk of failing to achieve a successful 
Final Determination following Ofwat’s price control review 
which could result in loss of income and profit, significant 
cost recovery shortfall, a reduction in allowed expenditure 
(both capital and operating expenditure) and the ability to 
outperform. There will also be additional costs for preparing 
for and administrating separate price controls for retail and 
wholesale.
We have raised and explained our concerns with Ofwat and, 
where appropriate, made alternative proposals as part 
of the consultation process. We continue to make strong 
representation to Ofwat on these issues, particularly in 
relation to the ‘cost to serve’ proposals.
More generally, a successful price control review (meeting 
the needs of customers and stakeholders) is being targeted 
through a dedicated PR14 programme team whose activities 
are focused on appropriate deliverables and stakeholder 
engagement. The final price review methodology proposals 
are due to be issued later this summer.  United Utilities Group PLC

Principal risks and uncertainties continued
Compliance
Failure to comply with applicable law or regulations Control/mitigation 
We are subject to various UK and international laws 
and regulations associated with water and wastewater 
service, health and safety, the environment, property/land 
management and the general running of a company. If we fail 
to comply, or become involved in third party proceedings 
including civil actions by third parties for infringement of rights 
or nuisance, we could face a range of outcomes. These include 
financial penalties (of up to 10 per cent of relevant regulated 
turnover), the imposition of an enforcement order requiring 
additional capital/operating expenditure, or compensation 
following litigation. In more extreme circumstances, impacts 
could ultimately include the revocation of our licence to 
operate or the appointment of a special administrator.
The UK Government has lost a case in the Court of Justice of 
the European Union relating to the Government’s approach to 
enforcement of the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive 
(the ‘Whitburn’ case). The Directive relates to wastewater 
discharges and, if this case leads to a change in the law or 
enforcement of it, our capital investment programme and 
associated funding requirements could change.
We have robust processes in place to identify risks to 
our compliance with legal and regulatory obligations. 
This includes the continual monitoring of legislative and 
regulatory developments, the training of employees in 
new developments and the participation in consultations 
to influence their outcome, either directly or through 
industry trade associations for wider issues. Funding for 
any additional compliance costs in our regulated business is 
sought as part of the price determination process. We also 
robustly defend litigation where appropriate and seek to 
minimise our exposure by establishing a provision and seeking 
recovery wherever appropriate.
No decision has been made on potential change to the law or 
its enforcement following ‘Whitburn’ but we are engaged with 
the industry and industry trade associations on this issue.
Material litigation Control/mitigation 
In February 2009, United Utilities International Limited 
(UUIL) was served with notice of a multiparty ‘class action’ in 
Argentina related to the issuance and payment default of a 
US
$ 230 million bond by Inversora Eléctrica de Buenos Aires 
S.A. (IEBA), an Argentine project company set up to purchase 
one of the Argentine electricity distribution networks which 
was privatised in 1997. UUIL had a 45 per cent shareholding 
in IEBA which it sold in 2005. The claim is for a non-quantified 
amount of unspecified damages and purports to be pursued 
on behalf of unidentified consumer bondholders in IEBA. UUIL 
has filed a defence to the action and will vigorously resist the 
proceedings given the robust defences that UUIL has been 
advised that it has on procedural and substantive grounds.
In March 2010, Manchester Ship Canal Company (MSCC) 
issued proceedings seeking, amongst other relief, damages 
alleging trespass against United Utilities Water PLC (UUW) in 
respect of UUW’s discharges of water and treated effluent into 
the canal. UUW filed a Defence and Counterclaim in support 
of its believed entitlement to make discharges into the canal 
without charge and await MSCC’s response. Although UUW won 
a ‘summary judgment’ application against MSCC in January on a 
significant element of the claim, MSCC subsequently appealed 
to the Court of Appeal who dismissed UUW’s summary 
judgment. UUW was then granted permission to appeal to the 
Supreme Court, the hearing to be in the next 6 to 12 months.
The group faces the general risk of litigation in connection 
with its businesses. In most cases, liability for litigation is 
difficult to assess or quantify; recovery may be sought for 
very large and/or indeterminate amounts and the existence 
and magnitude of liability may remain unknown for substantial 
periods of time. The group robustly defends litigation, where 
appropriate, and seeks to minimise its exposure to such claims 
by early identification of risks and compliance with its legal 
and other obligations. Based on the facts and matters currently 
known and the provisions carried in the group’s statement of 
financial position, the directors are of the opinion that the 
possibility of the disputes referred to in this risk section having 
a material adverse effect on the group’s financial position is 
remote. Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 unitedutilities.com

Financial
Pension deficit risk Control/mitigation 
The group participates in a number of pension arrangements 
(see note 20 in our financial statements). Estimates of the 
amount and timing of future funding for these schemes are 
based on various actuarial assumptions and other factors 
including, among other things, the actual and projected 
market performance of the scheme assets, future long-
term bond yields, average life expectancies and relevant 
legal requirements. The impact of these assumptions and 
other factors may require the group to make additional 
contributions to these pension schemes which, to the 
extent they are not recoverable under the regulatory price 
determination process, could materially adversely affect the 
group’s financial position. 
In the 2009 water price review, Ofwat took account of broadly 
50 per cent of the pension deficit shown in UUW’s final 
business plan over a 10-year period (subject to reaffirmation 
at the next price review) and allowed for half of this deficit 
when setting its overall price controls for the 2010‒15 
period. In response to the size of our ongoing pension risks 
and pension costs we introduced a series of changes for 
employees in defined benefit (DB) schemes. These changes, 
which came into force on 31 March 2010, should result in 
reduced costs and risks, including deficit, associated with 
DB liabilities in the future. In conjunction with the trustees 
we continue to monitor and to look to reduce the investment 
strategy risks for the pension schemes, including our 
exposure to investment risks. We are also engaged with 
Ofwat on the appropriate allowance for pension deficits for 
the next price review period.
Counterparty risk Control/mitigation 
The group participates in treasury activities including the 
depositing of cash and holding of derivatives and foreign 
exchange instruments. Although we do not consider there 
to be an imminent exposure, a potential loss of deposits, 
financial assets or hedge due to bank failure, error or delay 
in receiving funds from a bank or sequestration could impact 
cash flow, the ability to meet debt obligations, credit rating 
and cost of borrowing. 
Risks from treasury activities are covered by policies set by 
our treasury committee with operational management the 
responsibility of our treasury department. These include 
establishing a total credit limit for each counterparty which 
comprises a counterparty credit limit and an additional 
settlement limit to cover intra day gross settlement cash 
flows. In addition, potential derivative exposure limits 
are also established to take account of potential future 
exposures. These limits are based on a number of factors, 
including the credit rating and the size of the asset base of 
the individual counterparty. In respect of cash, short-term 
deposits and derivative financial instruments, the group does 
not have a material exposure to any financial instruments 
based within the Eurozone with the exception of Germany and 
has not experienced any credit issues in the financial year. 
Operational
Customer service risk Control/mitigation 
Failure to deliver good customer service can be caused by 
failures in supply and quality requirements (see page 37) and 
also the effectiveness of communication and response. The 
Service Incentive Mechanism (SIM), introduced by Ofwat 
for the 2010‒15 period, replacing the Overall Performance 
Assessment (OPA), compares companies’ performance in 
terms of the number of ‘unwanted’ contacts received from 
customers and how well a company then deals with those 
contacts. Depending on UUW’s relative performance under 
SIM it could receive a revenue penalty (up to 1 per cent 
of turnover in 2010‒15) or reward (up to 0.5 per cent of 
turnover in 2010‒15) when price limits are next reset in 
2014.
The group has been monitoring and measuring customer 
satisfaction for a number of years and results have been 
improving consistently. We have already improved our 
SIM score as detailed in our KPIs (see 'Key performance 
indicators' on page 19). We have an overall customer 
experience programme covering a range of initiatives to 
improve customer service, responding to our customers’ 
requirements and focusing on people, processes and 
systems. The company’s focus is on ensuring right first time 
service delivery to our customers, thus avoiding the need for 
‘unwanted’ contacts and reducing associated operating costs. 
Where ‘unwanted’ contacts do arise, there is a clear focus on 
identifying the root causes to improve the overall customer 
experience and the SIM score. These actions are intended 
to ensure that the company’s performance under SIM is 
optimised thereby mitigating the risk of a penalty at the next 
price review. United Utilities Group PLC

Principal risks and uncertainties continued
Operational (continued)
Bad debt risk Control/mitigation 
The service we provide is predominantly in the North West 
of England where the level of socio-economic deprivation 
is much higher than in any other region, leading to, amongst 
other things, an increased risk of bad debt. The law prohibits 
the disconnection of a water supply from certain premises 
including domestic dwellings as a method of enforcing 
payment.
Bad debt risk is managed in-house by the customer 
collections department whose approach includes the 
adoption of best practice collection techniques and 
segmentation of customers based on their credit risk profile.
Operational service risk Control/mitigation 
The group controls and operates water and wastewater 
networks and maintains the associated assets with the 
objective of providing a continuous service. Physical, 
environmental, technological or human factors, either within 
or outside the company’s control, could result in impacts 
ranging from a decline in performance to interruptions 
and environmental impact. Ofwat could make financial 
adjustments at the next price review if corrective actions do 
not restore service to the required reference levels for each 
of their serviceability measures and could go on to force 
additional operating or capital expenditure if performance 
were to continue to decline. Additionally, depending on the 
nature and extent of an operational service incident, we could 
be fined for breaches of statutory obligations, be held liable 
to third parties or be required to provide an alternative water 
supply of equivalent quality, at additional cost. 
Operational processes combined with the capital investment 
programme are targeted to maintain stable serviceability 
of our water and wastewater assets and to minimise 
the risk of significant operational events occurring. The 
various indicators of performance are closely and routinely 
monitored by management. There are also governance and 
inspection regimes for key infrastructure assets such as 
aqueducts, dams, reservoirs and treatment works. Where 
adverse trends in performance or asset integrity develop, 
corrective action is identified and taken. The sustainability 
and resilience of our water supply is also managed through 
regional aqueduct networks allowing flexibility and we 
operate emergency plans, incident management and disaster 
recovery processes for the response and/or recovery of 
operational service failures. Insurance cover is also in place 
against loss and liabilities associated with significant risks. 
Capital delivery risk Control/mitigation 
Our core business requires significant capital expenditure, 
particularly in relation to new and replacement plant and 
equipment for water and wastewater networks and treatment 
facilities.
Delivery of our capital investment programmes could be 
affected by a number of factors including adverse legacy 
effects of earlier capital investments (such as increased 
maintenance, repair, reinstatement or renewal costs) or 
amounts budgeted in prior capital investment programmes 
proving insufficient to meet the actual amount required. 
This may affect our ability to meet regulatory and other 
environmental performance standards.
Capital investment programmes are regularly monitored to 
identify the risk of time, cost and quality variances from plans 
and budgets and to identify, where possible, any appropriate 
opportunities for outperformance and any necessary 
corrective actions. Executive directors are incentivised, as 
part of their bonusable measures, on time, cost and quality of 
delivery of our capital investment programme.  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 unitedutilities.com

Operational (continued)
Secure supply of safe clean drinking water risk Control/mitigation 
A secure and reliable supply of safe, clean drinking water is 
critical for our way of life. There are several events, either 
within or outside our control, that could put at risk this key 
requirement. These include inadequate supply and demand 
prediction, leakage performance issues, operational or asset 
failures, changes to abstraction licences, low rainfall or 
malicious acts. Depending on the nature and extent of these 
circumstances, the impact to the group may include: failure 
to meet the security of supply index or quality standards 
with associated regulatory penalties, increased frequency of 
hosepipe bans and drought permits and additional operational 
activity and cost. In extreme and remote circumstances, 
impacts may include unavoidable water resource shortfalls or 
an impact on public health.
Our management of water catchments is designed to 
ensure reliable yields of good quality raw water. In addition, 
our water resources management plan compares future 
demand with availability, analyses historic droughts and 
climate change data and seeks to inform the delivery of 
supply enhancements and demand reductions. It covers 
leakage reduction programmes, enhanced water efficiency 
and network enhancements. We also maintain a drought 
management plan which includes processes, supporting 
communication plans and options for reserve supplies. 
Our treatment of water is based on quality assurance 
procedures and water supply is through an increasingly 
integrated network. Security measures are in place to 
protect these assets and our capital investment programme 
targets improvements to water quality and supply. This is all 
supported by testing regimes through our scientific services 
department and drinking water safety plans to ensure that 
risks to drinking water quality are identified and managed 
across our entire network. We also operate emergency and 
incident management processes should there ever be a need 
for alternative water supply of equivalent quality. 
Hazard
Significant and catastrophic events Control/mitigation 
Our core activity involves the building, control and operation 
of water and wastewater networks and the maintenance of the 
associated assets with the objective of providing a continuous 
service. This includes major construction work and operations 
above and below ground and includes the use of vehicles, 
equipment and chemicals subject to a variety of physical and 
environmental factors/conditions. In exceptional and remote 
circumstances, such as the failure of an asset, an element 
of a network or supporting systems, plant or equipment, the 
impact could be significantly greater than operational service 
failures set out in other risks in this section. These could range 
from environmental impact, economic and social disruption to 
loss of life. Such consequences may arise due to a number of 
circumstances either within or outside our control e.g. human 
error, an individual’s malicious intervention or unavoidable 
resource shortfalls. 
Whilst we seek to ensure that we have appropriate processes 
and preventative controls in place, there can be no certainty 
that such measures will be effective in preventing or, when 
necessary, managing large-scale incidents to the satisfaction 
of our customers, regulators, Government and the wider 
stakeholder community. We could be fined for breaches of 
statutory obligations or be held liable to third parties or be 
required to provide an alternative water supply of equivalent 
quality, which could increase our costs. 
We have developed and continue to focus on a strong safety 
and health culture throughout the organisation and seek to 
achieve the highest safety standards not simply to comply 
with legislation but to contribute to our overall business 
performance while protecting employees, contractors and the 
public from harm. In support of this, the business operates a 
Health and Safety Management System (HSMS) which sets out 
minimum expectations and requirements including monitoring 
the occupational health of individuals when appropriate. 
We operate long-standing, well tested and appropriately 
resourced incident response and escalation procedures. 
Our processes continue to be refined alongside related risk 
management and business continuity procedures which 
complement the governance and inspection regimes for key 
infrastructure assets such as aqueducts, dams, reservoirs and 
treatment works. Disaster recovery processes also exist for 
the recovery of IT applications, all recognising that possible 
events can have varying causes, impacts and likelihoods. 
The sustainability and resilience of our water supply is also 
managed through regional aqueduct networks which are 
enhanced by the West East Link pipeline. We also maintain 
insurance cover in relation to losses and liabilities likely to 
be associated with such significant risks, although potential 
liabilities arising from a catastrophic event could exceed 
the maximum level of insurance cover that can be obtained 
cost-effectively. The licence of the regulated business also 
contains a ‘shipwreck’ clause that, if applicable, may offer a 
degree of recourse to Ofwat/customers (by way of interim 
determination) in the event of a catastrophic incident. United Utilities Group PLC

Corporate governance report
Dear shareholder
We have continued our strategic 
journey during the year towards 
becoming a leading North West service 
provider and one of the best UK water 
and wastewater companies through 
the concentration of our efforts on 
improving the service we provide to our 
customers.
Licence changes
It has been an eventful year. As a 
board we have been fully engaged in 
the discussions relating to Ofwat’s 
proposals to make some fundamental 
changes to the licence under which 
UUW provides water and wastewater 
services to our customers in the North 
West of England. Decisions such as 
these have a long-term impact on 
our group affecting our 2015–2020 
regulatory period and beyond. In 
particular, a number of additional 
meetings of the UUW board were 
arranged beyond its normal schedule 
of meetings, where the board spent 
a considerable amount of time 
considering these changes for our 
group, our customers, our investors and 
our wider stakeholders. 
The UUW board also met with  
Regina Finn, chief executive officer 
of Ofwat, in November 2012 to 
discuss the licence proposals with 
her. This reflected the constructive 
approach adopted by all parties to 
resolve the issue, and we believe the 
outcome delivered a positive result 
for our customers, our group and our 
stakeholders.
 
Board composition
In my role as Chairman of the board,  
I am responsible for ensuring that the 
directors are people with a diverse 
range of backgrounds and skills and 
that they all contribute to our decision 
making. I believe the composition of 
the board reflects this and that, both 
individually and collectively, we act 
with integrity and bring our individual 
viewpoints to board discussions so 
that we attain the highest standards of 
governance. Thereafter, I believe these 
standards are cascaded throughout the 
business. This year’s board evaluation 
exercise again reconfirmed the 
positive outcome observed by last 
year’s external evaluator and further 
demonstrated that the board functions 
effectively, although there were some 
suggestions where improvements could 
be made, details of which are given on 
page 49. 
Our view of the business
A major part of our role as a board 
is to be responsible for providing 
constructive challenges to the 
executive team and its approach to 
implementing our strategic objectives 
and, in holding them to account for 
their actions. We have had a number 
of opportunities during the year to 
meet with members of the executive 
team and other senior managers which 
enables board members to develop a 
better understanding of the challenges 
they face in implementing the 
business’s strategic objectives. Such 
meetings also enable board members 
to get to know senior managers 
considered to be potential successors 
for key roles and to form an opinion of 
these candidates for themselves. 
Board changes
Paul Heiden will retire at the 
forthcoming AGM after over seven 
years’ service, for many of which 
Paul has chaired the audit and risk 
committee. Our succession plan 
resulted in the recruitment of  
Brian May to the board as an 
independent non-executive  
director with effect from  
1 September 2012. Consequently, 
Brian will replace Paul as chair of the 
audit and risk committee (and as our 
financial expert on the committee 
as required by the Code). I would 
like to thank Paul for his extensive 
contribution to the board and for his 
leadership of the committee, and we 
wish him well for the future.
Sara Weller, who joined the board 
on 1 March 2012, presents her first 
remuneration report on pages 54–68. 
Under Sara’s guidance, the committee 
has reviewed the remuneration 
policy, and in particular, the long 
term share plans we have in place to 
incentivise our executive team and 
senior managers. As a consequence, 
the board is recommending that a new 
long term executive share plan should 
be approved by shareholders, and a 
resolution is contained in the notice 
of annual general meeting along with 
explanatory notes. 
If you are able to attend, I look forward 
to seeing you at the AGM in July 
along with my fellow directors. In the 
meantime, we are keen to engage with 
our shareholders and stakeholders and 
we would welcome your thoughts and 
feedback on this annual report. Please 
email secretariat@uuplc.co.uk and let 
us know what you think.

Business Review Governance
During the year, we have fully complied with the ‘Principles 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code 2010’ (‘principles’ and 
‘code’ respectively) and have measured ourselves and reported 
against these principles and the requirements of the code in 
this annual report. On the following pages, 41–68, you will find 
information on what the board has been doing during the year 
in terms of these code principles. 
Code principle: Leadership
Overview of the board
Given the wide-ranging nature of the business activities which 
are needed in a water and wastewater service provider and the 
complex regulated environment in which it operates the skills 
and experience of the board of directors need to be similarly 
diverse and varied. Nearly all our directors have experience 
of working in a regulated environment, either as part of the 
regulatory body or the regulated organisation, spanning 
government departments, financial services, water, electricity 
and telecoms. The directors have also spent their careers 
in a diverse range of commercial environments including 
chemicals, defence, engineering, telecoms and retail and many 
individuals have worked both in the UK and internationally.
With the exception of the Chairman, for whom under the code 
the test is not appropriate, all of our non-executive directors 
are determined to be independent in accordance with the code 
and free from any business or other relationship which could 
compromise their independent judgement. Should they need it, 
the non-executive directors are supported in their role by the 
ability to seek independent specialist advice.
With the exception of Paul Heiden, all directors will be offering 
themselves for reappointment or election at the forthcoming 
AGM in July 2013 in accordance with the code. As confirmed 
by the board evaluation exercise, the board fully endorses 
the reappointment of the board members at the AGM, all of 
whom are considered to be making a valuable and effective 
contribution to the board. The board also supports the 
election of Brian May who was appointed as a director during 
the year. The board recommends that shareholders vote all the 
directors back into office at the forthcoming AGM.
Our board is responsible for setting the strategy of the 
group and has responsibility for the internal control 
systems operated across the group, allowing assessment 
and management of the key issues and risks impacting the 
business. The formal schedule of matters reserved for the 
board (available on our website) sets out its responsibilities 
including approving the company’s overall strategic direction, 
values and standards, reviewing management performance 
and assessing whether the company has the necessary 
financial and human resources in place to meet its objectives. 
It also reviews the company’s business planning, its approach 
to risk management and the development of policies. 
Decisions are taken with a view to promoting the long-term 
success of the company and to ensure that the principal 
goal of the company is to create shareholder value, whilst 
having regard to our other stakeholders represented by our 
employees, customers, regulators, suppliers, the environment 
and the community in which we operate and serve. 
Conflicts of interest 
The company’s articles of association contain provisions which permit unconflicted directors to authorise conflict situations. 
Each director is required to notify the Chairman and/or company secretary of any potential conflict, and the board reviews 
the position of each director annually.

Nomination committee
Dr John McAdam
Current committee members
Dear shareholder
Through the nomination committee, of which I am chair , our 
board and senior manager succession plans are kept continually 
under review as the needs of our company change over time. 
The skills and experience of our current board of directors 
we believe match the needs of our business. As shown in the 
biographical details of our directors (see pages 42–43), their 
careers have been spent in a wide range of industries and 
companies and, as a result, boards such as ours are considered 
to be more likely to make better decisions and be less at risk 
of suffering from group think (where their similar skills and 
experiences result in them thinking in the same way). 
With the recent natural turnover of our directors we feel that 
the resulting refreshing of our board members has meant that 
our board discussions have also been kept alive with our new 
board members providing fresh perspective in their questions 
and challenge to board discussions.
Dr John McAdam
Chair of the nomination committee
Nomination committee: board succession 
As referred to in the Chairman’s introduction on page 40, our 
board succession plan identified that the replacement candidate 
for Paul Heiden should be a financial expert. All our non-executive 
directors, along with the CEO, are members of the nomination 
committee (whose role is to make recommendations to the board 
on the composition, balance and membership of our board and 
refreshing the membership of the board’s principal committees). 
During the year, the committee met twice, and at these meetings 
it agreed on the skills and experience a successful candidate 
would need to replace Paul Heiden, as referred to above. In 
accordance with its board diversity policy (see page 47) the 
committee engaged Spencer Stuart, an executive search 
consultant, to help identify a suitable candidate. They were 
briefed with a description of the skills and experience that 
were needed, and resulted in the appointment of Brian May as 
an independent non-executive director on 1 September 2012. 
(Spencer Stuart is a signatory to the voluntary code of conduct 
on gender diversity for executive search firms, it has no other 
relationship with the group other than being used on a previous 
occasion for executive search purposes.) 
Getting to know United Utilities: 
induction programme for Brian May
An initial two-day programme was 
arranged enabling Brian to meet with 
members of the executive team and 
other senior managers who provided 
an introduction to their areas of the 
business. An informal dinner was also 
held allowing Brian to meet members of 
the executive team. There will also be the 
opportunity for visits to key operational 
sites, including the Whitehaven customer 
services centre and major water and 
wastewater treatment sites.
Brian May said: “With regards to the induction, I found the  
two-day visit to the Warrington head office in November  
to be especially useful. I was able to spend time with key 
executives and their teams to better understand various 
strategic, operational and financial aspects of the business. ”

Business Review Governance
Wider succession plans and talent management
In the succession plans for our CEO and CFO roles, our first 
pool of talent is our executive team who have been working 
during the year on a strategic development programme 
in association with Manchester Business School. Female 
members of the executive team also have additional support 
with targeted development plans and executive coaching. 
Members of the executive team are also actively involved in 
coaching and mentoring some of our younger employees in our 
‘emerging talent group’; 56 per cent of this group are female.
Throughout 2012/2013, in our second talent pool, senior 
leaders have attended business education workshops and 
master classes at Manchester Business School, and have 
been involved with behavioural leadership development and 
360 feedback exercises. Women in this group have additional 
development such as networking inside and outside of United 
Utilities, participating in a ‘women in the workplace’ module 
and have targeted development plans. The success of this 
programme is demonstrated by the promotion during the year 
of two internal female employees to two of our key business 
roles, namely the head of engineering and head of wastewater 
strategy, both of which have historically been held by men (see 
page 48 for details). 
In 2013, we are sponsoring a North West Y oung Business 
Woman of the Y ear Award which will provide some of our 
female employees with an insight into other women’s careers 
and the organisations they work for. 
We continue to recruit graduates and apprentices to feed 
our future resourcing needs. Analysis of our attraction 
rate for female graduates and apprentices has enabled us 
to proactively target key schools and universities in our 
attraction campaign. This year we have seen an increase in  
the number of female graduates joining United Utilities to  
23 per cent and for apprentices an increase to 10 per cent, 
compared with the national average of five to seven per cent. 
Diversity
At the end of the financial year, in line with our board diversity 
policy and the recommendations of Lord Davies, 25 per cent of 
our directors were female. With the retirement of Paul Heiden 
at the annual general meeting, this will rise to 28 per cent. In the 
executive team, 38 per cent are female (five out of thirteen), 
(2012: 36 per cent (five out of fourteen)). In respect of our  
wider employees  at the year end, 63 per cent were male and  
37 per cent were female (2012: 64 per cent male and 36 per cent 
female). As is the case in many UK companies certain activities 
remain more widely populated by males (e.g. operational and 
engineering roles) or females (e.g. customer contact centre roles 
and support services). As previously described, we will continue 
our actions to try and address gender imbalances at all levels and 
in all areas of our business.
Board diversity policy: summary
  Ensure the selection process for board candidates 
provides access to a diverse range of candidates, 
although any appointments will be made on the basis 
of equal merit, but with due regard for the benefits of 
diversity on the board, including gender.
  Ensure that the policies adopted by the group will, over 
time, promote gender diversity among senior managers 
who will in turn aspire to a board position.
  In selecting candidates for board positions, only use the 
services of executive search firms who have signed up to 
the voluntary code of conduct for executive search firms 
as recommended by Lord Davies.
  Adopt measurable objectives from time to time for 
achieving gender diversity at board level – which shall 
currently be to maintain at least 25 per cent female 
representation.

Jo Harrison  
Head of Wastewater Strategy
I started working for United 
Utilities in 1998 on the Graduate 
Recruitment scheme following a 
number of years in environmental 
consultancy. I am a chartered 
member of the Institute of Water 
and Environmental Management, 
with a BSc in Ecology and Geography 
and an MSc in Pollution Control from 
Manchester University.
I was identified by succession planning as a ‘future talent’ and 
in the last 12 months I have taken on a senior leadership role 
as head of wastewater strategy. This role involves defining 
the 25-year strategy for the wastewater business, setting 
our approach to planning our investment and managing the 
relationship with our regulator, the Environment Agency. 
Previously I have held the roles of area planning manager 
and wastewater strategy manager, as well as a number of 
management roles leading operational teams.
My development has been supported by attending a 
12-month senior leadership programme; this has involved 
360 feedback, a transformational leadership programme 
and a number of workshops and master classes at 
Manchester Business School.
Board evaluation 
During the year, as facilitated by our company secretary, we 
undertook an internal evaluation of our board’s performance, 
its committees and of each of the individual directors including 
the Chairman. Our questionnaires were designed to gain some 
insight into the directors’ perceptions and views of what the 
relationship between the board members was like and whether 
the board processes and support, and interactions with its 
committees, were appropriate. Views were also sought on the 
administrative support for the board, and whether there was 
sufficient information and time devoted to: strategic planning 
and reviewing; financial and operating issues and management’s 
performance of these issues; and on the visibility and processes 
around risk management and internal controls. 
Our questionnaires followed the approach that Lintstock 
took last year when they facilitated our board evaluation and 
which was reported on in the 2012 annual report. In addition 
to board members, questionnaires were completed by senior 
managers responsible for reporting to the various committees 
and third party advisors to the committees. Thereafter, the 
individual responses were kept confidential; after analysis by 
the company secretary the results were discussed with the 
chairman, the chair of each committee as appropriate and 
thereafter by the board. 
In summary, progress has been made in enhancing the board’s 
effectiveness. The responses indicate that the atmosphere 
around our board table is a positive one and discussions are 
open and frank with all board directors sharing their knowledge 
and experience for the benefit of the company and actively 
participating in board discussions and decisions. The collective 
motivation as a board of directors is to ‘do the right thing’ to 
look after our company in the long-term for our shareholders 
and other stakeholders. 
Actions arising from last year’s evaluation 
(conducted by Lintstock in February 2012) What we have done in response
Increase the customer-centric skills on the board. Strengthened by the appointment of Sara Weller.
Improving the board’s knowledge and understanding 
of water regulation and the different regulators’ 
agendas.
Our board has spent considerable time at board meetings understanding the impact 
of the licence changes proposed by Ofwat; additionally, the director of economic 
regulation gives a presentation on regulation issues at most board meetings. Our 
board also met with Regina Finn, Ofwat’s chief executive in November 2012.
Improving the timeliness of the distribution of papers 
prior to board meetings.
A timetable for the approval and distribution of board papers has been set and 
every effort is made to adhere to it although, on some occasions, papers have 
followed the scheduled despatch time.
Improving the presentations made by junior 
executives to the board.
Senior managers of the relevant business areas are encouraged to work more 
closely with their team members to improve the content of presentations relating 
to their business area to focus on the key issues requiring board input rather than 
providing too much operational detail.
Improving succession plans for key management 
positions beneath the board.
There has been further focus on the talent pipeline from the senior management 
population: see page 47.

Business Review Governance
Code principle: Accountability
The board is satisfied that in these accounts for the year 
ended 31 March 2013, they have presented a fair, balanced 
and understandable assessment of our company in line with 
our statutory requirements. 
Internal controls and risk management
The board is responsible for ensuring that the company has 
sound risk management and internal control systems in place, 
and for reviewing its effectiveness. It is supported in this role 
by the audit and risk committee, the internal audit function, 
the financial control team and the external auditor. The key 
features of this internal control framework include policies 
and procedures for planning, approving and monitoring major 
capital expenditure and clearly defined comprehensive 
business planning and financial reporting procedures, and 
monthly meetings by the executive team to review financial 
and non-financial performance and key operational issues. 
Alongside these processes, risk management is well 
embedded in our ongoing business as usual approach. All areas 
of the business and support departments are responsible for 
monitoring changes to their areas of activity, and identifying 
any associated risk as a result of these changes which might 
prevent us from achieving our objectives, and identify actions 
to mitigate those risks as far as is reasonably practicable 
and cost-effective to do so. These internal control and 
risk management systems, which are designed to manage 
rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives and can only provide reasonable and not absolute 
assurance against material misstatement or loss, have been 
in place continually for the year under review. On behalf of 
the board, the audit and risk committee completed its annual 
review of the effectiveness of the risk management and 
internal control processes up to the date of the annual report 
in accordance with the revised Turnbull Guidance on Internal 
Control. There were no significant failings or weaknesses 
identified in this review. 
Risks impacting our business due to regulatory changes have 
dominated our risk review agenda at board meetings; the 
principal risks and uncertainties to the business are explained 
on pages 32–37. We continue to work with all key parties to 
represent the best interests of our stakeholders, and where 
we can identify actions to mitigate the adverse consequences 
of these potential regulatory changes we are working hard to 
address these changes to our business in a proactive manner. 
2012/13 board evaluation
In this year’s evaluation, our directors confirmed that they felt the action points coming out of last year’s evaluation had been 
satisfactorily addressed. 
The following actions came out of the 2012/13 board evaluation and we will report on the actions taken in the 
2014 annual report: 
 — Build further on the improvement in the standard of presentations given to the board by ensuring that those presenting to 
the board infrequently provided information to board members at the appropriate level and focus.
 — Maintain the opportunities for the board to meet with members of the executive and the wider senior management team, 
which were felt to be very beneficial.
 — Further develop the focus of executive succession planning.
 — Given the evolving regulatory agenda, ensure that the board continues to have opportunities to broaden its understanding 
and knowledge, with particular emphasis on market reform.  United Utilities Group PLC

Audit and risk committee
Dear shareholder
Following the annual cycle of work of the audit and risk 
committee, we concluded that sound risk management 
and internal control systems have been maintained during 
the year. In terms of our risk management processes, 
we were satisfied that there is a high level of awareness 
of risk management across the business. From the 
information and assurance provided by the day-to-day 
work of our internal audit team and the external audit 
review conducted by our auditor KPMG Audit Plc (KPMG) 
undertaken both at the half-year and full year; our 
understanding of the business; and information provided 
by our senior executive management team, the committee 
was satisfied that the report and accounts, taken as 
a whole, provide a fair, balanced and understandable 
assessment of the company’s position at 31 March 2013.

Going concern reporting
As part of its review of the financial report and accounts, 
the committee considered whether the group had adequate 
financial resources to continue trading as a going concern. 
FRC guidance requires that in order to be considered to be 
a going concern the group should have adequate financial 
resources for at least 12 months from the date of approval 
of the financial statements.
The directors have a reasonable expectation that the 
company has adequate resources available to it to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable future and have 
therefore continued to adopt the going concern policy in 
preparing the financial statements. 
This conclusion is based upon, amongst other matters, a 
review of the group’s financial projections together with 
a review of the cash and committed borrowing facilities 
available to the group as well as consideration of the group’s 
capital adequacy. In addition, the directors considered, 
amongst other matters, the regulator’s legal duty to ensure 
that United Utilities Water PLC is able to finance its 
activities. The directors also took into account potential 
contingent liabilities and other risk factors as interpreted

Audit tender
A full audit tender process was concluded in March 2011, 
resulting in the appointment of KPMG as the group’s auditor 
to replace Deloitte LLP . Following its appointment, KPMG 
undertook its first audit of the company and its subsidiaries 
for the year ended 31 March 2012. The auditor’s role is 
considered annually by the board for reappointment for the 
year end audit process on the recommendation of the audit 
and risk committee.
Appointment of auditor
Our auditor, KPMG, has informed us that for administrative 
reasons and to instigate the orderly wind down of business, 
they wish to formally change the entity which conducts 
the United Utilities audit from KPMG Audit Plc to KPMG 
LLP . KPMG Audit Plc has indicated that it will not stand for 
reappointment at our 2013 AGM, however KPMG LLP will 
seek election at this meeting. Our board has decided to 
recommend KPMG LLP to be appointed as external auditor 
to the company at the AGM and an authority for the directors 
to set the remuneration of the auditor will also be sought.

Members of the audit and risk committee and their 
attendance at meetings
The biographical details of our directors can be found on 
pages 42–43, all members of the committee are independent 
within the meaning of the code. The board is content that 
Paul Heiden, chair of the committee, has recent and relevant 
financial experience and is independent within the meaning 
of the code and when Paul retires Brian May, as his successor, 
will also fulfil that requirement. Following the retirement of 
David Jones in July 2012, Nick Salmon was appointed as a 
member of the committee on a temporary basis to ensure that 
the membership of the committee was aligned with the Code; 
however, there was no requirement for the committee to meet 
and so, on the appointment of Brian May as a non-executive 
director and member of the committee on 1 September 2012, 
Nick stepped down from the committee.
What happens at meetings of the audit and risk committee 
Although not members of the committee, the Chairman, the 
CEO and CFO also have a standing invitation to attend to 
help provide information to the committee as it requires. At 
each scheduled meeting the external auditor meets with the 
committee members to enable them to have a frank and open 
debate without the executives being present, as does the head 
of corporate audit and risk. Similarly, part of the meeting is 
also held without the external auditor being present, to enable 
the committee to discuss their performance openly. 
What was on the audit and risk committee’s  
agenda during the year
During the year, in addition to its standard items of business 
in conjunction with the requirements of the half-year and full 
year reporting cycle, internal controls and risk management 
systems, the committee reviewed the following topics:
  IT security and the implementation of the new IT system 
across the group which would both improve internal 
controls and minimise the potential opportunity for fraud;
  Operational debt write off practices were amended to align 
accounting and operational processes;
  In-depth review of risk management systems in: 
 — asset performance in the group’s wastewater part of the 
business; 
 — asset planning and engineering; 
 — information control and technology; and 
 — within the retail domestic activities of the business 
including customer activities, water and wastewater 
connections, meter reading, billing and debt collection;
  Updates on anti-fraud, whistleblowing and bribery issues 
and compliance and readiness for the changes to be brought 
about as a result of the 2012 version of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code.
Significant issues considered by the audit  
and risk committee in relation to the 2013 
financial statements
The committee considered the ongoing appropriateness 
of the company’s accounting policies and the requirement 
to adopt any new financial reporting standards applicable 
for first time adoption in the current accounting period.  In 
addition, the committee discussed the critical accounting 
judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty, as 
noted in Section P of the accounting policies, and concluded 
that the estimates, judgements and assumptions used were 
reasonable based on the information available and that 
these had been used appropriately in applying the group’s 
accounting policies.
In relation to the company’s existing accounting policies, 
the committee discussed the following principal areas of 
judgement:
 — The policy for providing against doubtful receivables was 
reviewed and it was concluded that the historical approach 
taken remained appropriate, while the approach to the 
assessment of the credit note provision was improved by a 
more detailed analysis of outstanding receivables.  
 — The methodologies and assumptions used in calculating 
the closing defined benefit pension position were reviewed 
and the reasons for the improvement in the net position 
discussed.
 — The provision and disclosure for uncertain taxation 
matters were considered to remain appropriate.
 — The ongoing contractual and legal claims against the 
company were discussed and it was concluded that the 
related accounting was appropriate.
 — The operational policies for reviewing ongoing long-
term capital projects were discussed along with the 
appropriateness of reviewing the allocation of costs 
on such projects, between classifications of type of 
expenditure, on an annual basis as well as at project 
completion.
 — The committee discussed how cost attribution 
improvements have been made following the introduction 
of a new operating model focused on the company’s first 
time resolution of issues together with a more granular 
analysis of the nature of the activity being undertaken.
 — The committee was provided with an update on expenditure 
on private sewers and its allocation between operating and 
capital expenditure.  United Utilities Group PLC

Safeguarding auditor independence and 
non-audit services  
Assurance is provided by KPMG twice a year confirming that 
their staff have no relationships with the company that could 
adversely affect their independence and objectivity. The 
committee monitors the use of KPMG’s services across the 
business at every scheduled meeting of the committee. In 
line with the Financial Reporting Council’s Guidance on Audit 
Committees published in September 2012, the committee 
amended its policy on the use of the external auditor, KPMG, 
to perform non-audit work. In accordance with the FRC’s 
guidance, fees for permitted non-audit services such as tax 
advisory services are pre-approved by the committee (but 
require approval by the CFO) and do not require further 
approval so long as the cumulative value of these services 
is less than 30 per cent of the group annual audit and 
regulatory reporting fee (£320,000 for 31 March 2013); fees 
for permitted non-audit services in excess of this 30 per cent 
level will need to be specifically approved by the committee. 
There are a range of business services which KPMG are 
prohibited from providing to the company such as: business 
process improvement advisory services; employee benefit 
plan advisory services; operational consulting; internal 
audit services; cash management and treasury services; and 
strategic planning support. 
What the audit and risk committee is planning to do, in 
addition to its usual items of business, during 2013/14
  The committee will be addressing the need to comply 
fully with the 2012 version of the Code in the 2014 annual 
report and accounts.
Outcome of audit and risk committee evaluation
The conclusions of the internal evaluation of the performance 
and operation of the committee were that the committee was 
functioning well. The main action identified was the need to 
ensure papers to the committee were succinct. 
Code principle: Relations with shareholders
We are keen to engage with our shareholders and investors and to 
understand their views on our business, and our CEO and CFO have 
a regular programme of one-to-one meetings with representatives 
from major shareholders and investors and group presentations, 
both on an ad hoc basis and linked to our results announcements. 
Board members receive regular updates in the area of investor 
relations and reports from sector analysts to ensure that the 
board maintains an understanding of our investors’ priorities. 
Additionally, we ask Makinson Cowell to produce an annual survey 
of shareholders, the results of which are reviewed by the board. 
Our non-executive directors also have the opportunity to attend 
meetings with major shareholders at either party’s request. 
Copies of our results presentations are available on our website 
along with a range of other information. All directors welcome 
further engagement from our institutional investors as the 
Financial Reporting Council’s Stewardship Code becomes adopted 
more widely. Sara Weller and the reward team have met with 
representatives from a number of major shareholders to discuss 
the new long-term plans.
Investor relations programme
We undertake a comprehensive investor relations programme 
and our CEO and CFO met with around 100 institutional 
investors in the year. This covers a wide range of geographies 
comprising the UK, Europe, North America and the Asia/Pacific 
region. The meetings represent a mix of existing shareholders 
and prospective investors and are supplemented by additional 
meetings hosted by our investor relations team.  We also 
maintain very close contact with the range of City analysts 
that research United Utilities. In total, we met or offered to 
meet with 38 per cent by value of the overall shareholder base, 
which represents 74 per cent of the targetable institutional 
shareholder base (when adjusting for shareholders who 
typically do not take meetings, such as indexed funds). 
In the meetings we have with investors, frequent areas of 
common interest include operational and environmental 
performance, customer service, capital investment, efficiency 
initiatives and regulatory outperformance. Financial stability 
is a key area and investors are interested in the level of gearing 
versus regulatory assumptions, cost of finance, debt portfolio 
and maturity profile, future financing requirements and 
dividends. Looking ahead, investors are keen to understand 
how the economy may impact the water sector, the implications 
of political and regulatory developments and the forthcoming 
price review in 2014.

Retail shareholders
We are very aware that many of our customers are also 
shareholders so their interest in us is from both an operational 
and a financial perspective. In fact, over 51 per cent of our 
shareholders are registered in the North West of England, 
reflecting the privatisation process over twenty years ago and 
we have a regular attendance of our more local shareholders 
at our AGM held in our region in Manchester. 
We produce an online report for our shareholders and other 
interested parties, which provides information on our key 
social and environmental impacts and performance during the 
year. Together with the annual and the half-yearly financial 
reports, and interim management statements, these form the 
principal means of our communications with our shareholders. 
A substantial amount of company information is available via 
our website: corporate.unitedutilities.com.
Code principle: Remuneration
The way in which we remunerate our directors has been a key 
topic for our board’s remuneration committee during the year. 
Sara Weller, having taken over as chair of the committee (since 
David Jones’s retirement at the AGM last year), has been meeting 
with key shareholders to obtain a fuller understanding of their 
views of the content the remuneration package provided to our 
executive directors. It is our intention to ensure that our future 
remuneration policy reflects their expectations and current 
market practice in order that we can attract, motivate and 
retain the right individuals with the right skills and experience 
to contribute to, and ensure, our strategic objectives are 
implemented efficiently and effectively. 
The remuneration report (pages 54–68) provides details of 
the proposed long term plan, which is subject to shareholder 
approval at the annual general meeting in July 2013.
What the remuneration committee is planning to do during 
2013/14  
In consideration of the Department for Business, Innovation and 
Skills draft regulations relating to remuneration reporting, the 
committee will be reviewing the future remuneration policy to 
ensure that it reflects the new requirements.
Outcome of the remuneration committee evaluation  
The conclusions of the internal evaluation of the performance 
and operation of the committee were that the committee 
is functioning well and the tone is very positive, particularly 
given the challenges around the new long term plan in a rapidly 
changing external remuneration and regulatory environment.
The committee evaluation identified that there was a lack 
of visibility of the forthcoming items for discussion on the 
committee’s agenda. This is being addressed by circulating 
the committee’s rolling calendar to committee members on a 
regular basis.
The report of the remuneration committee can be found on the 
following pages.
Relations with other providers of capital
Running a water and wastewater business, by its very nature, 
requires a long-term outlook. Our regulatory cycle is based 
on five-year periods, and we raise associated funding
in order to build and improve our water and wastewater 
treatment works and associated network of pipes for 
each five-year cycle. We are, as a group, heavily reliant 
on successfully acquiring long-term funding from banks 
and debt capital markets to fund our capital investment 
programme. This requires a long-term commitment and 
involvement from our credit investors who lend us the 
funds with the company paying them a return for doing so.  
The group currently has gross borrowings of £6,173m and 
we arrange term debt finance in the bond markets (with 
maturities typically ranging from seven years to up to 50  
years at issue), with access to the sterling and euro public 
bond markets via the group’s London listed multi-issuer Euro 
Medium Term Note programme.  We also arrange committed 
credit facilities with various relationship banks on a bi-
lateral basis.  Additionally, the European Investment Bank 
(EIB), which is the financing arm of the European Union, is 
United Utilities’ single biggest lender currently providing 
circa £1 billion of term funding used to support the financing 
of various projects undertaken in the current and prior 
regulatory periods, aimed at delivering environmental and 
quality improvements, climate change adaptation and eco-
efficiency. In deciding which construction projects we need 
to undertake in each five-year cycle (which are approved 
by our regulators) we need to look into the future to help 
us prepare our facilities and network to match supply and 
demand for our services in areas of predicted population 
growth, as best we can. 
Given the importance of debt funding to our group, we have 
an active credit investor programme, co-ordinated by group 
treasury, who provide a contact point for credit investors’ 
queries. We engage with credit investors through one to one 
meetings, targeting coverage of the major European fund 
managers known to invest in corporate bonds, that may be 
current holders of the group’s debt or be potential holders. 
We also arrange for regular mailings across the year as a 
commitment to keep credit investors informed of significant 
events and to encourage enquiries they may have regarding 
the industry or company. Additionally group treasury is in 
regular dialogue with its relationship banks and the EIB. United Utilities Group PLC

Remuneration committee
Dear shareholder
As new chair of the remuneration 
committee, I am pleased to introduce 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
for the year ending 31 March 2013.
Over the past year the company has 
worked hard to improve its service 
to customers and to continue to 
invest efficiently in strengthening 
our infrastructure to provide a strong 
and stable base for the future, and its 
progress has been reflected in a strong 
share price performance through the 
year. We know that these are difficult 
economic times, bringing challenges for 
many of our customers and therefore 
our approach to remuneration remains 
restrained. However, it is important that 
we reward employees at all levels for a 
strong operational performance during 
the year. 
Maintaining a responsible approach to 
executive pay
Last year’s remuneration report 
received a vote of 98.4 per cent in 
favour from shareholders, indicating 
that our prudent approach to executive 
remuneration is considered to be 
appropriate. 
Whilst there has been good business 
performance this year (as already 
outlined in this annual report), base 
salary increases were limited to  
2.4 per cent for both of the executive 
directors, which is below inflation 
and less than the average base salary 
increase applied at other levels in the 
company. Our good results this year 
have instead been rewarded through 
our annual bonus payments, which 
we believe is a more appropriate 
approach. 
Remuneration for the year reflects 
performance
A key objective of our remuneration 
policy is to align executive pay to 
the company’s strategy of delivering 
long-term shareholder value by 
providing the best service to 
customers, at the lowest sustainable 
cost and in a responsible manner. 
Many of the corporate KPIs (see 
pages 18–19) are embedded as 
performance measures in the annual 
bonus plan.
This year, despite the continuing 
challenging economic conditions, we 
have delivered strong operational 
performance improvement, and in 
particular have significantly improved 
our customer service performance. 
This was reflected in a total 
shareholder return over the year  
of 24 per cent. 
In this context, the committee is 
satisfied that bonus payments of 
around 84 per cent of maximum for 
the executive directors are reflective 
of performance. As the same bonus 
measures are used throughout the 
company, employees at all levels have 
benefited from this success. 
Review of executive incentives
This year we have reviewed, and are 
proposing changes to our executive 
incentive schemes. We are putting 
forward a new long term plan (L TP) for 
approval by shareholders at the AGM 
on 26 July 2013. Details of the plan, 
which will be used instead of our two 
existing long term plans, are given in 
the notice of AGM 2013.

Business Review Governance
This review was necessitated by the 
challenge of setting long-term targets 
for the operational measures under our 
existing plans, where the three-year 
performance period starting in April 
2013 extends in to a new regulatory 
period. As the regulatory contract for 
the five-year period 1 April 2015 to  
31 March 2020 has not yet been 
agreed, it would be very difficult to set 
targets for these operational measures 
for the final year of the performance 
period. We also took the opportunity to 
ensure that our executive incentives are 
firmly aligned to our business priorities 
and those of our major stakeholders, 
including shareholders and customers.
In considering these changes, we 
have been mindful of the public 
debate on executive reward and we 
have consulted extensively with 
several leading shareholders and 
representative groups in developing 
our proposals. We have also taken 
the latest shareholder guidelines into 
account.
Our proposals place strong emphasis 
on the importance of delivering long-
term value to shareholders, by not only 
continuing to focus on total shareholder 
return over each respective three-year 
period, but also on creating strong 
earnings that ensure the sustainability 
of dividends. They also recognise the 
importance of continuing to drive for 
ever higher standards of service and 
good value for our customers, which are 
key issues both for our shareholders 
and our economic regulator, Ofwat. 
They are also fundamental to delivering 
our vision of becoming a leading North 
West service provider and one of 
the UK’s best water and wastewater 
companies. 
We are mindful of our responsibilities 
as stewards of assets and operational 
efficiency in a sector where long-
term planning is critical, and this is 
reflected in our move to a longer-term 
approach on executive incentives. 
The introduction of compulsory 
deferral of half of the annual bonus 
for executive directors into shares, 
and the requirement for awards under 
the new LTP to be held by executive 
directors for a further two years 
beyond the three-year performance 
period demonstrates this approach, 
and will further strengthen the 
alignment between executive and 
shareholder interests over the long 
term. At the same time, we are taking 
the opportunity to simplify the 
arrangements through the removal of 
the matching share award plan.
Under these new proposals the 
maximum face value of long-term 
incentives for executive directors  
will reduce from 140 per cent to  
130 per cent of base salary, although 
the expected value of the executive 
package will not change. We believe 
this is appropriate given the relatively 
stable and long-term nature of the 
water business. 
We are confident that the new 
proposals will allow for a more direct 
focus on delivering value for our 
shareholders and our customers in the 
long-term, which I very much hope you 
will support. 
Structure of report
Throughout the year we have 
taken the opportunity to respond 
to the Department for Business, 
Innovation and Skills’ consultations on 
remuneration reporting. In this report 
we have adopted elements of the draft 
regulations on reporting of directors’ 
pay. This includes the splitting of our 
report into a distinct remuneration 
policy report followed by further 
details about how our policies have 
been implemented in the year ended  
31 March 2013. 
We will be seeking your support for this 
remuneration report, and the new L TP , 
at the 2013 AGM.
Sara Weller
Chair of the remuneration committee
Customer experience is central to incentives
Over half of the annual bonus opportunity for executive directors is based on 
customer service measures, either directly (though the use of our regulator’s 
customer service measure) or indirectly (through making sure our assets are 
of good quality and work reliably, thereby delivering a stable and reliable level 
of service to our customers without any unintended consequences for the 
environment). In addition, under the proposed long term plan (L TP), one-third of 
the performance measures are based on delivering excellent customer service.
We believe that improving customer service will lead to the creation of long-
term shareholder value as it results in increased efficiency and improves 
our reputation. Importantly, our regulator, Ofwat, can also apply financial 
incentives or penalties depending on our customer service performance 
and can require us to incur additional unfunded expenditure to ensure key 
customer targets (such as those for leakage or serviceability) are met.  United Utilities Group PLC

Business Review Governance
Remuneration policy report
Overview of remuneration policy
The company’s remuneration arrangements are designed so that 
the overall level of remuneration (including salary and benefits 
together with the short and long-term incentive opportunities) 
is sufficient to attract, retain and motivate executives of the 
quality required to run the company successfully. The company 
does not pay more than is necessary for this purpose. The 
committee recognises that the company operates in the North 
West of England in a regulated environment and therefore 
needs to ensure that the structure of executive remuneration 
reflects both the practices of the markets in which its 
executives operate, and stakeholder expectations of how the 
company should be run.
A significant proportion of senior executives’ remuneration 
is linked to company and individual performance. Senior 
executives are incentivised to achieve stretching results which 
are delivered with an acceptable level of risk. There is a strong 
direct link between incentives and the company’s strategy and 
if the strategy is delivered, senior executives will be rewarded 
through the annual bonus and long-term incentives. If it is not 
delivered, then a significant part of their potential remuneration 
will not be paid.
Executive incentive review
As described in the chair’s letter, during the year the committee 
carried out a full review of the executive incentive schemes. 
As part of this process the chair of the committee consulted 
with several leading shareholders and representative groups 
from December 2012 through to May 2013 on behalf of the 
committee.
Changes to incentives will apply from the year 2013/14, 
including the deferral of the 2012/13 bonus and the long-term 
incentive awards to be granted in summer 2013.
The key changes to the current structure are as follows:
  Reduced maximum opportunity whilst maintaining the 
expected value of the package
  Introduction of compulsory deferral of 50 per cent of annual 
bonus for executive directors
  Introduction of new Long T erm Plan (L TP) to be used instead 
of the existing matching share award plan (MSAP) and 
performance share plan (PSP), featuring revised long-term 
measures aligned with strategy and shareholder objectives
  Longer time horizon on L TP for executive directors of  
five years (three-year performance period plus two-year

Further details regarding the incentives proposed for 2013/14 
are set out in this report. The long-term awards to be granted in 
2013 will be made under the L TP which is being put forward for 
shareholder approval at the 2013 AGM. The key terms of the 
L TP are set out in the notice of AGM.
How the views of shareholders are taken into account
The committee understands that listening to the views of the 
company’s key stakeholders plays a vital role in formulating 
and implementing a successful remuneration policy over 
the long term. The committee thus actively seeks the views 
of shareholders and other key stakeholders to inform the 
development of the remuneration policy, particularly where any 
changes to policy are envisaged.
A consistent approach to remuneration across 
the wider workforce
The remuneration approach is consistently applied at 
levels below the executive directors, ensuring that there is 
alignment with business strategy throughout the company.
When conducting the annual salary review for all 
employees, account is taken of the external market, and 
for the majority of the management population, individual 
performance is also a key factor. 
The principles of performance related variable reward 
also apply widely to employees through the annual bonus 
scheme (in which employees at all levels participate). The 
corporate performance measures in the annual bonus 
scheme are the same as those for the executive annual 
bonus scheme, ensuring everyone is focused on delivering 
the same business priorities, and that employees share in 
the success if the business strategy is delivered.
As a responsible employer, the company places a high 
priority on enabling employees to plan for the future. Some 
longer serving employees are members of our historic 
defined benefit schemes. Newer employees can participate 
in our award winning defined contribution pension scheme, 
where they can receive a company contribution of up to 
14 per cent of salary alongside life assurance and income 
protection benefits. The scheme received the NAPF 
Pension Quality Mark Plus in 2012.
The board also believes that share ownership is an 
effective way of strengthening all employees’ involvement 
in the development of the business (not just those of 
executives) and brings together their interests and those 
of shareholders. Long-term incentives are used at the 
senior management levels as well as at the executive 
level to ensure that key talent is retained and that there 
is alignment of reward with shareholder experience. The 
company also offers all employees the opportunity to 
build up a shareholding in the company through the HMRC 
approved share incentive plan, ‘ShareBuy’ , under which the 
company gives one free share for every five partnership 
shares bought.  United Utilities Group PLC

where the company itself outperforms.
  Referenced against companies of a similar size (particularly 
market cap and turnover), sector, level of capital investment,

  The performance measures underlying the annual bonus are 
selected to ensure the company is focused on its strategic 
objectives. This is achieved by incorporating a number of 
the KPIs shown on pages 18–19 into the company scorecard 
element for bonus.
  The balance of financial, operational and personal measures 
is reviewed annually and may be adjusted by the committee if 
deemed appropriate.
  The threshold, intermediate and stretch targets are 
established annually by the committee, making sure that they 
are sufficiently stretching whilst also recognising the nature 
and risk profile of the company.
  25% of the maximum bonus is payable for reaching threshold 
targets, 50% for reaching intermediate targets and 100% 
for reaching stretch targets (with straight-line payouts in 
between these points).
  Bonuses are subject to clawback provisions in the event of 
a material overstatement in the financial statements of the 
company because of fraud or error.

executives and 
shareholders 
through the 
delivery of an 
award in shares.
  Compulsory deferral of 50% of gross bonus into company 
shares for three years.
  Shares accrue dividend equivalents.
  Awards will normally not vest until the normal vesting date, 
except in the event of death, where awards would vest earlier.
  If the participant is dismissed for gross misconduct at any 
point prior to vesting, the award will lapse.
  On a date of a change of control, typically the awards will vest 
or roll-over into equivalent shares in acquirer.
  The committee will have the discretion to reduce the number 
of unvested shares, cancel an award or impose further 
conditions on an award, in such negative circumstances it 
considers such action is appropriate. For example: material 
misstatement of audited financial results, serious failure of 
risk management, or serious reputational damage.
  This is in addition to the current clawback arrangements in 
place in executive directors’ service contracts (see table on 
page 60).
Compulsory 
deferral of 
50% of gross

Main points of service contracts for executive directors and letters of appointment for non-executive directors
Executive directors
Notice periods   One year by the company and six months by the executive director.
  A company notice period longer than one year may be provided if necessary for recruitment, but reducing to 
a rolling one-year notice period after the initial period has expired.
Termination  No termination payment if notice is worked.
  Otherwise, payment of a maximum of 12 months’ basic salary, plus pension and car allowance.
  Half of the termination payment will be paid within 14 days of date of termination with the other half 
paid in monthly instalments between the 7th and 12th month anniversary from date of termination 
of employment. The payment will be reduced by the value of any salary, pension contribution and car 
allowance earned in new paid employment in that period.
  No automatic entitlement to payments under the annual bonus or long-term incentives. Any annual bonus 
payment is at the discretion of the company.
  Fair and reasonable mitigation to any contractual obligations may be applied, taking account of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code (the code) and legal advice on the company’s liability to pay compensation.
  A robust line on reducing compensation is applied and payments to a departing employee may be phased in 
order to mitigate loss.
Clawback  Clawback of bonus scheme payments, MSAP and PSP awards is possible in the case of a material 
overstatement in the financial statements of the company because of fraud or error. 
  Actions include: requiring the executive to repay amounts received in respect of a bonus payment; reducing 
the number of shares awarded but not yet transferred to the executive in respect of a PSP or MSAP award; 
and requiring the executive to repay amounts related to the value of shares already transferred as a result 
of PSP or MSAP awards vesting.
  Note that this is in addition to the proposed wider malus provisions for the DBP and LTP described in the 
policy table above (effective for the new LTP if it is approved by shareholders at the AGM).
Service contract dates  Steve Mogford – 5.1.11
  Russ Houlden – 1.10.10
Non-executive directors
Letters of appointment  All non-executive directors should stand for reappointment on an annual basis at every AGM.
  No compensation will be paid for loss of office in the event of early termination.
  Letters of appointment can be viewed at the company’s registered office and on the website: 
corporate.unitedutilities.com.
Fees   Annual fees reflecting the responsibilities placed on the non-executive directors are paid.
  Additional fees are paid to the chairs of the audit and risk, corporate responsibility, remuneration and 
treasury committees, and to the senior independent non-executive director.
  The remuneration committee approves the remuneration for the Chairman, which is reviewed annually with 
any changes effective from 1 September.
  A separate committee of the board decides the remuneration of all of the other non-executive directors on 
an annual basis with any changes effective from 1 September. That committee is responsible for setting 
the base fee and also the fees received for chairing sub-committees and for the senior independent non-
executive.
  Fee reviews take account of the level of fees paid by companies of similar size and complexity.
  Non-executive directors do not participate in any annual bonus or incentive plans, pension schemes, 
healthcare arrangements, the company’s long-term incentive plans or employee share schemes.
  The company repays the reasonable expenses that non-executive directors incur in carrying out their duties 
as directors.

Further detail on proposed LTP performance measures and targets for grants in 2013/14
The performance conditions for the 2013 LTP awards were selected following an extensive review and shareholder consultation 
process. The committee is of the view that the performance targets are aligned with the company’s key strategic goals, and 
aligned with shareholders’ interests over the coming years. Summary details about the LTP performance measures are shown in 
the following table. The LTP is subject to shareholder approval at the 2013 AGM.
Shareholder returns Weighting: one-third of award
Key features Comments
  TSR measured over a three-year performance period
  Relative to the FTSE 100 excluding financial services,  
oil & gas and mining companies (a comparator group of 
approximately 64 companies)
  No payment for below median performance
  Threshold vesting (25%) at median performance
  Stretch vesting (100%) at 1.15x median (or greater)
  ‘Straight-line’ vesting between threshold and stretch
  For the purpose of calculating TSR, the TSR index is  
averaged over the three months prior to the start and  
end of the performance period
Given the small size of the current comparator group (five companies) 
and the consequent challenges in measuring performance on a robust 
basis we believe that extending the group in the new LTP to comprise 
constituents of the FTSE 100 (excluding financial services, oil & gas 
and mining companies) provides a better basis for comparison.
We believe the stretch target of 1.15x median is appropriate 
given our volatility relative to the comparator companies. If we do 
outperform the median over the three-year performance period this 
could generate significant returns for shareholders. For example, if 
the median TSR of the comparator group is 10% over the three-year 
performance period and stretch performance is achieved, then this 
could generate shareholder returns of around £275m per year more 
than would be delivered by achieving median TSR performance.
Sustainable dividends Weighting: one-third of award
Key features Comments
  Comprises two elements – dividend growth and dividend cover
  For 2013 where the performance period straddles two regulatory 
periods, dividend cover will operate as an underpin, with dividend 
growth (over the three-year period) providing the payout range 
based on threshold (25% vesting) to stretch (100% vesting) 
targets
  The remuneration committee will set challenging targets at the 
start of the performance period
Given the commercial sensitivity of attempting to publicly predict the 
outcome of a regulatory price review process, the committee believes 
that disclosing precise targets for this measure in advance would not 
be in shareholder interests. Actual targets, performance achieved and 
awards made will be published at the end of the performance period 
so shareholders can fully assess the basis for any pay-outs. 
Customer service excellence Weighting: one-third of award
Key features Comments
  Based on Ofwat’s customer service measure (currently the 
Service Incentive Mechanism)
  Vesting based on ranking position in final year compared to the 
other water and wastewater companies (currently 21 companies 
including United Utilities)
  No payment for below median performance
  Threshold vesting (25%) for median position (11 out of 21)
  Intermediate vesting (80%) for upper quartile position  
(6 out of 21) 
  Stretch vesting (100%) for upper decile position or above  
(1 or 2 out of 21)
  ‘Straight-line’ vesting between these points
Customer service has a direct financial impact on the company as our 
regulator can apply financial incentives or penalties depending on our 
customer service performance.
Threshold payments under this performance condition require 
achievement of median performance (11 out of 21). For 2011/12 the 
company was ranked 16 out of 21.
Intermediate vesting has been set in line with our medium-term target 
of moving to the upper quartile.
In line with our vision to be one of the UK’s best water and wastewater 
companies we believe that achieving the position of 1st or 2nd in the 
rankings is an appropriately demanding stretch target.
The committee will have the flexibility to make appropriate adjustments to the performance targets in exceptional 
circumstances, to ensure that the award achieves its original purpose. The basis for any adjustments to the level of vesting will 
be fully disclosed retrospectively in the remuneration report.
Any vesting is also subject to the committee being satisfied that the company’s performance on these measures is consistent 
with underlying business performance.  United Utilities Group PLC

  Maintaining and enhancing services for customers 
This measures how effectively and efficiently we deliver projects to improve our region’s water and wastewater network. 
Our capital programme ensures we can provide a reliable service for our customers now and in the future and helps to 
provide a cleaner environment.

  Sustainability of service and corporate responsibility 
This measure is made up of two components: serviceability and the Dow Jones Sustainability Index. Serviceability relates 
to the overall reliability for our assets, such as treatment works, water pipes and pumping stations – ensuring that they 
deliver a stable and dependable level of service to our customers. The Dow Jones Sustainability Index is an assessment of 
our responsible business practice, measuring economic environmental, social and governance performance.

Notes:
(1)  Total remuneration includes total emoluments for the year, long-term incentives with performance periods ending during the year and allowances paid in lieu of pension contributions.
(2)  For executive directors this includes car allowance, and health, life and income protection insurance. For non-executive directors this includes spouse’s attendance at a company event in the UK, 
and where applicable, retirement gifts.
(3)  The outcome of the 2009 awards was not known at the time of last year’s report. The final vesting in respect of those awards was 37.5 per cent. The relative TSR performance condition (relating to  
50 per cent of the awards) failed to reach the threshold vesting level. The remaining 50 per cent of awards were based on a scorecard of operational measures, of which 75 per cent were met.  
Neither of the current executive directors were participants in the 2009 awards, but the former executive directors Philip Green and Charlie Cornish received 43,170 and 12,007 shares respectively, 
related to the pro-rated awards they retained as good leavers. 
(4)  The performance period for the 2010 awards ended on 31 March 2013 and the awards vested on 21 May 2013. The final vesting of those awards was 35.3 per cent. Details of the  
performance measures are shown on pages 65-66. Former executive director Philip Green received 13,795 shares relating to the vested pro-rated awards he retained as a good leaver.  
Russ Houlden received 19,581 vested shares and the value of these shares shown in the table above has been calculated using the closing share price on the date of vesting, which was  
787 pence per share.
(5) David Jones retired from the board at the 2012 AGM on 27 July 2012.
Executive director salaries
Steve Mogford received an increase of 2.4 per cent effective from 1 September 2012, increasing his base salary from £650,000 
to £665,500. Russ Houlden also received an increase of 2.4 per cent effective from 1 September 2012, increasing his base 
salary from £410,000 to £420,000. The committee was satisfied that both executive directors had made good progress in 
delivering the business strategy during the year, and also considered the approach taken in respect of the wider workforce, 
along with external benchmark data when deciding to provide these increases.
Annual bonus

Long-term incentives
Matching share award plan (MSAP)
The committee does not intend to make ongoing awards under 
the MSAP in 2013/14 or future years. The following provides 
a summary of the operation of the plan for awards in previous 
years.
Summary of policy for 2012/13
Voluntary deferral of up to 54 per cent of gross bonus into 
MSAP .
  Matched by award of company shares on 1:1 basis. 
  Matching structure results in an overall maximum matching 
award equal to 70 per cent of base salary, assuming the 
maximum bonus applies.
  Three-year performance period applies to the matching 
shares starting at the beginning of the financial year in 
which awards are granted with 50 per cent based on the 
achievement of operational measures and 50 per cent based 
on TSR relative to an index (see below for further details).
  Any vesting is subject to the committee being satisfied that 
the company’s performance is consistent with underlying 
business performance.
  Matching shares accrue dividend equivalents.
  Awards are subject to clawback provisions in the event of a 
material overstatement in the financial statements of the 
company because of fraud or error.
  Subject to continuing employment. In the case of leavers, 
the vesting of awards is at the discretion of the trustee 
based on a recommendation from the committee and an 
award will not normally vest unless the termination is for a 
‘good leaver’ reason (as determined by the committee) such 
as retirement or because of ill health, or there are other 
special circumstances. Payments are then time pro-rated 
and subject to the performance conditions on which awards 
were granted (or modified, if appropriate) being satisfied.
Both executive directors elected to defer the maximum 
54 per cent of gross bonus into the MSAP relating to their 
bonus for 2011/12. This award will be based on performance 
from 1 April 2012 to 31 March 2015.
Performance share plan (PSP)
The committee does not intend to make ongoing awards under 
the PSP in 2013/14 or future years. The following provides a 
summary of the operation of the plan for awards in previous 
years.
Summary of policy for 2012/13
  The same performance conditions and continuing 
employment conditions which apply to the MSAP also apply 
to the PSP . 
  PSP shares accrue dividend equivalents.
  Awards are subject to clawback provisions in the event of a 
material overstatement in the financial statements of the 
company because of fraud or error. 
PSP awards during 2012/13 were 70 per cent of salary for 
executive directors and will be based on performance from  
1 April 2012 to 31 March 2015. 
Alongside the awards granted to executives, awards were 
also granted to a small number of key employees under the 
PSP , with the same performance conditions as apply to the 
executive directors (albeit with different weightings between 
the TSR and operational performance conditions).
Vesting of 2010 long-term incentives
The same performance period and performance conditions 
applied to the 2010 MSAP and PSP awards. The performance 
period for the awards ended on 31 March 2013 and the final 
vesting in respect of those awards was 35.3 per cent. Of the 
50 per cent based on relative TSR, 33.1 per cent vested. Of 
the 37.5 per cent based on relative efficiency and operating 
expenditure outperformance, 50 per cent vested. The 
employee engagement measure (12.5 per cent of the award) 
failed to meet the threshold vesting level. Neither of the 
current executive directors were participants in the 2010 
MSAP , but Russ Houlden was a participant in the 2010 PSP , 
and received 19,581 vested shares. 
Details on the performance measures applying to the 
2012/13 MSAP and PSP
Total shareholder return (TSR)
50 per cent of the PSP and MSAP awards made in 2012/13 
have a performance condition which measures the company’s 
comparative TSR performance against a TSR index over a 
period of three financial years, starting on 1 April 2012. The 
index is constructed by assessing the TSR performance of the 
companies in the index, with their influence on the index being 
weighted according to relevance and size. 
None of the TSR element of an award will vest if United 
Utilities’ performance falls below the index; 25 per cent of the 
award will vest for performance equal to the index; and 100 
per cent of the award will vest for outperforming the index by 
an additional 6.3 per cent (on a multiplicative basis) over the 
three-year performance period. Vesting is on a sliding scale for 
performance between these points. 
The composition and weighting of the index for awards made 
during 2012/13 is shown below.

Pennon Group 75

For the purpose of calculating TSR, the TSR index is averaged

performance period. TSR is independently calculated by New 
Bridge Street. United Utilities Group PLC

Operational performance measures
The operational measures applying to the remaining 50 per cent of the 2012/13 grants focused on:
  outperforming the operational expenditure regulatory targets over the three-year performance period from 1 April 2012 to 
31 March 2015; and
  delivering the capital expenditure regulatory targets over the five-year regulatory period from 1 April 2010 to 31 March 
2015 (although this is measured over the whole five-year regulatory period, the first two years of performance was known 
at grant and taken into account by the committee when assessing the difficulties of achieving the targets over the remaining 
three years). 
These operational measures are important to business performance during a regulatory period as they measure success against 
key elements of our business strategy: outperformance and delivery of the regulatory contract, and delivering long-term 
shareholder value at the lowest sustainable cost. More detail on these measures is given in the table below:
Operational measure Weighting Measure Vesting scale

100% vesting if stretch outperformance over the 
performance period is achieved;
50% vesting if intermediate outperformance over the 
performance period is achieved;
25% vesting if Ofwat’s allowed operating costs over the 
performance period (‘threshold’) are achieved; and
0% vesting if threshold is not achieved.

50% vesting for intermediate underperformance or

25% vesting for threshold underperformance or 
outperformance; and
0% vesting if threshold is not achieved.
Note:
(1) Vesting is on a straight-line basis between threshold and intermediate, and intermediate and stretch performance.
Changes to existing performance measures
During the year it was necessary to make the following changes to the performance conditions applying to the 2010/11 and 
2011/12 MSAP and PSP awards:
  Relative efficiency measure for the 2010/11 awards – 37.5 per cent of the awards related to a relative efficiency measure. 
However, as notified in last year’s report, due to changes in Ofwat’s reporting not all of the information necessary to 
produce annual relative efficiency assessments is now available in the public domain. The committee therefore replaced 
the original relative efficiency measure with a measure it considered to be no easier or harder to achieve than the original 
performance condition. The replacement measure was based on relative efficiency performance in the first year of the three 
year performance period and operating expenditure outperformance (relative to Ofwat’s allowed operating costs) over the 
remaining two years of the performance period.
  Treatment of International Power for the 2010/11 and 2011/12 awards – following the delisting of Northumbrian Water 
Group (NWG) in 2011, the committee decided to replace NWG in the comparator group for the 2010/11 and 2011/12 
L TIPs with Centrica and International Power. However, International Power was subsequently taken over by GDF Suez and it 
delisted in July 2012. Due to the relatively short period of time International Power had been in the comparator group, the 
committee agreed to remove International Power retrospectively from the comparator group.

Notes:
(1) All awards are increased by the notional reinvestment of dividends paid over the course of the retention or performance period.
(2) For the matched share investment schemes, there are no performance conditions and the dates in this column are the vesting dates.
(3)  The performance period for this award started on 1 April 2011 and will end on 31 March 2014. Half of the performance measures are based on relative TSR and half are based on 
operational measures. Further details are given in last year’s report.
(4)  The performance period for this award started on 1 April 2012 and will end on 31 March 2015. Half of the performance measures are based on relative TSR and half are based on 
operational measures. Further details are given on pages 65-66.
(5)  Full details of the one-off matched share investment award for Steve Mogford, introduced as a necessary part of his terms of appointment, were disclosed in the 2010/11 report. He 
invested in shares to the value of £500,000 and so a conditional matched award of shares to the value of £500,000 was made to him on 27 May 2011. Shares under this scheme will be 
transferred to him on 5 January 2016, subject to him still being employed by the group at that date. 
(6)  The performance period for this award started on 1 April 2010 and ended on 31 March 2013. Half of the performance measures were based on relative TSR and half were based on 
operational measures . On 21 May 2013, 35.3 per cent of the awards vested and 64.7 per cent lapsed. See page 65 for details.
(7)  Full details of the one-off matched share investment award for Russ Houlden, introduced as a necessary part of his terms of appointment, were disclosed in the 2010/11 report. He 
invested in shares to the value of £210,000 and so a conditional matched award of shares to the value of £210,000 was made to him on 1 October 2010. Shares under this scheme will be 
transferred to him on 1 October 2015, subject to him still being employed by the group at that date.
Non-executive director fees
The Chairman’s fee was increased by 2.5 per cent to £270,000 (from £263,400) with effect from 1 September 2012.

any of the other fees paid to the non-executive directors. The chairmanship of the audit and risk committee and the treasury 
committee are held by the same non-executive director (Paul Heiden) and he received an additional annual fee of £15,000. 
The chair of the remuneration committee (Sara Weller) and the senior independent non-executive director (Nick Salmon) each 
received an additional annual fee of £10,000. The chair of the corporate responsibility committee (Catherine Bell) received an

Business Review Governance
Directors’ report
Our directors present their management report and the 
audited financial statements of United Utilities Group PLC 
(the company) and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the 
group) for the year ended 31 March 2013.
 
Principal activities and business review
The company is a public limited company registered in England 
and Wales. Our registered office address is at Haweswater 
House, Lingley Mere Business Park, Lingley Green Avenue, 
Great Sankey, Warrington, WA5 3LP .
The company is the holding company of a group which owns 
and operates water and wastewater assets in the North West 
of England.
The business review on pages 2–37, which includes our 
Chairman’s and Chief Executive Officer’s statement and the 
financial performance section (pages 20–31), provides a 
balanced analysis of the development and performance of 
our business during the financial year, and the position of our 
business at the year end, and forms part of this directors’ 
report. A summary of our key performance indicators can 
be found on pages 18–19. A further description of these 
key performance indicators and others can be found in the 
performance section of the business review on pages 20–31. A 
summary of our principal risks and uncertainties can be found 
on pages 32–37. An indication of likely future developments of 
the group can be found on pages 2–14. The company’s principal 
subsidiary undertakings, and the associated companies and 
joint ventures in which the group participates, are listed in 
note 14 in our consolidated financial statements.
Dividends
Our directors are recommending a final dividend of 22.88 
pence per ordinary share for the year ended 31 March 2013, 
which, together with the interim dividend of 11.44 pence, 
gives a total dividend for the year of 34.32 pence per ordinary 
share (the interim and final dividends we paid in respect of 
the 2011/12 financial year were 10.67 pence and 21.34 pence 
per ordinary share respectively). Subject to approval by our 
shareholders at our AGM, our final dividend will be paid on 
2 August 2013 to shareholders on the register at the close of 
business on 21 June 2013. United Utilities Employee Share 
Trust Limited (UUESTL) has waived its rights to dividends, 
including dividends paid in respect of the year ended 31 March 
2013. However, the shareholding of the UUESTL at 31 March 
2013, and at the date of this report, was nil.
Directors
The summary biographical details, together with the skills and 
experience of our directors who served during the financial 
year ended 31 March 2013, can be found on pages 42–43. 
During the year, David Jones retired from the board at our 
AGM on 27 July 2012 and we appointed Brian May to the board 
on 1 September 2012
.
Our articles of association provide that our directors must 
retire at the third annual general meeting following their last 
election or reappointment by our shareholders. However, our 
board, being mindful of the recommendation contained within 
the revised UK Corporate Governance Code published in June 
2010 that all directors should be subject to annual election 
by shareholders, has decided that all of our directors will 
retire at the 2013 AGM and offer themselves for election/
reappointment, as happened at the AGMs in 2011 and 2012. 
Information regarding the appointment of our directors is 
included in our corporate governance report on pages 46–49. 
Details of the interests in the company’s shares held by our 
directors and persons connected with them are set out in our 
directors’ remuneration report on pages 54–68.
Corporate governance statement
Further details of our compliance with the code as published 
by the Financial Reporting Council in June 2010 are given on 
pages 40–68. Our statement includes a description of the main 
features of our internal control and risk management systems 
in relation to the financial reporting process and forms part 
of this directors’ report. A copy of the code published in 
June 2010, as applicable to the company for the year ended 
31 March 2013, can be found at the Financial Reporting 
Council’s website frc.org.uk. Copies of the matters reserved 
to the board and the terms of reference for each of the main 
board committees can be found on our website: corporate.

Our annual general meeting (AGM)
Our 2013 AGM of the company will be held on 26 July 2013 at 
The Midland Hotel, Peter Street, Manchester, M2 3NQ. 
Full details of the resolutions to be proposed to our 
shareholders, and explanatory notes in respect of these 
resolutions, can be found in our notice of AGM. A copy can be

At our 2013 AGM, resolutions will be proposed, amongst other 
matters: to receive the annual report and financial statements; 
to approve the directors’ remuneration report; to declare a 
final dividend; and to appoint KPMG LLP  as auditor.
In addition, resolutions will be proposed: to approve our 
directors’ general authority to allot shares; to grant the 
authority to issue shares without first applying statutory 
rights of pre-emption; to authorise the company to make 
market purchases of its own shares; to authorise the making of 
limited political donations by the company and its subsidiaries; 
and to enable the company to continue to hold general 
meetings on not less than 14 clear days’ notice. A resolution to

Share capital, transfers of shares and voting rights
At 31 March 2013, the issued share capital of the company 
was £499,819,926 divided into 681,888,418 ordinary  
shares of five pence each and 273,956,180 deferred shares  
of 170 pence each. Details of our share capital and movements  
in our issued share capital are shown in note 24 to the  
financial statements on page 122. The ordinary shares 
represented 71.3 per cent and the deferred shares 
represented 28.7per cent respectively of the shares in 
issue as at 31 March 2013.
All our ordinary shares have the same rights, including the 
rights to one vote at any of our general meetings, to an equal 
proportion of any dividends we declare and pay, and to an 
equal amount of any surplus assets which are distributed in 
the event of a winding-up. 
Our deferred shares convey no right to income, no right to vote 
and no appreciable right to participate in any surplus capital 
in the event of a winding-up. The rights attaching to our shares 
in the company are provided by our articles of association, 
which may be amended or replaced by means of a special 
resolution of the company in general meeting. The company 
renews annually its power to issue and buy back shares at our 
AGM and such resolutions will be proposed at our 2013 AGM. 
Our directors’ powers are conferred on them by UK legislation 
and by the company’s articles. At the AGM of the company on 
27 July 2012, the directors were authorised to issue relevant 
securities up to an aggregate nominal amount of £11,363,479 
and were empowered to allot equity securities for cash on 
a non pre-emptive basis to an aggregate nominal amount of 
£1,704,521.
Electronic and paper proxy appointment and voting 
instructions must be received by our registrars (Equiniti) 
not less than 48 hours before a general meeting and when 
calculating this period, the directors can decide not to take 
account of any part of a day that is not a working day. There 
are no restrictions on the transfer of our ordinary shares in 
the company, nor any limitations on the holding of our shares 
in the company, save (i) where the company has exercised its 
right to suspend their voting rights or to prohibit their transfer 
following the omission of their holder or any person interested 
in them to provide the company with information requested 
by it in accordance with Part 22 of the Companies Act 2006; 
or (ii) where their holder is precluded from exercising voting 
rights by the Financial Conduct Authority’s Listing Rules or the

There are no arrangements known to us by which financial 
rights carried by any shares in the company are held by a 
person other than the holder of the shares, nor are there 
known to us any arrangements between holders of securities 
that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or 
on voting rights. All our issued shares are fully paid.

Purchase of own shares
At our last AGM held on 27 July 2012, our shareholders 
authorised the company to purchase, in the market, up to 
68,180,879 of our ordinary shares of 5 pence each. We did 
not purchase any shares under this authority during the year.

shareholders to purchase up to 68,188,841 of our ordinary 
shares of 5 pence each with such authority expiring at the end

Change of control
As at 31 March 2013, United Utilities Employee Share Trust 
Limited (UUESTL) was the trustee that administered our 
executive share plans and had the ability to exercise voting 
rights at its discretion which related to shares that it held 
under the trust deed constituting the trust. In the event of a 
takeover offer which could lead to a change of control of the 
company, the trustee must consult with the company before 
accepting the offer or voting in favour of the offer. Subject 
to that requirement, the trustee may take into account a 
prescribed list of interests and considerations prior to making 
a decision in relation to the offer, including the interests of 
the beneficiaries under the trust. As detailed on page 69, at 
31 March 2013 the trustee’s holding of ordinary shares in 
the company was nil. With effect from 22 April 2013, Equiniti 
Trust (Jersey) Limited replaced UUESTL as trustee to the 
executive share plans.
In the event of a change of control, the participants in our 
share incentive plan would be able to direct the trustee of the 
share incentive plan, Equiniti Share Plan Trustees Limited, how 
to act on their behalf.
Directors’ indemnities and insurance
We have in place contractual entitlements for the directors of 
the company and of its subsidiaries to claim indemnification 
by the company in respect of certain liabilities which might 
be incurred by them in the course of their duties as directors. 
These arrangements, which constitute qualifying third party 
indemnity provision and qualifying pension scheme indemnity 
provision, have been established in compliance with the 
relevant provisions of the Companies Act 2006. They include 
provision for the company to fund the costs incurred by 
directors in defending certain claims against them in relation 
to their duties as directors of the company or its subsidiaries. 
The company also maintains an appropriate level of directors’ 
and officers’ liability insurance.               
Political and charitable donations
 
We do not support any political party and do not make 
what are commonly regarded as donations to any political 
party or other political organisations. However, the wide 
definition of donations in the Political Parties, Elections and 
Referendums Act 2000 covers activities which form part of the 
necessary relationship between us as a group and our political 
stakeholders. This includes promoting United Utilities’ activities 
at any of the main political parties’ annual conferences.
The period 2012/13 saw an increase in stakeholder 
engagement along a number of policy themes as the industry 
examined its future development. The group incurred 
expenditure of £16,211 (2012: £12,328) as part of this 
process. At the 2012 AGM, an authority was taken to cover 
such expenditure. A similar resolution will be put to our 
shareholders at the 2013 AGM to authorise the company and 
its subsidiaries to make such expenditure.
Charitable donations by the group in the year amounted to 
£5,273,253 (2012: £5,345,093). Of this, £5,000,000 went to 
the United Utilities Trust Fund, an independent grant-making 
trust helping people facing severe financial challenges, whilst 
the remainder was in support of local charitable causes 
and those of interest to employees. Our other community 
investments, including volunteering time contributions, are 
described on page 25.
Employees
Our policies on employee consultation and on equal 
opportunities for our disabled employees can be found in 
the ‘Our approach to doing business’ section on page 15. The 
company’s business principles make clear how it and all our 
employees must seek to act with integrity and fairness and 
observe legal requirements. Anyone with serious concerns 
that the company may not be adhering to these principles is 
encouraged to speak up via their line manager or through a 
confidential telephone line.
Importance is placed on strengthening employees’ 
engagement, measuring their views annually, then by taking 
action to improve how they feel about the company and 
understand its direction.
Our board encourages employees to own shares in the 
company and we offer an all employee share incentive plan 
called ‘ShareBuy’ .

during the year, go to page 92. United Utilities Group PLC

Environmental, social and community matters
Details of our approach to corporate responsibility, relating to 
the environment and social and community issues, can be found 
in the ‘Our approach to doing business’ section on page 15.
Essential contractual relationships
Certain suppliers we use contribute key goods or services, the 
loss of which could cause disruption to our services. However, 
none are so vital that their loss would affect our viability as 
a group as a whole nor are we overly dependent on any one 
individual customer.
Policy on payment of creditors
Our policy is in line with the BIS Prompt Payment Code (a copy 
can be found online at promptpaymentcode.org.uk). Payment 
terms are specific to the type of contract and the relevant 
commercial arrangements, and are agreed with our suppliers 
in advance.
We make every effort to comply with the payment terms that 
we agree with our suppliers, subject to there being no dispute 
with the invoices we receive. As at 31 March 2013, our average 
credit period taken for trade purchases was 36 days for the 
group (2012: 29 days). The company has no trade payables.
Approach to technology development
We are committed to using innovative, cost-effective and 
practical solutions for providing high quality services and we 
recognise the importance of ensuring that we focus properly 
our investment in the development of technology and that we 
have the right skills to apply technology to achieve sustainable 
competitive advantage and also that we continue to be alert to 
emerging technological opportunities.
Financial instruments
Our risk management objectives and policies in relation to the 
use of financial instruments can be found in note 19 to the 
financial statements.
Property, plant and equipment
The group holds significant land assets; however, the vast 
majority of these are water catchment assets which are an 
integral and essential part of the operation of the group’s 
regulated business. The nature of these assets, which are 
primarily moorland areas and which could not be sold by the 
group, means that it is impracticable to obtain meaningful 
market values for the land. Other land owned by the group, the 
majority of which relates to operational sites, does not have a 
market value materially different from historic cost.
Events occurring after the reporting period
Details of events after the reporting period are included in 
note 31 to the consolidated financial statements on 
page 126.
Information given to the auditor
Each of the persons who is a director at the date of approval 
of this report confirms that:
(1)  so far as he or she is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the company’s auditor is unaware; and
(2)  he or she has taken all the steps that he/she ought to 
have taken as a director in order to make himself/herself 
aware of any relevant audit information and to establish 
that the company’s auditor is aware of that information. 
This confirmation is given, and should be interpreted, in 
accordance with the provisions of s418 of the Companies 
Act 2006.
Appointment of the auditor
Our board is proposing that our shareholders appoint  
KPMG LLP as our auditor at the forthcoming AGM and 
authorise our directors to fix the auditor’s remuneration.

Statement of directors’ responsibilities in respect 
of the annual report and the financial statements
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report 
and the group and parent company financial statements in 
accordance with applicable laws and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare group and 
parent company financial statements for each financial year. 
Under that law they are required to prepare the group financial 
statements in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European 
Union (EU) and applicable law and have elected to prepare the 
parent company financial statements on the same basis.
Under company law the directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the group and 
parent company and of their profit or loss for that period. In 
preparing each of the group and parent company financial 
statements, the directors are required to:
  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
  make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
  state whether they have been prepared in accordance with 
IFRSs as adopted by the EU; and
  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the group and the 
parent company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent 
company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy 
at any time the financial position of the parent company 
and enable them to ensure that its financial statements 
comply with the Companies Act 2006. They have general 
responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to 
them to safeguard the assets of the group and to prevent and 
detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are also 
responsible for preparing a directors’ report, directors’ 
remuneration report and corporate governance statement 
that complies with that law and those regulations.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the corporate and financial information included 
on the company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement of the directors in respect of the 
annual financial report
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
  the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the 
applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit 
or loss of the company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and
  the directors’ report includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business and the 
position of the issuer and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description 
of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.

Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities

the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a

Accounting policies
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation 
of these financial statements are set out below.
a) Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union (EU), including International 
Accounting Standards (IAS) and Interpretations issued by the 
International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee 
(IFRIC).
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical 
cost basis, except for the revaluation of financial instruments, 
accounting for the transfer of assets from customers and the 
revaluation of infrastructure assets to fair value on transition 
to IFRS.
The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with 
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) under IFRS, 
requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities at the date 
of the financial statements and the amounts of revenues and 
expenses during the reporting periods presented. Although 
these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge 
of the amount, event or actions, actual results ultimately may 
differ from these estimates.
The adoption of the following standards and interpretations, 
at 1 April 2012, has had no material impact on the group’s 
financial statements:
Amendments to IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments’
This amendment introduces new disclosure requirements 
about transfers of financial assets which will impact the group 
only if it enters into any relevant transactions in the future.
Going concern
The financial statements have been prepared on the going 
concern basis. The directors have set out factors considered 
in concluding the appropriateness of this presentation in the 
financial reporting and going concern section of the corporate 
governance report.
Operating profit
Operating profit is stated after charging operating expenses 
but before investment income and finance expense.
b) Basis of consolidation
The group financial statements consolidate the financial 
statements of the company and entities controlled by the 
company (its subsidiaries), and incorporate the results of its 
share of joint ventures using proportionate consolidation.
The results of subsidiaries and joint ventures acquired or 
disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated 
income statement from the date control is obtained or until 
the date that control ceases, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial 
statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies 
used under the relevant local GAAP into line with those used 
by the group.
Subsidiaries
Control is achieved where the company has the power 
to govern the financial and operating policies, generally 
accompanied by a shareholding of more than one-half 
of the voting rights of an investee entity so as to obtain 
benefits from its activities. In the parent company accounts, 
investments are held at cost less provision for impairment.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent 
liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at 
the date of acquisition. Any excess of the cost of acquisition 
over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired 
is recognised as goodwill. Any deficiency of the cost of 
acquisition below the fair values of the identifiable net assets 
acquired is credited to the income statement in the period of 
acquisition. All intra-group transactions, balances, income and 
expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Joint ventures
Joint ventures are entities in which the group holds an interest 
on a long-term basis and which are jointly controlled with one 
or more parties under a contractual arrangement. The group’s 
share of joint venture income, expenses, assets, liabilities 
and cash flows is included in the consolidated financial 
statements on a proportionate consolidation basis using the 
same accounting methods as adopted for subsidiaries.
c) Revenue recognition
Revenue represents the fair value of the income receivable 
in the ordinary course of business for goods and services 
provided. Where relevant, this includes an estimate of the 
sales value of units supplied to customers between the date 
of the last meter reading and the period end, exclusive of 
value added tax and foreign sales tax.
The group recognises revenue generally at the time of 
delivery and when collection of the resulting receivable is 
reasonably assured. Should the group consider that the 
criteria for revenue recognition are not met for a transaction, 
revenue recognition would be delayed until such time as 
the transaction becomes fully earned or collectability is 
reasonably assured. Payments received in advance of revenue 
recognition are recorded as deferred income.
d) Borrowing costs and finance income
Except as noted below, all borrowing costs and finance income 
are recognised in the income statement in the period in which 
they are accrued.
Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the 
acquisition or issue of a financial asset or financial liability are 
included in the initial fair value of that instrument. 84
United Utilities Group PLC
22027.04      3 June 2013 2:01 PM      Pfp
Where borrowing costs are attributable to the acquisition, 
construction or production of a qualifying asset, such costs 
are capitalised as part of the specific asset.
e) T axation
The taxation expense represents the sum of current taxation 
and deferred taxation.
Current taxation
Current taxation, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, 
is based on the taxable profit for the period and is provided at 
amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates 
and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at 
each reporting date.
Taxable profit differs from the net profit as reported in the 
income statement because it excludes items of income or 
expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it 
further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
Current taxation is charged or credited in the income 
statement, except when it relates to items charged or 
credited to equity, in which case the corporation taxation is 
also dealt with in equity.
Deferred taxation
Deferred taxation is the tax expected to be payable or 
recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and 
the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of 
taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are provided, using the 
liability method, on all taxable temporary differences at each 
reporting date. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised 
if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from 
the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) 
of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects 
neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred taxation liabilities are recognised for taxable 
temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries 
and interests in joint ventures, except where the group is able 
to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is 
probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future.
Deferred taxation is measured at the average tax rates that 
are expected to apply in the periods in which the temporary 
timing differences are expected to reverse based on tax rates 
and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at 
each reporting date.
The carrying amount of deferred taxation assets is reviewed 
at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is 
no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be 
available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred taxation is charged or credited in the income 
statement, except when it relates to items charged or 
credited to equity, in which case the deferred taxation is also 
dealt with in equity.
f) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment comprises water and 
wastewater infrastructure assets and overground assets 
(including properties and plant and equipment).
The useful economic lives of these assets are as follows:
  Water and wastewater infrastructure assets:
 – Impounding reservoirs 200 years;
 – Mains and raw water aqueducts 30 to 300 years;
 – Sewers 60 to 300 years;
 – Sea outfalls 77 years;
  Buildings 10 to 60 years;
  Operational assets 5 to 80 years; and
  Fixtures, fittings, tools and equipment 3 to 40 years.
Employee and other related costs incurred in implementing 
the capital schemes of the group are capitalised.
Water and wastewater infrastructure assets
Infrastructure assets comprise a network of water and 
wastewater pipes and systems. Expenditure on the 
infrastructure assets, including borrowing costs where 
applicable, relating to increases in capacity or enhancements 
of the network is treated as additions. Amounts incurred 
in maintaining the operating capability of the network in 
accordance with defined standards of service are expensed 
in the year in which the expenditure is incurred. Infrastructure 
assets are depreciated by writing off their cost, less the 
estimated residual value, evenly over their useful economic 
lives.
Other assets
All other property, plant and equipment is stated at historical 
cost less accumulated depreciation.
Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly 
attributable to the acquisition of the items, including relevant 
borrowing costs, where applicable, for qualifying assets. 
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount 
or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when 
it is probable that future economic benefits associated with 
the item will flow to the group and the cost of the item can be 
measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance costs 
are charged to the income statement during the financial 
period in which they are incurred.
Freehold land and assets in the course of construction are 
not depreciated. Other assets are depreciated by writing off 
their cost, less their estimated residual value, evenly over 
their estimated useful economic lives, based on management’s 
judgement and experience.

22027.04      3 June 2013 2:01 PM      Pfp
Depreciation methods, residual values and useful economic 
lives are reassessed annually and, if necessary, changes 
are accounted for prospectively. The gain or loss arising on 
the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the 
difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying 
amount of the asset and is recognised in other operating 
costs.
Transfer of assets from customers 
Where the group receives from a customer an item of 
property, plant and equipment (or cash to construct or acquire 
an item of property, plant and equipment) that the group must 
then use, either to connect the customer to the network, or 
to provide the customer with ongoing access to a supply of 
goods or services, or to do both, such items are capitalised 
at their fair value and included within property, plant and 
equipment, with a credit of the same amount to deferred 
grants and contributions. The assets are depreciated over 
their useful economic lives and the deferred contributions 
released to revenue over the same period (or where the 
receipt of property, plant and equipment is solely to connect 
the customer to the network, the deferred contribution is 
released immediately to revenue). This interpretation has 
been applied to transfers of assets from customers received 
on or after 1 July 2009.
Assets transferred from customers are accounted for at fair 
value. If no market exists for the assets then incremental cash 
flows are used to arrive at fair value.
g) Intangible assets
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation is recognised as an asset. 
Following initial recognition, goodwill is subject to impairment 
reviews, at least annually, and measured at initial value less 
accumulated impairment losses. Any impairment is recognised 
immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently 
reversed.
On disposal of a subsidiary, or jointly controlled entity, 
the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the 
determination of the gain or loss on disposal.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 
has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any 
subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets are measured initially at cost and 
are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated 
useful economic lives. The carrying amount is reduced by any 
provision for impairment where necessary.
On a business combination, as well as recording separable 
intangible assets already recognised in the statement of 
financial position of the acquired entity at their fair value, 
identifiable intangible assets that arise from contractual 
or other legal rights are also included in the acquisition 
statement of financial position at fair value.
Internal expenditure is capitalised as internally generated 
intangibles only if it meets the criteria of IAS 38 ‘Intangible 
Assets’ . 
Amortisation periods for categories of intangible assets are:
  Computer software 3 to 10 years; and
  Other intangible assets 2 to 20 years.
h) Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding 
goodwill
Intangible assets with definite useful economic lives and 
property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment 
at each reporting date to determine whether there is any 
indication that those assets may have suffered an impairment 
loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of 
the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the 
impairment loss, if any. Where the asset does not generate 
cash flows that are independent from other assets, the group 
estimates the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit 
to which the asset belongs.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs 
to sell, and value in use. Value in use represents the net 
present value of expected future cash flows, discounted on 
a pre-tax basis, using a rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific 
to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have 
not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash generating unit) 
is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying 
amount of the asset (or cash generating unit) is reduced to its 
recoverable amount. Impairment losses in respect of non-
current assets are recognised in the income statement within 
operating costs.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the reversal 
is recognised in the income statement and the carrying 
amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of 
its recoverable amount, but not so as to exceed the carrying 
amount that would have been determined had no impairment 
loss been recognised in prior years.
i) Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised and 
derecognised on the group’s statement of financial position 
on the trade date when the group becomes/ceases to be a 
party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Cash and short-term deposits
Cash and short-term deposits include cash at bank and in 
hand, deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments 
which are readily convertible into known amounts of cash, 
have a maturity of three months or less from the date of 
acquisition and which are subject to an insignificant risk of 
change in value. In the consolidated statement of cash flows 
and related notes, cash and cash equivalents include cash and 
short-term deposits, net of bank overdrafts. 86
United Utilities Group PLC
22027.04      3 June 2013 2:01 PM      Pfp
Financial investments
Investments (other than interests in associates, subsidiaries, 
joint ventures and fixed deposits) are initially measured at 
fair value, including transaction costs. Investments classified 
as available for sale in accordance with IAS 39 ‘Financial 
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’ are measured 
at subsequent reporting dates at fair value. Gains and losses 
arising from changes in fair value are recognised directly in 
equity, until the security is disposed of or is determined to be 
impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously 
recognised in equity is included in the net profit or loss for 
the period. Investments classified as loans and receivables in 
accordance with IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition 
and Measurement’ are measured at amortised cost.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are initially measured at fair value, 
and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, less 
any impairment for irrecoverable amounts. Estimated 
irrecoverable amounts are based on historical experience  
of the receivables balance.
Trade payables
Trade payables are initially measured at fair value and are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified 
according to the substance of the contractual arrangements 
entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that 
evidences a residual interest in the assets of the group after 
deducting all of its liabilities.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the group are recorded at the 
proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Borrowings
The group’s default treatment is that bonds, loans and 
overdrafts are initially measured at fair value being the 
cash proceeds received net of any direct issue costs. They 
are subsequently measured at amortised cost applying 
the effective interest method. The difference between the 
net cash proceeds received at inception and the principal 
cash flows due at maturity is accrued over the term of the 
borrowing.
The default treatment of measuring at amortised cost, whilst 
associated hedging derivatives are recognised at fair value, 
presents an accounting measurement mismatch that has 
the potential to introduce considerable volatility to both the 
income statement and the statement of financial position. 
Therefore, where feasible, the group takes advantage of the 
provisions under IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition 
and Measurement’ to fair value its borrowing instruments 
to reduce this volatility and better represent the economic 
hedges that exist between the group’s borrowings and 
associated derivative contracts.
Where feasible, the group designates its financial instruments 
within fair value hedge relationships. In order to apply fair 
value hedge accounting, it must be demonstrated that the 
hedging derivative has been, and will continue to be, a highly 
effective hedge of the risk being hedged within the applicable 
borrowing instrument. 
Borrowings designated within a fair value hedge relationship
Where designated, bonds and loans are initially measured at 
fair value being the cash proceeds received net of any direct 
issue costs. They are subsequently adjusted for any change 
in fair value attributable to the risk being hedged at each 
reporting date, with the change being charged or credited to 
finance expense in the income statement. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively when the 
hedging instrument is sold, terminated or exercised, or 
where the hedge relationship no longer qualifies for hedge 
accounting.
Borrowings designated at fair value through profit or loss
Designation is made where the requirements to designate 
within a fair value hedge cannot be met at inception despite 
there being significant fair value offset between the 
borrowing and the hedging derivative. Where designated, 
bonds and loans are initially measured at fair value being the 
cash proceeds received and are subsequently measured at 
fair value at each reporting date with changes in fair value 
being charged or credited to finance expense in the income 
statement.
Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value at 
each reporting date with changes in fair value being charged 
or credited to finance expense in the income statement. The 
group enters into financial derivatives contracts to manage its 
financial exposure to changes in market rates (see note 19).
Derivatives and borrowings – valuation
Designated borrowings and derivatives recorded at fair 
value are valued using a net present value valuation model. 
The model uses applicable interest rate curve data at each 
reporting date to determine any floating cash flows. Projected 
future cash flows associated with each financial instrument 
are discounted to the reporting date using discount factors 
derived from the applicable interest curves adjusted for 
counterparty credit risk where appropriate. Discounted 
foreign currency cash flows are converted into sterling at the 
spot exchange rate at each reporting date.
The valuation of debt designated in a fair value hedge 
relationship is calculated based on the risk being hedged as 
prescribed by IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement’ . The group’s policy is to hedge its exposure to 
changes in the applicable underlying interest rate and it is 
this portion of the cash flows that is included in the valuation 
model (excluding any applicable company credit risk spread).

22027.04      3 June 2013 2:01 PM      Pfp
The valuation of debt designated at fair value through the 
profit or loss incorporates an assumed credit risk spread in 
the applicable discount factor. Credit spreads are determined 
based on indicative pricing data.
j) Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable 
value. For properties held for resale, cost includes the cost of 
acquiring and developing the sites, including borrowing costs 
where applicable.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price 
less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be 
incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
k) Employee benefits
Retirement benefit obligations
The group operates two defined benefit pension schemes, 
which are independent of the group’s finances, for its 
employees. Actuarial valuations of the schemes are carried 
out as determined by the pension scheme trustees using the 
projected unit credit method at intervals of not more than 
three years, the rates of contribution payable and the pension 
cost being determined on the advice of the actuaries, having 
regard to the results of these valuations. In any intervening 
years, the actuaries review the continuing appropriateness of 
the contribution rates.
Defined benefit assets are measured at fair value while 
liabilities are measured at present value. The difference 
between the two amounts is recognised as a surplus or 
obligation in the statement of financial position.
The cost of providing pension benefits to employees relating 
to the current year’s service (including curtailment gains 
and losses) is included within the income statement within 
employee benefits expense. The difference between the 
expected return on scheme assets and interest cost on 
scheme liabilities is included in the income statement within 
investment income or finance expense.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised outside the 
income statement in retained earnings and presented in the 
statement of comprehensive income.
In addition, the group also operates a defined contribution 
pension section within the United Utilities Pension Scheme. 
Payments are charged as employee costs as they fall due. 
The group has no further payment obligations once the 
contributions have been paid.
Share-based compensation arrangements
The group operates equity-settled, share-based 
compensation plans. In accordance with the transitional 
provisions, IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payments’ has been applied 
to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 
that were unvested as of 1 April 2004.
The group issues equity-settled share-based payments to 
certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments 
are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value 
determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line 
basis over the vesting period, based on estimates of the 
number of options that are expected to vest. Fair value is 
based on both simulation and binomial models, according to 
the relevant measures of performance. The group has the 
option to settle some of these equity-settled share-based 
payments on a net basis in cash.
At each reporting date, the group revises its estimate of the 
number of options that are expected to become exercisable 
with the impact of any revision being recognised in the income 
statement, and a corresponding adjustment to equity over the 
remaining vesting period. The proceeds received net of any 
directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share 
capital (nominal value) and share premium when the options 
are exercised.
l) Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the group has a present 
legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, 
it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required 
to settle the obligation, and the amount can be reliably 
estimated. Expenditure that relates to an existing condition 
caused by past operations that does not contribute to current 
or future earnings is expensed. 
m) Foreign currency translation
Transactions and balances
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the 
exchange rates applicable on the dates of the transactions. 
At each reporting date, monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling 
at the relevant rates of exchange applicable on that date. 
Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in net 
profit or loss for the period. Exchange differences arising on 
investments in equity instruments classified as available for 
sale are included in the gains or losses arising from changes in 
fair value which are recognised directly in equity.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, 
the group enters into derivative instruments (see note 19). 88
United Utilities Group PLC
22027.04      3 June 2013 2:01 PM      Pfp
Group companies
On consolidation, the statements of financial position of 
overseas subsidiaries and joint ventures (none of which has 
the currency of a hyperinflationary economy) are translated 
into sterling at exchange rates applicable at each reporting 
date. The income statements are translated into sterling using 
the average rate unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly 
in which case the exchange rate at the date the transaction 
occurred is used. Exchange differences resulting from the 
translation of such statements of financial position at rates 
ruling at the beginning and end of the period, together with 
the differences between income statements translated at 
average rates and rates ruling at the period end, are dealt with 
as movements on the group’s cumulative exchange reserve, a 
separate component of equity. Such translation differences 
are recognised as income or expense in the period in which the 
operation is disposed of.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition 
of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the 
foreign entity and translated at the closing rate. The group 
has elected to treat goodwill and fair value adjustments 
arising on acquisitions before the date of implementation 
of IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ (1 April 1999) as sterling 
denominated assets and liabilities.
n) Grants and contributions
Grants and contributions receivable in respect of property, 
plant and equipment are treated as deferred income, which is 
credited to the income statement over the estimated useful 
economic lives of the related assets.
o) Leases
Leases are classified according to the substance of the 
transaction. Operating leases are leases that do not transfer 
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the 
lessee.
Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement 
on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
p) Critical accounting judgements and key sources of 
estimation uncertainty
In the process of applying its accounting policies, the group 
is required to make certain estimates, judgements and 
assumptions that it believes are reasonable based on the 
information available. These judgements, estimates and 
assumptions affect the amounts of assets and liabilities 
at the date of the financial statements and the amounts 
of revenues and expenses recognised during the reporting 
periods presented.
On an ongoing basis, the group evaluates its estimates 
using historical experience, consultation with experts and 
other methods considered reasonable in the particular 
circumstances. Actual results may differ significantly from 
the estimates, the effect of which is recognised in the period 
in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known.
The following paragraphs detail the estimates and judgements 
the group believes to have the most significant impact on the 
annual results under IFRS.
Carrying value of property, plant and equipment
The estimated useful economic lives of property, plant and 
equipment (PPE) are based on management’s judgement and 
experience. When management identifies that actual useful 
economic lives differ materially from the estimates used to 
calculate depreciation, that charge is adjusted prospectively. 
Due to the significance of PPE investment to the group, 
variations between actual and estimated useful economic 
lives could impact operating results both positively and 
negatively, although historically few changes to estimated 
useful economic lives have been required.
The group is required to evaluate the carrying values of 
PPE for impairment whenever circumstances indicate, in 
management’s judgement, that the carrying value of such 
assets may not be recoverable. An impairment review requires 
management to make subjective judgements concerning 
the cash flows, growth rates and discount rates of the cash 
generating units under review.
Revenue recognition
The group recognises revenue generally at the time of delivery 
and when collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably 
assured. When the group considers that the criteria for 
revenue recognition are not met for a transaction, revenue 
recognition is delayed until such time as the transaction 
becomes fully earned or collectability is reasonably assured. 
Payments received in advance of revenue recognition are 
recorded as deferred income.
United Utilities Water PLC raises bills in accordance with 
its entitlement to receive revenue in line with the limits 
established by the periodic regulatory price review processes. 
For water and wastewater customers with water meters, 
the receivable billed is dependent on the volume supplied 
including the sales value of an estimate of the units supplied 
between the date of the last meter reading and the billing 
date. Meters are read on a cyclical basis and the group 
recognises revenue for unbilled amounts based on estimated 
usage from the last billing through to each reporting date. The 
estimated usage is based on historical data, judgement and 
assumptions; actual results could differ from these estimates, 
which would result in operating revenues being adjusted in the 
period that the revision to the estimates is determined. For 
customers who do not have a meter, the receivable billed is 
dependent on the rateable value of the property, as assessed 
by an independent rating officer.

Allowance for doubtful receivables
At each reporting date, the company and each of its 
subsidiaries evaluate the recoverability of trade receivables 
and record allowances for doubtful receivables based on 
experience. These allowances are based on, amongst other 
things, a consideration of actual collection history. The actual 
level of receivables collected may differ from the estimated 
levels of recovery, which could impact operating results 
positively or negatively.
Accounting for provisions and contingencies
The group is subject to a number of claims incidental to the 
normal conduct of its business, relating to and including 
commercial, contractual and employment matters, which are 
handled and defended in the ordinary course of business. 
The group routinely assesses the likelihood of any adverse 
judgements or outcomes to these matters as well as ranges of 
probable and reasonably estimated losses. 
Reasonable estimates involve judgements made by 
management after considering information including 
notifications, settlements, estimates performed by 
independent parties and legal counsel, available facts, 
identification of other potentially responsible parties and 
their ability to contribute, and prior experience. A provision 
is recognised when it is probable that an obligation exists for 
which a reliable estimate can be made after careful analysis 
of the individual matter. The required provision may change 
in the future due to new developments and as additional 
information becomes available. Matters that either are 
possible obligations or do not meet the recognition criteria 
for a provision are disclosed as contingent liabilities in 
note 30, unless the possibility of transferring economic 
benefits is remote.
Retirement benefits
The group operates two defined benefit schemes which are 
independent of the group’s finances. Actuarial valuations of 
the schemes are carried out as determined by the trustees at 
intervals of not more than three years. The pension cost under 
IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ is assessed in accordance with 
the advice of a firm of actuaries based on the latest actuarial 
valuation and assumptions determined by the actuary. The 
assumptions are based on information supplied to the actuary 
by the company, supplemented by discussions between the 
actuary and management. The assumptions are disclosed in 
note 20. Profit before taxation and net assets are affected 
by the actuarial assumptions used. These assumptions 
include investment returns on the schemes’ assets, discount 
rates, pay growth and increases to pensions in payment and 
deferred pensions and may differ from actual results due 
to changing market and economic conditions and longer or 
shorter lives of participants.
Taxation
Assessing the outcome of uncertain tax positions requires 
judgements to be made regarding the application of tax law 
and the result of negotiations with, and enquiries from, tax 
authorities in a number of jurisdictions.
q) Recently issued accounting pronouncements
International Financial Reporting Standards
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, 
the following relevant standards and interpretations were in 
issue but not yet effective. All of the standards in issue but 
not yet effective have been endorsed by the EU except where 
noted. The directors anticipate that the group will adopt these 
standards and interpretations on their effective dates.
The directors anticipate that the adoption of the following 
standards and interpretations may have a material impact on 
the group’s financial statements:
  IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments – amendment’ is effective 
for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2015 but 
will not be considered for endorsement by the EU until the 
remaining elements of the project have been completed. 
Under the provisions of this standard, where the group has 
chosen to measure borrowings at fair value through the 
profit or loss, the portion of the change in fair value due to 
changes in the group’s own credit risk will be recognised in 
the statement of other comprehensive income rather than 
within profit or loss. If this standard had been adopted in 
the current year, £1.5 million of losses would have been 
recognised in the statement of other comprehensive 
income rather than within the income statement. 
  IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ was amended in June 2011 and 
is effective for periods commencing on or after 1 January 
2013. The impact on the group will be to replace interest 
cost and expected return on plan assets with a net interest 
amount that is calculated by applying the discount rate to 
the net defined benefit surplus/(obligations). The group has 
assessed the impact of the revised standard, the impact on 
the results for the year ended 31 March 2013 would be to 
recognise a net interest cost of £1.5 million in the income 
statement as opposed to the net pension interest cost of 
£11.5 million (the interest cost of £108.3 million net of 
the expected return on plan assets of £96.8 million). There 
would be no impact on either the net retirement benefit 
surplus/(obligations) or related deferred tax balance within 
the statement of financial position. 90
United Utilities Group PLC
22027.04      3 June 2013 2:01 PM      Pfp
  IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’ is effective for periods 
commencing on or after 1 January 2014 and replaces 
IAS 31 ‘Interests in Joint Ventures’ . IFRS 11 removes the 
option currently taken by the group to proportionately 
consolidate its joint ventures and requires equity 
accounting. The impact on the income statement and 
statement of financial position for the year ended 
31 March 2013 would be that the group’s interests in its 
joint ventures’ assets, liabilities, income and expenses, as 
summarised in note 14, would be presented separately in 
the statement of financial position and income statement. 
There would be no impact on net assets.
The directors anticipate that the adoption of the following 
standards and interpretations will have no material impact on 
the group’s financial statements:
  Amendments to IAS 1 ‘Presentation of items of Other 
Comprehensive Income’ is effective for periods 
commencing on or after 1 July 2012. The impact of the 
amendments will be that items, which may be reclassified 
to profit and loss in the future, will be presented separately 
in the statement of other comprehensive income from 
those that would never be reclassified to profit and loss. 
  IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’ is effective 
for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2014 and 
builds on existing principles by identifying the concept 
of control as the determining factor in whether an entity 
should be included within the consolidated accounts of 
the parent company. The standard provides additional 
guidance to assist in the determination of control where 
this is difficult to assess.
  IFRS 12 ‘Disclosures of Interests in Other Entities’ is 
effective for periods commencing on or after 
1 January 2014 and includes the disclosure requirements 
for all forms of interest in other entities, including 
subsidiaries, associates, joint arrangements and 
unconsolidated structured entities. 
  IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’ is effective for periods 
commencing on or after 1 January 2013 and aims to 
improve consistency and reduce complexity by providing 
a precise definition of fair value and a single source of fair 
value measurement and disclosure requirements for use 
across IFRS.
  ‘Improvements to IFRSs (2011)’ , this is a collection of 
amendments to five standards as part of the International 
Accounting Standards Board’s (IASB) programme of annual 
improvements. The improvements were issued in May 2012 
and are effective for periods commencing on or after 
1 January 2013.
All other standards and interpretations, which are in issue but 
not yet effective, are not considered relevant to the activities 
of the group.

 Includes £1.5 million losses (2012: £21.3 million gains) on the valuation of debt reported at fair value through profit or loss due to changes in credit spread assumptions.
(3)
 Includes fair value movements in relation to other economic hedge derivatives relating to debt held at amortised cost.
(4)
 Includes £8.3 million income (2012: £7.2 million) due to interest on swaps and debt under fair value option.
Interest payable for the year ended 31 March 2013 is stated net of £14.3 million (2012: £9.7 million) borrowing costs 
capitalised in the cost of qualifying assets within property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets during the year. 
This has been calculated by applying a capitalisation rate of 4.3 per cent (2012: 4.8 per cent) to expenditure on such assets as 
prescribed by IAS 23 ‘Borrowing Costs’ .

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing profit for the financial year attributable to equity holders of the company by 
681.9 million, being the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year (2012: 681.8 million). Diluted earnings per 
share is calculated by dividing profit for the financial year attributable to equity holders of the company by 682.8 million, being 
the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year including dilutive shares (2012:  682.2 million).
The difference between the weighted average number of shares used in the basic and the diluted earnings per share calculations 
represents those ordinary shares deemed to have been issued for no consideration on the conversion of all potential dilutive 
ordinary shares in accordance with IAS 33 ‘Earnings per Share’ .
The weighted average number of shares can be reconciled to the weighted average number of shares including dilutive shares as 
follows:

19 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
Risk management 
The board is responsible for treasury strategy and governance, which is reviewed on an annual basis. The annual treasury 
strategy review covers the group’s funding, liquidity, capital management and interest rate management strategies, along with 
the delegation of specific funding and hedging authorities to the treasury committee.
The treasury committee, a sub-committee of the board, has responsibility for setting and monitoring the group’s adherence to 
treasury policies, along with oversight in relation to the activities of the treasury function.
Treasury policies cover the key financial risks: liquidity risk, credit risk, market risk (inflation, interest rate, electricity price and 
currency) and capital risk. These policies are reviewed by the treasury committee for approval on at least an annual basis, or 
following any major changes in treasury operations and/or financial market conditions.
Day-to-day responsibility for operational compliance with the treasury policies rests with the treasurer. An operational 
compliance report is provided monthly to the treasury committee, which details the status of the group’s compliance with the 
treasury policies and highlights the level of risk against the appropriate risk limits in place.
The group’s treasury function does not act as a profit centre and does not undertake any speculative trading activity.
Liquidity risk 
The group looks to manage its liquidity risk by maintaining liquidity within a board approved duration range. Liquidity is 
actively monitored by the group’s treasury function and is reported monthly to the treasury committee through the operational 
compliance report.
At 31 March 2013, the group had £721.7 million (2012: £991.2 million) of available liquidity, which comprised £201.7 million 
(2012: £321.2 million) cash and short-term deposits and £520.0 million (2012: £670.0 million) of undrawn committed borrowing 
facilities. Short-term deposits mature within three months and bank overdrafts are repayable on demand.
The group had available committed borrowing facilities as follows:

Expiring within one year 220.0 250.0
Expiring after one year but in less than two years 50.0 220.0
Expiring after more than two years 250.0 200.0
Total borrowing facilities 520.0 670.0
Offsetting bank guarantees – –
Undrawn borrowing facilities 520.0 670.0
At 31 March 2013, the group had additional committed borrowing facilities of £100.0 million expiring after more than two years, 
£50.0 million available to be drawn from September 2013 and £50.0 million available to be drawn from January 2014 .
At 31 March 2012, the group had an additional committed borrowing facility of £50.0 million expiring after more than two years 
that was available to be drawn from September 2013.
These facilities are arranged on a bilateral rather than a syndicated basis, which spreads the maturities more evenly over 
a longer time period, thereby reducing the refinancing risk by providing several renewal points rather than a large single 
refinancing point.
The company does not have any committed facilities available.

Maturity analysis
Concentrations of risk may arise if large cash flows are concentrated within particular time periods. The maturity profile in the 
following table represents the forecast future contractual principal and interest cash flows in relation to the group’s financial 
liabilities with agreed repayment periods and derivatives on an undiscounted basis. Derivative cash flows have been shown net 
where there is a contractual agreement to settle on a net basis; otherwise the cash flows are shown gross.

  Forecast future cash flows are calculated, where applicable, utilising forward interest rates based on the interest environment at year end and are therefore susceptible to changes in   
market conditions. For index-linked debt it has been assumed that RPI will be 2.65 per cent over the life of each bond.

  The carrying value of debt is calculated following various methods in accordance with IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’ and therefore this adjustment reconciles  
the undiscounted forecast future cash flows to the carrying value of debt in the statement of financial position.

Credit risk 
Credit risk arises principally from trading (the supply of services to customers) and treasury activities (the depositing of 
cash and holding of derivative and foreign exchange instruments). The group does not believe it is exposed to any material 
concentrations of credit risk.
The group manages its risk from trading through the effective management of customer relationships. Concentrations of 
credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the group’s customer base consisting of a large number of 
unrelated households and businesses. The Water Industry Act 1991 (as amended by the Water Industry Act 1999) prohibits the 
disconnection of a water supply and the limiting of supply with the intention of enforcing payment for certain premises including 
domestic dwellings. However, allowance is made by the water regulator in the price limits at each price review for a proportion of 
debt deemed to be irrecoverable. Considering the above, the directors believe there is no further credit risk provision required in 
excess of the allowance for doubtful receivables (see note 16).
The group manages its risk from treasury activities by establishing a total credit limit by counterparty, which comprises a 
counterparty credit limit and an additional settlement limit to cover intra-day gross settlement cash flows. In addition, potential 
derivative exposure limits are also established to take account of potential future exposure which may arise under derivative 
transactions. These limits are calculated by reference to a measure of capital and credit ratings of the individual counterparties 
and are subject to a maximum single counterparty limit. A control mechanism to trigger a review of specific counterparty limits, 
irrespective of credit rating action, is in place. This entails daily monitoring of counterparty credit default swap levels and/or 
share price volatility. Credit exposure is monitored daily by the group’s treasury function and is reported monthly to the treasury 
committee through the operational compliance report. 
At 31 March, the maximum exposure to credit risk for the group and company is represented by the carrying amount of each 
financial asset in the statement of financial position:

The credit exposure on derivatives is disclosed gross of any collateral held. At 31 March 2013, the group held £125.6 million 
(2012: £110.8 million) as collateral in relation to derivative financial instruments (included within borrowings in note 18). In 
respect of cash and short-term deposits and derivative financial instruments, the group does not have a material exposure to 
any financial institutions based within the eurozone, with the exception of Germany, and has not experienced any significant 
credit issues during the financial year.
Market risk 
The group’s exposure to market risk primarily results from its financing arrangements and the economic return which it is 
allowed on the regulatory capital value (RCV). 
The group uses a variety of financial instruments, including derivatives, in order to manage the exposure to these risks.

Inflation risk
The group earns an economic return on its RCV, comprising a real return through revenues and an inflation return as an uplift 
to its RCV. To the extent that nominal debt liabilities finance a proportion of the RCV, there is an asset liability mismatch which 
potentially exposes the group to the risk of economic loss where actual inflation is lower than that implicitly locked in through 
nominal debt. 
The group’s index-linked borrowings, which are linked to RPI inflation, form an economic hedge of the group’s regulatory assets, 
which are also linked to RPI inflation. In particular, index-linked debt delivers a cash flow benefit compared to nominal debt, as 
the inflation adjustment on the index-linked liabilities is a deferred cash flow until the maturity of each financial instrument, 
providing a better match to the inflation adjustment on the regulated assets, which is recognised as a non-cash uplift to the RCV .
In addition, the group’s pension obligations also provide an economic hedge of the group’s regulatory assets. The pension 
scheme funding mechanism ensures that future contributions will be flexed for movements in RPI and smoothed over a rolling 
five-year period, providing a natural hedge against any inflationary uplift on the RCV.
The group seeks to manage this risk by identifying opportunities to amend the economic hedge currently in place where 
deemed necessary and subject to relative value. Inflation risk is reported monthly to the treasury committee in the operational 
compliance report.
The carrying value of index-linked debt held by the group is as follows:

£m
2012

Index-linked debt 2,853.9 2,667.0
Sensitivity analysis
As required by IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosure’ , the sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis of the amount 
of index-linked debt in place as at 31 March 2013 and 31 March 2012, respectively. As a result, this analysis relates to the 
position at the reporting date and is not indicative of the years then ended, as these factors would have varied throughout 
the year. The following table details the sensitivity of profit before taxation to changes in the RPI on the group’s index-linked 
borrowings:
Increase/(decrease) in profit before taxation and equity
2013 
£m
2012 
£m
1 per cent increase in RPI (29.1) (27.2)
1 per cent decrease in RPI 29.1 27.2
This table excludes the hedging aspect of the group’s regulatory assets which, being property, plant and equipment, are not 
financial assets as defined by IAS 32 ‘Financial Instruments: Presentation’ and are typically held at cost or deemed cost less 
accumulated depreciation on the consolidated statement of financial position. In addition, the table excludes the hedging aspect 
of the group’s pension obligations.
The analysis assumes a one per cent change in RPI having a corresponding one per cent impact on this position over a 12-month 
period. It should be noted, however, that there is a time lag by which current RPI changes impact on the income statement and 
the analysis does not incorporate this factor. The portfolio of index-linked debt is either calculated on a three or eight-month lag 
basis. Therefore, at the reporting date the index-linked interest and principal adjustments impacting the income statement are 
fixed and based on the annual RPI change either three or eight months earlier.
The company has no material exposure to inflation risk. 110

Interest rate risk
The group’s policy is to structure debt in a way that best matches its underlying assets and cash flows. The group earns an 
economic return on its RCV, comprising a real return through revenues, determined by the real cost of capital fixed by the 
regulator for each five-year regulatory pricing period, and an inflation return as an uplift to its RCV.
The preferred form of debt therefore is sterling index-linked debt which incurs fixed interest, in real terms, and forms a natural 
hedge of regulatory assets and cash flows.
Where conventional long-term debt is raised in a fixed-rate form, to manage exposure to long-term interest rates, the debt is 
generally swapped at inception to create a floating rate liability for the term of the liability through the use of interest rate 
swaps. These instruments are typically designated within a fair value accounting hedge.
To manage the exposure to medium-term interest rates, the group has fixed interest costs for a substantial proportion of 
the group’s net debt for the duration of the current five-year regulatory pricing period. The group’s interest risk management 
strategy is to fix interest rates out to a 10-year maturity on a reducing balance basis, seeking to lock in a 10-year rolling average 
interest rate on the group’s nominal liabilities.
The group seeks to manage its risk by maintaining its interest rate exposure within a board approved range. Interest rate risk is 
reported monthly to the treasury committee through the operational compliance report.
Sensitivity analysis
As required by IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ , the sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis of the amount 
of net debt and the interest rate hedge positions in place at the reporting date. As a result, this analysis is not indicative of the 
years then ended, as these factors would have varied throughout the year.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the interest sensitivity analysis:
  fair value hedge relationships are fully effective;
  borrowings designated at fair value through profit or loss are effectively hedged by associated swaps;
  the main fair value sensitivity to interest rates in the statement of financial position (excluding the effect of accrued 
interest) is in relation to the fixed interest rate swaps which manage the exposure to medium-term interest rates;
  cash flow sensitivity in the statement of financial position to interest rates is calculated on floating interest rate net debt;
  the sensitivity excludes the impact of interest rates on post-retirement obligations;
  management has assessed one per cent as a reasonably possible movement in UK interest rates; and
  all other factors are held constant.

Electricity price risk
The group is allowed a fixed amount of revenue by the regulator, in real terms, to cover electricity costs for each five-year 
regulatory pricing period. To the extent that electricity prices remain floating over this period, this exposes the group to 
volatility in its operating cash flows. The group’s policy, therefore, is to manage this risk by fixing a proportion of electricity 
prices in a cost-effective manner.
The group has used electricity swap contracts to fix the price of a substantial proportion of its anticipated electricity usage out 
to the end of the AMP in 2015. 
Sensitivity analysis
As required by IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Dislosures’ , the sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis of the amount

Currency risk
Currency exposure principally arises in respect of funding raised in foreign currencies. 
To manage exposure to currency rates, foreign currency debt is hedged into sterling through the use of cross currency swaps and 
these are typically designated within a fair value accounting hedge. 
The group seeks to manage its risk by maintaining currency exposure within board approved limits. Currency risk in relation to 
foreign currency denominated financial instruments is reported monthly to the treasury committee through the operational 
compliance report.
The group and company have no material net exposure to movements in currency rates.

Capital risk management 
The group’s objective when managing capital is to maintain a capital structure that enables its primary subsidiary, United 
Utilities Water PLC, to retain a credit rating of A3 from Moody’s Investors Services (Moody’s), which the group believes best 
mirrors the Water Services Regulation Authority’s (Ofwat) assumptions in relation to capital structure. The strategy of targeting 
a credit rating of A3 has been consistently maintained since 2007.
One of Ofwat’s primary duties is to ensure that water companies are able to finance their functions, in particular by securing 
a reasonable return on their capital. Therefore, mirroring Ofwat’s assumptions for credit ratings (and hence capital structure) 
should help safeguard the group’s ability to earn a reasonable return on its capital, securing access to finance at a reasonable 
cost and enabling the group to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and credit investors, and 
benefits for other stakeholders.
In order to maintain a credit rating of A3 the group needs to manage its capital structure with reference to the ratings 
methodology and measures used by Moody’s. The ratings methodology is normally based on a number of key ratios (such as RCV 
gearing and adjusted interest cover) and threshold levels as updated and published from time to time by Moody’s.
The group looks to manage its risk by maintaining the relevant key financial ratios used by the credit rating agencies to 
determine a corporate’s credit rating, within the thresholds approved by the board. Capital risk is reported monthly to the 
treasury committee through the operational compliance report.
Further detail on the precise measures and methodologies used to assess water companies’ credit ratings can be found in the 
methodology papers published by the rating agencies. 114

In order to determine the fair values in the table above, all borrowings and derivatives are valued using a discounted cash flow 
valuation model as described within the accounting policies on pages 83 to 90. In determining fair values, assumptions are made 
with regard to credit spreads based on indicative pricing data.
In respect of the total change during the year in the fair value of financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or 
loss for continuing operations of a £17.5 million loss (2012: £19.1 million loss), a £1.5 million loss (2012: £21.3 million gain) is 
attributable to changes in own credit risk. The cumulative amount recognised in the income statement due to changes in credit

The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair 
value, grouped into levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable.
  Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or 
liabilities;
  Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are 
observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
  Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that 
are not based on observable market data (unobservable).

20 RETIREMENT BENEFIT SURPLUS/(OBLIGATIONS)
Defined benefit schemes
The group participates in two major funded defined benefit pension schemes in the United Kingdom – the United Utilities 
Pension Scheme (UUPS) and the United Utilities PLC Group of the Electricity Supply Pension Scheme (ESPS), both of which are 
closed to new employees. The assets of these schemes are held in trust funds independent of the group’s finances. 
The last actuarial valuations of UUPS and ESPS were carried out as at 31 March 2010. These valuations have been updated to 
take account of the requirements of IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ in order to assess the position at 31 March 2013 by projecting 
forward from the valuation date and have been performed by an independent actuary, AON Hewitt Limited.
The group made total contributions of £93.0 million (2012: £149.7 million) to its pension schemes for the year ended 
31 March 2013. Overall, the group expects to contribute around £27.1 million to its defined benefit schemes in the year ending 
31 March 2014. The group also continues to pay contributions in respect of the defined contribution members and insurance 
premiums. 
The group also operates a series of unfunded, unregistered retirement benefit schemes. The cost of the unfunded, unregistered 
retirement benefit schemes is included in the total pension cost, on a basis consistent with IAS 19 and the assumptions set out 
below.
Information about the pension arrangements for executive directors is contained in the directors’ remuneration report.
The main financial assumptions used by the actuary to calculate the defined benefit surplus/(obligations) of UUPS and ESPS were 
as follows:
Group
2013 
% pa
2012 
% pa
Discount rate 4.60 5.00
Expected return on assets* 4.60 4.50
Pensionable salary growth and pension increases 3.30 3.25
Price inflation 3.30 3.25
*   The 2012 expected return on assets has been re-presented to show the combined weighted average expected return on assets (the expected return on assets was previously shown 
separately for the UUPS and ESPS schemes).
In assessing the discount rate, the group has taken into account the average duration of the schemes’ liabilities.

To develop the expected long-term rate of return on asset assumptions, the group considered the current level of expected 
returns on risk-free investments, the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the 
portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class. The expected return for each asset class was 
then weighted based on the actual asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on asset assumptions for 
the portfolio. The group’s actual return on the schemes’ assets was a gain of £309.5 million (2012: £319.3 million).
The assets as at 31 March 2013, in respect of the UUPS, included in the table above, have been allocated to each asset class 
based on the return the assets are expected to achieve and not based on the physical assets held. The reason for this being 
that the UUPS has entered into a variety of derivative transactions in order to change the return characteristics of the physical 
assets held and in order to reduce undesirable market and liability risks.
The ‘Other’ element of the portfolio is set aside for collateral purposes linked to the derivative contracts entered into, as 
described above. The collateral portfolio, in addition to providing sufficient liquidity to maintain the derivative transactions, is 
expected to achieve a return in excess of LIBOR.

In respect of the group’s commitment to significant property leases, there are no contingent rentals payable, or restrictions on 
dividends, debt or further leasing imposed by these lease arrangements. Wherever possible, the group ensures that it has the 
benefit of security of tenure where this is required by operational and accommodation strategies. Escalation of rents is via rent 
reviews at agreed intervals.
The company had no operating lease commitments at 31 March 2013 or 31 March 2012.
27 SHARE-BASED PA YMENTS
The company operates several share option schemes. 
Company share option scheme 1999
The company share option scheme 1999 is for senior executives (excluding, with effect from the introduction of the group’s 
long-term incentive plan, executive directors and other executives participating in that plan and its successor, the performance 
share plan).
Options under the company share option scheme 1999 are exercisable in a period beginning no earlier than three years  
and ending no later than 10 years from the date of grant. The number of options outstanding at 31 March 2013 was nil  
(2012: 16,136) and the weighted average exercise price of options exercised during the year was £5.44 (2012: £6.22).
Performance share plan, matching share award plan and matched share investment scheme
Details of these schemes are given on pages 54 to 68 in the Directors’ Remuneration Report.
Deferred share plan
The deferred share plan (DSP) is used as a retention mechanism for certain key employees below board level on a discretionary 
basis. Shares are released after a three-year holding period and are conditional on continued employment with the group during 
this time. These options may, at the group’s discretion, be settled in cash. DSP awards grant employees nil-cost options with no 
performance conditions which are entitled to dividend equivalents; therefore, the fair value of the award is equal to the market 
price of the share at the grant date (2013: 19,532 options granted; 2012: no grants). The number of options outstanding at 
31 March 2013 was 70,589 (2012: 87,395). Options issued post 1 April 2012 include an element of operational conditions 
relating to satisfactory job performance. 
The total expense included within employee benefits expense from continuing operations in respect of equity-settled 
share-based payments was £1.7 million (2012: £1.2 million expense) and £0.2 million (2012: £nil) in respect of cash-settled 
share-based payments, plus £0.3 million accrual of national insurance contributions (2012: £0.2 million). 124

27 SHARE-BASED PA YMENTS continued
For the purpose of IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payments’ , expiry of performance share plan awards is measured with reference to the 
achievement of the performance conditions at the reporting date, not the end of the notional vesting period of three years from 
grant date. Therefore, options with performance conditions measured at the end of a reporting period are treated as expired if 
their performance conditions are not achieved at the reporting date.

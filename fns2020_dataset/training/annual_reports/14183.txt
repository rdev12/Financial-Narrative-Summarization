† Excluding discontinued activities and before exceptional items and amortisation
† Shiloh has three distinct, 
inter-related divisions
Overview
Medical
The Medical division focuses primarily on disposable products for use within the NHS acute and primary care sectors
and also the private healthcare sector.  It provides product and service solutions for continence care, infection
prevention and wound management.
Shiloh is best known as a leading manufacturer and supplier to both the NHS and private sector of the Conti range of
patient cleansing wipes. As the only manufacturer of shaped pads in the UK, branded Contisure, Shiloh has over 20
home delivery contracts throughout the UK delivering the company’s products direct to patients’ homes. Product
delivery is supported by a modern IT system enabling products to be delivered to
patients’ homes, direct to the NHS, to the private healthcare sector or to ward
level in Scotland through Shiloh’s own distribution business Fast-Aid.
Within the infection prevention portfolio, the Clinisan range of skin cleansing
products has been strengthened with the addition of smaller can sizes and
complements the continence care system whilst at the same time helping to
control MRSA in the fight against infection.
The Comfi range of tubular bandages marked Shiloh’s first move into the wound management arena and Comfi is
now on NHS contract in England, Scotland and Wales. With a dedicated team targeting the community market Comfi
is now listed on many Primary Care Trust formularies. Both Comfi and ROHO pressure care products complement our
offering to tissue viability nurses. Vacutex, a capillary-action primary dressing, has recently been added to the range.
Other healthcare products include alcohol wipes, disposable gowns, facemasks, protective clothing for the workplace
and cotton wool. Our Simply Gentle Organic cotton wool brand is manufactured and supplied to some of the major
retail outlets throughout the country and is fully compliant with The Soil Association Organic Standard.
2 Active Care
The re-branding and consolidation of the mobility and rehabilitation businesses
acquired and built since 2000 continues. Shiloh Active Care is committed to
helping people lead more active lives – whatever their age or situation. It does
this through the provision of high quality mobility and rehabilitation
products, services and after-care support.
The division operates a number of assessment centres across the UK – many
of which are attached to service centres for NHS contracts. The division has
been successful in being awarded new NHS wheelchair services contracts in
Lancashire and Northern Ireland with dedicated service and assessment centres 
being established in Preston and Belfast to support these.
Shiloh Active Care’s product range is now a common offering throughout the UK and includes wheelchairs, scooters,
hoists, beds, pressure relief products, specialist seating and aids for daily living. The division works in partnership with
key suppliers including Sunrise Medical and has exclusive distribution agreements with Sumed and Roho for seating
and pressure relief products.
Most of Shiloh Active Care’s sales are to the NHS or Social Services through a combination of product and service
contracts. These products and services are also available to individual customers through our network of assessment
centres and a specialist mail order catalogue.
Shiloh Active Care is well positioned to provide a competitive, high quality service in a traditionally fragmented market
and help make life a little easier for the elderly and disabled.
Sterilisation Services
Shiloh’s Sterilisation Services Division was established seven years ago as a new concept for the decontamination of
surgical instruments in the private sector. It operates from custom-built sterilisation facilities at Strathclyde Business
Park, Lanarkshire, supporting hospitals across central Scotland.
The Department of Health has publicly acknowledged that in the years ahead the need for fully-compliant
decontamination facilities across the U.K. will increase and that private sector companies are expected to provide a
significant number of those facilities. Accordingly, in June 2003 it published a strategy for modernising the provision of
decontamination services and has since embarked on the NHS Decontamination Programme for England.
Using its experience of operating a modern off-site facility that is strictly compliant with European regulations, the
division is committed to further expansion of this successful area of activity to take full advantage of the opportunities
arising from the decontamination programme. 
3 Overview
The result for the year is disappointing and does not
reflect the tremendous energy and effort involved in re-
positioning the Group as a leading supplier of products
and services to the National Health Service and the private
healthcare market. 
The cost and time taken to make the necessary changes
to re-position the Group have been much greater than
expected.  In particular, the re-structuring of our four
mobility acquisitions into one division, Shiloh Active Care,
has proved a costly exercise and has had a significant
negative impact on operating profit.
The Medical Division has had a year of mixed fortunes.
Our Glasgow based distribution operation, Fast-Aid
Products, has again turned in an excellent performance,
but the main Oldham-based operation has been adversely
affected by the costs involved in re-structuring and
changing the product mix.  We have withdrawn from
some low margin business and started to build up a range
of higher margin products, most notably our Comfi
bandage range of woundcare products and the Clinisan
brand of emollient cleansing foam. These two products
have resulted in new sales of over £900,000, which have
replaced nearly £2 million of low margin business, mainly
in workwear.
Under these circumstances, the Group has done well to
maintain sales at a similar level to last year at £45.12
million.  
A priority during the year has been the development of
our Sterilisation Services Division where we can clearly see
good prospects for profitable expansion in the future. Our
unique purpose-built sterilisation unit at Bellshill, servicing
hospitals in the Glasgow and Lanarkshire region, has now
had three years of profitable operation. We plan to build
on this success by using our skills and the experience
gained in this field to develop more units on the back of
the NHS programme for outsourcing sterilisation services
on a national basis.
Details of this programme have now been announced and
the NHS is in the process of issuing tender documents for
the first wave of contracts.   I am very pleased to report
that Shiloh Sterilisation Services has been short-listed for
some of these contracts and we are hopeful that we will
win one or more in the first wave.
The contracts will be awarded for a ten to fifteen year
term and would require us to raise additional finance.
The Directors are currently considering the best means of
securing this finance as they believe that the successful
growth of the Sterilisation Services Division is an important
way forward for the Group.
Chairman’s
“We must maximise the opportunities that the growth
in the national healthcare budget presents”
Statement
4 5
A review of the operation of the three divisions is contained in the
Chief Executive’s report. 
Results
Profit for the year before tax, exceptional items, amortisation and
interest is £428,000 (2003: £1.23 million).
Sales are £45.12 million (2003: £45.44 million).
Group profit before tax is £310,000 (2003: £490,000) after charging
amortisation of intangible assets of £290,000 and crediting an
exceptional profit on property sales of £367,000.
Earnings per share before amortisation of intangible assets and
exceptional items are 2.66p per share (2003: 12.13p)
Dividend
As a reflection of our confidence in the future, the Directors believe
they are justified in maintaining the dividend at the same level as last
year and therefore recommend a final dividend of 3.85p per share
making the total dividend for the year 5.35p (2003: 5.35p).
Property
We were successful in completing the sale of our three surplus
properties during the year, namely Park Mill and the previous Head
Office in Holden Fold, both in Royton, and Swan Lane Mill in Bolton.
These properties realised £1.84 million and resulted in an exceptional
profit of £367,000.
Finance
Cash flow has been favourable during the year and net borrowings
have been reduced by £796,000 to £1.54 million.
£681,000 has been spent on new plant and equipment, mainly on
upgrading the Shiloh Connect and other IT systems, and on additional
manufacturing plant. In addition, there is a commitment of over
£400,000 to purchase a new wipes manufacturing machine which will
result in greater efficiency and significant cost savings.
It is pleasing to note that the FRS 17 valuation of our defined benefit
pension scheme has risen by £672,000 during the year due to an
increase in the value of the scheme’s investments.
Directors
The Director retiring by rotation under the Company’s Articles of
Association is Mr Dieno George. Mr George has decided not to offer
himself for re-election and will retire at the conclusion of the Annual
General Meeting on 18
th
June.
I would like to thank Dieno for the contribution he has made as a non-
executive Director since he joined the Board in 2001. His knowledge of
the healthcare industry and his contribution to the Board’s strategic
thinking has been invaluable.
Employees 
As always, we rely on the dedication and professionalism of our
employees which has been clearly demonstrated in what has been a
tough year.  My Board colleagues and I greatly appreciate the support
and commitment they have shown, particularly in accepting the
changes that have been necessary to move the Group forward.
Outlook
We expect the demand for the Group’s products and services to
continue to grow in line with the growth in the national healthcare
budget.  It is up to us to maximise the opportunities that this presents.
I believe that we can gain advantage from an environment that places
healthcare at the top of the list of national priorities and that, with the
work that has been done to re-shape the Group over the last two years,
we will move forward in the coming year.
Edmund T Gartside Chairman A key focus for the year has been on higher margin
activity. Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased
from 27.4% to 29.2%, reflecting the improving margins
within the business despite the adverse impact of the
strengthening of the Euro. Currency movements had a
negative impact on profitability for the year of £325,000.
During the year, we have continued to incur significant
restructuring costs and these have impacted on the
operating profit.
The surplus properties have now all been disposed of
and are no longer a distraction to the core business.
Cash flow was another focus for the Group during the
year and the operating cash inflow of £576,000 (2003:
£1.8 million before exceptional items) was encouraging,
given the profit performance.
Medical
The division is focused primarily on disposable products
for use within the NHS and the private healthcare sector.
It provides product and service solutions in the areas of
continence care, infection prevention and wound
management.
Divisional sales were £32.1 million, down from £33.3
million in 2003. Within the division, we saw another
strong performance from our Scottish distribution
business, Fast-Aid Products, whilst Macdonald & Taylor,
our cotton wool business, delivered a sound set of results
in difficult market conditions. Sales of Simply Gentle
Organic cotton wool again grew strongly, albeit from a
modest base.
Shiloh Healthcare, comprising the continence care,
infection prevention and wound management businesses
had a difficult year, facing fierce price competition as a
result of changes in purchasing strategies within the NHS.
At the half year, we said that we were reviewing strategy
as regards Home Delivery activities for continence care
products because this part of the business made losses 
in the early part of the year. We have now refined
warehousing and distribution systems to improve
profitability while maintaining service levels.
Overall, sales of continence care products were flat year
on year, although sales of product through the Home
Delivery service, where margins are lowest, increased by
more than 8%. Most of the negative currency
movements in Shiloh Healthcare were as a result of a
long-term supply agreement for sub-contracted
continence care products sold through the Home Delivery
service. We have negotiated a new arrangement with
The Group is in the process of transforming itself 
from operating in commodity healthcare sectors, which
demand high levels of overhead expenditure due to high
service levels expected by our key customers, to higher
margin branded products and services. 
Last year, I explained the restructuring of the business
into three divisions – Medical, Active Care and
Sterilisation Services. When we announced the half 
year results in October, we gave an update on trading
conditions and initiated a detailed review of costs and
sales given the poor performance in the first half of the
year, particularly in the Active Care division. As a result,
changes were implemented without delay and the cost
base reduced to reflect the sales which were lower than
we had anticipated. Although the result for the year is
disappointing, it is encouraging that it was slightly ahead
of our re-forecast following the detailed review.
Chief Executive’s
Review
6
“Our stategy remains on
course. Actions taken
during the second half of
the year have placed us in
a much stronger position
to deliver the strategy” substantially lower prices and no risk from currency movements. 
This arrangement started in the new financial year.
Sales of infection prevention products fell, as planned, by more than
25% year on year. This is consistent with our strategy allowing us to
concentrate on our own brand, Primeguard. 
Following the renewal of the NHS dry wipes contract, which we
announced at the half year, we have taken the decision to invest 
in state of the art manufacturing plant for this key product area. 
This equipment is currently being installed and we expect it to be 
in operation during the month of May. 
Sales of our new wound management products grew strongly during
the year both in the primary care (community) sector and in the acute
care (hospital) sector, where we now hold more than 12% of the
market. Following the year end, we have signed an agreement with
Pro-Tex Capillary Dressings Ltd who have appointed us as their exclusive
UK distributor for Vacutex, a novel primary wound dressing for use on
all kinds of chronic wounds. We see this as a major step in us further
developing this key market area.
Active Care
This division supplies and maintains a comprehensive range of mobility
and rehabilitation equipment across the UK. The range includes
wheelchairs, scooters, hoists, slings, stair lifts, ramps, chairs, beds and
general aids.
Division sales were £10.8 million, an increase of 8.4%. At the half year,
we said that two units had been closed and that further rationalisation
was planned. Since then we have closed three small and poorly
performing sites. Although we have lost some contract business in
Merseyside, we have been awarded two large wheelchair service and
repair contracts in Northern Ireland and Preston and accordingly have
opened two new sites. The result of this additional contract activity
means that our annual contract-oriented business has grown by more
than £0.5 million, further reducing our reliance on private sales. In line
with our stated aims, the proportion of institutional sales has increased
from 54% to 59%.
The re-branding exercise, introducing the “Shiloh Active Care” brand
across the Group, continues to progress according to our plans and we
expect the exercise to be complete early in the current financial year.
We have received a very positive response from both customers and
employees. The restructuring of our Active Care Division has been more
complex than anticipated and consolidation of computer systems in the
new financial year will enhance our ability to derive benefit from our
purchasing strength.
Our relationship with Sumed International UK Ltd and Roho Inc for
pressure care products remains very strong and much of the sales
increase in the year was as a result of these new arrangements. During
the current financial year, we will be changing the sales force structure
to ensure that even more emphasis is placed on this key area.
The new Mail Order catalogue has been well received and is already
making a good contribution to sales. We intend that private sales will
increasingly be made through this route with less dependency on the
traditional retail channel.
At the half year, we said that costs would be reduced in the second
half. This exercise was completed quickly with most of the savings
coming from the Active Care Division.
Sterilisation Services
This division was established as a new concept for the decontamination
of surgical instruments in the private sector. It operates from custom-
built sterilisation facilities at Bellshill, Lanarkshire.
The business performed well during the year with sales in line with the
previous year but with improved levels of gross profit as a result of an
increase in the focus on higher margin reprocessing work. The unit has
now established itself as a sound business with capacity to grow as new
opportunities arise.
In June 2003, the NHS announced its plans to upgrade
decontamination facilities throughout England. We have been very
active in this project and see this as a significant opportunity to expand
our division by building new facilities south of the border.
Management
It has been a difficult year for the business. The management team and
employees have worked hard in implementing the changes necessary to
rebase the business. 
During the year, Paul Davies was appointed Managing Director of Shiloh
Active Care. Paul has nearly twenty years experience of the mobility
industry having joined us in 2000 when we acquired ICR Mobility.
We also strengthened the finance team with the appointment of Marie
Greenwood as Financial Controller. Marie is a Chartered Accountant
and joined us from Northern Foods Plc.
Strategy
Our aim is to develop innovative, long-term, mutually-beneficial
partnerships with healthcare providers in the supply of continence care,
mobility and rehabilitation, prevention of infection and wound
management. These partnerships will add value through the supply,
distribution and brand development of the products and services we
provide.
Our intention is to:
  consolidate the four mobility acquisitions under the Shiloh
Active Care brand and create a market-leading company in a
fragmented market by focusing on our core strength in
contract rather than retail sales
  grow the medical business by adding complementary products
in the continence care, infection prevention and wound
management markets, either through acquisition or through
distribution arrangements
  establish new sterilisation facilities in England using experience
derived from our Bellshill unit
Our strategy remains on course although we recognise that the
transformation process has taken longer than we envisaged. We believe
that actions taken in the second half of the year have placed us in a
much stronger position to deliver the strategy.

Environment
The Group recognises its environmental responsibilities and is committed to minimising any damage which its activities may cause to the
environment. In addition, it actively pursues a number of environmental policies including those designed to conserve energy and recycle
waste materials wherever practicable.
One Group company, Macdonald & Taylor Limited, has been working closely with the Biore Tanzanian organic cotton farming project to
develop and promote the growth of organic cotton. The company contributes a small percentage of its sales of organic cotton wool to a
fund to assist the farmers and their families with this project and as a result was the first U.K. company to achieve the SA8000 social
accountability standard whilst also being certified to the ISO14001 environmental standard.
Payments to Suppliers
The Company agrees terms and conditions for its transactions with suppliers. Payment is then made, subject to the terms and conditions
being met by the supplier. The number of days’ purchases outstanding for the Group at 31st March 2004 was 63 (2003 - 69).
Political and Charitable Donations
Charitable donations during the year totalled £2,768 (2003 - £635). In addition, some Group companies have supported a number of
voluntary organisations within their local communities.
Special Business
The following special business will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting on 18th June 2004:
i) Under the Company’s Articles of Association the Directors have the power to allot shares in accordance with section 80 of the Companies
Act 1985, subject to the approval of shareholders at a general meeting. Approval will be sought to renew this authority for another year
and to authorise the Directors to allot ordinary shares of up to £322,877, which is the balance of the unissued share capital of the company
and represents 19% of the issued capital (Resolution 6).
ii) Subject to the passing of Resolution 6 the Directors are seeking authority under section 89 of the Companies Act 1985 to allot shares for
cash, other than by way of a rights issue, up to a maximum of 5% of the nominal value of the issued share capital (Resolution 7).
iii) The Directors seek shareholders’ approval to renew the authority to allow the Company to purchase its own shares in respect of up to
10% of the issued capital at prices not exceeding 5% of the average mid-market price for the five business days preceding the purchase.
The Directors have no immediate intention of using this authority and would only do so if, in their view, it was in the best interests of the
Company at the time (Resolution 8).
Resolutions to implement the above authorities are set out in the notice of the Annual General Meeting on page 33 and the authorities
would expire at the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting or after fifteen months, whichever is the earlier.
Auditors
Waterworths have expressed their willingness to continue in office and a resolution for their re-appointment will be proposed at the
forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
By Order of the Board,

Secretary
5th May 2004
10 Corporate Governance and Directors’ Responsibilities
Corporate Governance
Combined Code
The Board considers that the company has complied with the detailed provisions of the Combined Code of Best Practice on Corporate
Governance throughout the year, except where noted. The Board considers the level of compliance to be appropriate for an organisation of
its size and nature. 
The Board
The Board comprises the part-time Chairman, three executive and three independent non-executive directors. The full Board meets on a
monthly basis and its procedures are sufficient to ensure that the direction of the Group is firmly controlled.
The Company’s Articles of Association provide for one third (or the number nearest to but not exceeding one third) of the non-executive
directors to be subject to re-election at each Annual General Meeting. There is no such requirement for the executive directors. 
As the Board is small, the appointment of new directors is a matter reserved for the whole Board, and there is no need for a separate
nomination committee.
All directors have full and timely access to all relevant information and independent professional advice.
Audit Committee
The Company has an Audit Committee consisting of non-executive directors under the chairmanship of Mr J.R.B.Gould. The members of
the Audit Committee are disclosed on page 8. The Committee meets at least three times a year and its terms of reference follow those
recommended by the Combined Code, ensuring an objective and professional relationship is maintained with the Auditors. The Auditors are
invited to attend as required, and other Board members may attend as appropriate.
Relations with Shareholders
After the announcement of the interim and final results the Directors encourage dialogue with the major institutional shareholders. There
is an opportunity for individual private shareholders to question directors at the Annual General Meeting and the Company regularly
responds to communications from shareholders on a wide range of issues.
Directors’ Responsibilities
Internal Control
The Combined Code requires the Directors to review the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal control.
The Directors acknowledge their responsibility for the Group’s system of internal control and that the Board has ultimate responsibility for
ensuring that the Group has in place a system of controls, financial and otherwise, that is appropriate to the business environment in which
it operates. This is intended to ensure that the Directors maintain full and effective control over all significant strategic, financial,
organisational and compliance issues. However, any system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business
objectives and can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Board confirms that it has established the procedures necessary to comply with the Turnbull Guidance.
The Board has identified the significant risks faced by the Company, its subsidiaries and divisions. The Board continues to develop procedures
to evaluate, manage and minimise such risks. The key procedures are being defined in Group manuals. The Board recognises that internal
controls must evolve, and the Board reviews them annually.
The Board has considered the need for internal audit and has developed a structure within which such a function can report to the Board.
This function began during the year and is in the early stages of development.
Going Concern
The Directors confirm that, after having made appropriate enquiries, they have a reasonable expectation that the Group and Company have
adequate resources to continue operating for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the Directors continue to adopt the Going Concern basis
in the preparation of the accounts.
11 Directors’ Responsibilities (continued)
Accounts
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of
affairs of the Company and Group, and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing those financial statements, the
Directors are required to:
• Select suitable accounting policies and apply them consistently
• Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent
• State whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in
the financial statements
• Prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company and Group will
continue in business
The Directors are responsible for maintaining proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial
position of the Group, and to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for
safeguarding the assets of the Group, and for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
A copy of the financial statements for the Company is placed on the Shiloh PLC website. The maintenance and integrity of this website is
the responsibility of the Directors. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and publication of financial statements may
differ from the legislation in other jurisdictions.
12 Directors’ Remuneration Report
Remuneration Committee
The committee consists of Messrs E.T.Gartside (Chairman), J.R.B.Gould and R.E.Hough, all of whom are non-executive directors.
The Committee is responsible for pay and salary policy throughout the Group and determines the remuneration package and conditions of
service of executive directors and other senior executives.
Remuneration Policy
Remuneration policy aims to ensure that the remuneration packages offered attract, motivate and retain high calibre executives and to
recognise the importance of achieving short and long term performance objectives and enhancing shareholder value, whilst at the same
time being consistent with policies applied to other employees in the Group.
Directors’ Remuneration
Details of the remuneration of all the Directors who have held office in the year are shown in note 5 to the accounts.
The emoluments of the Executive Directors consist of basic salary, performance linked bonus, pension contributions and other taxable
benefits, which include the provision of a car or car allowance, private health insurance and life assurance.
Performance Related Bonuses
The Executive  Directors, along with other senior managers, are eligible for annual bonuses based on performance targets. The performance
targets are based either on growth in earnings per share, growth in profits or on other personal targets on which the individual has a direct
influence. There is a maximum entitlement of between 15% of basic salary and 50% of basic salary dependent on the level of responsibility.
No performance related bonuses were earned by the Executive Directors during the year.
Executive Share Options
The Group operates an approved executive share option scheme, under which the Executive Directors benefit along with other senior
executives. Details of options held by the Executive Directors are shown in note 5 to the accounts. The options are issued subject to a
performance criterion of growth in earnings per share of 6% above inflation over a three-year period.
Service Agreements
Mr J. Edwards has a service agreement which provides for one year’s notice by either side.
Pensions
Messrs G.J.Collyer and J.Edwards are members of the Group’s defined contribution pension scheme. Contributions to the scheme are
disclosed in note 5 to the accounts.
Mr E.Robinson is a member of the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme, to which the company contributes 13.8% of salary.
Details of the Executive Directors’ pension entitlements are shown in note 5 to the accounts.
Performance of the Company
The  graph below charts the investment performance of the Company since 1st April 1999 against the FTSE All Share Index which is regarded
as the most direct comparator for this purpose.
Audit
The Directors’ remuneration, pensions, performance related bonuses and share options have been subject to audit.
By order of the Board
Edmund T. Gartside
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee.

Total Shareholder Return Report of the Independent Auditors
To the shareholders of Shiloh PLC
We have audited the financial statements of Shiloh PLC for the year ended 31st March 2004, which comprise the Consolidated Profit and
Loss Account, the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Total Recognised
Gains and Losses and the related notes. These financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by
the revaluation of certain fixed assets and the accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited the information in the Directors’
Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the
Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial statements in
accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited in accordance with
relevant legal and regulatory requirements and United Kingdom Auditing Standards.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements and the
part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We
also report to you if, in our opinion, the Directors’ Report is not consistent with the financial statements, if the Company has not kept proper
accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law
regarding directors’ remuneration and transactions with the Company and other members of the Group is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement reflects the Company’s compliance with the seven provisions of the Combined
Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required to
consider whether the Board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial statements. The
other information comprises only the Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive’s Review, the Directors’ Report, the unaudited part of the
Directors’ Remuneration Report, the Corporate Governance Statement, the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities, the Financial Record and
the Financial Highlights. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material
inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with United Kingdom Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes
examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and the part of the Directors’
Remuneration Report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgments made by the directors in the
preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate in the Company’s circumstances, consistently
applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide
us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to
be audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also
evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration
report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
  the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and the Company’s affairs as at 31st March 2004 and of
the Group’s profit for the year then ended; and
  the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance
with the Companies Act 1985.

1  Accounting policies
The accounts have been prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of certain fixed assets,
and comply with applicable U.K. accounting standards. The principal accounting policies which the Directors have adopted within the
convention are as follows:
Basis of consolidation - The Group accounts consolidate the accounts of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings. The financial
statements are prepared for the 12 month period ended 31st March in each year. The results of companies and businesses acquired are
included from the date of acquisition.
Intangible fixed assets - Goodwill: Goodwill arising on acquisitions, being the difference between the fair value of the purchase
consideration and the fair value of the identifiable net assets of an acquired company or business, is capitalised and amortised in equal
annual instalments over its useful economic life, normally a period not exceeding 20 years. Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 31st
December 1997 has been set off directly against reserves. In accordance with FRS10 “Goodwill and Intangible Assets”, previously written
off goodwill has not been reinstated.
Brands: Acquired brands are only recognised on the balance sheet as intangible assets where title is clear, brand earnings are separately
identifiable, the brand could be sold separately from the rest of the business and where the brand achieves earnings in excess of those
achieved by unbranded products. Brands are amortised over their estimated useful economic lives, normally a period not exceeding 20 years.
Depreciation - Land: Depreciation is not provided on freehold and leasehold land.
Buildings: Depreciation is provided on buildings so as to write off their cost or valuation over 40 years, or, in the case of leasehold property,
over the term of the lease.
Plant and Machinery: Depreciation of plant and machinery, office equipment and vehicles is calculated to write off their cost during their
expected normal lives at rates ranging from 10% to 33%.
Investment properties - The investment property was included in the balance sheet at its open market value and was not depreciated.
Although this accounting policy is in accordance with the applicable accounting standard, SSAP 19, “Accounting for Investment Properties”,
it is a departure from the general requirement of the Companies Act 1985 for all tangible assets to be depreciated. In the opinion of the
Directors, compliance with the standard is necessary for the financial statements to give a true and fair view. Depreciation is only one of
many factors reflected in the annual valuation and the amount which might otherwise have been included cannot be separately identified
or quantified.
Stocks - Stocks are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value, and cost includes an appropriate proportion of production overheads.
Turnover - Turnover of the Group is the invoiced sales less returns to external customers exclusive of value added tax.
Deferred taxation - Except where otherwise required by accounting standards, full provision without discounting is made for all timing
differences which have arisen but not reversed at the balance sheet date.
Pensions - The Group operates a defined benefit scheme for full time staff employees who were on the payroll on 20th October 1997.
Contributions are based on percentages of members’ pensionable remuneration as fixed by independent actuaries. The cost of contributing
to this scheme is charged to the profit and loss account over the estimated service lives of the employees. On adoption of FRS17, “Retirement
Benefits”, the Group has followed the transitional provisions at 31st March 2004 as disclosed in note 30. The Group also operates or
contributes to a number of defined contribution schemes. The costs of the contributions to the defined contribution schemes are charged
to the profit and loss account as they are incurred.
Leased assets - Fixed assets held under finance leases are capitalised and depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or their expected
useful lives. The finance charges are allocated during the lease term so that the charge for each accounting period is a constant percentage
of the remaining balance of the capital sum outstanding. The costs of operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account as they
accrue.
Government grants - Grants received in respect of tangible fixed assets are treated as a deferred credit and are released to the profit and
loss account in equal instalments over the estimated useful economic life of the assets concerned.
Foreign currency translation - Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of
exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
All translation differences are taken to the profit and loss account.
2  Information by class of business 
The turnover, operating profit and net assets are attributable to the one principal activity of the Group.
Turnover of the Group outside the United Kingdom amounted to £274,000 (2003 - £619,000).

13  Earnings per share
The basic earnings per share figures have been calculated by reference to the weighted average of 6,694,575 shares in issue during the year
(2003-6,655,137) and, in respect of the full earnings per share figures, the Group profit for the financial year of £203,000 (2003-£308,000).
A reconciliation of this figure to the alternative figure in the profit and loss account is as follows:
Full earnings 203 3.03 308 4.62
Amortisation of intangible assets 290 4.34 223 3.35

The Directors present the alternative earnings per share figures in order to give an additional indication of the Group’s underlying
performance.
The diluted earnings per share figure, on both bases above, has been calculated using the same earnings numerators as set out above, by
reference to an adjusted average number of shares, as follows:

30  Pensions
The Group operates a defined benefit pension scheme, providing benefits based on the final pensionable salary, and defined contribution
pension schemes for eligible employees.
The assets of the defined benefit pension scheme are held in separate trustee administered funds and the Group’s contributions to the
scheme are determined by the Directors based on triennial valuations by a qualified actuary using the age attained method. The defined
benefit scheme is now closed to new members and the salary level by which benefits are calculated is now capped at £50,000.
The most recent valuation was dated 20th October 2001. The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the
valuation are those relating to the rate of return on investments and the rate of increases in salaries. It was assumed the investment return
would be 7% per annum and that salary increases would average 5% per annum. The most recent actuarial valuation showed that the
market value of the scheme’s assets was £6.8 million and that the actuarial value of those assets represented 100% of the benefits that had
accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The Pensions Act 1995 introduced the Minimum Funding Requirement for defined benefit pension schemes. Calculations have been carried
out to assess the scheme’s funding position against the Minimum Funding Requirement and on the prescribed basis the value of the scheme’s
assets represented 106% of the value of the benefits as at 20th October 2001.
The contributions of the Group are currently 13.8% of basic earnings. Scheme members contribute 6% of basic earnings. In addition, the
Group makes contributions to provide death in service benefits, which are a refund of contributions and a lump sum equal to three times
Scheme salary. One half of the accrued pension shown is also payable should there be a surviving spouse.
The pension cost of this scheme to the Group was £130,000 (2003 - £271,000). The reduction in cost has arisen partly because of the top
up to the scheme in the previous year and partly because of the departure of several employees who were members of the Scheme.
The Group also paid £113,000 (2003 - £111,000) into the separate defined contribution schemes.
Whilst the Group continues to account for pensions in accordance with SSAP 24, “Accounting for Pension Costs”, as above, under FRS 17,
“Retirement Benefits”, the following transitional disclosures are required:
The valuations were updated by the actuary on an FRS 17 basis as at 31st March 2004.
The major assumptions used by the actuary were:

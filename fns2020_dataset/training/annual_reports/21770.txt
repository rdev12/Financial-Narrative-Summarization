MORTGAGE EXPRESS
ESTABLISHED 1986
Bradford & Bingley’s specialist mortgage
products are sold under the Mortgage Express
brand, mostly through third party intermediaries.
These products cover niche areas of the
mortgage market which are attractive because
higher returns are available when compared to
those in the mainstream market. In order to
generate these returns, Bradford & Bingley has
developed a deep understanding of those niche
lending markets and strong specialist skills in
product development, underwriting, operations,
arrears and collections.
BUY-TO-LET
MARKET SHARE 20%
Mortgage Express was a pioneer of buy-to-let
products in the mid 1 990s. Bradford & Bingley
provides loans to landlords and residential
property investors using our extensive
underwriting experience in this specialist market.
We are currently one of the leading buy-to-let
providers in the UK with balances of £ 1 5.1bn.
SELF-CERT
TOTAL BALANCES £4.7bn
These loans are for individuals who have
complex income streams such as the self-
employed and those with multiple jobs. Bradford
& Bingley is a major player in this market. We use
credit scoring techniques and manually
underwrite loans to minimise credit risk.
LIFETIME
POSITION IN MARKET 3rd
Lifetime loans enable customers over 60 years
old to gradually release the equity they have
built up in their main residence as an income
stream. Bradford & Bingley has been one of
the pioneers of this product in the last two
years and is one of the top three lenders in
this fast-growing segment of the market.
STANDARD MORTGAGES
TOTAL BALANCES £5.8bn
Bradford & Bingley has a portfolio of
traditional residential mortgages, mainly
originated through the branches prior to
conversion to plc status at the end of 2000.
COMMERCIAL PROPERTY FINANCE
TOTAL BALANCES £2.7bn
This division predominantly provides loans to
investors in income producing commercial real
estate in the UK. These loans are, for the most
part, secured on retail, ofﬁce or industrial
property. The division also has a small business
making loans to developers of pre-sold or pre-
let commercial property, and residential
development schemes.
HOUSING ASSOCIATION LENDING
TOTAL BALANCES £2.3bn
Bradford & Bingley provides funding to housing
associations throughout the UK. Housing
associations are non-proﬁt organisations that
provide affordable rented homes for people
unable to satisfy their housing needs in the
open market. Funding for development of new
stock or refurbishment of existing properties is
partially funded by a grant payment from the
Housing Corporation but housing associations
must raise the remainder from private sources.
BUSINESS OVERVIEW
We have a clear strategy and an appropriate
structure to drive the business forward in our two
main business segments, Lending and Retail.
Lending
Bradford & Bingley’s Lending business develops and
manufactures a range of specialist lending products
secured on UK residential property. The Group also
provides loans secured on commercial property and
makes loans to housing associations. We do not
participate in the unsecured consumer lending markets. 3 BRADFORD & BINGLEY ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2005 WWW.BBG.CO.UK
INTERNET ACCOUNTS
TOTAL BALANCES £2.0bn
In late 2004, as part of its drive to diversify the
channels used for gathering savings deposits,
Bradford & Bingley entered the market with the
launch of a range of highly competitive internet
accounts. This addition to the Group’s savings
range has proved to be extremely successful.
DIRECT ACCOUNTS
BY POST TELEPHONE
Bradford & Bingley provides direct savings
accounts which can be accessed via the
telephone or by post. It is also possible for
customers to open and operate the majority of
our branch based accounts by post.
OFFSHORE SAVINGS
TOTAL DEPOSITS £2.4bn
Bradford & Bingley also operates an offshore
savings business, Bradford & Bingley International
Limited, based in the Isle of Man. It attracts funds
predominantly from outside the United Kingdom
from both corporate and personal customers.
MORTGAGES
The Group offers customers a wide choice of
highly competitive mortgages from a panel of
mortgage providers.
INVESTMENT PRODUCTS
The Group also offers ﬁnancial planning advice
and a wide range of products through our
partnership with Legal & General (‘L&G’). Their
advisers are located in our branch network and
provide advice and products in the investment,
retirement and life protection areas.
INSURANCE PRODUCTS
Competitive personal general insurance
products are also offered through our
branches including motor insurance and home
insurance sales from a panel of providers.
Bradford & Bingley also sells travel insurance
through introductions to a tied partner.
RECORD HALF-YEAR PERIOD 
FOR RESIDENTIAL LENDING
£4.7bn
RETAIL PROFIT BEFORE TAX
+14%
Retail
The Retail business is run through the Group’s nationwide
network of 207 branches, 1 45 franchise outlets and also
through internet and telephone channels. The Savings
business has a dual role for the Group – to gather
deposits to help fund the Lending business and to help
generate customers for other Retail products.
BRANCH BASED ACCOUNTS
TOTAL DEPOSITS £12.6bn
The Group provides a wide range of retail savings
accounts including instant access deposit accounts,
regular savings accounts, ﬁxed and variable rate
bonds, tax efﬁcient accounts (ISAs), children’s
accounts and tracker accounts on which the
interest rates are automatically linked to Bank of
England base rates. 4 BRADFORD & BINGLEY ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2005 WWW.BBG.CO.UK
“The Group’s success in
2005 is directly attributable
to the restructuring exercise
we started in 2004. Bradford
& Bingley’s strategy provides
the right direction for
continued success for a
differentiated and innovative
specialist mortgage lender.”
Bradford & Bingley has grown proﬁts and
continued the successful development of its
Lending and Retail businesses in 2005. This
performance is particularly pleasing given the
extent of the changes that the Group has
undergone in the last eighteen months.
Underlying proﬁt increased 1 1% to £31 0.1 million
and underlying earnings per share increased 9%
to 35.4 pence per share. Proﬁt before tax and
loss on sale of discontinued operations
increased by 1 4% to £263.5 million (2004:
£231.9 million).
Dividend
The Board is pleased to propose a ﬁnal dividend
of 1 2.3 pence per share for payment on 5 May
2006 to shareholders on the register as at 
24 March 2006. If approved, the full year
dividend for 2005 will be 1 8.3 pence per share
(2004: 1 7.1 pence), an increase of 7%. The
Board will continue to seek to balance dividend
payments with the capital requirements of the
Group’s growing Balance Sheet.
Lending
Our total lending balances increased 7% to
£31.1 billion (2004: £29.0 billion) and total new
lending was £8.8 billion (2004: £9.2 billion)
including acquired assets.
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Continued success
Rod Kent
CHAIRMAN 5 BRADFORD & BINGLEY ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2005 WWW.BBG.CO.UK
Growth was predominantly driven by our
residential lending business where we grew
balances by 1 0% to £26.1 billion including
acquired assets, the Group’s best ever
residential lending performance.
Net interest margin decline has slowed
appreciably as our asset and liability mixes 
have stabilised. We expect a more stable trend
moving forward.
The arrears performance across all our
portfolios has continued to be good. The
Group’s experience in the specialist lending
markets and prudent approach to
underwriting is a substantial driver of this.
Balance Sheet and capital
We have continued to improve the diversity
and balance of our funding platform in 2005.
We made issues through our master trust
securitisation programme, our covered bond
programme and into the wholesale markets. In
addition, the Savings business has made an
important contribution.
The Group remains well capitalised and capital
ratios are within target ranges.
Retail
We have made progress with simplifying and
enhancing our customer proposition in our retail
branches. Efﬁciency gains made in 2004 have
been improved upon and our partnership with
L&G has continued to be fruitful.
Savings has had a strong year with balances
increasing by £ 1.5 billion to £ 1 7.7 billion.
Costs
Our cost cutting initiative has now been
successfully concluded. This has driven a
wholesale improvement in the cost dynamics
of the Group, driving proﬁt growth in 2005
and allowing us to convert a higher proportion
of income into beneﬁts for our shareholders in
the future. A stronger vigilance against cost has
developed within the Group.
There has been a cost attached to the Group’s
reorganisation amounting to £7.9 million. The
Board remains conﬁdent that this cost will be
rapidly offset by the beneﬁts of the substantial
savings we have achieved.
In common with ﬁnancial services ﬁrms across
the market, we have experienced an increased
level of claims for compensation for mis-sold
investment and endowment products. This has
exceeded the level we had previously
provided and a further charge of £38.7 million
is required. In 2004 the Group closed its
independent ﬁnancial advisory business which
was responsible for selling these products.
Board
I was pleased to welcome two new Executive
Directors to the Board in the second half of
the year. Chris Willford was appointed Group
Finance Director and Chris Gillespie was
appointed Group Lending Director.
I would like to express my sincere thanks to
Rosemary Thorne, who left the Board and the
Group in late 2005, for her contribution over
the last six years.
People
Bradford & Bingley’s continued success comes
about as a direct result of the efforts of the
people who work for the Group. We went
through substantial change and saw many
challenges during 2005. The commitment of
our employees has formed the bedrock of our
performance during a testing period.
Outlook
The Group is well placed moving into 2006.
Bradford & Bingley is stronger, leaner and
better equipped to convert growth into proﬁt.
The mortgage and housing markets are looking
robust, our lending pipeline is strong and we
expect our chosen segments of the lending
market to continue to outperform the wider
mortgage market. Our Retail businesses will
continue to build on the stronger foundations
we have been laying and we will continue to
improve our customers’ experience.
Bradford & Bingley’s strategic aims are clear and
the Group will continue to do what it does
best in 2006: build our strong specialist lending
business and grow our retail operations.
WE HAVE GROWN PROFITS WELL AND CONTINUED
THE SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPMENT OF OUR LENDING
AND RETAIL BUSINESSES IN 2005. THIS PERFORMANCE
IS PARTICULARLY PLEASING GIVEN THE EXTENT OF
THE CHANGES THAT THE GROUP HAS UNDERGONE
IN THE LAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS.

“We have continued to build
on our strong track record in
the specialist lending sector.
Our chosen markets
performed very well during
the second half of 2005 and
we started 2006 in a good
position with a stable, healthy
lending environment.”
2005 was a challenging and successful year for
the Group, a year of two halves in the
residential lending market and a period where
we have consolidated on the intense changes
that we went through in 2004.
My ambitions for the Group in 2005 have
been fulﬁlled. The Lending business has shown
good growth, Retail continues to improve and
the cost cutting programme has been
completed with a new, ongoing vigilance
against unnecessary cost inﬂation now
embedded in the business.
I am delighted that the actions we undertook to
simplify and reinvigorate Bradford & Bingley are
showing such success. We have become a
stronger, healthier organisation and have driven
proﬁt growth off that improved platform with
underlying proﬁt increasing 1 1% to £31 0.1 million
over the year (2004: £280.4 million). The
Group’s proﬁt before tax and loss on sale of
discontinued operations also increased to
£263.5 million (2004: £231.9 million).
During the year, I was pleased to welcome,
Chris Gillespie and Chris Willford to the
Group. Their experience from careers in
ﬁnancial services and other industries brings
added strength and depth to our Board.
GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
Positioned for growth
Steven Crawshaw
GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE This was not a phenomenon conﬁned to
Bradford & Bingley. The overall mortgage
market also had its highest ever half year for
gross lending in the second half of 2005.
However, within the wider recovery, it is highly
signiﬁcant that buy-to-let and self-cert, two of
our main products, grew particularly strongly.
This supports our view that the growth of
these markets is likely to keep on
outperforming the wider mortgage market.
These specialist areas continue to be
supported by strong demographic drivers, a
fundamental shortage of housing stock and, in
the case of buy-to-let, good demand from
landlords for property, as well as from tenants.
The market for buy-to-let loans remains
competitive, but we have not seen any
fundamental change in the nature of the
market or pricing of loans.
We remain committed to strengthening our
position as a leading player in the specialist
lending markets. Our share of the buy-to-let
market was around 20% in the second half of
the year and we are building on our strong
positions in the self-cert and lifetime markets.
Mortgage portfolio acquisitions have continued
to play a part in our lending business with the
Group acquiring £ 1.4 billion of loan portfolios
over the period (2004: £ 1.3 billion). Our
primary focus for growth is our organic
lending. However, mortgage portfolio
acquisitions will continue to provide an
opportunistic, alternative channel.
The environment for our Commercial and
Housing Association lending businesses stayed
ﬁercely competitive during the year, as it had
done in 2004. Commercial property has been
a popular asset class for investors throughout
2005 and is expected to remain so in 2006.
We made new loans where margins and credit
terms were at acceptable levels and protected
the loans we already held on our balance
sheet. At 31 December 2005 the Commercial
and Housing Association book stood at
£5.0 billion (2004: £5.3 billion) with £ 1.6 billion
(2004: £ 1.5 billion) new lending in the year.
7 BRADFORD & BINGLEY ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2005 WWW.BBG.CO.UK
Lending
We have continued to build on our proposition
of lending in more proﬁtable, specialist
segments of the residential mortgage market.
We believe that good growth and attractive
margins are available in our markets and, by
balancing innovative product design with
prudent risk management, Bradford & Bingley
will continue to prosper. We are unique as a
lending institution in our preference for high
quality selective assets with a fully secured loan
portfolio and no exposure to unsecured
consumer lending.
Our Balance Sheet has continued to show
healthy growth with total assets increasing 7%
to £40.8 billion (2004: £38.2 billion). T otal new
advances were £8.8 billion (2004: £9.2 billion)
including acquired assets. The bulk of this was
attributable to our residential lending activities
with the remainder coming from our
Commercial and Housing Association business.
The residential lending market went through a
signiﬁcant change during the course of 2005.
In the ﬁrst half of the year the mortgage market
experienced very low lending volumes and
transaction levels. We had run down business
levels in the autumn of 2004 to reduce
operational pressure over M-Day when
mortgage regulation was introduced and as we
implemented a major operational upgrade that
included switching our residential lending
operations to a new mortgage system. As we
tried to rebuild volumes in the ﬁrst quarter of
2005, the market slowed markedly and we
took a decision to preserve credit quality rather
than compete for the light volumes that were
available in an uncertain credit environment.
In the second quarter the market started to
recover and we became more comfortable
with the credit outlook. We delivered a steady
improvement in the level of applications and
new loans as we moved through the year to
achieve record lending in the second half,
moving back to a more natural position in the
new lending market compared to the ﬁrst half.
This change is particularly clear from our new
residential lending performance – £2.5 billion in
the ﬁrst half and a record £4.7 billion in the
second, representing a share of the total
market of 2% and 3% respectively.
Credit quality and impairment
The UK secured lending credit cycle appears to
have turned for the better. Record high
employment and low interest rates over the last
few years conspired to generate an
exceptionally benign credit environment that
deteriorated in the ﬁrst half of 2004. Since then
a combination of base rate rises, slight
deterioration in employment levels and other
stresses on the UK consumer and economy
have led to a modest rise in arrears across the
market. This upward trend represents a, return
to more normal levels of credit default rather
than a material deterioration. The absolute
numbers of distressed loans in the market
remain very low by historical standards.
We have seen a similar movement within the
Group to that reported in the external market.
Arrears levels across all our portfolios have
been showing a modest upward trend well
within management expectations. We expect
this to continue alongside trends in the overall
mortgage market and, speciﬁcally for Bradford
& Bingley, as the signiﬁcant new lending growth
we have achieved in the past three years
translates into a more mature balance sheet.
At 31 December 2005 residential loans more
than three months in arrears stood at 1.1 9%
(2004: 0.77%) for the whole book and 1.06%
(2004: 0.52%) for our buy-to-let book.
We are conﬁdent that our arrears and bad
debts will remain low as a direct result of our
conservative underwriting processes and
lending policies ensuring that the quality of our
loan books is maintained. Increases in arrears
do not necessarily translate into losses. We
have a high equity cushion in our portfolio, the
average loan-to-value (‘LTV’) of the whole
residential book was 50% (2004: 45%) on an
indexed basis (taking account of house price
inﬂation) and 68% (2004: 67%) on an original
basis (at the time the loan was made) at 
31 December 2005. The average LTV of new
lending remained steady at 73% (2004: 74%).
In addition, we remain well provided for with
an impairment allowance representing 0.1 8%
of residential assets (2004: 0.1 6%).
We continue to have a fully secured balance
sheet and, as such, have no exposure to the
current deterioration in the consumer 
credit market.
WE ARE UNIQUE AS A LENDING INSTITUTION IN OUR
PREFERENCE FOR HIGH QUALITY SELECTIVE ASSETS
WITH A FULLY SECURED LOAN PORTFOLIO AND NO
EXPOSURE TO UNSECURED CONSUMER LENDING. 8 BRADFORD & BINGLEY ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2005 WWW.BBG.CO.UK
Balance Sheet and capital
We worked hard during 2004 and 2005 to
improve the diversiﬁcation of our funding
structure to promote a stronger balance sheet.
At the end of 2005 our success in this task is
evident from our more balanced funding mix –
43% of total liabilities and equity from retail
deposits, 34% wholesale and 1 4% from
secured funding sources (2004: 42%, 39%, and
1 1% respectively).
This does not tell the whole of the
diversiﬁcation story though. We have
broadened our presence in the capital
markets, targeting the full spectrum of
investors in a geographically diverse spread 
of ﬁnancial markets. We have seen good
appetite from investors for our securitisation
master trust, covered bond and wholesale
borrowing programmes.
Although we have experienced some pressure
on our net interest margin as a consequence
of this diversiﬁcation process, a combination of
favourable changes in the relative cost of these
different types of funds and a more stable mix
has reduced this effect. On the asset side, the
run-off of the back book has continued to
diminish in absolute terms and as a percentage
of the book.
As a consequence, Group net interest margin
improved in the second half of the year relative
to the ﬁrst half and only reduced slightly on
2004 (2005: 1.21%, 2004: 1.25%). Looking
forward, our balance sheet and net interest
margin are expected to be more stable.
As a regulated bank, we are required to hold
reserves of capital and the amounts are deﬁned
as the tier 1 and total capital ratios. In line with
our conservative approach to lending, we
remain a well capitalised bank with our year end
tier 1 capital ratio at 7.9% (2004: 7.5%), well
above the regulatory minimum. This is further
bolstered when taken in the context of our
relative lack of life assurance, proprietary trading,
commercial and unsecured lending activities. We
will continue to manage our tier 1 capital within
our stated range of 7% to 8%. Our total capital
ratio also increased to 1 3.5% (2004: 1 3.2%).
Retail
We have continued to improve efﬁciency by
simplifying our sales and distribution processes.
Our relationship with L&G continues to develop
and this arrangement offers good growth and
income prospects for the coming year. General
insurance sales stabilised as we have successfully
moved new sales to the counters in our
branches rather than being related to our old
Building Society mortgage sales.
Savings showed an excellent performance
during 2005. Balances have increased 9% to
£ 1 7.7 billion (2004: £ 1 6.2 billion). The bulk of this
increase has come from our eSavings offering
(£ 1.2 billion) with a strong performance from
our operation in the Isle of Man (£0.3 billion).
In our branch-based accounts we managed a
signiﬁcant volume of maturities during the year
and improved our customer retention rates.
I am particularly pleased with our Savings
performance because of the funding it provides
to the Lending business and the customers it
generates for the other Retail businesses.
Costs
The Group’s cost base was £264.8 million in
2005, £ 1 67.4 million down on the whole
business and £20.1 million down on the
continuing business in 2004. This is a material
improvement and brings our underlying
cost:income ratio down to 45.6% compared to
60.7% in 2004 for the Group and 49.8% for
the continuing business.
These improvements have come about as a
consequence of simplifying the organisation
around fewer lines of business, a smaller
central overhead and more efﬁcient front and
back ofﬁce processes. The number of
employees in the Group now stands at 3,043
compared to 3,1 52 for the core business at the
end of 2004, with a reduction of nearly 500 in
the average number of people employed to
3,062 (2004: 3,530) in the continuing business.
Our formal cost cutting programme has 
now concluded and we have exceeded the 
£50 million target that we set in May 2004.
We now have a stronger, more vigilant stance
toward costs in the operating businesses. It is
this dynamic that will drive our cost
performance in the future rather than another
structured programme.
Market outlook
The housing market is in good shape. After
the lull seen in the ﬁrst half of the year,
conﬁdence has returned to the market and
demand has been buoyant. House price
inﬂation has stabilised over the past eighteen
months, with the risk of a wholesale fall in
house prices now remote, which will boost
conﬁdence in the market for the year ahead.
The housing market will also continue to be
supported by the structural pressure arising
from the UK’s shortage of housing supply
relative to household creation, although it will
be limited on the upside by current
affordability constraints.
We expect the mortgage market to remain
robust. The favourable social, demographic
and economic factors that underpin our
specialist markets will continue to drive 
their outperformance.
Risks from prudent mortgage lending continue
to be low. We continue to believe that the
independent management of monetary policy by
the Bank of England will prevent any marked
swings in interest rates. Although the
employment level, a major driver of secured
lending arrears, appears to have passed its
cyclical peak, the UK economy remains relatively
healthy and signiﬁcant deterioration is unlikely.
GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
CORE COSTS REDUCED BY
7% Housing & rental market
Both the housing and mortgage markets showed a strong
recovery in the second half of 2005 following sluggish
demand in the ﬁrst half. Indeed, gross mortgage lending
reached new record levels by the end of the year.
House prices, which had shown little increase in the latter part of 2004, were ﬂat in
the ﬁrst half of 2005. However, there was a modest rise in prices towards the end of
the year, indicative of the increasing conﬁdence in the market. In 2006 we expect the
market environment to remain stable with the ‘soft landing’ achieved in 2005 being
sustained. The main drivers of the housing market, the mortgage market and 
mortgage arrears seem unlikely to show any material change in the near-term.
The UK economy, although currently growing slightly below trend, is in a relatively 
strong position and is expected to improve through 2006. Interest rates are low and 
stable with market consensus currently suggesting room for some small cuts in interest rates.
Employment levels seem to have peaked, but with growth only marginally below its
trend rate, we expect the rise in unemployment will have little material impact on levels
of demand in the market. Earnings are expected to show steady growth, potentially
helping to improve mortgage affordability, although the growth in disposable income will
be limited by price rises including larger council tax and utility bills.
The UK private rental sector is healthy with demand from tenants looking for rental
property remaining strong. As a consequence, interest from people wanting to
become landlords continues at high levels. Social changes toward renting, demographic
movements and some affordability issues in the housing market all remain positive for
the buy-to-let sector.
We conduct regular surveys of our customers to give us insight into the views and
intentions of borrowers who invest in the private rental sector. The most recent set of
results are extremely positive. Demand amongst landlords and tenants for property is
healthy moving into 2006.
9 BRADFORD & BINGLEY ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2005 WWW.BBG.CO.UK
We expect our arrears levels to continue to
remain low in a historical context but to show
a moderate upward trend. This partly reﬂects
the mild increases in credit stress from the
extremely benign conditions experienced in
the recent past, but is also due to the overall
growth in the Group’s assets and the
seasoning of our lending book.
Overall, we expect the environment to be
stable in 2006.
Business outlook
Our Lending business began the year in a very
good position. The momentum of record
lending volumes in the second half of 2005 has
continued with a strong pipeline in early 2006.
Margins are stable and we are competing
effectively in the market. This should translate
into good growth of lending income.
We are operating in a robust mortgage market
and see good prospects for our chosen
specialist segments, which positions us well for
future growth.
Retail is now better placed to deliver
proﬁtable growth and will support our Lending
business through continued improvement in
savings balances.
Costs remain under tight control and we have
a sound capital base for future expansion.
We have had a strong start to 2006. Our
business is stronger, leaner, and better able to
convert growth into proﬁt. 10 BRADFORD & BINGLEY ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2005 WWW.BBG.CO.UK
Underlying proﬁt improved 
to £31 0.1m, up 1 1% from
£280.4m in 2004. The Group’s
proﬁt before tax and loss on
sale of discontinued operations
improved by 1 4% to £263.5m
(2004: £231.9m). The increase
in proﬁts reﬂects the signiﬁcant
progress the Group has made
during the year.
The implementation of International Financial
Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’), and the
restructuring undertaken by the Group in
2004, complicate the comparison of
performance between 2004 and 2005. The
Board believes it is appropriate to assess
performance based on the underlying proﬁt of
the business which excludes the cost of
restructuring and compensation payments and
takes accounts of certain changes under IFRS.
Therefore, the discussion of results in this
statement uses underlying proﬁt and its
components as the measure of performance.
Analysis of the difference between the
accounting measures of proﬁt and the
underlying proﬁt of the Group is provided on
page 1 2. Full details of the accounting changes
under IFRS are set out in the Appendix.
The increase in underlying proﬁt in 2005 has
been delivered through the beneﬁts of the
restructuring in 2004 and the completion of a
rigorous programme of cost reduction in our
core business that achieved greater than the
planned level of savings. I am pleased to report
that whilst undertaking this programme our
Lending and Retail businesses were not diverted
and continued to make good progress.
The Group’s core net income increased to

GROUP FINANCE DIRECTOR GROUP FINANCE DIRECTOR’S REVIEW
During the year the Group incurred charges
associated with the cost reduction 
programme of £7.9m (2004: £ 1 4.6m) and 
in connection with compensation claims for
mis-sold investment products of £38.7m 
(2004: £37.1m).
The total tax charge for 2005 was £74.7m
(2004: £67.0m) resulting in Group proﬁt for
the ﬁnancial year of £ 1 88.8m.
On an underlying basis, this represents
earnings per share (‘EPS’) of 35.4 pence, an
increase of 9% (2004: 32.4 pence) and return
on equity of 1 7.2% (2004: 1 6.1%). The basic
earnings per share increased to 30.1 pence
from 5.2 pence in 2004.
On 9 December 2005, the Group issued a
trading statement saying “we expect underlying
proﬁt before tax to be at the top end of the
range of analysts’ forecasts, varying between
£280.5m and £306.0m”. The comparable
proﬁt ﬁgure is the Group’s underlying proﬁt of
£31 0.1m, a difference of 1.3%.
Net interest income
The Group’s net interest income increased by
5% to £469.3m (2004: £446.3m). This has
been driven by a £2.4bn growth in residential
lending assets, the Group’s average interest-
earning assets increasing by 8% to £38.7bn.
This growth in balances has been substantially
translated into net interest income growth as
the Group’s net interest margin has begun to
£580.6m (2004: £572.6m). Net interest income
increased by 5% to £469.3m (2004: £446.3m).
This was partially offset by lower non-interest
income of £ 1 1 1.3m (2004: £ 1 26.3m) in the core
business. Core underlying costs decreased by
£20.1m to £264.8m (2004: £284.9m).
Impairment losses in 2005 were £5.7m
compared to a small credit of £ 1.0m in 2004.

Accounting bases
These results are the ﬁrst full set of Financial
Statements reported by the Group under IFRS. This
has become the standard accounting convention for
the consolidated accounts of all listed companies
within the European Union. Transition to IFRS has
been undertaken in two stages; most of the
standards are implemented and reported in these
results on the basis that they had been in place since
1 January 2004, with 2004 information restated in
line with those standards. There are two further
standards, International Accounting Standard 32
‘Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation’
(‘IAS 32’) and International Accounting Standard 39
‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and
Measurement’ (‘IAS 39’) (‘the Financial Instruments
Standards’), that are implemented on the basis of
being in effect from 1 January 2005. The 2004
information need not be restated in line with those
two standards. The Board has therefore prepared
the 2004 Group results on three bases.
Statutory basis. The “Statutory” basis excludes the
Financial Instruments Standards – this exclusion is
permitted for 2004 only and was introduced
consideration of the performance of the Group
could be misleading. Information on the Proforma
basis is included in the Appendix on page 88.
Underlying basis. The “Underlying” basis applies
to certain measures of performance. References
to underlying performance measures exclude
restructuring costs, compensation for claims for
regulated investment business written in the past,
and losses on the sale of businesses in 2004.
Following the transition to IFRS, the net fair value
gains are included in the Group’s ﬁnancial
information for the ﬁrst time. While information
and awareness of the ﬁnal impacts of IFRS hedge
accounting convention were developing, these net
gains were also omitted from underlying proﬁt in
our results announced for the six months to
30 June 2005. However, further experience of these
impacts and of accounting under the new IFRS
regime has led us to conclude that they should
form part of the underlying proﬁts of the Group.
A reconciliation between the Statutory proﬁt, the
Proforma proﬁt and the underlying proﬁt is
provided above.
because IAS 39 was only issued in December 2004,
therefore it was not practical for companies to comply
with the IAS 39 hedge accounting rules for the start of
the 2004 year. Information on the Statutory basis
therefore forms the comparative information in the
audited ﬁnancial statements on pages 37 to 98.
Proforma basis. The “Proforma” basis applies, in
addition to the Statutory basis, all elements of IAS 32
and IAS 39 with the exception of those sections
relating to hedging, hedge effectiveness and fair value.
In the Proforma basis 2004 information, derivative
and available-for-sale instruments have been
accounted for under UK Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles (‘UK GAAP’). This restatement
is not required for 2004; however, the Board believes
this information is necessary for a comparable
assessment of performance between 2004 and 2005
accounting periods. This conclusion arises because
the Financial Instruments Standards include other
changes in addition to the hedge accounting changes,
relating to the accounting for interest receivable and
payable and for impairment which are, for the
Group, the most material differences between UK
GAAP and IFRS. T o omit these changes from a
In order to aid comparison of the 2005
results with those of 2004, comparatives 
on a statutory and proforma IFRS basis have
been provided. In addition, the results are
presented on an Underlying basis to exclude
restructuring and compensation costs. stabilise, and declined by only 4 basis points to
1.21% in 2005. This reduction in margin is
signiﬁcantly lower than in previous years
reﬂecting a stabilisation in the structure of the
balance sheet notwithstanding continued asset
growth. In particular, the lending interest margin
declined by only 2 basis points in 2005 to 1.03%.
T otal lending assets closed 7% higher at
£31.1bn (2004: £29.0bn). This growth was
funded principally by a £ 1.5bn increase in retail
deposits driven largely by the continued
success of eSavings. T otal retail deposits
increased by 9% to £ 1 7.7bn (2004: £ 1 6.2bn)
with Retail interest income growing by 5% to
£ 1 27.3m (2004: £ 1 21.7m).
Treasury operations maintained liquidity and
access to a diversiﬁed range of funding options
ensuring a stable platform for further balance
sheet growth. The £ 1 2.6m interest income
growth to £47.7m (2004: £35.1m) reﬂected a
combination of improved investment returns on
the Group’s reserves and lower borrowing costs.
The 31 basis points increase in the gross yield
on average interest earning assets in 2005 was
consistent with the 29 basis points growth in
the average bank base rate during the year.
The majority of the Group’s lending assets are
base rate linked. The cost of interest bearing
liabilities increased by a higher amount,
reﬂecting in part the change in mix to higher
cost eSavings balances. T ogether this resulted
in a 6 basis point narrowing of the Group’s
interest spread to 1.03% (2004: 1.09%).
Non-interest income
T otal core non-interest income fell in 2005 to
£ 1 1 1.3m (2004: £ 1 26.3m). Activity in our
markets, particularly the mortgage market, was
subdued in the ﬁrst half of 2005 but recovered
somewhat through the year. In addition, as a
result of a deliberate policy to refocus the Retail
business and improve its proﬁtability, non-
interest income fell to £66.1m (2004: £77.7m).
Mortgage broking income reduced to £ 1 2.5m
from £ 1 7.6m as the impact of slower conditions
and a reduced, but more proﬁtable, sales force
were felt. Mortgage broking is now operating at
a reduced level of complexity realising savings in
management and support costs.
Similarly, our investment related income fell to
£32.0m (2004: £35.0m) following the successful
outsourcing of new sales in an agreement with
L&G completed towards the end of 2004.
General insurance income reduced to £ 1 8.6m
(2004: £21.1m) owing to a reduction in renewal
income on policies linked to our legacy building
society mortgage business.
Lending related income improved during 2005
to £31.7m (2004: £27.0m). The increase was
due to higher fee income in the residential part
of the Lending business. In addition, fees earned
in our Commercial Lending business increased
as a result of charges made on redemption and
reﬁnancing of loans.
Income from the sale of properties increased
to £8.1m from £6.4m. In 2005, the Group has
continued a programme of selling freehold
assets and leasing back the required elements
of the property designed to improve efﬁciency
that has been underway for a number of years.
In 2005, income from the sale of debt securities
has been disclosed separately in the Income
Statement for the ﬁrst time under IFRS.
Previously this income has been within net
interest income. Gains or losses may be
incurred if debt securities are sold prior to their
contractual maturity. Our Treasury business may
sell such securities from time to time according
to the prevailing interest rate conditions and the
structure of the Group’s Balance Sheet. These
transactions are primarily driven by actions
taken to manage interest rate and credit risk
that occurs as a natural consequence of our
Lending and Retail businesses. In 2005, gains of
£ 1.8m were realised (2004: £ 1 0.0m).
Administrative expenses
Core underlying costs fell by 7% to £264.8m
(2004: £284.9m) reﬂecting the successful
completion of a programme of cost reduction,
net of increases arising as the Group invested
to provide improvements in its Lending and
Retail businesses. As a consequence of the
reduced cost base, the Group’s underlying
cost:income ratio in the continuing business
improved to 45.6% from 49.8% in 2004.

The main area of cost savings was staff related
expenditure which fell by 1 4% to £ 1 23.6m
(2004: £ 1 43.0m core). This is primarily a result
of reducing the number of people employed
by the Group to 3,043 (2004: 3,1 52) from
more than 3,700 in the core business over the
two-year period to the end of 2005.
Premises costs increased by £ 1.2m to £ 1 8.9m
(2004: £ 1 7.7m core). The increase reﬂects rises
in the number of properties we lease, as well
as utility costs. Marketing costs were £ 1.9m
lower at £ 1 5.2m (2004: £ 1 7.1m core).
Other administrative expenses and depreciation
were held ﬂat at £ 1 07.1m (2004: £ 1 07.1m core)
with cost savings offset by expenditure on a
new lending administration system installed
towards the end of 2004.
Restructuring charges of £7.9m were incurred
in 2005 (2004: £7.7m core) primarily due to
redundancy costs. The cost reduction
programme is now complete and has
contributed to the achievement of a material
reduction in absolute costs.
Although this cost reduction programme is
over, we remain vigilant on costs and will
continue to target a healthy gap between top
line growth and cost growth.
The level of complaints about mis-selling of
endowment and investment products increased
throughout the UK market in 2005, exceeding
our previous expectations. As a consequence,
a charge of £38.7m (2004: £37.1m) has been
incurred and is based on an estimate of the
total liability for future claims assessed using
current experience and analysis of the total
population of products sold. The independent
ﬁnancial advisory business which made these
sales was closed in 2004.
Arrears and loan impairment 
During 2005, arrears levels have increased as
predicted following increases in borrowing
costs driven by base rate rises in 2003 and
2004. The number of cases over 3 months in
arrears and in possession increased to 3,730
(2004: 2,388) representing 1.1 9% (2004:
0.77%) of the total cases.
It takes a period of around 1 8 months for
interest rate changes to translate into arrears
and a further period of time before arrears
result in realised losses. The amount of
impaired balances on the balance sheet has
increased correspondingly to £48.4m (2004:
£42.0m). This amount represents the balance
of mortgages we anticipate may not be repaid
resulting in a potential loss and has been
increased as a proportion of total lending
balances to 0.1 8% (2004: 0.1 6%).
The charge to the Income Statement is
derived from the amount of impaired balances
less any recovered amounts in excess of
balances previously written-off. As a result of
these movements, a net charge of £5.7m
(2004: credit £ 1.0m) was made in 2005.
Taxation
The tax charge for 2005 was below the
standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of
30% due to elements of earnings being derived
from overseas and taxed at a lower rate than in
the UK and ongoing temporary adjustments.
Based on the underlying proﬁt of £31 0.1m
(2004: £280.4m), the total tax charge is £74.7m
(2004: £67.0m). This equates to an underlying
effective tax rate of 28.5% (2004: 27.6%).
BUSINESS SEGMENT
PERFORMANCE
Lending
The Lending business developed well in 2005
generating £250.2m (2004: £249.8m) proﬁt
before tax. Our strategy of being a leading
provider of specialist lending products continues
to contribute signiﬁcant proﬁts to the Group.
Net interest income in the Lending business
improved by £4.8m to £294.3m (2004:
£289.5m). The rate of increase in interest
income is slower than that of the loan growth
as the majority of the increase in loans was in
the second half of the year. Gross residential
lending in the second half was £4.7bn
compared to £2.5bn in the ﬁrst half when the
market was less buoyant and our business was
rebuilding following measured reduction in new
lending as we implemented the new mortgage
administration system in 2004. This increase
positions the Lending business well as growth
in balances will translate to improved income
levels. The change in mix between mature

loans. In total, Lending net income increased
by 3% to £326.9m (2004: £31 6.5m).
Administrative expenses increased to £71.0m
(2004: £67.7m) as a consequence of higher
volumes of new applications and investment in
the new mortgage administration system.
Impairment charges increased to £5.7m (2004:
credit £ 1.0m) reﬂecting a larger number of
cases in arrears and increased loan balances.
Overall, arrears levels remain low and the
increases in 2005 reﬂect the higher cost of
borrowing and tighter ﬁscal conditions in the
UK generally. Arrears have moved in line with
our expectations and economic conditions.
Lending balances grew by 7% to £31.1bn
(2004: £29.0bn). Gross new lending, including
loan book acquisitions, was £8.8bn (2004:
£9.2bn). Residential advances were £7.2bn
(2004: £7.7bn) including acquisitions of £ 1.4bn
(2004: £ 1.3bn). Commercial lending originated
£ 1.7bn (2004: £ 1.5bn) of new loans.
The rate of redemptions on residential
mortgages improved to 1 9% (2004: 23%).
Commercial redemptions increased in 2005 to
£2.0bn (2004: £ 1.4bn) as competition in the
market for commercial property intensiﬁed
and a number of borrowers reﬁnanced
facilities at prices we chose not to match.
The structure of the lending balances analysed
by main product type reﬂects the Group’s
policy to specialise in segments of the mortgage
market where the returns are superior to the
majority of standard mortgages. The largest
segment is the buy-to-let market where
Bradford & Bingley is the market leader with
around a ﬁfth of the lending stock. The next
largest product group is self-cert mortgages,
designed to meet the needs of self-employed
workers or people whose income contains
signiﬁcant elements of bonus or commission.
Lifetime mortgages are a relatively new product
area for the Group where we have established
a strong position as one of the largest lenders in
this strategically important market.
Treasury & Reserves
Net income in Treasury & Reserves increased 
to £49.7m (2004: £45.1m). The growth in
income reﬂects improved returns on the
Group’s reserves and a reduction in the overall
cost of borrowing.
During 2005 the Treasury team has continued
to improve the strength and stability of the
balance sheet by attracting new investors in
both the secured and unsecured wholesale
markets. New funds have been raised in the
form of securitised bonds £2.0bn (2004:
£2.0bn) and using the reputation and strength
of Bradford & Bingley to issue a further £ 1.0bn
(2004: £2.6bn) to the wholesale money
markets. Administrative expenses increased to
£ 1 0.4m (2004: £8.2m) owing to investment in
the Treasury infrastructure and the wider
range of funding activities.

Retail
The Retail improvement programme
continued in 2005 leading to an increase in
proﬁts of 1 4% to £70.2m (2004: £61.6m).
The Retail business provides savings deposit,
mortgage broking, general insurance and other
ﬁnancial products through our branches and
online. In addition, investment services are
provided via L&G with advisers operating in
Bradford & Bingley branches.
Retail deposits form an important part of our
balance sheet funding. This business continued
to ﬂourish leading to an increase in deposit
balances of £ 1.5bn to £ 1 7.7bn (2004 £ 1 6.2bn)
and in net interest income of 5% to £ 1 27.3m
(2004: £ 1 21.7m). The development of our online
savings account has been particularly strong
adding £ 1.2bn in the year to reach a total
balance of £2.0bn (2004: £0.8bn).
Income in the remainder of the Retail business
fell to £66.1m from £77.7m in 2004 as the
Group sold fewer ﬁnancial services products
but at an improved level of proﬁtability. The
change of approach in Retail is most
signiﬁcantly demonstrated by a reduction of
1 1% in administrative expenses to £ 1 23.2m
(2004: £ 1 37.8m). Consequently the operating
margin improved to 36.3% from 30.9% in the
previous year.
Group Services
The net underlying cost of Group Services
improved by £ 1 0.0m to £49.6m (2004: £59.6m).
The improvement in the net cost has been the
result of the successful cost reduction programme
which contributed to 1 5% lower administrative
expenses of £60.2m (2004: £71.2m).
Balance Sheet
The Group’s total assets increased to £40.8bn
(2004: £38.2bn) in 2005 due mainly to the
success of our Lending business increasing
total loans to £31.1bn (2004: £29.0bn).
Treasury wholesale assets were £9.0bn,
compared to the £8.9bn balances at the end of
2004. Fixed and other assets remained at £0.3bn
(2004: £0.3bn). Of the increase in balances in
2005, £0.4bn is as a consequence of changes
under IFRS requiring the fair value of derivatives
to be included among total assets. Similarly,
£0.3bn has been added to liabilities.
Retail deposits increased by 9% to £ 1 7.7bn
(2004: £ 1 6.2bn) reﬂecting strong growth in our
eSavings product. A net £0.7bn was also
added to non-retail deposits mainly through
increased access to securitisation markets.
Capital
The Group’s capital for regulatory purposes has
increased to £2.6bn (2004: £2.5bn). The increase
is in tier 1 capital up to £ 1.5bn (2004: £ 1.4bn).
Tier 2 capital remained £ 1.1bn (2004: £ 1.1bn).
The Group’s solvency position has improved
with a total capital ratio of 1 3.5% (2004:1 3.2%)
and a tier 1 ratio of 7.9% (2004: 7.5%). This
improvement has arisen in part due to
increased use of securitisation as a source of
funds, now £4.4bn (2004: £2.7bn). These
amounts are excluded from the Group’s risk
weighted assets of £ 1 9.1bn (2004: £ 1 8.8bn).
RISK MANAGEMENT 
AND CONTROL
In the ordinary course of business, the Group
is exposed to, and manages, a variety of risks,
with operational, credit, market and liquidity
risk being of particular signiﬁcance. The
management of risk is fundamental to the
Group, with the Board having responsibility for
the overall system of internal control and for
reviewing its effectiveness.

* Minority interest in 2004 The Board has delegated speciﬁc risk
monitoring and control responsibilities to the
Audit Committee, the Group Risk Committee
and the Asset & Liability Management
Committee (‘ALCO’).
Each business area within the Group is
responsible for the identiﬁcation and
assessment of their particular risk exposures,
and implementing risk management policies,
limits and procedures as approved by the
Board. The key areas of risk the Group faces
are discussed below.
Operational risk
Operational risk is deﬁned as the potential risk
of ﬁnancial loss or impairment to reputation
resulting from inadequate or failed internal
processes and systems, from the actions of
people or from external events. The Group’s
business units manage this risk through
appropriate controls and loss mitigation
actions, including insurance. These actions
include a balance of policies, appropriate
procedures and internal controls to ensure
compliance with laws and regulations. In
addition, specialist support functions provide
expertise in operational risk areas such as
information security, ﬁnancial services
compliance, fraud management, security and
business continuity management.
Credit risk
Credit risk is deﬁned as the potential of
ﬁnancial loss if counterparties (borrowers) are
not able to meet their obligations as they fall
due. The Group is ﬁrmly committed to the
management of this risk in both its lending and
wholesale money market activities. In its core
lending activities, the Group employs
sophisticated credit scoring, underwriting and
fraud detection techniques that support sound
credit decision making and work to minimise
losses. A proactive approach to the
identiﬁcation and control of loan impairment is
maintained in the Credit Risk Management and
Credit Control areas.
Lending policies and limits are reviewed and
approved annually by the Board, with the
associated credit risk processes deﬁned and
managed centrally. The Group Risk Committee
ensures that any exposure to credit risk,
signiﬁcant changes in policy, or expansion into
new areas of business remain within overall
risk exposure levels as agreed by the Board.
Authorised credit risk limits for wholesale
money market counterparties reﬂect the size,
depth and quality of a counterparty’s capital
base and, where published, credit ratings
assigned by the major credit rating agencies.
The policies and limits covering Treasury
counterparty credit risk exposure are
reviewed and approved annually by the Board.
Social, environmental and ethical (‘SEE’) risks
Having identiﬁed the need to consider SEE
risks within our risk management and control
policies, our Group Strategy function now
includes SEE risks on their monthly risk analysis.
Market risk
Market risk is deﬁned as the potential adverse
change in Group income or Group net worth
arising from movements in interest rates,
exchange rates or other market prices. Market
risk exists to some extent in all of the Group’s
businesses. Effective identiﬁcation and
management of market risk is essential for
maintaining stable net interest income.
Interest rate risk is the most signiﬁcant form of
market risk to which the Group is exposed. It
arises from mismatches between the repricing
dates of the interest-bearing assets and
liabilities on the Group’s balance sheet, and
from the investment proﬁle of the Group’s
free reserves. Treasury is responsible for
managing this exposure within the market risk
exposure limits set out in the Group’s policies.
The Group’s exposure to market risk is
governed by the Balance Sheet Management
policy as approved by the Board. This policy
sets out the nature of the market risks that
may be taken along with aggregate risk limits,
and stipulates the procedures, instruments and
controls to be used in managing market risk.
The Board has delegated responsibility for
managing the Group’s exposure to market risk
to the ALCO. It is the ALCO’s responsibility to
approve strategies for managing market risk
exposures and ensuring that Treasury
implements the strategies so that the exposures
are managed within the Group’s approved
policy limits. The ALCO meets regularly and
reviews reports and other analyses showing the
Group’s exposure to market risk.
Foreign exchange risk
The Group raises and invests funds in
currencies other than sterling. Accordingly,
foreign exchange risk arises from activities
related to the Group managing borrowing
costs and investment returns. As with interest
rate risk, Treasury is responsible for managing
this exposure within the limits as set out in the
Group’s policies.
Foreign exchange risk is managed primarily
through the use of currency swaps and
forward foreign exchange contracts. It can
also be managed, when appropriate, by
foreign currency denominated liabilities being
matched with assets denominated in the same
foreign currency.
Liquidity risk
It is Group policy to ensure that funds are
available at all times to meet the Group’s
obligations, including the withdrawal of
customer deposits, the draw-down of customer
facilities and growth in the balance sheet. The
development and implementation of liquidity
policy is the responsibility of the ALCO.
The day-to-day management of liquidity is the
responsibility of Treasury, which provides
funding to, and takes surplus funds from, each
of the Group’s businesses as required. Liquidity
policy is approved by the Board and agreed
within a framework established by the Financial
Services Authority (‘FSA’). Regulatory guidelines
and potential outﬂows of funds drive the scope
and nature of the Group’s holdings of readily
realisable liquid assets.
Derivatives
The Board, through the Balance Sheet
Management policy, has authorised the use of
certain derivative instruments for the
purposes of supporting the strategies and
operational business activities of the Group.
These instruments are also used to manage
the risk arising due to changes in interest rates
and foreign exchange rates.
Detailed disclosures on interest rate risk,
foreign exchange risk, and the use of derivatives
are set out in Note 40 to the Financial
Statements in accordance with IAS 32, ‘Financial
Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation’.

Bradford & Bingley believes in placing
Corporate Social Responsibility (‘CSR’) at the
heart of our business activities. We aim to
conduct our business in a socially responsible
manner in respect of the environment, staff,
customers, shareholders and local communities.
We continue to structure our CSR reporting
along the FORGE framework for CSR
Management and Reporting for the Financial
Services Sector. We report against the four
major themes identiﬁed by FORGE as being
those most relevant to ﬁnancial services
organisations – Marketplace, Workplace,
Community and Environment. The FORGE
Group is a consortium of ﬁnancial institutions
and involves the British Bankers’ Association
and the Association of British Insurers.
Bradford & Bingley is a national member of
Business in the Community and the London
Benchmarking Group.
Bradford & Bingley continues to be a member
of the FTSE4Good Index of socially
responsible companies and in 2005 we were
pleased to be recognised as one of the top
1 00 Companies That Count by the Sunday
Times where we were ranked 57th in the UK
in the Business in the Community Corporate
Responsibility Index.
Bradford & Bingley was awarded two ‘Big
Ticks’ in Business in the Community’s Awards
for Excellence; one for our work with 
Shelter, and a collaborative action award for
our support of West Midlands Business Action
on Homelessness.
Our CSR report has for the ﬁrst time been
independently veriﬁed this year by Bureau
Veritas, who carried out our environmental
audit in 2004.
Mark Stevens, Managing Director Group
Strategy, continues as the executive responsible
for the Group’s CSR programme.
Doing the right thing in the marketplace
Following our strategic refocus in 2004 we now
have two well established arms to our business:
• Lending: providing a range of residential
mortgages, secured commercial property
loans and loans to housing associations
• Retail: selling Bradford & Bingley’s own
savings products and a choice of other
ﬁnancial products through our branches and
direct channels.
Both of these arms have their own approach
to CSR but signiﬁcantly, both have been able
to demonstrate their CSR credentials through
their product and services range this year.

Bradford & Bingley’s lending business develops
and manufactures a range of lending products
primarily secured on residential property. As a
company, we have made a policy decision not
to participate in the unsecured consumer
lending markets as we believe our underwriting
expertise is in secured lending.
Bradford & Bingley’s residential lending activity
focuses on a range of niche areas providing
mortgages for individuals who need a more
specialist product than those available in the
mainstream market. These products are sold
under the Mortgage Express brand.
Bradford & Bingley has the largest buy-to-let
customer base in the UK, and in November
completed its 6,000th lifetime mortgage.
Over 30% of lifetime mortgages sold 
through mortgage intermediaries such as
Independent Financial Advisers are Mortgage
Express products.
These products are ones that address some of
the growing concerns within the housing
market in the UK. The growth of buy-to-let
has increased the availability of rental housing
stock in the UK, making it easier for people to
ﬁnd affordable housing. Lifetime mortgages
enable homeowners over the age of 60 to
release some of the equity they have built up
in their properties to enhance their lifestyle 
in retirement.
Bradford & Bingley continues to be a member
of Safe Home Income Plans (‘SHIP’). SHIP is
the UK’s leading professional body for equity
release providers, launched in 1 991 and
dedicated entirely to the protection of
borrowers and promotion of safe home
income and equity release plans. We observe
the SHIP Code of Practice which has been
welcomed by Age Concern. As a member of
SHIP , Bradford & Bingley guarantees that
borrowers cannot lose their home – whatever
happens to the stock market or interest rates.
More details about SHIP are available on its
website, www.ship-ltd.org
Bradford & Bingley also continues to be active
in lending to Housing Associations throughout
the UK. Housing Associations are non-proﬁt
organisations that provide affordable rented
homes for people unable to satisfy their
housing needs in the open market.
We have provided loans to over 1 20 housing
associations and now ﬁnance over 1 00,000
social rented homes throughout the UK.
Bradford & Bingley’s commitment to the
housing association sector at £2.3 billion,
equates to over 7% of the Group’s total
mortgage commitments.
The Savings business develops and sells
Bradford & Bingley’s competitive range of
deposit based investment products through our
branch network, online and via post/telephone.
In August, we launched two new savings
accounts for children, FirstSave and SmartSave.
FirstSave, an instant access account for
children up to the age of 1 2, is an ideal
account to begin building up savings for the
future. SmartSave is also an instant access
account and is available for young adults up to
the age of 25.
FirstSave and SmartSave were launched in
association with Aardman Animations and
Wallace & Gromit’s Children’s Foundation. For
every new account opened, Bradford &
Bingley made a £ 1 donation to the Foundation
and in 2005 over £ 1 1,000 was donated. In
addition, the branch network sold a range of
pin badges provided by Wallace & Gromit’s
Children’s Foundation which raised a further
£27,700 – the highest amount ever raised by a
pin badge campaign at Bradford & Bingley.
The Foundation is a national charity raising funds
to improve the quality of life for children in
hospitals and hospices throughout the UK. The
Foundation funds an innovative range of projects
to ensure children in hospitals and hospices have
a better, brighter future. Created in 2003, the
Foundation has funded projects in 23 hospitals
and hospices.
Doing the right thing in the workplace
Our employment practices continue to reﬂect
the human rights standards enshrined in the
United Nations Universal Declaration of
Human Rights and the International Labour
Organisation Conventions, and cover such
items as minimum working age, working
hours, health and safety and discrimination.
Our workforce should reﬂect the communities
in which we live and work, and our
employment practices help us to deliver on
this goal. Bradford & Bingley is a member of
Employers’ Forum on Disability, Employers
Forum on Age, Race for Opportunity and
Opportunity Now. These organisations look at
ways to promote awareness of disability, age,
race and gender within the workplace.
Women now occupy 45% of management roles
(2004: 44%) and 24% of senior management
roles (2004: 23%) within the Group. Women
represent 1 0% of the Board (2004: 22%).
Ethnic minorities occupy 5% of management
roles (2004: 7%) and 6% of senior management
roles. We have seen a slight drop in the number
of ethnic minorities employed in the workforce
(2005: 1 0%, 2004: 1 1%) but Bradford & Bingley
continues to support and work with Quest for
Economic Development, an organisation
supporting the South Asian community within
the UK, to ensure we have robust and fair
employment policies for all staff.
POSITION IN THE BUSINESS IN THE COMMUNITY
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY INDEX
57th 22 BRADFORD & BINGLEY ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2005 WWW.BBG.CO.UK
We recognise that the well being of our
employees is vital to our business. We have
comprehensive policies agreed with the
recognised staff union (‘UBAC’) on Flexible
Working and Fair Treatment at Work. We
continue to offer a conﬁdential counselling
service, provided free of charge to employees
and their families, to enable discussion of any
issue affecting their lives at work or at home.
Bradford & Bingley was awarded the ‘two ticks’
symbol by the Employment Service in June 1 995.
This publicises our commitment to people with
disabilities. Using the ‘two ticks’ symbol means
we are working towards the guidelines in the
Employment Service Code of Good Practice on
the Employment of Disabled People. We have
induction loops in all branches, and have
wheelchair access and power assisted doors
across the branch network. Bradford & Bingley
also provides sign language and manual
interpreting services in conjunction with the
Royal National Institute for the Deaf (‘RNID’)
and offer RNID’s Typetalk service. We have
undertaken further Typetalk training and will
continue to do so throughout 2006.
Bradford & Bingley is also committed to ensuring
accessibility across our product range and we
continue to provide customers with literature in
different formats, such as Braille, audio and large
print. Our corporate and customer facing
websites were also relaunched in 2005, having
undergone accessibility audits by the Royal
National Institute for the Blind to ensure the
websites are as user friendly as possible.
Bradford & Bingley has carried out a thorough
review of all Health & Safety, Business
Continuity and Security policies in 2005.
The Group’s Health & Safety Policy Statement
was updated and a full copy was issued to
every branch and department. This Policy
Statement is reviewed by the Board of
Directors every twelve months.
T o help meet the objectives set out in the policy
statement, Bradford & Bingley has established a
clear and simple structure for managing health
and safety which identiﬁes the roles and
responsibilities everyone has in ensuring a safe
place of work. This was communicated to all
staff through an online training session.
Robert Dickie, Group Operations Director,
is the nominated member of the Board of
Directors responsible for Health & Safety and
chairs the Group Health & Safety Committee.
Bradford & Bingley consults with its staff,
management and UBAC on health and 
safety matters through the Group Health & Safety
Committee. As part of our ongoing development
in this area, all line managers undertook a half day
training course on Health & Safety in 2005.
We continue to encourage employees to
beneﬁt from the Group’s success through
share schemes. Currently, 39% of employees
hold at least one Sharesave account (2004:
52%), enabling them to save to buy 
Bradford & Bingley shares.
We carried out our staff opinion survey in
September, giving all staff an opportunity to
feed back in conﬁdence their views and
opinions of Bradford & Bingley. A series of
roadshows were then carried out where the
senior executive team fed back the results and
invited further discussion.
Doing the right thing in the community
In 2005, there was an increase in Bradford &
Bingley’s community programme (2005:
£ 1,320,61 2; 2004: £ 1,295,639), continuing for a
sixth consecutive year the investment of over
£ 1 million in the communities in which we live
and work. Preventing and alleviating the causes
of homelessness continues to be our main
corporate area of support. However, in 2005,
we gave a larger focus to our support of
charities and organisations throughout West
Y orkshire, speciﬁcally in Bradford and the Aire
Valley where our Head Ofﬁce is based.
Preventing and alleviating the causes 
of homelessness
Bradford & Bingley continues to support Shelter,
the UK campaigning charity for homeless and
badly housed people. Our support helps
Shelter’s freephone housing advice line, the
gateway to the majority of Shelter’s services.
Bradford & Bingley is a national member of
Business Action on Homelessness (‘BAOH’).
BAOH is a unique partnership between
leading businesses, homelessness agencies and
the Government which aims to break the
vicious cycle of no job, no home, through
helping homeless people to ﬁnd employment
and achieve independent living. Steven
Crawshaw, Bradford & Bingley’s Group Chief
Executive sits on the BAOH executive forum.
During 2005, we continued to strengthen our
links with many community groups across
West Y orkshire. Our Community Action Team
CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 23 BRADFORD & BINGLEY ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2005 WWW.BBG.CO.UK
has continued to encourage and co-ordinate
employee involvement across West Y orkshire.
The Community Action team has used central
budgets to speciﬁcally support local communities
and consists of staff from across all functions of
the business and a representative from the
Community Affairs team. They meet on a
monthly basis to consider requests from local
charities and community groups and make small
grants of about £300 on average. During 2005,
39 charities received funding in the Bingley area.
Bradford & Bingley continues to support
employee involvement, in particular through
supporting their fundraising activities. All
employees are able to apply for funds to
match their own fundraising efforts for charity
in a scheme which matches the ﬁrst £250 of
funds raised per employee. During the year,
85 employees received matching (2004: 1 47)
totalling £ 1 9,1 51 (2004: £26,908). Although this
is a decrease from 2004, it should be
remembered that staff numbers were lower in
2005 compared to most of 2004.
Bradford & Bingley also matches employee
donations through the payroll-giving
programme, Give As Y ou Earn. We continued
to promote the scheme to new and existing
employees via online and internal promotions
and have seen an increase both in take up and
amount donated and we now have 7.6%
(2004: 8.8%) of our workforce donating via
Give As Y ou Earn. We have set ourselves a
target to increase this to 1 0% in 2006.
Bradford & Bingley matched £74,628 of
employee donations (2004: £65,900).
Doing the right thing in the environment
In 2005, Bradford & Bingley has built on the
work carried out in our environmental audit of
2004 to deliver increased environmental
performance and disclosure.
In preparation for the EU Accounts
Modernisation Directive, we have worked with
Trucost, an independent environmental research
organisation to identify the Environmental Key
Performance Indicators relevant to Bradford &
Bingley. T o do this, we have worked from the
consultation document Environmental Key
Performance Indicators – Reporting Guidelines
for UK Business published by the Department of
Environment, Food & Rural Affairs in 2005.
The main waste streams produced by Bradford
& Bingley consist of general ofﬁce waste,
conﬁdential paper waste and IT equipment.
In 2005, we have reported on a weekly basis
the amount of waste generated and the
percentage recycled. In 2006, we have set a
target for 65% of our waste to be recycled.
There are procedures in place to recycle
paper, plastic cups, toners, metals, IT
components and mobile telephones at central
locations, whilst our branches recycle toners,
IT components and mobile telephones.
Mowlem Technical Services are in the second
year of a three year facilities management
contract for Bradford & Bingley. Energy
management forms part of the service, which
is being delivered nationally via a team of
mobile engineers checking on site controls and
a central management provision monitoring
consumption. Water conservation measures
are being put in place in central facilities to
help reduce water consumption.
Printing managers Williams Lea purchase print
services on behalf of Bradford & Bingley. All
products purchased are derived from
sustainable managed forestry (plantation crop).
Bradford & Bingley continues to use the Financial
Services Purchasing Forum collaborative
environmental best practice principles. This
document, developed by the ﬁnancial industry,
outlines six principles and Bradford & Bingley’s
progress against these principles is explored in
detail in our CSR Report.
T o demonstrate our commitment to disclosure
of our CSR programme, we have also
published our conﬁdential feedback from the
Corporate Responsibility Index on our
www.bbg.co.uk website.
Bradford & Bingley produces a separate CSR
Report which is available on our website,
www.bbg.co.uk or on request to csr@bbg.co.uk.

Bradford & Bingley, 1 34b New Street,
Birmingham B2 4NP to request a printed copy.
This is a summary of the full CSR Report. For
more details, please refer to the full report
which includes a much larger range of key
performance indicators than is possible to
include in this summary.
Bradford & Bingley continues to see
Carbon Neutral
®
as a positive way to
offset the Carbon emissions from
our business. Both the CSR Report
and the Annual Report & Accounts
are Carbon Neutral
®
to minimise
their environmental impacts. In 2005,
we made the Insurance Marketing,
Internal Communications and Group
Strategy departments Carbon
Neutral
®
. In a sign of his
commitment to leadership in this
area, Steven Crawshaw, Group
Chief Executive also made his ofﬁce
Carbon Neutral

.
We continue to use the Carbon
Neutral Company (formerly known
as Future Forests) as our partner
for the programme of tree planting
to offset the carbon emissions.

By order of the Board
Alan Shankley
COMPANY SECRETARY
1 5 February 2006
Bradford & Bingley is committed to high
standards of corporate governance in its business.
The Directors are pleased to report that
throughout the year ended 31 December 2005
the Company complied with the provisions of
the Combined Code (‘the Code’). This
Corporate Governance Report, coupled with
the Directors’ Remuneration Report, explains
how the Company has applied the governance
principles set out in the Code.
The Board
During the year, the Directors satisﬁed the
main and supporting principles and provisions
of the Code by the following actions,
procedures and policies:
• The Board met nine times during the year.
This included one meeting devoted to
strategic matters. In addition, the Chairman
held two meetings with the Non-executive
Directors without the Executive Directors
being present. One meeting of the 
Non-executive Directors chaired by the
Senior Independent Director was also held
without the Chairman present.
• As a matter of policy the roles of Chairman
and Group Chief Executive are distinct and
the ofﬁces are held by different people -
Rod Kent and Steven Crawshaw
respectively. The role of each is recorded in
writing and has been agreed by the Board.
• During the year the constitution of the
Board satisﬁed the Code at all times. At the
end of the year the Board consisted of a
Non-executive Chairman, ﬁve independent
Non-executive Directors and four 
Executive Directors. The ﬁve independent
Non-executive Directors bring wide
experience from varied backgrounds to the
workings of the Board and the Board
considers that all independent directors
meet the independence criteria set out in
the Code.
• The recognised Senior Independent Director
throughout the year was George Cox.
• The purpose of the Board is to govern the
Group’s strategic direction, supervise its
operational management and deﬁne and
monitor acceptable risk parameters for the
Group. The Board has adopted a structure of
mandates, granted to individuals and
committees throughout the Group, whilst
retaining speciﬁed matters for its exclusive
decision. The speciﬁed matters include the
approval of interim and ﬁnal ﬁnancial
statements, the approval of recommendations
in connection with the payment of dividends,
approval of corporate governance
arrangements, the approval of the Group’s
strategic direction and the approval of various
policies to be adopted by the Group. The
mandate structure enables authorised
individuals to approve levels of expenditure
and commit to contracts or other agreements
in the normal course of business.
• The Board reviews its constitution every year
and during 2005, for the second year running,
the Chairman took the lead role in the
evaluation of the performance of the Board,
the principal committees and the performance
and commitment of each Director. The
process included detailed questionnaires, one-
to-one interviews with the Chairman and a full
discussion at a Board Meeting. George Cox,
the Senior Independent Director, led the
Non-executive Directors in the evaluation of
the Chairman and a separate meeting, at
which the Chairman was not present, was
held for the purpose.
All Directors are subject to election by
shareholders at the ﬁrst AGM after their
appointment by the Board and each Director is
subject to re-appointment every three years in
accordance with the Articles of Association.
The Board has decided that Stephen Webster
and Robert Dickie will retire by rotation at 
the AGM in 2006 and offer themselves for 
re-appointment by shareholders under the
terms of the Articles of Association. Chris
Gillespie and Chris Willford, who were
appointed since the last AGM, are required to
retire at the AGM and seek re-appointment in
accordance with the Articles of Association.
Following the evaluation process, these 
re-appointments were considered by the
Nominations Committee which recommended
to the Board that the performance of the
individuals concerned was effective and their
commitment exemplary. Further information
about the recommended re-appointments is
included in the Notice of the AGM.
• An appropriate training programme is
established for new Directors to ensure that
they are fully conversant with their
responsibilities as a Director, with the
business of the Group and with major
DIRECTORS’ REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 27 BRADFORD & BINGLEY ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2005 WWW.BBG.CO.UK
shareholders’ views about the Company.
During 2005, Chris Gillespie and Chris
Willford followed an appropriate
familiarisation programme in respect of their
new Executive Director roles. A number of
Non-executive Directors undertook visits to
operational locations and branches, to
enhance their understanding of the Group.
Throughout their period in ofﬁce all Directors
are updated on Group business, the
competitive and regulatory environment in
which it operates and other changes as they
occur, via presentations at Board or
committee meetings, as appropriate.
• All Directors have access to the advice and
services of the Company Secretary, who is
responsible for ensuring that Board
procedures and applicable rules and
regulations are observed. The Company
Secretary also assists the Chairman in
facilitating the Directors’ training. The Directors
are able to take independent professional
advice at the Company’s expense.
Principal Board committees
The Board has established a number of
committees, each of which has detailed terms 
of reference. The three principal committees 
are the Audit, Remuneration and Nominations
Committees. The Audit and the Remuneration
Committees comprise only independent 
Non-executive Directors. The terms of reference
of all these committees are available on request
to the Registered Ofﬁce and by visiting the
‘Corporate Governance’ section within the ‘Our
Business’ part of the www.bbg.co.uk website.
During the year, the Audit Committee
monitored the effectiveness of the Group’s risk
management process and its ﬁnancial and other
internal control systems, including effective
internal audit, risk management and compliance
functions. The Committee also reviewed the
Group’s accounting policies, ﬁnancial statements
and external reporting responsibilities with
particular regard to International Financial
Reporting Standards. It met with the external
auditors and received all reports by them
addressed to the Group. The Committee
reviewed the arrangements for staff to raise
concerns about possible improprieties in the
area of ﬁnancial reporting or other issues. The
Committee also undertook corporate
governance and other duties as required under
the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000
and applicable regulations made under it. As a
result of the 2004 evaluation of the operation
of the Audit Committee, administrative
improvements were made during 2005 in terms
of the presentation of papers and the
attendance at the Committee. Following the
evaluation in 2005, the Committee established
that they needed to develop a better
understanding of the Group’s risks and that the
interaction between the Group’s Risk and
Compliance functions should be reviewed to
ensure an appropriate division of duties. The
Committee has agreed that there will be a
review of the provision of external audit
services with a tender process to take place
during 2006.
The Audit Committee also considered the
position of the auditors including any risk of
conﬂict of interest. The Group recognises the
importance of internal and external auditor
independence and has adopted principles to
safeguard this, as follows:
• the Group will continue to use the 
external auditors for non-audit work,
where appropriate;
• the Group recognises the need for
transparency around the services being
provided and for a central independent
overview. This is provided by the Audit
Committee which monitors audit and 
non-audit fees paid; and
• there is an appropriate approval process for
non-audit work to ensure the auditors’
independence is not compromised.
The members of the Committee are Stephen
Webster (Chairman), Ian Cheshire and
Nicholas Cosh. The Board is satisﬁed that 
Mr Webster fulﬁls the Code requirement that
at least one member of the Committee has
recent and relevant ﬁnancial experience.
The Remuneration Committee, during the year,
reviewed the remuneration policy for the Group
overall, and the salary, bonus and beneﬁts
arrangements for the Executive Directors and
other members of the senior management team.
The Committee also reviewed the grants and
awards of schemes established by the Company
and addressed the implications of the tax
simpliﬁcation changes that come into effect in
April 2006 on the Company’s pension
arrangements. Further detail is provided in the
Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 29 to
34. The members of the Committee are George
Cox (Chairman), Ian Cheshire and Louise Patten.
The Nominations Committee reviewed the
composition of the Board. Chris Gillespie and
Chris Willford were recommended for
appointment to the Board. In making the
recommendation, the Committee made
reference to the succession plans and sought the
advice of external recruitment consultants. The
Board unanimously agreed to appoint Chris
Gillespie and Chris Willford. In addition, the
Committee recommended Directors for 
re-appointment at the AGM based on the
performance evaluation results. The members of
the Committee are Rod Kent (Chairman),
Nicholas Cosh, George Cox, Louise Patten and
Steven Crawshaw together with Ian Cheshire and
Stephen Webster who joined the Committee
with effect from 29 November 2005 following
the 2005 committee evaluation process.
Shareholder relations
The Company is committed to ongoing,
transparent communication across the
shareholder base, whether to institutional
investors, private or employee shareholders. The
Summary Financial Statement, which details key
facts about the Group’s performance, is
distributed to those private shareholders who
have requested it. All Annual Report & Accounts
and AGM documents, announcements,
presentations and press releases are available on
our www.bbg.co.uk website. The Company
engages in two-way communication with
institutional shareholders, fund managers and
analysts to discuss publicly available information
on its strategy, performance and policies. The
Board receives feedback on these
communications from the Directors attending
the meeting, and is also regularly apprised of
comments from institutional shareholders and
analysts so that all Directors can develop a
balanced understanding of the issues and
concerns of shareholders. The Chairman and
Senior Independent Director are available to
meet shareholders on request and will ensure
that the Board is aware of any shareholder
concerns not resolved through the usual investor
communications routes. At each AGM there is a
review of the Group’s performance and the
Board welcomes the opportunity to gather views
and take questions from shareholders. 28 BRADFORD & BINGLEY ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2005 WWW.BBG.CO.UK
In connection with the AGM, the Company
discloses the level of proxy voting (including
for, against and votes withheld), proposes
separate resolutions and has a policy that the
committee chairmen should attend the
Meeting. In addition, the Notice of the AGM
and any related papers are sent out to arrive
at least 20 business days before the Meeting to
ensure that shareholders have sufﬁcient time in
which to consider the items of business.
Internal control
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system
of internal control. It seeks regular assurance to
satisfy itself that the system is functioning
effectively in managing risks in the manner
which it has approved. Such a system can only
provide reasonable and not absolute assurance
against material misstatement or loss, as it is
designed to manage rather than eliminate the
risk of failure to achieve business objectives.
Throughout the year ended 31 December 2005,
the Group has operated a system of internal
control, which includes an ongoing risk
management process for identifying, evaluating
and managing the signiﬁcant risks faced by the
Group. During the year, the Board has continued
to review the effectiveness of the Group’s system
of ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial controls, including
operational and compliance controls, risk
management and the Group’s highest level
internal control arrangements. In addition, as part
of the process of preparing this statement, the
Board has also performed its annual assessment
of the effectiveness of internal controls.
Changes in ﬁnancial regulation continue within
the industry, and the Group’s risk management
processes are kept under regular review to
ensure that the Group responds appropriately
both to actual and proposed regulatory changes.
The Group’s management operate a risk
management process, producing a Group-
wide risk proﬁle that identiﬁes the Group’s
signiﬁcant risks, the probability of those risks
occurring and their impact should they occur,
and has the prime responsibility for the design
and operation of suitable controls and
mitigating actions. The risk management
process is complemented by a formalised
reporting and escalation process for control
issues. Internal audit has a key role in
maintaining the control environment by
providing independent assurance on the
effectiveness of the Group’s internal control
systems. The Group Risk Committee oversees
the risk management process, considers the
Group-wide risk proﬁle regularly and receives
monitoring reports to update it on progress.
Further information on risk management and
control is set out on pages 1 6 to 1 7.
The Group is committed to developing and
maintaining an appropriate risk management
framework and culture with the aim of
continuing to ensure that the management
understand the key risks that the businesses face.
This is achieved through an organisational
structure with clear reporting lines and governed
by appropriate business monitoring mechanisms,
codes of conduct and policy statements.
The system of internal control has been in place
throughout 2005 and up to the date of approval
of the Annual Report & Accounts. It accords
with the guidance from the T urnbull Committee.
In reviewing the effectiveness of this system,
the Board takes into account the work of the
Audit Committee, which receives reports from
the Group Risk Committee on the Group’s
signiﬁcant risks and how these are being
managed. The Board also considers reports
from internal audit, external audit, compliance
and management on the system of internal
control, adherence to regulatory requirements
and material control weaknesses, together with
actions taken to address them. The Chairman
of the Audit Committee reports on the
outcome of each meeting to the Board, where
appropriate, and the Board also receives
minutes of these committee meetings.
Going concern
The Directors conﬁrm that they are satisﬁed
that the Company has sufﬁcient resources
to continue in operation for the foreseeable
future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt 
the going concern basis in preparing the
Financial Statements.

Board Meeting and committee attendance 2005
The table below shows the attendance by Directors at the Board Meetings and at the principal
committees of which they were members during the year. Director absences were the result of
unavoidable diary clashes and, in all cases, were agreed with the Chairman in advance. 29 BRADFORD & BINGLEY ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2005 WWW.BBG.CO.UK
The following report has been prepared in
accordance with the Directors’ Remuneration
Report Regulations 2002 (the ‘Regulations’,
now contained in Schedule 7A to the
Companies Act 1 985) and approved by the
Board for agreement with the shareholders.
The Remuneration Committee
The role of the Remuneration Committee
(the ‘Committee’) is to assist the Board in the
development and application of remuneration
policy for the Chairman, the Group Chief
Executive, Executive Directors and certain
senior executives. The Committee also
reviews and approves overall remuneration
policy for all staff. The belief is that neither
Directors’ remuneration nor staff pay can be
considered in isolation from one another.
The overall aim of the Committee is to ensure
that the Group has remuneration policies
which attract and retain the right executives
and staff, and which incentivise them to deliver
strong performance in pursuit of the Group’s
plans and objectives. The Committee regularly
reviews arrangements and incentives to ensure
that they remain effective and appropriate to
the Group’s circumstances and prospects and
to monitor the level of potential awards.
The terms of reference of the Committee 
are available on the www.bbg.co.uk website
and from the Registered Ofﬁce on request.
Committee membership
The Committee is composed entirely of
independent Non-executive Directors, as
detailed in the table below:
George Cox (Chairman) All year
Ian Cheshire All year 
Louise Patten All year
George Cox was appointed chairman of the
Committee in November 2003. The Chairman,
Rod Kent, and the Group Chief Executive,
Steven Crawshaw, are normally invited to
attend Committee meetings for those items
other than their own arrangements. In addition,
Andrew Law (General Manager, Human
Resources) is also available to provide advice.
Attendance at meetings during 2005 is
recorded in the Corporate Governance
section of this Annual Report & Accounts.
Advisers
T owers Perrin provides external advice to the
Board and the Committee on executive
compensation levels, structure and design, and
also provides services to the Group on
employee reward, retirement and administration.
Mercer Human Resource Consulting is
appointed as the Company’s pension scheme
actuaries and provides advice to the Company
on its pension arrangements. Watson Wyatt
Consultants provide advice to the Committee on
pensions issues. The Monks Partnership is the
Committee’s appointed independent adviser and
provides no other services to the Group.
Remuneration policy
The Committee considers total remuneration as
its primary measure of reward and seeks to
provide median remuneration for on-target
performance, with the potential to achieve upper
quartile remuneration for outstanding
performance. T otal remuneration for executives,
therefore, is geared heavily towards performance,
whilst any base salary increases are generally kept
in line with those given to all Group employees.
The remuneration package comprises two
main components:
• ﬁxed pay, i.e. base salary and beneﬁts
including pension; and
• variable pay, i.e. short-term incentive
delivered in the form of cash and deferred
shares, and a long-term incentive in the form
of matching shares, delivered through a single
scheme, the Executive Incentive Plan (‘EIP’).
As Figure 1 illustrates, at ‘target’ performance
levels, where matching shares commence to
vest, a signiﬁcant proportion (48%) of the total
remuneration package is dependent on
performance. Similarly , at ‘upper end’
performance, the variable pay element accounts
for over three-quarters of the total package.
Similar to last year, the relative importance of
performance and non-performance related
elements of remuneration for the purposes of
the Regulations, has been determined according
to a number of assumptions on the Company’s
share price growth over the next three years.
For the purposes of Figure 1, the value of
pensions has been excluded in calculating
beneﬁts, as these values can vary signiﬁcantly
from year to year and from person to person.
Figure 1
T otal remuneration at ‘target’ performance
T otal remuneration at ‘upper end’
performance
Going forward, therefore, the main
remuneration principles are to:
• provide Executive Directors and senior
executives with competitive levels of total
remuneration with respect to comparable
companies in the UK ﬁnancial services
sector; and
• provide share-based incentive plans that
facilitate Executive Directors to build a
signiﬁcant stake in the Company and hence
maintain alignment with shareholder interests.
The criteria and performance levels are set at
the start of each year. Once set, they would
not normally be adjusted during the course of
the year and, in fact, no changes were made
over the course of the past ﬁnancial year.
The following sections of this report address
the current elements of executive
remuneration, previous executive incentive
plans where performance cycles are still
running for grants made in 2001 to 2004,
executive beneﬁts including pensions, contracts
and variable pay plans open to all employees.
CURRENT ELEMENTS OF
REMUNERATION
Base salary
Base salaries for Executive Directors are
reviewed annually in April where consideration
of wider remuneration and employment factors
elsewhere in the Company is also taken into
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
Fixed pay 52% Variable pay 48%
Fixed pay 22%
Variable pay 78% 30 BRADFORD & BINGLEY ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2005 WWW.BBG.CO.UK
account. Base salary increases for Executive
Directors in April 2005 were broadly in line with
increases throughout the Group. Base salary is
the only element of pay that is pensionable.
The Executive Incentive Plan
The EIP is a single plan introduced with
shareholders’ approval in 2004 that encompasses
both annual and three-year performance.
The EIP applies to those individuals whose
personal performance has a signiﬁcant impact
on the Group’s results, namely the Executive
Directors and certain other senior executives.
In 2005 there were 1 8 participants in total. In
2006 we are extending the plan to a further
25 participants albeit at a lower bonus level.
Short-term performance component
Under the EIP , the short-term component is
composed of two parts.
Under the ﬁrst part, a bonus with an ‘on-
target’ payout of 30% of base salary and a
maximum of 60% of base salary can be paid 
in cash as a reward for the achievement of
pre-determined short-term performance
measures during the year.
The second part consists of an equivalent
amount of deferred shares, which will form a
stake in the longer-term future of the Company.
However, these shares will not vest for three
years and if a participant leaves the Company
they will have no automatic right to the shares,
thus creating a retention element within the plan.
The performance measures are reviewed
annually to ensure they continue to be
appropriate to the current market conditions
and position of the Company. Those selected
for 2005, in order to align Executive Directors’
performance with the Group’s business
strategy, were underlying Group proﬁt before
tax, restructuring and compensation cost, and
a set of personal objectives for each executive.
Bonus payments earned for the past year
totalled on average 39.3% of salary in cash and
39.3% of salary in deferred shares. The value of
the deferred shares element will be disclosed
at the time of vesting in the relevant report.
Long-term performance component
If the Company performs well during the
three-year deferral period, participants will be
entitled to an additional award of matching
performance shares. The performance
conditions, determining the level of match to
be applied to the bonus relating to 2005
performance (paid in 2006), will be as follows:
Performance Share Match
Compound EPS growth No match
< RPI + 3% pa
Compound EPS growth 1 x match
= RPI + 3% pa
Compound EPS growth 2 x match
= RPI + 5% pa
Compound EPS growth 3 x match
> or = RPI + 8% pa
Matching is calculated on a pro-rata basis
between the above points. The maximum
number of matching shares will be three matching
performance shares for each deferred share.
On change in control of the Company,
participants’ deferred shares are released in
full. In addition, matching performance shares
are also released but pro-rated on the basis of
(i) the proportion of the performance period
that has elapsed; and (ii) the extent to which
the Committee considers the performance
conditions would have been met had the
performance period run its full term.
Previous executive incentive plans
Final awards under the Performance Share Plan
(‘PSP’) were made in February 2004 to Executive
Directors and other senior executives. Awards
under the PSP will vest subject to out-performing
similar ﬁnancial services companies over the
longer-term, as measured by T otal Shareholder
Return (‘TSR’). The 2004 comparator group was
disclosed in last year’s report which is available on
the Company’s website.
Under the terms of the 2004 PSP , Executive
Directors received a ‘standard’ award up to a
maximum of one times basic salary and a ‘stretch’
award of up to a further one times basic salary.
Shares are released depending on the
Company’s TSR performance relative to the
performance of the comparator group
companies at the end of three years, as shown
in Figure 2. Under the standard award, 30%
vests for median performance rising on a
straight line basis to full vesting for upper
quartile performance. Under the separate
stretch award, vesting commences at median
performance and rises on a straight line basis to
full vesting at the 85th percentile or above. The
Committee must also be satisﬁed that the
underlying ﬁnancial performance of the
Company warrants vesting.
Final grants of share options to Executive
Directors and other senior executives were made
in 2003. In order for these share options to
become exercisable, the Company’s earnings per
share (‘EPS’) growth must exceed the increase in
the retail price index by at least 9% over a three
year period. The deﬁnition of EPS used to assess
performance for 2005, is EPS before restructuring
and compensation costs. This assumes earnings to
be the proﬁt of the Group after all payments,
including taxation, are made. If the performance
condition has not been achieved at the end of
three years, the test may be repeated on three
further consecutive occasions, otherwise the
options lapse.
In relation to the share option awards made in
2002, the Company’s EPS growth exceeded
the applicable performance condition. The
Remuneration Committee determined,
therefore, that the awards should become
exercisable in full in accordance with the
applicable performance condition.
Pensions and other beneﬁts
Steven Crawshaw, Rosemary Thorne and Robert
Dickie are members of the Company’s Deﬁned
Beneﬁt pension scheme under which pension is
accrued at retirement based on one-fortieth of
the base salary paid over the prior twelve months
(‘ﬁnal salary’) for each year of pensionable service
up to 31 December 2000 (7 August 2003 for
Robert Dickie) and one-thirtieth thereafter.
Executive Directors’ contributions were at the
rate of 2.5% of base salary for 2005 and increase
to 5% of base salary from April 2006 onwards.
Chris Gillespie participates in the Company’s
Deﬁned Contribution pension scheme to which
the Company contributes 1 5% and the participant
3% of base salary. Chris Willford does not
participate in the Company pension schemes, but
receives a salary supplement equal to 20% of his
base salary instead.
Both of the Company’s pension schemes
provide a lump sum death-in-service beneﬁt of
the higher of four times basic salary or four
times earnings in the previous tax year, together
with spouse’s or dependants’ pensions. The
normal retirement age is now 65.
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED 31 BRADFORD & BINGLEY ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2005 WWW.BBG.CO.UK
As a result of the new UK legislation affecting
the taxation of pensions, the Company has
reviewed the pension arrangements it provides
to Executive Directors. It has agreed to
replicate internally a notional cap (initially
£ 1 05,600) for any deﬁned beneﬁt arrangements
– a provision in excess of this limit will be
provided by way of deﬁned contribution
arrangements. In addition, Executive Directors
with unapproved pension beneﬁts will be given
the option of rolling those beneﬁts into the
Company’s Deﬁned Beneﬁt scheme. Currently
none of the Executive Directors have beneﬁts
in excess of the lifetime allowance (initially
£ 1.5m). A cash supplement in lieu of pension
beneﬁts will be offered in such a circumstance
to be agreed by the Committee.
In line with typical market practice, executive
beneﬁts are provided in the form of a
company car (or cash allowance), housing
allowance, private medical insurance and
permanent disability and accident insurance.
Contracts 
Group policy is to employ Executive Directors
on one-year rolling contracts (that expire at their
respective normal retirement ages) although, on
recruitment, longer initial terms may be
approved by the Remuneration Committee. In
line with this policy, the Company’s notice of
termination (or payment in lieu) and the
Directors’ notice periods are shown in the table
Directors’ service contracts on page 33. With
respect to Chris Willford, the Remuneration
Committee considered it appropriate, in order
to secure his joining the Company, that his
contract has an initial 24-month notice period,
reducing to 1 2 months with effect from the ﬁrst
anniversary of his joining.
The principle applied on termination is that all
legal and contractual arrangements are met, with
no additional payments. Executive Directors
receive a maximum of 1 2 months’ basic salary and
other contractual beneﬁts in the event of the
Company terminating the contract without notice
for any reason other than gross misconduct
(when there will be no compensation).
The date of each service contract and the 
age of each current Executive Director (as at
31 December 2005) are shown in the table on
the page 33.
Rosemary Thorne resigned from the Board on
29 November 2005 and her employment with
the Company ceased on 31 December 2005.
Chris Willford was appointed as Executive
Director on 3 October 2005. Chris Gillespie
was appointed as Executive Director on 
26 September 2005.
Employee variable pay plans 
The Company continues to encourage wider
share ownership through the use of a savings
related share option scheme in which
approximately 40% of its employees (including
Executive Directors) were participants.
In addition, restricted shares are awarded to a
very few key, high-performing individuals following
achievement of speciﬁed performance measures.
These shares are released to individuals in three
annual tranches or on the third anniversary of the
award. Executive Directors are not eligible to
receive restricted shares.
Chairman and Non-executive Directors’ fees
Fee levels for the Chairman are determined by
the Remuneration Committee with reference
to a similar peer group used for Executive
Directors and other senior executives.
Consistent with current best practice, the
Chairman is not eligible to participate in any
form of performance-related incentive plan.
Fee levels for the Non-executive Directors are
determined by a committee, the current
membership being the Chairman, the Group
Chief Executive and the Group Finance
Director. T owers Perrin provides independent
advice on best practice and market fee levels,
taking into account the responsibilities and time
commitment of each Non-executive Director.
Fee levels were not reviewed in 2005, but 
are likely to be reviewed in 2006. The 
Non-executive Directors do not participate in
any incentive arrangements and none of them
have a service contract. Each receives a letter of
engagement indicating that their initial term of
appointment will be three years. Non-executive
Directors do not receive any other beneﬁts.
Non-executive directorships 
Executive Directors who hold non-executive
directorships in other companies are permitted
to retain their earnings from these posts.
Rosemary Thorne is a Non-executive Director
of Cadbury Schweppes plc. The Non-executive
Directors of Cadbury Schweppes have chosen to
utilise a percentage of their fees (between 50%
and 60%) to purchase shares in the company,
which are bought within ﬁve business days of
each relevant payment. Each Non-executive
Director has undertaken to hold such shares
during the term of his or her appointment.
Rosemary received a fee of £46,250 for 2005.

Notes
Short-term performance remuneration shown above reﬂects amounts payable in respect of 2005 performance.
Taxable beneﬁts received by Directors consist principally of the provision of a company car, health beneﬁts and housing allowance as appropriate. Taxable beneﬁts for Chris Willford also
include an amount in lieu of pension entitlement.
The ‘T otal emoluments 2004’ reﬂect payments made to Directors for the period they served on the Board during 2004.
Rosemary Thorne resigned from the Board on 29 November 2005 but served as an ofﬁcer of the Group until 31 December 2005. Under the employment terms agreed with the Group,
Rosemary is entitled to receive monthly salary and other beneﬁts until 30 September 2006. The salary, beneﬁts and short-term performance remuneration in the above table relate to the
period of service between 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2005. The additional sums shown as ‘Other payments to former Director’ represent the contractual value of salary and other
beneﬁts payable under the above agreement for the period 1 January 2006 through to 30 September 2006.

Beneﬁts have been valued at a retirement age of 60, with an adjustment made to the post 1 April 2005 beneﬁts to reﬂect the fact these are reduced if paid before the age of 65.
Pension disclosures are reported above in accordance with the Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002. The transfer values reported above reﬂect the capital value of the relevant
pension assessed under market conditions at the end of 2005 and 2004 respectively. The change in transfer value during 2005 is reduced by the Directors’ contributions to the scheme during
2005. The increase in accrued pension entitlement represents the change in the annual pension to which each Director is entitled as a result of changes in pensionable earnings, excluding
inﬂation and increases in pensionable service.
The accrued pension ﬁgure for Steven Crawshaw allows for the fact that his total pension at normal retirement date will be restricted to 2/3rds of his ﬁnal pensionable salary (FPS), offset by his
retained beneﬁts held in other pension schemes. The accrued pension ﬁgure for Robert Dickie allows for the fact that his pension at normal retirement date will be restricted to 2/3rds of his
FPS, offset by his retained beneﬁts held in other pension schemes and a change of accrual rate backdated to 1 August 2003.
Chris Gillespie is not a member of the deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme but the Company contributes to a money purchase scheme.
Rosemary Thorne ceased to be a Director of the Company on 29 November 2005, and her total deferred pension at that date was £59,098 p.a. However, she opted to cash in the
unapproved element of this pension and a cash payment of £0.7m is included within the pension payments to former Directors. The remaining deferred pension is £ 1 6,300 per annum
In 2005 pension payments due to former Directors amounted to £ 1.0m (2004: £0.3m).
The changes in transfer values during 2005 are net of employee contributions. 33 BRADFORD & BINGLEY ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2005 WWW.BBG.CO.UK

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities in
respect of the Annual Report & Accounts
and the Financial Statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the
Annual Report & Accounts and the Group and
parent Company Financial Statements in
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to
prepare Group and Company Financial
Statements for each ﬁnancial year. Under that
law they are required to prepare the Group
Financial Statements in accordance with IFRS
as adopted by the European Union (the ‘EU’)
and have elected to prepare the Company
Financial Statements on the same basis.
The Group and Company Financial Statements
are required by law and IFRS as adopted by the
EU to present fairly the ﬁnancial position of the
Group and the Company and the performance
of the Group for that period; the Companies
Act 1 985 provides in relation to such ﬁnancial
statements that references in the relevant part
of that Act to ﬁnancial statements giving a true
and fair view are references to their achieving a
fair presentation.
In preparing each of the Group and Company
Financial Statements, the Directors are
required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then
apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are
reasonable and prudent;
• state whether the Financial Statements have
been prepared in accordance with IFRS as
adopted by the EU; and
• prepare the Financial Statements on the
going concern basis unless it is inappropriate
to presume that the Group and Company
will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping
proper accounting records that disclose with
reasonable accuracy at any time the ﬁnancial
position of the Company and enable them to
ensure that its Financial Statements comply
with the Companies Act 1 985. They have
general responsibility for taking such steps as
are reasonably open to them to safeguard the
assets of the Group and to prevent and detect
fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the
Directors are also responsible for preparing a
Directors’ Report, Directors’ Remuneration
Report and a Corporate Governance Statement
that comply with that law and those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the
maintenance and integrity of the corporate
and ﬁnancial information included on the
Company’s website. Legislation in the UK
governing the preparation and dissemination
of ﬁnancial statements may differ from
legislation in other jurisdictions.

GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES 36 BRADFORD & BINGLEY ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2005 WWW.BBG.CO.UK
We have audited the Group and parent
Company ﬁnancial statements (the ‘Financial
Statements’) of Bradford & Bingley plc for the
year ended 31 December 2005 which
comprise the Group Income Statement, the
Group and Company Balance Sheets, the
Group and Company Cash Flow Statements,
the Group and Company Statements of
Recognised Income and Expense, the related
notes and the Appendix except for the
Proforma information described on pages 88,
91, 93, 95 and 98 as unaudited. These Financial
Statements have been prepared under the
accounting policies set out therein. We have
also audited the information in the Directors’
Remuneration Report on pages 32 to 34.
This report is made solely to the Company’s
members, as a body, in accordance with
section 235 of the Companies Act 1 985. Our
audit work has been undertaken so that we
might state to the Company’s members those
matters we are required to state to them in an
auditor’s report and for no other purpose. T o
the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not
accept or assume responsibility to anyone
other than the Company and the Company’s
members as a body, for our audit work, for this
report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors 
and auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing 
the Annual Report & Accounts, the Directors’
Remuneration Report and the Financial
Statements in accordance with applicable law
and International Financial Reporting Standards
(‘IFRS’) as adopted by the EU are set out in
the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities 
on page 35.
Our responsibility is to audit the Financial
Statements and the part of the Directors’
Remuneration Report to be audited in
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory
requirements and International Standards on
Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether
the Financial Statements give a true and fair
view and whether the Financial Statements
and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration
Report to be audited have been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies
Act 1 985 and, as regards the Financial
Statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We also report to you if, in our opinion, the
Directors’ Report is not consistent with the
Financial Statements, if the Company has not
kept proper accounting records, if we have
not received all the information and
explanations we require for our audit, or if
information speciﬁed by law regarding
Directors’ remuneration and other transactions
is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate
Governance Statement reﬂects the
Company’s compliance with the nine
provisions of the 2003 FRC Combined Code
speciﬁed for our review by the Listing Rules of
the Financial Services Authority, and we
report if it does not. We are not required to
consider whether the Board’s statements on
internal control cover all risks and controls, or
form an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Group’s corporate governance procedures or
its risk and control procedures.
We read other information contained in the
Annual Report & Accounts and consider
whether it is consistent with the audited
Financial Statements. We consider the
implications for our report if we become
aware of any apparent misstatements or
material inconsistencies with the Financial
Statements. Our responsibilities do not extend
to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with
International Standards on Auditing (UK and
Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board.
An audit includes examination, on a test basis,
of evidence relevant to the amounts and
disclosures in the Financial Statements and the
part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to
be audited. It also includes an assessment of the
signiﬁcant estimates and judgements made by
the Directors in the preparation of the Financial
Statements, and of whether the accounting
policies are appropriate to the Group’s and
Company’s circumstances, consistently applied
and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to
obtain all the information and explanations
which we considered necessary in order to
provide us with sufﬁcient evidence to give
reasonable assurance that the Financial
Statements and the part of the Directors’
Remuneration Report to be audited are free
from material misstatement, whether caused by
fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming
our opinion, we also evaluated the overall
adequacy of the presentation of information in
the Financial Statements and the part of the
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the Group Financial Statements give a true
and fair view, in accordance with IFRS as
adopted by the EU, of the state of the
Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2005 and
of its proﬁt for the year then ended;
• the Company Financial Statements give a true
and fair view, in accordance with IFRS as
adopted by the EU as applied in accordance
with the provisions of the Companies Act
1 985, of the state of the Company’s affairs as
at 31 December 2005; and
• the Financial Statements and the part of the
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be
audited have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1 985
and, as regards the Financial Statements,
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.

1. Signiﬁcant accounting policies
Bradford & Bingley plc (“the Company”) is a
public limited company incorporated in the
United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1 985.
These Financial Statements were authorised
for issue by the Directors on 1 5 February 2006
and will be put to the shareholders for
approval at the Company’s Annual General
Meeting to be held on 25 April 2006.
(a) Statement of compliance
The Group Financial Statements consolidate
those of the Company and its subsidiaries
(together referred to as the “Group”). The
Company Financial Statements present
information about the Company as a separate
entity and not about its Group.
Both the Group Financial Statements and the
Company Financial Statements have been
prepared and approved by the Directors in
accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards as adopted by the
European Union (“adopted IFRS”). In
publishing the Company Financial Statements
here together with the Group Financial
Statements, the Company has taken advantage
of the exemption in s230 of the Companies
Act 1 985 not to present its individual Income
Statement and related notes that form a part
of these approved Financial Statements.
As detailed in paragraph (u), the Group has
used “The Fair Value Option” amendment to
IAS 39 “Financial Instruments: Recognition and
Measurement” issued by the IASB in June 2005.
The IASB intended that compliance with the
following two statements should be voluntary
for 2005 and 2006 but mandatory for 2007;
the Group has not adopted them for these
2005 Financial Statements because the EU had
not endorsed them by 31 December 2005:
• The Capital Disclosures amendment to IAS
1 issued by the IASB in August 2005; and
• IFRS 7 “Financial Instruments: Disclosures”
issued by the IASB in August 2005.
These two statements relate to disclosures
only, and adoption of them would have no
impact on the Group’s or the Company’s
Income Statements, Balance Sheets or Cash
Flow Statements.
The Group has also not adopted the
following statements:
• IFRIC 4 “Determining Whether an
Arrangement Contains a Lease” issued in
January 2004. This is effective for 2006, and
will require the Group to account for as
leases any rights to use assets in return for
payment. The Group is not aware of any
arrangements which will require any change
in accounting treatment in 2006 as a result
of IFRIC 4.
• Amendment to IAS 39 and IFRS 4 “Financial
Guarantee Contracts” issued in August 2005
and effective for 2006. A ﬁnancial guarantee
contract is a contract that requires the issuer
to make speciﬁed payments to reimburse the
holder for a loss it incurs because a speciﬁed
debtor fails to make payment. The Group is
not aware of any arrangements which will
require any change in accounting treatment
in 2006 as a result of this amendment.
Both the Group and the Company are presenting
their Financial Statements in accordance with
adopted IFRS for the ﬁrst time and consequently
both have applied IFRS 1 “First-time Adoption of
International Financial Reporting Standards”. An
explanation of how the transition to adopted
IFRS has affected the reported ﬁnancial position
and ﬁnancial performance of the Group and
Company is provided in the Appendix. As at 
1 January 2004 the cumulative change to retained
earnings has been taken directly to reserves as
required by IFRS 1.
(b) IFRS 1 exemptions
IFRS 1 sets out the procedures which the Group
and Company must follow on adoption of IFRS.
The Group and Company are required to 
establish their IFRS accounting policies as at 
31 December 2005 and, in general, to apply
them retrospectively to the whole of 2004 and
2005 and in determining their IFRS opening
Balance Sheet as at 1 January 2004. However,
IFRS 1 provides a number of optional
exemptions from this general principle. The most
signiﬁcant of these are set out below, together
with a description in each case of the exemption
adopted by the Group and Company.
(i) IFRS 2 “Share-based Payment”
The Group and Company have elected to
apply IFRS 2 only to share-based payment
transactions granted after 7 November 2002
and not vested as at 1 January 2005.
(ii) IFRS 3 “Business Combinations”
The Group has elected not to apply IFRS 3
retrospectively to business combinations that
took place before 1 January 2004. As a result,
in the 1 January 2004 opening IFRS Balance
Sheet, goodwill arising from past business
combinations remains as stated under UK
GAAP as at that date.
(iii) IAS 39 “Financial Instruments: Recognition
and Measurement”
Under IAS 39 a ﬁnancial asset or liability which
was derecognised from the Balance Sheet
prior to 1 January 2004, due to sale or other
reason, cannot be reinstated to the Balance
Sheet other than as a result of a new event
occurring on or after 1 January 2004. IFRS 1
allows an entity to adopt an earlier cut-off
date, and the Group and Company have
chosen to use 1 January 1 999 for this purpose.
Therefore all ﬁnancial liabilities which were
derecognised in the period 1 999 to 2004 and
which should be carried on the Balance Sheet
under IFRS at 1 January 2005 have been
reinstated to the Balance Sheet as at that date.
(iv) IAS 32 “Financial Instruments: Disclosure
and Presentation” and IAS 39 “Financial
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement”
As explained in 1(c) below, IFRS 1 allows
entities to apply IAS 32 and IAS 39 with effect
from 1 January 2005 without retrospective
restatement of 2004. The Group and
Company have taken this exemption.
(c) 2004 comparative information
The 2004 comparative information contained
in these Financial Statements has been
restated from that presented in the Group’s
2004 Financial Statements in accordance with
IFRS. As at 1 January 2004 the cumulative
change to retained earnings has been taken
directly to reserves, as required by IFRS 1.
The accounting policies applied to 2005 differ
to those applied to the 2004 comparative
information with regards to ﬁnancial
instruments, where those used under UK
GAAP have been applied.
The difference in policies between 2004 and
2005 arises from the exemption granted by
IFRS 1 from retrospective application of IAS 32
and IAS 39 in restating 2004 information. The
adjustments made as at 1 January 2005 in order
to reﬂect adoption of the new ﬁnancial
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 42 BRADFORD & BINGLEY ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2005 WWW.BBG.CO.UK
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
instruments accounting policies have been
treated as a change in accounting policies at that
date, except that, in accordance with IFRS 1,
the cumulative change to retained earnings has
been taken directly to reserves as at that date.
(d) Basis of preparation
The Financial Statements are prepared on 
the historical cost basis except that for the
2005 information:
(i) the following assets and liabilities are carried
at their fair value:
• derivative ﬁnancial instruments;
• ﬁnancial instruments categorised under IAS 39
as “at fair value through proﬁt or loss”; and
• ﬁnancial instruments categorised under IAS 39
as “available-for -sale”; and
(ii) where hedge accounting has been applied
the carrying value of hedged items has been
adjusted to take account of the fair value of
the risk which has been hedged.
The 2004 information in these Financial
Statements complies with the Statements of
Recommended Practice (‘SORPs’) issued by the
British Bankers’ Association. In 2005 the SORPs
have been superseded by IFRS.
In the application of these accounting policies
the Directors have made judgements that have
a signiﬁcant effect on the Financial Statements
and have also made estimates that may give
rise to adjustment in future years. These
judgements and estimates are discussed in
note 37.
The Directors consider that the accounting
policies set out in this note are the most
appropriate to the Group’s and the Company’s
circumstances, have been consistently applied
both to the Group and the Company in
dealing with items which are considered
material, and are supported by reasonable and
prudent estimates and judgements. Where
IFRS allows a choice of accounting policy, the
Directors have chosen the policy which they
consider most appropriate for the Group. The
accounting policies have been applied to all
periods presented in these Financial
Statements and are consistent with the
accounting policies used by the Group in
preparing its Interim Financial Information for
the 6 months ended 30 June 2005.
The Financial Statements are presented in pounds
sterling, which is the currency of the Group’s and
Company’s primary operating environment.
(e) Basis of consolidation
The Group’s Financial Statements incorporate
on a fully consolidated basis the Financial
Statements of the Company and those entities
(including special purpose entities) which are
controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries).
Control is achieved where the Company has
the power to govern the ﬁnancial and operating
policies of an investee entity so as to obtain
beneﬁts from its activities. Where subsidiaries
have been acquired during a period, their
results are consolidated in the Financial
Statements from the date control is transferred
to the Group. Where subsidiaries have been
disposed of, their results are consolidated to
the date of disposal. On the acquisition of a
business, fair values are attributed to the assets,
liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired. Any
difference between the consideration given and
the fair value of the net assets acquired is
capitalised as goodwill.
Accounting policies applied to both 2004 
and 2005
(f) Fee and commission income
Where value added tax (‘VAT’) is charged,
income is stated net of VAT.
Commission receivable from the sale of third
party regulated ﬁnancial services products is
recognised as income within “fee and
commission income” when the policy goes “on
risk”, net of any provision for repayment in the
event of early termination by the customer.
Fee and commission income arises on various
other activities and is accounted for within “fee
and commission income” in the Income
Statement on an accruals basis as the services
are performed. Fee and commission income
includes items relating to lending which do not
qualify for inclusion in the effective interest
rate (‘EIR’) on the loan.
(g) Employee beneﬁts
(i) Post-retirement beneﬁts
The Group operates a number of post-
retirement beneﬁt plans for its employees,
including deﬁned contribution plans, deﬁned
beneﬁt plans and other post-retirement
beneﬁts (principally healthcare). The costs of
these plans are charged to the Income
Statement and retained earnings in accordance
with IAS 1 9 “Employee Beneﬁts” as amended
in December 2004.
A deﬁned contribution plan is a pension
arrangement where the employer pays ﬁxed
contributions into a separate fund. The
contributions are charged to the Income
Statement when employees have rendered the
related services, which is generally in the year
of contribution.
A deﬁned beneﬁt plan is a pension
arrangement that deﬁnes an amount of
pension beneﬁt that an employee will receive
during retirement, usually dependent on one
or more factors such as age, years of service
and salary. The net deﬁcit or surplus on the
plan is carried in the Balance Sheet, comprising
the present value of the deﬁned beneﬁt
obligation at the Balance Sheet date less the
fair value of plan assets. The deﬁned beneﬁt
obligation is calculated annually by independent
qualiﬁed actuaries using the projected unit
credit method. Actuarial gains and losses are
charged to retained earnings in full in the
period in which they occur, and pass through
the Statement of Recognised Income and
Expense rather than the Income Statement.
Post-retirement medical beneﬁts are
accounted for in the same way as pension
beneﬁts, with the present value of the liability
being carried on the Balance Sheet.
(ii) Share-based payment
The Group operates various share-based
incentive schemes for employees and ofﬁcers,
including a Sharesave Scheme. Grants of shares,
share options and other equity instruments
which were made after 7 November 2002 and
which had not vested as at 1 January 2005 are
accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2
“Share-based Payment”, under which the fair
value of awards is measured at the date of grant
and charged to the Income Statement over the
period to vesting, with a corresponding credit
to retained earnings. Further details of the
Group’s fair value methodology are given in
note 5. The fair value takes into account vesting
conditions in addition to expected movements
in the Company’s share price. The charge is
made only in respect of the number of awards 43 BRADFORD & BINGLEY ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2005 WWW.BBG.CO.UK
that are expected to vest; this expected
number is revised at each Balance Sheet date
and the difference due to estimate revisions is
charged or credited to the Income Statement
over the period to vesting with a corresponding
adjustment to retained earnings. The proceeds
received on exercise of options net of any
directly attributable transaction costs are
credited to retained earnings.
(h) Taxation
The charge for taxation is based on the proﬁt
for the year and takes into account taxation
deferred or accelerated arising from
temporary differences between the carrying
amounts of certain items for taxation and for
accounting purposes. Deferred taxation is
provided for in full at the tax rate at the
Balance Sheet date in accordance with IAS 1 2
“Income Taxes”, including on tax losses carried
forward, and is not discounted to take account
of the expected timing of realisation. Deferred
taxation assets are recognised only to the
extent that it is probable that future taxable
proﬁts will be available against which the
taxable differences can be utilised. Tax relating
to items which are taken directly to reserves is
also taken directly to reserves.
(i) Dividends
In accordance with IAS 1 0 “Events after the
Balance Sheet Date”, dividends payable on
ordinary shares are recognised in retained
earnings once they are appropriately
authorised and are no longer at the discretion
of the Company.
Dividends receivable by the Company
(including those receivable from other Group
entities) are recognised by the Company once
the right to receive payment is established, in
accordance with IAS 1 8 “Revenue”.
(j) Purchases and sales of ﬁnancial assets
Purchases and sales of mortgage portfolios are
accounted for on the completion date. All
other purchases and sales of ﬁnancial assets
are accounted for on the date of commitment
to buy or sell (the “trade date”).
(k) Securitisation vehicles
The Group has securitised various residential
mortgage loans, generally by sale or transfer to
special purpose entities which in turn issue
securities to investors. The special purpose
structures are consolidated line by line into the
Group Financial Statements if they are, in
substance, controlled by the Company.
(l) Shares in Group undertakings
In the accounts of the Company, shares in
Group undertakings are carried at cost less
any impairment, as required by IAS 27
“Consolidated and Separate Financial
Statements”. Shares are reviewed at each
published Balance Sheet date for any indication
of impairment, in accordance with IAS 36
“Impairment of Assets”. If there is indication of
impairment of any share, the carrying value of
the share is reviewed, and any impairment
identiﬁed is charged immediately in the
Income Statement.
(m) Property, plant and equipment 
The cost of additions and major alterations to
land and buildings, equipment, ﬁxtures and
motor vehicles is capitalised. All property,
plant and equipment is stated at historical cost
less depreciation.
Depreciation is provided so as to write off the
cost less the estimated residual value of each
signiﬁcant component of each item of
property, plant and equipment over that
component’s estimated useful life, as follows:
• Land is not depreciated;
• Freehold buildings at 2% per annum on a
straight line basis;
• Leasehold properties over the shorter of
the lease period and 50 years on a straight
line basis;
• Fixtures and ﬁttings at 20% per annum on a
straight line basis;
• Motor vehicles at 25% per annum on a
reducing balance basis;
• Computer equipment at rates ranging from
20% to 33% per annum on a straight line
basis; and
• Other equipment and major alterations to
buildings at 1 0% per annum on a straight
line basis.
All items of property, plant and equipment are
reviewed annually for impairment.
(n) Leases
Leases are accounted for as ﬁnance leases or
operating leases in accordance with IAS 1 7
“Leases”. A ﬁnance lease is a lease that
transfers substantially all the risks and rewards
of ownership of an asset; any other lease is an
operating lease.
Rentals under operating leases are charged to
“administrative expenses” on a straight line basis
to the date of change in the rental amount.
Typically, operating leases have rent review
dates in their terms, several years apart, and
between those dates the annual rent remains
constant. Lease premia paid are amortised over
the full lease period on a straight line basis.
(o) Intangible assets
(i) Goodwill
On acquisition of a business, goodwill
represents the difference between the fair
value of the consideration given and the net
aggregate fair value of the identiﬁable assets,
liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is not subject to regular amortisation,
but is reviewed annually for impairment. Any
impairment identiﬁed is charged immediately
in the Income Statement and is not
subsequently reversed. Goodwill is carried at
cost less accumulated impairment losses. Gains
and losses on the disposal of a business include
the carrying amount of any goodwill relating to
the business sold.
In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004,
goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed
cost, being its carrying amount at 1 January 2004
under previous UK GAAP .
(ii) Computer software
Computer software licences are capitalised as
intangible assets if they have a sufﬁciently
enduring nature. Thereafter they are carried at
cost less accumulated amortisation.
Amortisation is provided on a straight line
basis over their useful economic lives, which
may be up to ﬁve years. Those which have a
life expectancy at the outset of less than two
years are not capitalised but instead their costs
are charged to the Income Statement as they
arise. Costs that are directly associated with
developing identiﬁable computer software
systems are capitalised if the criteria in IAS 38
“Intangible Assets” are satisﬁed; the main
criteria are that the successful completion of
the development project is reasonably certain
and that the software is expected to generate
future economic beneﬁts. Each item of
capitalised developed computer software is
carried at cost less accumulated amortisation; 44 BRADFORD & BINGLEY ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2005 WWW.BBG.CO.UK
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
amortisation is provided on a straight line basis
over its estimated useful life. Costs that do not
qualify for capitalisation are charged to the
Income Statement as they arise.
(p) Provisions
Provisions are recognised when, and only
when, the following criteria are all met:
• there is a present obligation (legal or
constructive) as a result of a past event; and
• it is probable that an outﬂow of resources
will be required to settle the obligation; and
• a reliable estimate can be made of the
amount of the obligation.
Provisions are discounted to net present value
using rates which reﬂect the risks speciﬁc to the
provision, if the effect of discounting is material.
Provisions are reviewed at each Balance Sheet
date, and are released if they no longer meet
the above criteria.
(q) Cash and cash equivalents
For the purposes of the Cash Flow Statement,
cash and cash equivalents comprise balances
which had an original maturity of three months
or less.
(r) Foreign currencies
Foreign currency transactions, assets and
liabilities are accounted for in accordance with
IAS 21 “The Effects of Changes in Foreign
Exchange Rates”. The presentation currency of
the Group is pounds sterling. Transactions
which are not denominated in pounds sterling
are translated into sterling at the spot rate of
exchange on the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities which are not
denominated in pounds sterling are translated
into sterling at the closing rate of exchange at
the Balance Sheet date.
Any foreign exchange gains or losses arising
from settlement of transactions at rates
different from those at the date of the
transaction, and any unrealised foreign
currency exchange gains and losses on
unsettled foreign currency monetary assets
and liabilities, are included in the Income
Statement in “interest and similar income” or
“interest expense and similar charges”
depending on whether the underlying
instrument is an asset or a liability.
The assets and liabilities of subsidiaries which
have a functional currency other than pounds
sterling are translated into sterling at the
closing rate of exchange at the Balance Sheet
date, and the Income Statements and cash
ﬂows of those entities are translated into
sterling at the average exchange rate for the
Income Statement period.
Financial instruments accounting policies
applied to 2005 only
(s) Interest income and expense
For all ﬁnancial instruments (including loans
and advances), interest income and expense
are recognised in the Income Statement on 
an EIR basis.
The EIR basis spreads the interest income or
interest expense over the expected life of the
instrument. The EIR is the rate that at the
inception of the instrument exactly discounts
expected future cash payments and receipts
through the expected life of the instrument back
to the initial carrying amount. When calculating
the EIR, future cash ﬂows are estimated,
considering all contractual terms of the
instrument (for example prepayment options)
but potential future credit losses are not
considered. The calculation includes all directly
attributable incremental fees and costs, premia
on acquisition of mortgage portfolios and all
other premia and discounts as well as interest.
(t) Fee and commission income
If commission income is receivable on deferred
terms, a deemed interest element of the
commission is separated and recognised on an
EIR basis over the deferred payment period.
(u) Classiﬁcation of ﬁnancial instruments
In accordance with IAS 39 each ﬁnancial asset
is classiﬁed at initial recognition into one of
four categories:
(i) Financial assets at fair value through proﬁt
or loss;
(ii) Held-to-maturity investments;
(iii) Loans and receivables; or
(iv) Available-for-sale;
and each ﬁnancial liability into one of two
categories:
(v) At amortised cost; or
(vi) At fair value through proﬁt or loss.
In June 2005 the IASB issued the “Fair Value
Option” amendment to IAS 39. This
amendment permits designation of a ﬁnancial
asset or ﬁnancial liability as being “at fair value
through proﬁt or loss” under wider
circumstances than were previously allowed.
The Company uses this amendment to prevent
technical accounting mismatches between the
Company and other Group entities in respect
of accounting for intra-group swap
arrangements; use of this amendment has had
no impact on the results or Balance Sheet of
the Group. On initial adoption of the
amendment, the Company did not redesignate
any existing instruments between categories.
Measurement of ﬁnancial instruments is either
at amortised cost (categories (ii), (iii) and (v)
above) or at fair value (categories (i), (iv) and
(vi) above), depending on the category of
ﬁnancial instrument.
Amortised cost is the amount measured at
initial recognition, adjusted for subsequent
principal and other payments, less cumulative
amortisation calculated using the EIR method;
the amortisation is taken to interest income or
expense depending on whether the instrument
is an asset or a liability. The amortised cost
balance is reduced where appropriate by an
allowance for amounts which are considered to
be impaired or uncollectable.
Any proﬁt or loss on sale of an instrument
carried at amortised cost is recognised
immediately in the Income Statement in interest
income or expense depending on whether the
instrument is an asset or a liability.
Fair value is the amount for which an asset
could be exchanged, or a liability settled,
between knowledgeable, willing parties in an
arm’s length transaction. Where a market
exists, fair values are based on quoted market
prices. For instruments which do not have
active markets, fair value is calculated using
present value models which take individual cash
ﬂows together with assumptions based on
market conditions and credit spreads and are
consistent with accepted economic
methodologies for pricing ﬁnancial instruments.
Movements in fair value are recognised in the
“fair value movements on ﬁnancial instruments”
line in the Income Statement, except in the
case of instruments classiﬁed as “available-for-
sale”, in which case the fair value movements 45 BRADFORD & BINGLEY ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2005 WWW.BBG.CO.UK
are taken to the “available-for-sale reserve”.
On sale of an available-for-sale instrument 
the accumulated fair value movements are
transferred from the “available-for-sale reserve”
to “gains less losses on sale of debt securities”
within the Income Statement.
Certain certiﬁcates of deposit, ﬁxed and
ﬂoating rate notes and mortgage-backed
securities are classiﬁed as available-for-sale.
(v) Impairment of ﬁnancial assets
Financial assets, including loans and receivables,
are reviewed for indications of possible
impairment throughout the year and at each
published Balance Sheet date, in accordance
with IAS 39. For each individual loan which
exhibits indications of impairment, the carrying
value of the loan at the Balance Sheet date is
reduced to the net present value of the
expected future cash ﬂows associated with the
loan, calculated at the loan’s original EIR; these
cash ﬂows include where appropriate
estimated amounts recoverable by
repossession and sale of the secured property,
taking into account a discount on property
value to reﬂect a forced sale. Loans and
advances are written off when there is no
realistic prospect of recovery. All loans that
have been assessed as having no individual
impairment are then assessed collectively,
grouped by loans with similar risk
characteristics; assessment is made of
impairment arising due to events which are
believed to have occurred but had not yet
been reported by the Balance Sheet date,
taking into account the prevailing economic
climate. This collective impairment is reﬂected
by reducing the carrying value of total loans.
Interest income is recognised on impaired
loans by applying the original EIR of the loan 
to the impaired balance.
(w) Debt securities held
Debt securities intended for use on a
continuing basis in the Group’s activities are
classiﬁed either as “available-for-sale” or as “at
fair value through proﬁt or loss”, and are
accounted for, in accordance with IAS 39. In
each case they are carried at fair value. Each
investment in a structured investment vehicle
(‘SIV’) is individually reviewed to ensure the
accounting treatment is appropriate. Where
the SIV is considered to have minimal
management discretion, the Group recognises
its share of the SIV’s underlying assets and
liabilities, at fair value. In other cases the
investment in the SIV is treated as a debt
security. Interest on these vehicles includes a
margin above the coupon rate to reﬂect
proﬁts earned by the underlying investment.
(x) Derivative ﬁnancial instruments and
hedge accounting
The Group enters into derivative contracts in
order to manage exposures to interest rate
risks, foreign currency risks and risks arising
from forecast transactions, in accordance with
IAS 39. The EU has issued an amendment to
IAS 39 (the “carve-out” of IAS 39) which
relaxes the IAS 39 rules on hedging. Group
policy is to apply and account for hedging in
accordance with IAS 39, without use of the
carve-out relaxation. As explained in 1(u), the
Group has used the provisions of the Fair
Value Option amendment to IAS 39 issued by
the IASB in June 2005.
All derivatives are carried at fair value in the
Balance Sheet; as assets when the fair value is
positive and as liabilities when the fair value is
negative. Changes in the fair value of the
derivatives are charged to the Income
Statement, in the “fair value movements on
ﬁnancial instruments” line. However, by applying
the hedge accounting rules set out in IAS 39,
the changes in fair value of derivatives which are
used to hedge particular risks can either be
offset in the Income Statement (fair value
hedging) or deferred to reserves (cash ﬂow
hedging). The Group uses fair value hedges and
cash ﬂow hedges.
One-to-one fair value hedges
Where a derivative ﬁnancial instrument hedges
the changes in fair value of a speciﬁc asset or
liability, any gain or loss in the fair value of the
hedging derivative is recognised in the Income
Statement, in “fair value movements on
ﬁnancial instruments”. Provided that the hedge
arrangement meets the requirements of IAS
39 to be classed as “highly effective”, the
associated hedged item is carried in the
Balance Sheet at fair value in respect of the
hedged risk, with any gain or loss in that fair
value also recognised in the Income Statement
in “fair value movements on ﬁnancial
instruments”. Hence proﬁt volatility is
mitigated. The Income Statement immediately
recognises any “ineffectiveness”, deﬁned as any
difference between the fair value movement
on the hedging instrument and that on the
hedged item. Where a fair value hedge
relationship is terminated or deemed
ineffective (other than as a result of the
hedged item being derecognised from the
Balance Sheet due to sale or other reason) the
fair value adjustment relating to the terminated
hedge relationship is amortised in “fair value
movements on ﬁnancial instruments” within the
Income Statement over the period to the date
of maturity of the hedged item. The derivative
continues to be carried at fair value.
Portfolio fair value hedges
Where a group of derivatives hedge the
interest rate exposure of a group of assets or
liabilities, and the hedge meets the
requirements of IAS 39 to be classed as “highly
effective”, the hedge relationship is accounted
for in the same way as a one-to-one fair value
hedge except that the Balance Sheet carrying
value of the hedged items is not adjusted to
fair value; instead the difference between the
fair value and carrying value of the hedged
items is carried on the Balance Sheet in “fair
value adjustments of portfolio hedging”.
Cash ﬂow hedges
Where a derivative ﬁnancial instrument hedges
the variability in cash ﬂows of an asset or
liability, or of a highly probable forecast
transaction, the effective portion of the change
in fair value of the derivative is taken to the
“cash ﬂow hedge reserve” and the remaining
portion is charged to “fair value movements on
ﬁnancial instruments” in the Income Statement.
The amount taken to the “cash ﬂow hedge
reserve” is amortised to the “fair value
movements on ﬁnancial instruments” line of
the Income Statement over the life of the
hedged item. Where a cash ﬂow hedge of a
forecast transaction is terminated or deemed
ineffective any cumulative gain or loss
remaining in the reserve continues to be held
there, and is transferred to the Income
Statement only when the forecast transaction
is recognised. If the forecast transaction is no
longer expected to occur, the gain or loss still
held in the reserve is immediately recognised
in the Income Statement, in “fair value
movements on ﬁnancial instruments”.
Hedge effectiveness
At the inception of each hedging arrangement,
the relationship between the hedging
instruments and the hedged items is 46 BRADFORD & BINGLEY ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2005 WWW.BBG.CO.UK
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
documented, as well as the risk management
objective and strategy. Also documented is an
assessment, both at hedge inception and on
an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives
that are used in the hedging arrangement are
highly effective in offsetting changes in fair
values or cash ﬂows of the hedged items.
Embedded derivatives
Certain ﬁnancial instruments have derivative
features embedded within them (‘embedded
derivatives’). Where the economic
characteristics and risks of the embedded
derivative are not closely related to those of the
host instrument, and where the host
instrument is not carried at fair value, the
embedded derivative is separated from the host
and carried in the Balance Sheet at fair value
within “derivative ﬁnancial instruments”, with
gains and losses on the embedded derivative
being recognised in the Income Statement in
“fair value movements on ﬁnancial instruments”.
(y) Debt securities in issue
On initial recognition, debt issued is measured
at its fair value net of directly attributable
transaction costs, in accordance with IAS 39.
Subsequent measurement is at amortised cost
using the EIR method to amortise incremental
attributable issue and transaction costs,
premia and discounts over the life of the
instrument; these costs are charged along
with interest on the debt to “interest expense
and similar charges”. Unamortised amounts
are added to or deducted from the carrying
value of the instrument.
It is the Group’s policy to hedge ﬁxed interest
rate risk on debt issued and to apply fair value
hedge accounting.
Financial instruments accounting policies
applied to 2004 only
(z) Income recognition
• Interest income is recognised in the Income
Statement in “interest and similar income” as
it accrues except where interest is suspended
as set out in 1(ad) below.
• Commercial lending fees charged in lieu of
interest are recognised in the Income
Statement in “interest and similar income”
as they fall.
• Residential lending fees and commissions
receivable are recognised in the Income
Statement on receipt within “fee and
commission income”.
• Commission receivable from Regulated
Financial Services products is recognised in
the Income Statement on receipt within “fee
and commission income” when the policy
goes “on risk”, net of any provision for
repayment in the event of termination by
the customer.
• Procurement fees from sale of mortgages
are recognised in the Income Statement
within “fee and commission income” when
monies are advanced and the mortgage
becomes active.
(aa) Fees payable
Fees payable to brokers and agents in respect
of the sale of mortgages are recognised in the
Income Statement within “fee and commission
expense” as incurred.
(ab) Acquisition of mortgage portfolios
Premia paid on the acquisition of mortgage
portfolios are held within “other assets” and
amortised over the estimated economic life
of the underlying asset. Where such
mortgage portfolios are acquired as part of a
company purchase, the amortisation charge
is included within “administrative expenses”.
Where such mortgage portfolios are acquired
as a result of a specific asset purchase, the
amortisation charge is deducted from
“interest and similar income”.
(ac) Incentives to customers
Cashbacks, interest discounts and other
incentives to customers are amortised 
against “interest and similar income” over the
early-redemption clawback period of these
products commencing from the date of
completion. Unamortised incentives are held
within “prepayments and accrued income”
and “other liabilities”.
(ad) Provisions for bad and doubtful debts
Provision is made at each Balance Sheet date
for all reasonably foreseeable losses that are
believed to exist at that date in the portfolio
of loans and advances to customers.
Speciﬁc provisions for residential lending are
created on a case-by-case basis. The potential
shortfall is calculated from the outstanding
mortgage debt plus costs of repossession less the
estimated property value with a discount
valuation factor for forced sale. The potential
shortfall for each case is adjusted to reﬂect the
probability of loss. This adjustment reﬂects
historical performance except for specialist
lending where, because this area of lending is not
yet mature, probabilities of loss are predicted by
reference to the credit scoring system.
Speciﬁc provisions for the commercial
portfolio are calculated on all cases which are
three or more months in arrears. A probability
of loss, dependent on the severity of the
arrears, is applied on a case-by-case basis.
The speciﬁc provision for properties in
possession is based on the contracted/agreed
sale price or sale valuation, with adjustment
for expenses of sale and income from
insurance policies.
Loans and advances are written off where
there is no realistic prospect of recovery.
General provisions are raised to cover losses
which are judged to be present in total loans
and advances at the Balance Sheet date, but
which have not been identiﬁed in speciﬁc
loans. The general provision also takes into
account the economic climate in the market
and the level of security held.
Interest charged to all residential and
commercial loans which are in arrears or in
possession, and where the interest is expected
to be irrecoverable, is suspended and no longer
credited to “interest and similar income”.
(ae) Debt securities held
Debt securities intended for use on a
continuing basis in the Group’s activities are
classiﬁed as investment securities and are
stated at cost as adjusted for the amortisation
of any premia or discounts arising on
acquisition; these are amortised to “interest
and similar income” over the period to
redemption on a level yield basis. Provision is
made for any impairment in value. Each
investment in a structured investment vehicle
(‘SIV’) is individually reviewed to ensure the
accounting treatment is appropriate. Where
the SIV is considered to have minimal
management discretion, the Group recognises
its share of the SIV’s underlying assets and
liabilities. In other cases the investment in the
SIV is treated as a debt security. Interest on
these vehicles includes a margin above the 47 BRADFORD & BINGLEY ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2005 WWW.BBG.CO.UK
coupon rate to reﬂect proﬁts earned by the
underlying investment.
(af) Debt securities in issue and 
capital instruments
Debt securities in issue are stated at cost as
adjusted for the amortisation of any premia or
discounts arising on issue; these are amortised
to “interest expense and similar charges” over
the period to redemption on a level yield basis.
Premia or discounts on capital instruments are
amortised over the period to the instruments’
maturity at a constant rate and included in
“interest expense and similar charges”. The
unamortised amounts are added to or
deducted from the relevant liability. In the
event of early repayment, the unamortised
issue cost is charged immediately to “interest
expense and similar charges”.
(ag) Off-balance sheet ﬁnancial instruments
The Group uses off-balance sheet ﬁnancial
instruments for hedging purposes to reduce
the risks arising on transactions entered into in
the normal course of business, and the income
or expense arising from these off-balance
sheet ﬁnancial instruments is recognised in the
Financial Statements in accordance with the
accounting treatment of the transactions being
hedged. The effectiveness of this hedging is
reviewed on a regular basis.
Where an off-balance sheet instrument is
terminated prior to the termination of the
underlying hedged transaction, any proﬁt or
loss realised upon the early termination is
deferred and matched against the income or
expenditure arising from the underlying
hedged transaction over the remaining period
of the hedged transaction. If the underlying
hedged transaction is extinguished or
terminated, the remaining unamortised gains
or losses on the hedge are recognised
immediately in the Income Statement.

All segments are continuing except Retail non-core.
(a) In order to analyse net interest by business segment, a transfer price is applied to the internal funding or liquidity requirement of each segment. Interest rates used for transfer pricing have
been determined to retain the interest rate risk within Treasury & Reserves. Costs have been assigned to each segment based on resources consumed. Transfer pricing in respect of mortgage
origination by the Retail segment has been determined on the basis of market rates for such activity.
(b) Restructuring costs of £7.9m (2004: £ 1 4.6m) and compensation costs of £38.7m (2004: £37.1m) have not been allocated across business segments since they are the consequence of
Group level decisions.
(c) Assets and liabilities have been allocated to Lending and Retail on the basis of the regulatory capital framework. The segments are not allocated capital during the normal course of business,
therefore segmental proﬁts do not relate to these net assets. The other signiﬁcant unallocated items are deferred and current tax.

* estimate to be ﬁnalised in 2006
A Monte Carlo simulation model is used to determine the Performance Share Plan fair value as the arrangements include market-based performance conditions and to assist in assessing an
appropriate expected vesting period for the Executive Share Option Scheme. For other share schemes a Black-Scholes methodology is used to value options.
The expected volatility of share price applied in the option pricing models is based on historic Bradford & Bingley plc share price data over a period equivalent to the expected life of the
scheme or since the date of ﬂotation (4 December 2000) if shorter.
Awards granted under the Executive Incentive Plan are granted based on performance in the preceding ﬁnancial year. The performance criteria include qualitative elements which are not
determined until the award date i.e. after the end of the relevant ﬁnancial year. The grant date therefore occurs after the employees to whom the award is made have begun providing services.
In accordance with IFRS 2 the grant date fair value is initially estimated for the purposes of recognising the services received during the period between service commencement date and grant
date. The fair value is then revised once the actual grant date has been established.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the year was £3.2722 (2004: £2.9276).

The tax charge for 2004 shown above excludes a £2.8m credit representing the tax on minority interests (non-equity) as under IAS 1 2 this is required to be offset against the minority interest
rather than included within the tax charge on ordinary activities.
The 2005 foreign taxation includes a charge of £6.9m (2004: credit of £0.3m) in respect of previous periods.
The 2004 total current taxation charge includes a credit of £ 1 0.4m relating to restructuring and compensation costs.
The 2004 loss on sale of discontinued operations is shown net of a taxation credit of £3.1m (see note 8).

Earnings per share is calculated using the number of ordinary shares as follows:

Dilutive effect of ordinary shares issuable under Company share schemes 1.5 1.3
Diluted weighted average number of ordinary shares 628.7 625.6
The diluted weighted average number of ordinary shares is calculated by assuming that all shares which could be issued as a result of existing share options and other share-based payment
arrangements are in fact issued. Issuance of these additional shares would have no material impact on the Group’s earnings.
Shares acquired by employee share trusts, which are deducted from equity shareholders’ funds, have been excluded from the calculation of earnings per share as they are treated as if they are
cancelled until such time as they vest unconditionally to the employee.

A “special purpose vehicle” (‘SPV’) is a structure comprising one or more legal entities, set up to act as a trust for debt investors, with the aim of obtaining
ﬁnancing outside the regulatory capital of the Group. The rights of mortgages are transferred to the SPV, which operates under a Trust Deed to distribute

(a) Pension Schemes
The Group operates two deﬁned beneﬁt pension schemes, the Bradford & Bingley Staff Pension Scheme (‘the principal scheme’), and the MarketPlace
Pension Scheme, both administered by trustees, and both closed schemes. The funds of these schemes are independent from those of the Company.
The normal pension age of employees in the schemes is 65.
The Group also operates a deﬁned contribution scheme, the Bradford & Bingley Group Pension Plan. The funds of this scheme are independent from those
of the Group. The Group and Company had no liabilities or prepayments associated with the deﬁned contribution scheme at the year end (2004: Nil). The
cost to the Group of the deﬁned contribution scheme was £ 1.4m (2004: £2.7m) and the cost to the Company was £ 1.1m (2004: £2.0m).
(b) Other post-retirement beneﬁts
The Group provides healthcare beneﬁts to some of its pensioners. The healthcare beneﬁts are provided through a post-retirement medical scheme
into which the Company contributes 1 00% towards the cost of providing medical expense beneﬁts for members who retired before 1 January 1 996
and 50% for members who retired after this date. The total number of members of the scheme as at 31 December 2005 was 579 (2004: 61 6).
Private medical costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of a qualiﬁed actuary.
(c) Accounting treatment
The Group accounts for post-retirement beneﬁt costs in accordance with IAS 1 9 (amended) issued in December 2004. The full net actuarial deﬁcit is
carried on the Group and Company Balance Sheets, and actuarial gains and losses are taken to the Group and Company retained earnings rather
than being charged or credited in the Income Statement. The actuarial loss recognised in the Group and Company retained earnings during the year
was £26.0m (2004: £ 1.4m).
In respect of pension schemes, more than one employing Group entity contributes to the schemes. As there is no contractual agreement or stated
policy for charging the net deﬁned beneﬁt cost to individual Group entities the net deﬁned beneﬁt cost is recognised in the Financial Statements of
the Company (being the sponsoring entity) while other individual Group entities, in their individual Financial Statements, recognise a cost equal to
their contributions payable for the period.

In determining the expected long-term return on plan assets the Company considered the current level of expected returns on risk-free investments (primarily government bonds), the
historical level of risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns on each asset class. The expected return for
each asset class was then weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the expected long-term return for the portfolio.
The principal assumptions made on life expectancy were for active members to use PA92 Base rated down by 3 years and for retired members PA92 Base unadjusted.
Assumed healthcare cost trend rates have an effect on the amounts recognised in staff costs. A one percentage point change in assumed healthcare

29. Provisions continued
Empty leasehold premises
The empty leasehold premises provision relates to properties which as at the Balance Sheet date were no longer used for trading but were subject
to a lease agreement. The provision is based on either known or forecast future rental expenditure; the rental payments are due to be made during
the period 2006 to 2020.
Compensation claims
Compensation claims relate to potential payments to customers for business written in the past by the Group’s independent advisory business. The
provision is calculated on the basis of a reasonable estimate of the size and expected timing of claims. Notwithstanding this, external factors such as
the performance of the stock market and market agitation could inﬂuence both the size and timing of payments.
Restructuring costs
Other restructuring costs relate to redundancies and contract terminations which had occurred by the Balance Sheet date. The provision represents
amounts expected to be paid in 2006. It also includes a provision for an insurance premium to cover the professional indemnity liability associated
with businesses disposed of during 2004; the liability will run off over the next ﬁve years.
Pension review
The pension review provision has been established to cover compensation payable in connection with phases one and two of the pension review and
also a review of free-standing additional voluntary contributions. The provision represents an estimate of the amount to be expended during 2006.

On 29 May 2002, £ 1 50m (£ 1 48.5m net of expenses) of 6.462% guaranteed, non-voting, non-cumulative, perpetual preferred securities, Series A were issued through Bradford & Bingley Capital
Funding L.P ., a Jersey-based Limited Partnership. These securities are not subject to any mandatory redemption provisions and qualify as Tier 1 regulatory capital; they are redeemable by the issuer at
its option on 2 June 2032 and on each ﬁfth anniversary thereafter. They have a ﬁxed coupon and, if not redeemed in 2032, the coupon will be reset at a rate equal to the sum of the relevant ﬁve year
benchmark gilt rate plus a margin of 2.3% per annum. The Group is not obliged to, and will not, make any payments to the holders of the preferred securities other than those to which the holders of
these securities are entitled under the terms of the preferred securities. At 31 December 2004, under UK GAAP , these instruments were classiﬁed as “minority interest” and carried at £ 1 48.6m (being
£ 1 50.0m less unamortised issue costs), but in 2005 they are classed as “other capital instruments” as under IAS 32 they are deemed to form part of the Group’s liabilities. Interest incurred in 2005 in
respect of these securities was £9.7m (2004: £9.7m minority interest charge).

The Company has one class of shares; ordinary shares of 25p each, ranking equally in respect of rights attaching to voting, dividends and in the event of a winding-up.
Bradford & Bingley Proﬁt Sharing Scheme
In March 2002, employees entitled to the Group bonus could elect to receive shares under the rules of the Bradford & Bingley Proﬁt Sharing
Scheme. This scheme operated a trust fund known as the Bradford & Bingley Share Ownership Trust, under the control of independent trustees,
Computershare Trustees Limited. By leaving the shares in the Bradford & Bingley Share Ownership Trust for three years, employees did not have to
pay income tax and national insurance contributions on receipt of those shares. At 31 December 2005 the trustees of the Bradford & Bingley Share
Ownership Trust held no shares (2004: 585,567) on behalf of the employees (2004: on behalf of 1,656 employees).
Bradford & Bingley Employees’ Share Trust
On 3 October 2000 the Company established an offshore employee share trust, the Bradford & Bingley Employees’ Share Trust, for the purpose of
receiving monies and acquiring shares to be used in conjunction with any employee share schemes established by the Company. At 31 December 2005
the trustee of this trust, Mourant & Co. Trustees Limited, held 4,51 2,760 (2004: 5,51 0,361) shares to satisfy share awards and options which have 
been made or are to be made in accordance with the rules of the employee share schemes established by the Company. During 2005 the Company
provided £ 1,1 04,628 (2004: £803,290) for share purchases. The trust has waived in full its rights to receive dividends on the shares held except in
respect of the Executive Incentive Plan where dividends are received in full by the trust and distributed to the underlying beneﬁcial holders of the
shares. This trust currently holds shares relating to the Executive Share Option Scheme, the Performance Share Plan, the Executive Incentive Plan and
the Employees’ Restricted Share Bonus Plan which are detailed in note 5.
Long Term Incentive Plan
Under the rules of the 1 998 Long Term Incentive Plan it was possible for the participants to elect to take share options rather than their cash
entitlements. Awards were made under this plan on 1 2 December 2000, and 50 participants elected to take options over 353,744 shares exercisable at
the same time as the cash payments (40% immediately and two further equal tranches on the ﬁrst and second anniversaries). The options over shares
remained exercisable during the ﬁrst ﬁve years following the award date. At 31 December 2005 no shares remained under option (2004: 35,922). 73 BRADFORD & BINGLEY ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2005 WWW.BBG.CO.UK
32. Share capital continued
Executive Share Option Scheme
Grants of approved and unapproved share options were made under the rules of the Bradford & Bingley 2000 Share Option Scheme as detailed in
note 5. The shares are exercisable subject to the achievement of a performance target linked to an increase in the Company’s earnings per share.
The options over shares are exercisable over the period of three to ten years after the date of the grant. At the year end there were options
outstanding over 1,463,332 shares (2004: 2,642,1 76).
Sharesave Scheme
The Company operates the Bradford & Bingley 2000 Sharesave Scheme, an Inland Revenue approved, all-employee Save As Y ou Earn share option
scheme. Grants of share options under this scheme were made as detailed in note 5. The option prices represent a 20% discount to the market
price on the date of the grant. There were 1,421 three year and 61 5 ﬁve year savings contracts in place at the end of 2005 represented by a total of
3,273,764 shares under option (2004: 5,771,776). A further invitation to participate in the scheme will be issued in February 2006.
On 8 December 2000 the Bradford & Bingley Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust was established to acquire shares for employees, including
Directors, to satisfy options exercised under the Sharesave Scheme. At 31 December 2005 the Trust held a total of 1,690,490 shares (2004: 3,1 1 3,496)
to satisfy options which are expected to be exercised under the Sharesave Scheme. In respect of dividends arising from the shares held, the Trust has
waived its rights to all but 0.0001 pence per share. No funds to acquire shares were provided by the Company to the Trust during 2005 (2004: Nil).
Employees’ Restricted Share Bonus Plan
In April 2002 the Employees’ Restricted Share Bonus Plan was established to allocate shares to employees following the achievement of speciﬁed
performance measures. The shares will be released to the individuals in tranches annually in the three years following the allocation or on the third
anniversary of the award, depending on the conditions under which they were awarded, and subject to them remaining employed by the Company
on the anniversary dates. At the year end there were 223,1 45 share allocations outstanding (2004: 445,1 66).
Performance Share Plan
Shares were awarded under the rules of the Bradford & Bingley 2000 Performance Share Plan as detailed in note 5. The shares will be released to
the individuals after the end of the performance period subject to the achievement of a performance criterion which measures the performance of
the Company against a peer group of companies. The number of outstanding share awards at the year end was 2,084,082 (2004: 2,871,532).
Executive Incentive Plan
The Executive Incentive Plan 2004 was established to provide a replacement to the short and long term incentive plans for senior executives. The
short term element consists of a cash payment based on the achievement of pre-determined short term performance measures and an equivalent
amount of deferred shares that are held in trust for three years. Dividends receivable on the deferred shares are paid to the underlying beneﬁcial
owners of the shares. After three years the long term element of the scheme may be applied in the form of an additional award of matching shares
subject to earnings per share growth. Matching share awards will be made when compound earnings per share growth is between RPI plus 3% and
RPI plus 8%. The maximum number of matching shares will be three matching shares for each deferred share. At 31 December 2005 there were
341,990 deferred shares held in trust (2004: Nil). 74 BRADFORD & BINGLEY ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2005 WWW.BBG.CO.UK

The share premium reserve represents the excess of the consideration received for issued shares over the nominal value of those shares, net of transaction costs.
The capital redemption reserve was created on the sale of surplus conversion shares and to maintain the total amount of capital when shares were repurchased by the Company.
The available-for-sale reserve represents cumulative fair value movements on assets which are still held at the Balance Sheet date and are classiﬁed as available-for-sale.
The cash ﬂow hedge reserve represents cumulative fair value movements on derivatives which are still held at the Balance Sheet date and are effective cash ﬂow hedges.

37. Key sources of estimation uncertainty and judgements in application of accounting policies
In preparation of the Group’s and Company’s accounts estimates and assumptions are made which affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities; estimates and assumptions are kept under continuous evaluation. Estimates and judgements are based on historical experience,
expectations of future events and other factors.
Post-retirement beneﬁt obligations
The net deﬁcit in respect of post-retirement beneﬁt obligations is carried on the Balance Sheet. The value of this obligation is calculated by the
Group’s actuaries using the assumptions set out in note 28.
Share-based payment
The Income Statement charge in respect of share-based payment arrangements is based on the fair value of awards as at the date of grant. Further
details of the Group’s fair value methodology are provided in note 5.
Useful lives and residual values of property, plant and equipment and computer software
Property, plant and equipment and computer software are capitalised and depreciated to their estimated residual values over their estimated useful
lives. The depreciation rates are disclosed in the accounting policies notes 1(m) and 1(o).
Provisions
Details of provisions are shown in note 29.
Effective interest rate
Certain ﬁnancial instruments are accounted for on an effective interest rate basis, under which the income or expense associated with the instrument
is spread over the instrument’s expected life. On a quarterly basis, models are reviewed to re-assess expected life by portfolio of products, based
upon actual redemptions by product.
Fair values of ﬁnancial instruments
Certain ﬁnancial instruments are carried at fair value. Where a market exists, fair values are based on quoted market prices. For instruments which do not
have active markets, fair value is calculated using present value models; further detail of the methodology is provided in note 40(a).
Loan impairment
The Group reviews its loan impairment on a quarterly basis. Impairment models use historical loss experience to provide both probabilities of default
and property forced sale discounts across a portfolio of products. In addition management applies a risk weighted view on additional factors, such as
speciﬁc fraud cases.
38. Related party disclosures
The key management personnel of the Group and Company are the Company’s Executive and Non-executive Directors and senior managers. The
Group and Company have related party relationships with the key management personnel and with the Group’s pension schemes. In addition, the

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
40. Financial instruments continued
(a) Fair values of ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities continued
Fair value methodology:
Cash and balances at central banks: the fair value is their carrying amount.
Loans and advances to banks: the fair value is their carrying amount.
Loans and advances to customers: the fair value is estimated from expected future cash ﬂows, discounted at current market rate. The fair value is
shown net of impairment.
Debt securities: the fair value is their carrying amount.
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments assets and liabilities: the fair value is their carrying amount.
Other ﬁnancial assets: the fair value of shares in Group undertakings is derived from the market capitalisation of the Group; the fair values of most
others is their carrying amount.
Deposits by banks: the fair value is their carrying amount.
Customer accounts: the fair value is estimated from expected future cash ﬂows discounted at current market rates.
Debt securities in issue, subordinated liabilities and other capital instruments: the fair value is based upon quoted market prices in active markets or
discounted expected cash ﬂows using market rates applicable to the credit quality and maturity of the instruments.
Other ﬁnancial liabilities: the fair value is their carrying amount.
No ﬁnancial assets were reclassiﬁed during the year between amortised cost and fair value categories.
The carrying values of ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities which are categorised as “held for trading” and “at fair value through proﬁt or loss” were as follows:
Group Company
Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities
£m £m £m £m
Held for trading ----
At fair value through proﬁt or loss 46.1 - 62.5 -
”Held for trading” is a term used in IAS 39 and represents ﬁnancial instruments carried at fair value; the Group does not carry out trading activities or hold a trading book.
Set out below is a comparison of carrying values and fair values of certain of the Group’s ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities at 31 December 2004.
The Group does not undertake transactions for trading or speculative purposes. The table excludes certain ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities
which are not listed or publicly traded, or for which a liquid and active market does not exist. It therefore excludes items such as mortgages,
customer accounts and deposits with banks.

Where a market exists, market values have been used to determine the fair value of debt securities issued and held. Where no market exists, discounted cash ﬂow techniques have been used
to determine the fair value using market interest rates for the relevant assets. The fair values of off-balance sheet ﬁnancial instruments have been determined using market interest rates in
discounted cash ﬂow techniques. Fair values of interest rate caps and collars have been calculated using option-pricing models. 81 BRADFORD & BINGLEY ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2005 WWW.BBG.CO.UK

Deferred balances relating to settled derivatives and other ﬁnancial transaction provisions used as hedges will be released to the Income Statement in the same periods as the income and
expenditure ﬂows from the underlying hedged transactions. The above table shows the gains and losses on off-balance sheet derivative instruments used for hedging by the Group. The gains
and losses therefore do not represent absolute gains and losses expected by the Group as they will be substantially offset by corresponding losses or gains from on-balance sheet instruments.

(c) Interest income and expense on ﬁnancial instruments that are not at fair value through proﬁt or loss
During the year, total interest income and expense (calculated using the effective interest rate method) for ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities that
are not at fair value through the proﬁt or loss were:
Group
£m
Interest income 2,1 34.5
Interest expense (1,666.6)
(d) Hedging and hedge effectiveness
The fair values of hedges as at 31 December 2005 were as follows:
Group Company
£m £m
Fair value hedges - derivatives (84.8) (1 57.9)
Cash ﬂow hedges - derivatives 1 6.5 1 6.5
(68.3) (1 41.4)
The Group undertakes derivative transactions to hedge risk exposures, and manages risk by use of fair value hedges and cash ﬂow hedges. For those transactions which qualify and are
designated as fair value or cash ﬂow hedges, hedge accounting treatment is applied.
Fair value hedges are primarily used to hedge against changes in fair value of ﬁxed rate products due to movements in market interest rates. For the year ended 31 December 2005, the Group
recognised fair value gains of £ 1.1m, representing the ineffective portion of the fair value hedges.
Cash ﬂow hedges are used to hedge the risk of exposure to variability of cash ﬂows attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability, or a forecast transaction. Any
gains or losses on cash ﬂow hedges are recorded in equity until the hedged cash ﬂow occurs, whereupon they are transferred to proﬁt or loss for the period. As at 31 December 2005, net
gains accumulated in equity were £ 1 5.8m and the ineffective portion of those hedges was £Nil.
Hedge effectiveness is measured and assessed on an ongoing basis and was determined to be actually effective throughout the year. Changes in fair values and cash ﬂows of the hedged items
were almost fully offset by changes in fair values and cash ﬂows of the hedging instruments, and actual effectiveness was within a range of 80% to 1 25%. 82 BRADFORD & BINGLEY ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2005 WWW.BBG.CO.UK

(f) Nature and extent of risks arising from ﬁnancial instruments
The risks that the Group is exposed to and the Group’s approach to risk management are discussed in the Group Finance Director’s Review on pages
1 0 to 1 7. Risks are managed on a Group basis, and hence a description of risk management policies is not provided separately for the Company.
Financial instruments used by the Group for risk management purposes include derivative instruments. Such instruments are used only to limit the
extent to which the Group will be affected by changes in interest rates and exchange rates. As part of its responsibilities, the Group’s Asset and
Liability Management Committee (‘ALCO’) approves the use of speciﬁed derivative instruments within approved limits and business activities.
The Group does not undertake transactions for trading or speculative purposes, and consequently all of the Group’s derivative instruments are for
commercial hedging purposes. Hedge accounting is applied as appropriate, as detailed in the accounting policies note 1(x). The principal derivative
instruments used by the Group in managing its Balance Sheet exposures are interest rate swaps, interest rate options, interest rate futures, cross-
currency interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts. These are used to protect the Group from exposures arising principally from ﬁxed and
capped rate mortgage lending, ﬁxed rate savings products, deposit funding, foreign currency exposure and investment activities. The duration of
derivative instruments is generally short to medium-term and their maturity proﬁle reﬂects the nature of exposures arising from underlying business
activities. Substantially all of the Group’s derivatives activity is contracted with ﬁnancial institutions. 83 BRADFORD & BINGLEY ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2005 WWW.BBG.CO.UK

The Group hedges ﬁxed rate and foreign currency balances into sterling ﬂoating rates.
The Group regularly measures its exposures to a range of interest rate scenarios. Based on detailed underlying assumptions, at the end of 2005 the Group estimated the impact of a 1% fall in interest
rates as an improvement in its forecast net interest income of £4m over the course of the following 1 2 months.
A positive interest rate sensitivity gap exists when more assets than liabilities re-price during a given period. Although net interest income tends to
beneﬁt from a positive gap when interest rates are rising (and suffer a negative gap when rates are falling), the actual effect will depend upon a number
of factors, including the extent to which repayments are made earlier or later than the next reset or maturity date. The carrying amount of derivative
ﬁnancial instruments, which are principally used to reduce the Group’s exposure to interest movements, are included under the heading “non-interest
bearing”. The following tables analyse the re-pricing periods of Group assets and liabilities at 31 December 2005 and 31 December 2004:

(iv) Concentrations of risk
The Group operates primarily in the UK and adverse changes to the UK economy could impact all areas of the Group’s business. Loans and advances
to customers are all secured on property based in the UK. 49% of loans and advances is concentrated in the buy-to-let market. The Group has
investments in a range of debt securities issued by government bodies, banks and building societies, and in asset-backed securities, in both the UK
and overseas. 1 4% of the asset-backed securities are invested in UK mortgage-backed securities.
Customer accounts comprise investment and savings accounts held by customers. 1 4% of these were opened through Bradford & Bingley
International Ltd, the Group’s deposit taker on the Isle of Man. Debt securities in issue represent bonds, medium term notes and other debt
securities issued in a range of countries and currencies with no signiﬁcant investment by any individual counterparty. 88 BRADFORD & BINGLEY ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2005 WWW.BBG.CO.UK
The 2005 Financial Statements are the ﬁrst full
set of Financial Statements reported by the
Group and the Company under International
Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’). The
transition to IFRS has been accounted for in
accordance with IFRS 1 “First Time Adoption
of International Financial Reporting Standards”.
The 2004 comparative information contained
in these Financial Statements has been restated
from that presented in the 2004 Annual
Report & Accounts in accordance with IFRS.
IFRS 1 allows entities to apply IAS 32 “Financial
Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation” and
IAS 39 “Financial Instruments: Recognition and
Measurement” (the “Financial Instruments
Standards”) with effect from 1 January 2005,
and 2004 information need not be restated in
line with those standards. The effect of this is
described by means of preparation of a 
1 January 2005 Balance Sheet.
As such, this Appendix sets out the impact of
the transition to IFRS on:
• the Group Balance Sheet at 1 January 2004;
• the Group proﬁt for 2004;
• the Group Balance Sheet at 31 December
2004;
• the Group Balance Sheet at 1 January 2005;
• the Company Balance Sheet at 1 January 2004;
• the Company proﬁt for 2004;
• the Company Balance Sheet at 31 December
2004; and
• the Company Balance Sheet at 1 January 2005.
The impact of transition refers to three bases:
• UK GAAP Basis;
• Statutory Basis;
• Proforma Basis.
UK GAAP Basis: the UK GAAP Basis
information is extracted from the 2004 Report &
Accounts, reformatted to the IFRS presentation.
2004 Statutory Basis: the 2004 Statutory Basis
excludes the Financial Instruments Standards as
permitted by IFRS 1. Information on the 2004
Statutory Basis therefore forms the 2004
comparative information in the audited Financial
Statements on pages 37 to 87. The information
is presented in compliance with the Group’s
IFRS accounting policies applicable to 2004.
2005 Statutory Basis: as per the 2004
Statutory Basis but inclusive of the impacts of
the Financial Instruments Standards.
Proforma Basis (unaudited): the Proforma
Basis includes all elements of IAS 32 and IAS
39 with the exception of those sections
relating to hedging, hedge effectiveness and
fair value, i.e. the Fair value Adjustments as
deﬁned in note 1 4 below, which have been
accounted for under UK GAAP . This
Proforma Basis restatement is not required
for 2004 and is not audited; however, the
Board believe that this information is
necessary for a comparable assessment of
the Group’s and Company’s performance
between 2004 and 2005 accounting periods.
Further information regarding the transition to
IFRS and details of the Group’s and Company’s
IFRS accounting polices, are set out in note 1 to
the Financial Statements on pages 41 to 47.
Non IAS 32 and 39 adjustments
1. Consolidation of special purpose entities
The Group has securitised various residential
mortgage loans by sale or transfer to special
purpose structures which in turn have issued
securities to investors. The special purpose
structures have been consolidated into the
IFRS Group Financial Statements if they are,
in substance, controlled by the Group. This
consolidation is in accordance with SIC-12
“Consolidation – Special Purpose Entities”
and IAS 27 “Consolidated and Separate
Financial Statements”.
Under UK GAAP , the Group’s policy was that
certain special purpose structures were not
consolidated into the Group Financial
Statements line by line, but linked presentation
was used in accordance with Financial
Reporting Standard 5 “Reporting the
Substance of Transactions”; their mortgages
were shown as “Loans and advances to
customers subject to Non-recourse funding”
and their funding liabilities were shown as a
deduction from mortgages described as 
“Non-recourse funding”. Their net proﬁt
before tax was included within “Other
operating income”. Under IFRS, the mortgages
are included within “Loans and advances to
customers”, the funding is included within
“Debt securities in issue” and the net proﬁt is
split between the relevant income and
expense lines (principally “Net interest
income”, “Administrative expenses” and
“Impairment (loss)/credit”).
2. Post-retirement beneﬁt obligations
The Group has adopted the amendment to
IAS 1 9 “Employee Beneﬁts” issued by the IASB
in December 2004 which allows actuarial
gains and losses to be charged directly to
retained earnings.
The IFRS Balance Sheet at 1 January 2004
reﬂects the net deﬁcit on post-retirement
deﬁned beneﬁt obligations as at that date. The
adjustment to opening retained earnings (net
of an associated deferred taxation adjustment)
reﬂects also the reversal of the prepayment
and liability in relation to UK GAAP accounting
under Statement of Standard Accounting
Practice 24 “Accounting for Pension Costs”.
Adoption of IAS 1 9 caused an incremental
charge to the Income Statement for the year
ended 31 December 2004, less a related
taxation credit. In addition an actuarial loss less
related taxation credit was taken directly to
retained earnings during the year.
3. Share-based payment
Where equity instruments are granted to
employees as part of their remuneration
(including in respect of employee and
performance share schemes) a charge is
recorded in the Income Statement with a
corresponding increase in retained earnings,
in accordance with IFRS 2 “Share-based
Payment”. The charge is based on the fair
value of the instruments at the date of grant
and is spread over the period to vesting. As
permitted by IFRS 1, this expense is charged
only on options which were granted after 
7 November 2002 and which had not vested at
1 January 2005. Deferred taxation is provided
based upon the expected future corporation
tax deductions relating to share-based payment
transactions, and is recognised over the vesting
period of the schemes concerned. Under IFRS,
as at 1 January 2004 there is no need for 
share based payment UK GAAP accruals. The 
1 January 2004 UK GAAP corporation tax asset
is replaced by a share-based payment deferred
taxation asset.
4. Revenue recognition
IAS 1 8 “Revenue” requires that income from the
sale of certain investment and protection
products, which are generally received over a
four-year period, be discounted and spread and
the notional interest element of the income be
accounted for. This has the impact of reducing
debtor balances in the 1 January 2004 Balance
APPENDIX
TRANSITION TO IFRS Sheet, reducing provisions against these
balances and deferring income. Opening
retained earnings are reduced after taking
account of the related tax asset. Income before
taxation for 2004 is increased with an
associated additional taxation charge.
5. Dividends
IAS 1 0 “Events After the Balance Sheet Date”
requires that dividends declared after the year
end should not be recognised as a liability in the
year end Balance Sheet as the dividend does
not represent a present obligation as at that
date. Under UK GAAP , the year end Balance
Sheet includes an accrual for the ﬁnal dividend
proposed between the year end and the date
of approval of the Financial Statements. In the 
1 January 2004 Balance Sheet the proposed
ﬁnal 2003 dividend is not accrued under IFRS
and the amount of dividend deducted from
retained earnings during 2004 is lower under
IFRS than under UK GAAP .
6. Amortisation of goodwill
IFRS 3 “Business Combinations” requires that
goodwill is not amortised; instead it is subject to
an annual impairment review. As the Group has
elected not to apply IFRS 3 retrospectively to
business combinations which occurred prior to
1 January 2004, the UK GAAP goodwill balance
at 31 December 2003 has been included in the
1 January 2004 Group IFRS Balance Sheet. The
goodwill was disposed of in full during 2004
with the discontinued operations (as detailed in
note 8) and the loss on disposal of goodwill was
higher under IFRS due to the non-amortisation
during the year.
7. Deferred taxation
The scope of IAS 1 2 “Income Taxes” is wider
than the corresponding UK GAAP standards
and requires deferred taxation to be provided
on all temporary differences rather than just
timing differences. As a result, the Balance
Sheet at 1 January 2004 includes an additional
deferred taxation liability in respect of a 
rolled-over capital gain. The liability had
decreased by 31 December 2004.
8. Presentation of ﬁnancial statements
IAS 1 “Presentation of Financial Statements”
requires corporation tax and deferred taxation
balances to be shown on the face of the
Balance Sheet; under UK GAAP the Group
carried these balances within “Other assets”,
“Other liabilities” and “Provisions for liabilities
and charges”. IAS 30 “Disclosures in the
Financial Statements of Banks and Similar
Financial Institutions” requires separate
disclosure of gains less losses arising on debt
securities; under UK GAAP the Group included
these amounts within “Net interest income”.
9. Computer software
Under UK GAAP , all capitalised computer
software was included within “Tangible ﬁxed
assets” on the Balance Sheet. Under IFRS, only
computer software that is integral to a related
item of hardware should be included as
“Property, plant and equipment”. All other
computer software should be recorded as an
intangible asset. Accordingly, a reclassiﬁcation
has been made in the Balance Sheet as at 
1 January 2004 from “Property, plant and
equipment” to “Intangible assets”.
IAS 32 and 39 adjustments
1 0. Derecognition of ﬁnancial liabilities
In accordance with IAS 39 certain balances
which had previously been de-recognised
from the Balance Sheet under UK GAAP 
have been reinstated to the Balance Sheet.
This has the impact of increasing “Customer
accounts” at that date, net of provisions for
reclaims. Reinstating these balances gives rise
to a deferred taxation asset. The cost of 
re-recognising previously de-recognised
balances is removed from the 2004 IFRS
Income Statement.
1 1. Classiﬁcation of ﬁnancial instruments
The Group has issued securities, via a Jersey
based subsidiary, which qualify as “innovative”
tier 1 capital under the deﬁnition of capital
applied to UK banks by the Financial Services
Authority. Under UK GAAP , these securities
were accounted for as a “Minority interest”
within the Group Balance Sheet. Under IAS 32
it is reclassiﬁed as debt and transferred to
liabilities. This accounting change does not
affect the regulatory capital status of the
securities and they remain a part of the
Group’s tier 1 capital. Corresponding with the
change in Balance Sheet presentation, the cost
of this capital is reclassiﬁed as an interest
expense in the Income Statement.
1 2. Effective interest rate
IAS 39 requires that most income and
expenses arising from ﬁnancial assets and
ﬁnancial liabilities be accounted for on an EIR
basis. The EIR is the rate which at the outset
of the instrument exactly discounts the
relevant forecast cash ﬂows associated with
the instrument over the instrument’s
expected life back to the initial carrying
amount of the instrument. The forecast cash
ﬂows to be included are all incremental
receipts and payments, and under IFRS these
items are all considered to be part of the net
interest income or expense arising on the
instrument; under UK GAAP , some of these
ﬂows were considered to be non-interest, for
instance fee and commission income or
expense or administrative expense. Interest
income or expense in respect of the
instrument is recognised by applying the EIR
to the carrying amount. This has the impact of
increasing the carrying value of “Loans and
advances to customers” while UK GAAP
“Prepayments”, “Other assets” and “Other
liabilities” relating to loans and advances to
customers are released. Carrying values of
“Debt securities in issue”, “Subordinated
liabilities” and “Other capital instruments” are
reduced. The adjustments to reﬂect EIR give
rise to a net deferred taxation liability.
1 3. Loan impairment
Under IAS 39, UK GAAP provisions for
mortgage losses are replaced by “Loan
impairment”. Impairment is recognised only
where there is objective evidence that events
have occurred by the Balance Sheet date which
indicate that the loan assets in question are
impaired. This has the impact of decreasing the
carrying value of loan impairment/provision
compared to UK GAAP as at 1 January 2005
and decreasing deferred taxation assets. The
impairment charge for 2004 is increased
compared to UK GAAP , less an associated
taxation credit.
1 4. Fair value adjustments
Under IAS 39 certain ﬁnancial instruments,
including all derivatives, are carried at fair value.
Subject to the hedge accounting criteria in 
IAS 39 being met, the carrying value of hedged
items may be adjusted to mitigate volatility
caused by carrying instruments at fair value.

ShareGift Scheme
Many investors ﬁnd themselves owning parcels
of shares in quantities so small that it would
cost more to sell them than they are worth.
They may therefore be too small to do
anything with, but may still bring an additional
tax liability on any dividends paid and unwanted
annual reports and other documents.
Bradford & Bingley plc supports the ShareGift
scheme which is administered by The Orr
Mackintosh Foundation (registered charity
number 1 052686). Any shares that you donate
to the ShareGift scheme will be transferred
into the name of The Orr Mackintosh
Foundation, who will aggregate them, sell them
as soon as possible, and donate the proceeds
to a growing list of charities. Since ShareGift
was started in 1 996, millions of pounds have
been given to hundreds of different charities.
If you would like to participate in the ShareGift
scheme, or receive more information about
the scheme, they can be contacted by visiting
their website at www.sharegift.co.uk, by calling
0207 337 0501, or by writing to The Orr
Mackintosh Foundation, 46 Grosvenor Street,
London W1K 3HN.
Dividend mandates
If you have already elected to receive your
dividends directly into an account, you will
receive one consolidated tax voucher each
year. This will contain the taxation details of 
all dividends paid in that particular tax year.
Otherwise dividends will be paid to you by
cheque to the address held by the Registrar. If
you wish to have them credited to a bank or
building society account, you will receive a
form with the dividend payment enabling you
to do this.

Introduction
Welcome to Bradford & Bingley’s Corporate
Social Responsibility (‘CSR’) Report for 2005.
The purpose of this report is to cover in detail
our CSR programme, providing results and case
studies from the year.
B16163 CSR BROCHURE AW cover  24/2/06  16:39  Page 2 This report is Carbon Neutral
®
In order to minimise the environmental impact
of this report, Bradford & Bingley is working
with The Carbon Neutral Company to assess
and ‘offset’ the greenhouse gas emissions
created by the production and distribution of
the report. 1.73 tonnes of CO 2 will be
balanced by planting trees on Whitelee Moor
to absorb these emissions over time, making
this report Carbon Neutral
®
For more information on The Carbon Neutral
Company, visit www.carbonneutral.com
About our forest
Whitelee Moor is one of Britain’s most
important upland nature reserves. It’s spacious
and wild – home to blanket bog, heather
moorland, acid grassland and pockets of valley
fen. The lower slopes are home to moorland
birds such as red grouse and curlew, and birds
of prey including merlins, buzzards, peregrine
falcons and hen harriers use the area. For
hundreds of years, Whitelee has been grazed
but levels of stock are carefully controlled and
former drainage channels, or grips, are being
dammed to make sure the bog stays wet.
Future Forests’ goal for this project, along with
a few other funding organisations, is to create
an area of native broadleaved woodland with
access to visitors. In order to best manage the
site, the planting will be phased and consists of
several native species including birch, ash,
willow and alder. This ‘low impact’ approach
should allow native species of birds to inhabit
the forest. In all, the project will add trees to an
already stunning nature reserve and increase its
ability to soak up carbon emissions – and so
help protect the climate.
High up the Bateinghope Burn, near Buzzard
Crag, are two sets of limekilns, which burned
limestone from a nearby quarry and mine.
Further down the slopes you can see circular
stone structures, called stells, which provide
shelter for sheep in bad weather. A herd of
‘wild’ goats can sometimes be seen on the
border. The goats are in fact feral – they are
from domestic stock, but have been left to
roam wild for many centuries. One of the
moor’s most striking animals is the Emperor
Moth – its woolly caterpillars become bright
green as they grow, before pupating and
emerging as a spectacular day-ﬂying moth.
Directions 
From Jedburgh take the A68 towards Corbridge.
The site is on the right from Carter Bar down to
Catcleugh reservoir. The planting area is at the
south eastern corner near the reservoir. There is
access from the forestry track.

B16163 CSR BROCHURE AW cover  24/2/06  16:39  Page 3 Bradford & Bingley believes in placing
Corporate Social Responsibility
(‘CSR’) at the heart of our business
activities. This report aims to show
how we conduct business in a socially
responsible manner in respect of the
environment, staff, customers,
shareholders and local communities.
We continue to structure our CSR
reporting along the FORGE framework
for CSR Management and Reporting
for the Financial Services Sector. This
report follows the four major themes
identiﬁed by FORGE as being those
most relevant to ﬁnancial services
organisations – Marketplace,
Workplace, Community and
Environment. The FORGE Group is a
consortium of ﬁnancial institutions and
involves the British Bankers’ Association
and the Association of British Insurers.
Bradford & Bingley has published a
stand-alone CSR report for the last
two years and feedback forms an
important part of developing and
improving our CSR programme.
During 2005, we entered into
proactive dialogue particularly with the
investment community to improve
both our reporting and our CSR
programme, although we continue to
seek feedback from community and
voluntary groups, staff and customers.
1 BRADFORD & BINGLEY CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 WWW.BBG.CO.UK
We have received positive feedback on
our reporting, but we have been asked
to provide more information on Key
Performance Indicators (‘KPIs’). This
year, therefore, you will see an increase
in our results and reporting section.
This report continues to be published
on our corporate website,
www.bbg.co.uk, and we encourage
people to access the report online.
We also produce a limited number of
paper copies and, as in previous years,
both this report and our Annual
Report & Accounts have been 
made Carbon Neutral
®
through our
carbon offsetting programme with
The Carbon Neutral Company
(www.carbonneutral.com).
As part of our commitment to 
sharing best practice in the ﬁeld 
of CSR, Bradford & Bingley is a
national member of Business in the
Community (‘BITC’), and the 
London Benchmarking Group 
(‘LBG’). Throughout the year, senior
executives and board members have
taken part in Seeing is Believing tours
and spoken at BITC events.
Bradford & Bingley continues to be 
a member of the FTSE4Good Index
of socially responsible companies,
and participates in the Business in the 
Community Corporate Responsibility
Index. In 2005, Bradford & Bingley was
proud to be named as one of the top
1 00 “Companies That Count” in BITC’s
Corporate Responsibility Index.
Mark Stevens, Managing Director
Group Strategy, continues as the
executive responsible for the 
Group’s CSR programme, with 
overall accountability for the CSR
budget and line management of the
Group’s CSR Manager. Robert Dickie,
Group Operations Director,
continues as the Executive Director
responsible for the Group’s
environmental performance under his
responsibility for Group Property and
Health & Safety Management.
B16163 CSR BROCHURE AW  28/2/06  16:05  Page 1 2 BRADFORD & BINGLEY CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 WWW.BBG.CO.UK
2005 has been a very strong
year for Bradford & Bingley 
in terms of ﬁnancial
performance and I am
pleased to report that it has
also been a strong year for
our CSR performance.
In April, we were delighted to see that we 
had risen over 50 places in BITC’s Corporate
Responsibility Index and were ranked as one
of the top 1 00 “Companies That Count” in
BITC’s Corporate Responsibility Index which
was published in the Sunday Times. Indeed,
we have published our conﬁdential feedback
from the Index on our website to
demonstrate our commitment to disclosure 
of our CSR programme.
We were also awarded two ‘Big Ticks’ in BITC’s
Awards for Excellence; one for our work with
Shelter, and a collaborative action award for
our support of West Midlands Business Action
on Homelessness.
This external recognition is the end result of a
lot of hard work across the business as a whole.
We believe that CSR needs to form part of our
core business activities and needs to pervade
the business from board level to every front line
member of staff. I am particularly pleased,
therefore, that this year saw our ﬁrst product
related CSR activity when we teamed up with
Wallace & Gromit’s Children’s Foundation to
help promote our new children’s savings
account whilst also donating money for each
new account opened. We are looking at other
ways to integrate CSR into our product range
and we are planning to launch an
environmentally focused campaign in 2006.
GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S MESSAGE
Moving forward
Steven Crawshaw
GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE
B16163 CSR BROCHURE AW  28/2/06  16:05  Page 2 3 BRADFORD & BINGLEY CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 WWW.BBG.CO.UK
I continue to be impressed and challenged by
the desire for information on our CSR policies
from the investment community and media.
We are also seeing a growing interest in 
CSR from our customers, ﬁndings which are
backed up by the latest MORI survey which
states that 82% of customers believe it is
important that the companies they buy from
show a high degree of social responsibility
(Source: MORI CSR Survey 2005).
In view of this interest and following on from
feedback on last year’s CSR report, we have
continued to increase the amount of KPI data
available in the report.
Bradford & Bingley continues to be a major
lender in the social housing sector and, in
2005, we lent over £203 million in the lifetime
mortgage lending market, increasing our
market share to 1 9.4% (2004: 1 9.2%) whilst
continuing to be an active member of Safe
Home Income Plans (‘SHIP’).
Bradford & Bingley is a FTSE250 company,
employing over 3,000 staff and in 2005 we
have paid £ 1 09 million to shareholders in
dividends, £75 million in taxes and over £ 1 23
million in staff salaries and beneﬁts. These
employment opportunities, taxes and
dividends are all beneﬁts to the UK community
in addition to our CSR programme detailed in
this report.
On a personal basis I have continued to play
an active part in our CSR programme. I was
privileged to host a reception at the Institute
of Directors in October celebrating our
sponsorship of Shelter’s freephone housing
advice line. I shared the speaker’s platform
with David Ford, Shelter’s Director of Services
and Richard Wilson, the actor and long term
supporter of Shelter. I also believe that
Bradford & Bingley has an extremely important
role to play in supporting the community in
our West Y orkshire heartland and have
supported a number of these activities
throughout the year, more detail of which 
can be found in the Community section of 
this report.
I am also pleased that our CSR report has 
for the ﬁrst time been independently veriﬁed
by Bureau Veritas, who carried out our
environmental audit in 2004.
In a year that was marked by a number of
natural disasters around the world, I was struck
by the amazing response of Bradford & Bingley’s
staff, customers and suppliers to every appeal
that was made for aid.
The Indian Ocean Tsunami, the Pakistan
Earthquake and the food crisis in Niger all saw
massive levels of support from our staff,
suppliers and customers, not just ﬁnancially but
with offers of material goods and volunteering
time including some of our staff who manned
donation helplines.
Bradford & Bingley is a member of a group of
twenty banks and building societies that work
with Y Care International as their emergency
aid partner. Y Care International is the
international relief and development agency of
the YMCA and has faced an unprecedented
demand on its resources in 2005. During the
year, over £278,000 was raised for Y Care
International appeals alone.
We continue to review progress against our
goals for 2005 and set new goals for 2006:
Key Goals for 2005
• T o improve disclosure of our CSR
programme by increasing the information
available to the public
- Achieved. We are committed to public
disclosure of our CSR programme and
have made available on our CSR website,
our conﬁdential feedback from the
Business in the Community Corporate
Responsibility and Environmental Indices.
We have also continued to increase the
number of KPIs in this report.
• T o continue to support Shelter’s freephone
housing advice line (formerly known as
Shelterline), increasing the number of calls
to the helpline
- Achieved. Shelter’s freephone housing
advice line took its 450,000th call in
2005. We continue to offer support,
both ﬁnancial and through employee
and customer support.
• T o increase the number of departments
who are Carbon Neutral
®
- Achieved. In 2005, we increased the
number of Carbon Neutral
®
departments
from four to eight, adding Insurance
Marketing, Internal Communications,
Group Strategy, and I am pleased to say,
the Chief Executive’s Ofﬁce.
• T o continue to increase the percentage of
staff giving to charity via payroll giving
- Achieved. Through a well run
promotional campaign, we increased the
percentage of staff participating in our
payroll giving programme from 6% to 9%.
• T o increase the programme of support to
branches for local community involvement
- Partly Achieved. An increasing number
of branches take part in our community
support programme, but I still believe
that we can continue to play a fuller part
in our local communities and we shall
continue to focus on this aim in 2006.
Other Key Achievements in 2005
• Ranked 57th in the Sunday Times 1 00
“Companies that Count”
• Awarded two Big Ticks in Business in the
Community’s Awards for Excellence
• Improved performance in the Business in
the Environment Index.
Key Goals for 2006
• T o develop and set targets for the KPIs of
our CSR programme
• T o support the social and economic
regeneration of West Y orkshire
• T o launch further product initiatives with a
CSR element
• T o continue to increase staff involvement in
our CSR programme
• T o continue to support Shelter’s freephone
housing advice line, increasing the number
of calls to the helpline.
Bradford & Bingley has continued to develop its
CSR programme in 2005. I hope that this
report will help you to understand our activities
better and that you ﬁnd it of interest. I
encourage you to take the time to feed back
any suggestions or comments which will help
us make our programme even better.

property investors. The growth of buy-to-let
has increased the availability of rental housing
stock in the UK, making it easier for people to
ﬁnd affordable decent housing.
• Self-certiﬁcation; loans for individuals who have
complex income streams, including the self-
employed and those with more than one job 
• Lifetime; enabling customers over the age of
60 to gradually release the equity they have
built up in their main residence, to enhance
their lifestyle in retirement.
These products address some of the growing
concerns within the housing market in the UK
and products are sold under the Mortgage
Express brand, Bradford & Bingley’s specialist
mortgage subsidiary.
Mortgage Express is a market leading specialist
lender. It has the largest buy-to-let customer
base in the UK and in November completed its
6,000th lifetime mortgage. Over 30% of lifetime
mortgages sold through mortgage
intermediaries such as Independent Financial
Advisers (‘IFAs’) are Mortgage Express products.
Mortgage Express, as a market leader, publishes
authoritative reports on conﬁdence in the buy-
to-let market as well as economic outlook
reports. Both of these reports are published on
our www.mortgage-express.co.uk website.
In September, Mortgage Express celebrated its
1 0th anniversary as a specialist lender. During
the last decade, it has developed its product
range, increased market share and won many
industry awards and accolades.
The vision statement for Mortgage Express is a
clear one – to be the natural choice for
innovative mortgage solutions. Mortgage
Express is currently the leading buy-to-let
lender and plans to remain so. We also intend

Over the last twelve months
we have seen signiﬁcant growth
in our share price and ﬁnancial
returns. However, both of
these outcomes are driven by
our focus and philosophy for
doing business – ﬁnding what is
best for the customer.
Following our strategic refocus in 2004 
we now have two well established arms to 
our business:
• Lending: providing a range of residential
mortgages, secured commercial property
loans and loans to housing associations
• Retail: selling Bradford & Bingley’s own
savings products and a choice of other
ﬁnancial products through our branches and
direct channels.
Both of these arms have their own approach
to CSR but, signiﬁcantly, both have been able
to demonstrate their CSR credentials through
their range of products and services this year.
LENDING
Bradford & Bingley’s lending business develops
and manufactures a range of lending products
primarily secured on residential property. As a
company, we have made a policy decision not
to participate in the unsecured consumer
lending markets as we believe our underwriting
expertise is in secured lending.
Bradford & Bingley’s residential lending activity
focuses on a range of niche areas, providing
mortgages for individuals who need a more
specialist product than those available in the
mainstream market. Typical mortgages include:
to remain a major player in other specialist
markets such as lifetime and self-certiﬁcation.
We are pleased that lifetime mortgages are now
regulated by the Financial Services Authority
(‘FSA’) and Mortgage Express continues to be a
member of Safe Home Income Plans (‘SHIP’).
SHIP is the UK’s leading professional body for
equity release providers, launched in 1 991 and
dedicated entirely to the protection of
borrowers and promotion of safe home
income and equity release plans.
Mortgage Express observes the SHIP Code 
of Practice which has been welcomed by Age
Concern. As a member of SHIP , Mortgage
Express guarantees that borrowers cannot lose
their home – whatever happens to the stock
market or interest rates. More details about SHIP
are available on its www.ship-ltd.org website.
Mortgage Express’ lifetime product has a ﬁxed
rate for the duration of the mortgage term.
Interest is rolled up monthly and added to the
loan throughout the term. No monthly
repayments are required.
The loan is not payable until the death of the
last surviving borrower, or when the property
ceases to become the main residence, for
example, the last surviving borrower moves
into long term care. In addition, Mortgage
Express provides a no negative equity guarantee
which ensures that borrowers (or estate) will
never owe more than the value of the property.

Bradford & Bingley is in a good position to
operate in these niche markets as we
understand and mitigate risk levels because of
our long track record, good understanding of
the markets and their customers and strong
underwriting and collections skills. All
Mortgage Express lending is secured on UK
residential property.
In addition to these specialist loans, Bradford &
Bingley has a portfolio of traditional residential
mortgages, which are secured on UK residential
property. Little new business is currently being
written in this area as Bradford & Bingley sees
the development of its chosen niche areas to be
more beneﬁcial to the business and the
customer, meeting needs which are not well
served elsewhere. For traditional residential
mortgages we continue to offer loans ﬁnanced
by other banks and building societies which are
amongst the most competitive on the high street.
Bradford & Bingley also continues to be active
in commercial property lending and lending to
housing associations. The Commercial
Property lending division provides corporate
customers with loans secured by income-
producing property or pre-let development
schemes. Housing Association lending provides
funding to housing associations throughout the
UK. Housing associations are non-proﬁt
organisations that provide affordable rented
homes for people unable to satisfy their
housing needs in the open market.
We have provided loans to over 1 20 housing
associations, ﬁnancing nearly 1 00,000 social
rented homes throughout the UK. Bradford &
Bingley’s lending of £2.3 billion to the housing
association sector equates to over 7% of the
Group’s total mortgage balances.
RETAIL
Bradford & Bingley’s Retail business has two
main segments: Savings and Distribution.
Savings develops and sells Bradford & Bingley’s
competitive range of deposit based investment
products through our branch network, online
and via post/telephone. In August, we
launched two new savings accounts, FirstSave
and SmartSave, for children.
FirstSave, an instant access account for
children up to the age of 1 2, is an ideal
account for children to begin building up
savings for the future. SmartSave is also an
instant access account and is available for
young adults up to the age of 25.
FirstSave and SmartSave were launched in
association with Aardman Animations and
Wallace & Gromit’s Children’s Foundation. For
every new account opened, Bradford & Bingley
makes a £ 1 donation to the Foundation and in
2005 over £ 1 1,000 was donated. In addition,
the branch network sold a range of pin badges
provided by Wallace & Gromit’s Children’s
Foundation which raised a further £27,700 –
the highest amount ever raised by a pin badge
campaign at Bradford & Bingley.
The Wallace & Gromit’s Children’s Foundation is
a national charity raising funds to improve the
quality of life for children in hospitals and
hospices throughout the UK. The Foundation
funds an innovative range of projects to ensure
children in hospitals and hospices have a better,
brighter future. Created in 2003, the Foundation
has funded projects in 23 hospitals and hospices.
Bradford & Bingley’s relationship with Wallace
& Gromit’s Children’s Foundation will continue
into 2006 as the Group will take part in the
Foundation’s national fundraising and awareness
campaign, Wrong Trousers Day on 23 June.
More information about the campaign and 
the charity can be found at their
www.wallaceandgromitfoundation.org website.
The Retail business offers its customers a wide
choice of ﬁnancial services products through
the branch network and direct channels.
Bradford & Bingley has the UK’s leading
mortgage broking business and also offers a
wide choice of highly competitive products
from a range of providers including general
insurance, wealth and personal loan products,
which are provided by third parties.
Our association with Legal & General to
provide ﬁnancial advice has grown in strength
and depth throughout 2005. Legal & General
is a leading provider of Socially Responsible
Investment (‘SRI’) products and our customer
base has access to their range of investments.
Legal & General aims to monitor as closely as
possible the companies in which they invest,
and especially those in the FTSE 350, to
ensure that they are identifying, assessing,
managing and reporting on their social,
environmental and ethical (‘SEE’) impacts. This
involves conducting research on a company, or,
most commonly, all companies within a sector,
identifying the key risks and issues and assessing
how well the company is addressing them.
Research is based primarily on the Association
of British Insurers’ SEE disclosure guidelines and
their assessment of how particular companies
or sectors are performing. Legal & General also
refers to company CSR reports and websites,
analyses by FTSE4Good, the Dow Jones
Sustainability Indices, the Ethical Investment
Research Service (‘EIRIS’) and a number of
other publications in the course of research.
This level of research can give our customers
conﬁdence in the ethical and SRI funds offered
in Bradford & Bingley branches.

the needs of our customer base. We therefore
take our commitment to diversity seriously and
have a named Board Director, Robert Dickie,
responsible for diversity issues and reporting.
Women now occupy 45% of management roles
(2004: 44%) and 24% of senior management
roles (2004: 23%) within the Group. Although
Rosemary Thorne, Bradford & Bingley’s Group
Finance Director, left the Group on 
31 December 2005, we still have one female
Director, Louise Patten, representing 1 0% of 
the Board (2004: 22%).
Ethnic minorities occupy 5% of management
roles (2004: 7%) and 6% of senior management
roles. We have seen a slight drop in the number
of ethnic minorities employed in the workforce
(2005: 1 0%, 2004: 1 1%) but Bradford & Bingley
continues to support and work with Quest for
Economic Development (‘QED’). This is an
organisation supporting the South Asian
community within the UK, to ensure we have
robust and fair employment policies for all staff.
QED has helped to deliver cultural awareness
training and we are looking to continue this
during 2006. Bradford & Bingley worked with
QED to produce a series of training videos
aimed at assisting Pakistani and Bangladeshi
men and women in Y orkshire to become
economically active. The videos encourage the
taking up of jobs or self-employment, thereby
improving overall health and economic
conditions, encouraging education and
reducing crime in their communities.
We recognise that the well being of our
employees is vital to our business. We have
comprehensive policies agreed with the
recognised staff union (‘UBAC’) on Flexible
Working and Fair Treatment at Work. We
continue to offer the conﬁdential counselling

As an organisation,
Bradford & Bingley believes in
supporting and investing in its
staff. Doing the right thing in
the workplace therefore
means working with our staff
to ensure Bradford & Bingley
is a safe, diverse and
enjoyable place to work.
Our employment practices continue to reﬂect
the human rights standards enshrined in the
United Nations Universal Declaration of
Human Rights and the International Labour
Organisation Conventions and cover such
items as minimum working age, working hours,
health and safety and discrimination.
Diversity and Accessibility
As an employer of over 3,000 people and with
a presence across the UK, we understand
what diversity can bring to the business.
Our workforce should reﬂect the communities
in which we live and work and our employment
practices help us to deliver on this goal. We
promote diversity and equality across all aspects
of working life and we believe it is important to
share best practice and success. We provide the
opportunity for all staff to develop their skills
and knowledge and to enjoy fulﬁlling careers.
Bradford & Bingley is a member of the
Employer’s Forum on Disability, Employers
Forum on Age, Race for Opportunity and
Opportunity Now. These organisations look at
ways to promote awareness of disability, age,
race and gender within the workplace.
Bradford & Bingley recognises that a diverse
workforce gives the company a wider range of
service, provided free of charge to employees 
and their families, to enable discussion of any
issue affecting their lives at work or at home.
Our Flexible Working Policy is available to all
staff, not just those with children under six or
disabled children under eighteen, which is the
legal requirement. For Bradford & Bingley,
ﬂexible working incorporates a wide variety of
working practices.
From 1 October 2006, it will be unlawful to
discriminate on the basis of age in employment
and in preparation of the legislation we have
been working with the Employer’s Forum on
Age (‘EFA’) who are an independent network
of leading employers who recognise the value
of an age diverse workforce.Valuing people of
all ages within the workforce and regarding
them all as a sustainable resource is essential
for our future prosperity.
We provide prayer rooms at our main
operational sites for all our employees and
information on different religions and cultures with
dates of religious festivals and events is published
on our intranet site, helping to raise awareness
and understanding amongst all our employees.

Bradford & Bingley was awarded the ‘two ticks’
symbol by the Employment Service in June 1 995.
This publicises our commitment to people with
disabilities. Using the ‘two ticks’ symbol means
we are working towards the guidelines in the
Employment Service Code of Good Practice on
the Employment of Disabled People.
The symbol is used in our job advertisements
and on our job application form to make it
clear to potential applicants with a disability
that we welcome their application on the basis
of their abilities and we will interview all
applicants with a disability who meet the
minimum criteria for the role.
The symbol also demonstrates to all our
employees that we are serious about good
employment opportunities for people with
disabilities and signals to the business community
and the general public that the Group considers
making the most of its people a priority.
However, it is also important to back up 
this commitment by ensuring our products 
and services are accessible across all parts 
of our business.
We have induction loops in all branches 
and have improved wheelchair access and
introduced power assisted doors across the
branch network. Bradford & Bingley also
provides sign language and manual interpreting
services in conjunction with the Royal National
Institute for the Deaf (‘RNID’) and offers
RNID’s Typetalk service. We have undertaken
further Typetalk training and will continue to
do so throughout 2006.
Bradford & Bingley is also committed to ensuring
accessibility across our product range and we
continue to provide customers with literature in
different formats, such as Braille, audio and large
print. Our corporate and customer facing
websites were also relaunched in 2005, having
undergone accessibility audits by the Royal
National Institute for the Blind (‘RNIB’) to ensure
the websites are as user friendly as possible.
In support of our accessibility work, we have
extended our sponsorship with RNIB of the
Braille version of Money Matters, RNIB’s money
advice magazine, for a further year.
Occupational Health & Safety, Business
Continuity and Security
Bradford & Bingley has a legal and moral
responsibility for the health and safety of its
staff and members of the public where they
are affected by its business.
Bradford & Bingley carried out a thorough
review of all Health & Safety, Business
Continuity and Security policies in 2005.
The three areas were amalgamated under a
new Head of Health & Safety, Business
Continuity and Security who instigated a Group
wide training programme, entitled “A safe
workplace is everyone’s responsibility.”
The Group’s Health & Safety Policy Statement
was updated and a full copy was issued to
every branch and department. In it, Bradford
& Bingley undertakes to do the following:
• Comply fully with relevant health and safety
legislation as it applies to Group activities
• T o provide healthy and safe working
conditions and ensure work activities are
undertaken so as to minimise any risk
• Ensure health and safety is a consideration
in all business decisions therefore becoming
an integral part of the management of 
the Group
• Provide information, training, instruction
and supervision to ensure a satisfactory level
of health and safety competence of its staff
• Monitor and review health and safety
performance within the organisation and
develop strategies for its continual
improvement
• Consult and liaise directly with staff and 
the recognised staff union (‘UBAC’)
representatives to ensure effective
communication and co-operation on 
health and safety matters
• Provide a central advisory unit to support
management of health and safety
responsibilities across the Group
• Provide sufﬁcient resources to meet the
objectives set out in this Policy Statement.
This Policy Statement is reviewed by the Board
of Directors every 1 2 months.
T o help meet the objectives set out in the
policy statement, Bradford & Bingley has
established a clear and simple structure for
managing health and safety which identiﬁes 
the roles and responsibilities everyone has 
in ensuring a safe place of work. This was
communicated to all staff through an online
training session. In addition, staff with line
management responsibilities attended a 
half-day workshop to reinforce the learning
messages and line management duties.
Robert Dickie, Group Operations Director,
is the nominated member of the Board of
Directors responsible for Health & Safety and
chairs the Group Health & Safety Committee.
Bradford & Bingley consults with its staff,
management and UBAC on health and safety
matters through the Group Health & Safety
Committee. The work of the committee is
supported by three speciﬁc Health & Safety
forums; one for the retail branch network, one
for the central locations in Bingley and
Crossﬂatts and one for Mortgage Express.

• Escalate critical health and safety issues to
Bradford & Bingley’s Executive Committee
• Provide an annual report to the Board on
the management of health and safety across
Bradford & Bingley.
Each Health & Safety Forum’s terms of
reference (within the area of responsibility
represented at that forum) are as follows:
• Monitor the implementation of Bradford &
Bingley’s Health & Safety Policy, its safety
organisation and arrangements
• Implement Bradford & Bingley’s strategy for
the promotion of a positive health and
safety culture across the Group
• Receive and review reports from forum
members and discuss and decide on suitable
actions where appropriate
• Monitor the delivery of health and safety
training, information and supervision
• Assess the effectiveness of the management
of health and safety through the review of
management information such as incident
reports, accident data, near misses, absence
rates, etc.
• Monitor the level of compliance with

results and recommendations
• Receive and review reports from Enforcing
Authorities and act on recommendations

• Provide a report to the Group Health &
Safety Committee on the management of
health and safety within the area of
responsibility represented at that forum.
In addition, a dedicated Health & Safety
Advice Line was set up for any member of
staff to request information or advice from the
Health & Safety Team. This was made
accessible by telephone, fax or email.
In November, a Near Miss Campaign was
carried out across the whole of Bradford &
Bingley. A near miss is an incident that could
cause injury or damage but fortunately does
not. Collecting details of those incidents can
help us identify and eliminate the cause before
the problem escalates and someone gets hurt.
The campaign used eye catching posters 
and was also run through the Group’s 
intranet. It was designed to ensure that all 
staff understood the importance of reporting
near misses and hazards before they result in
an accident.
The campaign was a great success, both in
increasing the number of near misses reported
and in the value of those reports. Some quite
potentially serious issues were reported and
remedial action taken.
The process of reporting was simpliﬁed as all
staff had to do was report a near miss via the
dedicated Health & Safety Advice Line. The
Group Health & Safety team then co-
ordinated any action that was needed to
resolve the incident or provide advice on
action the staff member could take.
During the past year, we have revised and
updated our arrangements for managing an
incident of kidnap or extortion. This involved
putting in place improved prevention measures
and response procedures.
Work continued on the ongoing review of 
the effectiveness of the Group’s general
security measures in bank branches which
resulted in the lowest ever incidence rate 
for raid and robbery, with only three branches
being involved in such an event over the last 
1 2 months.
In 2006, Bradford & Bingley will be delivering a
Stress Management Plan and Road Risk
Management Plan together with associated
training across the Group.
In addition, we are currently in discussions
with Bradford Council Environmental Health
regarding the establishment of a formal Lead
Authority relationship with them. This is an
arrangement where we can agree various
policies with them locally thus ensuring
consistent interpretation across the country.

Staff representation & share ownership
The staff union UBAC has sole recognition
rights with all parts of Bradford & Bingley to
negotiate matters relating to staff terms and
conditions of employment, including pay and
contractual negotiations. All employees are free
to join UBAC, and currently 52% are members
(2004: 46%). UBAC is an independent trade
union in accordance with the Trade Union and
Labour Relations Act 1 974.
We continue to encourage employees to
beneﬁt from the Group’s success through share
schemes. Currently, 39% of employees hold at
least one Sharesave account (2004: 52%),
enabling them to save over a period of years
with the prospect of buying Bradford & Bingley
shares at a discount.
Staff survey and feedback
We are committed to ensuring that we create
a safe working environment which encourages
openness, honesty and mutual respect, and
where colleagues can constructively challenge
and ask questions.
T o encourage this, we again ran our staff
opinion survey which was carried out in
September, giving all staff an opportunity to
feed back in conﬁdence their views and
opinions of Bradford & Bingley. The survey 
was available to complete either online or 
on paper.
Staff were given a range of attitudinal questions
to answer under eight section headings:
• Direction and Communication
• Working at Bradford & Bingley
• Training and Development
• Company Culture
• Customer Focus and Quality
• Management
• Pay and Beneﬁts
• Overall
The survey contained 66 questions, the
majority of which were of the Likert format,
i.e. presented in the form of statements with
which staff could agree or disagree on a four
point scale. The results were then assessed
against the ETSM3 benchmark score.

our sponsorship and this is now our longest
running community investment partnership.
In 2005, Shelter ﬁnalised its internal review of
services and the Shelterline name was retired
and the service was brought under the main
Shelter logo. The service is now known purely
as Shelter’s freephone housing advice line but
now acts as the gateway to the majority of
Shelter’s services.
Despite this increased remit, we have
continued to work with Shelter to ensure that
their service is a preventative one rather than
a reactive one. Last year, the percentage of
preventative calls remained constant at 63%
(2004: 64% 2003: 40%).
We continue to support Shelter in other, non-
ﬁnancial, ways as well as our sponsorship. In June,
we launched Shelter’s Summer Sizzlers campaign,
where we asked 50 celebrities to choose their
favourite summer holiday read, and then donate
a signed copy to Shelter. These signed books
were then used as prizes to encourage the public
to donate their own summer holiday books to
be resold in Shelter branches. Over 1 00 Shelter
shops and Bradford & Bingley branches took part
in the campaign, acting as collection points for
the public’s donations.
In addition, staff at our Crossﬂatts and Barnet
Head Ofﬁce locations held collections and
donated over 700 books between them. In
total, the books donated helped raise
thousands of pounds for Shelter as well as
generating much local media interest.
Launched in 1 998, Business Action on
Homelessness (‘BAOH’) is a unique partnership
between leading businesses, homelessness
agencies and the Government. BAOH aims to
break the vicious cycle of no job, no home,
through helping homeless people to ﬁnd
employment and achieve independent living.
Bradford & Bingley is a national member of
BAOH, and our Group Chief Executive sits on
the BAOH executive forum.
At a regional level, we are on the steering
group of West Midlands Business Action on
Homelessness helping to deliver a number of
programmes and projects across the region.
Ready for Work is the key programme run by
BAOH. Working closely with local homelessness
organisations, BAOH identiﬁes people who are
‘ready for work’ but perhaps lack conﬁdence or
have been out of the workplace for a long time.
Homeless clients are given the opportunity to
re-enter the job market, gain professional
training, a minimum of two weeks work
placements, ongoing job coaching and a
support network. Prior to the placements, the
clients attend workshops run by businesses
and the homelessness agencies which help
build conﬁdence and personal interaction skills.
Bradford & Bingley has run a number of these
courses in the West Midlands and provided the
venues for courses in Y orkshire during 2005.
Following the success of the New Shefﬁeld
Employment Bond in 2004, Bradford & Bingley
agreed to become trustees and registrars in
another initiative, the Shefﬁeld Investment
Bond which Shefﬁeld Council are promoting
to their staff across the city.
The Shefﬁeld Investment Bond, run by charity
Citylife, will support vital work across the City
of Shefﬁeld. The money raised will support
not-for-proﬁt initiatives working to help those
in debt in Shefﬁeld, providing face-to-face
money advice, affordable loans, help with debt
restructuring, teaching ﬁnancial literacy and
supporting credit unions who encourage
savings and provide even lower interest loans.
At present there is waiting list of over two
months just for a ﬁrst appointment but the
money from the Bond will enable more families
to be supported. Further details can be found
at the www.shefﬁeldbond.org website.
Supporting charities and organisations
throughout West Y orkshire
Bradford & Bingley was formed in 1 964 from
the merger of Bradford Equitable Building
Society and Bingley Building Society and as
such, we still have a strong association to
Bradford and the Aire Valley region of West
Y orkshire where Bingley can be found.
During 2005, we continued to strengthen our
links with many community groups across
West Y orkshire and increased the portfolio of
grass roots sports projects that we support.
These projects were supported with a mix of
ﬁnancial support and employee involvement,
both inside and outside of work time. The staff
at our two head ofﬁce buildings, in Bingley and
Crossﬂatts, voted on a choice of charity for the
year and picked the Paediatric Unit at Airedale
Hospital. Throughout the year, staff organised
dress down days, rafﬂes, a gala dinner and
many other fundraising activities which raised
over £5,500 for the Paediatric Unit.
We added a third school in Bingley to our
reading volunteer scheme. Bradford & Bingley
sends volunteers into the schools to spend
time reading on a one-to-one basis with pupils
over a ten week period. During this time we
have seen reading ages improve dramatically
and, crucially, the improvement is maintained.

Our Community Action Teams have 
continued to encourage and co-ordinate
employee involvement across Bingley and
Crossﬂatts and also at Mortgage Express in
Barnet, Hertfordshire.
The two teams consist of staff from across all
functions of the business and a representative
from the Community Affairs team. Each team
meets on a monthly basis to consider requests
from local charities and community groups and
makes small grants of about £300 on average.
During 2005, 87 charities received funding in
the Bingley and Barnet areas.
The biggest project that the Bingley
Community Action Team took on in 2005 
was funding the set-up and launch of a 
new youth club for the Bingley area, run in
association with Bingley Methodist Church and
West Y orkshire police. Because of our support
of the Bradford Bulls community programme
we were able to take along the Superleague
trophy, which Bradford Bulls Rugby League
Club had just won.
Bradford Bulls is just one of the sports
organisations whose community or grass roots
programmes we support. During the past
twelve months we have entered into, or
renewed, agreements with Bradford City
Football in the Community, Bradford Bulls
Foundation, Y orkshire Lawn Tennis Association
and Y orkshire County Cricket Club.
Our partnership with Y orkshire County
Cricket Club saw Michael Vaughan, the
England cricket captain, launched the Bradford
& Bingley Indoor Cricket Centre and Indoor
Cricket Leagues. Over 3,000 school children
visit the centre each year and the centre runs
courses at evenings and weekends, as well as
hosting nine Bradford & Bingley Indoor Cricket
Leagues for ages from under 9s to adults. The
partnership between Y orkshire County Cricket
Club and Bradford & Bingley will aim to
highlight minority cricket and will place
particular emphasis on disabled, black, ethnic,
and women’s cricket by forming specialist
leagues and encouraging other cricket related
activity in the centre.
Bradford & Bingley is also pleased to support
its namesake, Bradford & Bingley Rugby
Football Club who are based in Bingley.
Bradford & Bingley RFC is a semi-professional
rugby union team who play in National
Division 3 North. This year, we helped to fund
a new 250 seater stand which we ofﬁcially
opened at the ﬁrst home game of the season.
However, the largest project that we
announced in West Y orkshire was our
partnership with the National Museum of
Photography, Film & Television (‘NMPFT’) in
Bradford. The NMPFT is the most visited
national museum outside London, attracting
nearly a million visitors each year.
In October 2005, The NMPFT announced that
Experience TV, a new £3 million interactive
gallery exploring the world of television, would
open in Summer 2006 with the support of
funding from Bradford & Bingley.

As well as allowing the Museum to display a
substantial part of its world class television
collection – in some cases for the ﬁrst time –
Experience TV will allow visitors to walk into a
replica studio and ﬁnd out how television is
made, as well as trying their hand at reading
the news or presenting the weather.
From John Logie Baird’s original apparatus to a
Jim’ll Fix It badge, Experience TV will contain
many of the objects that make up the story of
TV. Important televisions and studio cameras will
sit alongside the likes of Wallace & Gromit and
the Play School toys – reunited with their
famous windows – to create the only gallery of
its kind in Europe with hundreds of objects from
NMPFT’s collections on display. The production
zone will include a working quiz show set,
demonstrating everything from studio lighting
effects to vision mixing, while a virtual studio will
allow visitors to ﬁnd themselves in various
scenarios that reﬂect modern TV techniques.
Employee involvement
Bradford & Bingley continues to support
employee involvement, in particular, through
supporting their fundraising activities.
All employees are able to apply for funds to
match their own fundraising efforts for charity
in a scheme which matches the ﬁrst £250 of
funds raised per employee. During the year,
85 employees received matched funding
(2004: 1 47) totalling £ 1 9,1 51. (2004: £26,908).
Although this is a decrease from 2004, it
should be remembered that staff levels were
lower in 2005 compared to most of 2004.
Bradford & Bingley also matches employee
donations through the payroll-giving
programme, Give As Y ou Earn. We continued
to promote the scheme to new and existing
employees via online and internal promotions
and have seen an increase both in take up and
the amount donated. We now have 9.6% of
our workforce donating via Give As Y ou Earn
(2004: 8.8%) and have set ourselves a target to
increase this to 1 0% in 2006. Bradford &
Bingley matched £74,628 of all employee
donations (2004: £65,900).
Our branches continue to raise funds for local
community groups and again a special mention
should be made of Margaret Carlyle the
branch manager at Stockport. Not content
with being the highest fundraiser of 2004, this
year she arranged for the Managing Director of
Retail to take part in a ‘Jail & Bail’ event, where
he was held in handcuffs until he had raised
over £3,000 for Christie’s Against Cancer.
Overall contributions from employee involvement
rose to £326,871 (2004: £226,406) and we
expect more opportunities to arise in 2006.

St Basils is the largest charity outside
London working with young people who
are homeless or in danger of homelessness.
We try to take a holistic view of the
problem not only providing accommodation
but also family mediation, employment and
education services, and with our Schools
Training and Mentoring Programme
(‘ST aMP’) we are taking our message that
homelessness should never be a accepted
part of growing up to the next generation.
We also participate in the Ready for Work
scheme run by Business Action on
Homelessness. We have found Bradford &
Bingley to be valuable partners in this
scheme, as they provide valuable training
and support to our clients who are
preparing to re-enter employment.
T o do all this costs money and we rely on
charitable donations to provide more than
£500,000 each year. T o keep up this
income it is vital that we communicate
well with all our donors. Quality is a key,
when our newsletter hits the doormat or
desk it will be competing for attention
with glossy catalogues, full colour
brochures and offers of everything from
holidays in the sun to cheap loans.
Bradford & Bingley help us to compete by
printing our quarterly newsletter for us,
with full colour cover and high quality gloss
paper we can look as good as everyone
else, without the expense. Here is another
example of Corporate Social Responsibility
at work; making a difference to the future
of thousands of young people who might
otherwise struggle.

in the environment
In 2005, Bradford & Bingley
built on the work carried out in
our independent environmental
audit of 2004 to deliver
increased environmental
performance and disclosure.
In preparation for the EU Accounts
Modernisation Directive, we have worked with
Trucost, an independent environmental research
organisation to identify the Environmental Key
Performance Indicators relevant to Bradford &
Bingley. T o do this, we have worked from the
consultation document Environmental Key
Performance Indicators – Reporting Guidelines
for UK Business published by the Department of
Environment, Food & Rural Affairs in 2005.
Following this analysis, we are reporting for the
ﬁrst time on climate change (CO
2
emissions)
and waste (amount and percentage recycled).
In addition to this, we continue to report and
comment on the following areas we have
identiﬁed as being signiﬁcant issues to 
Bradford & Bingley.
WASTE MANAGEMENT
The main waste streams produced by Bradford
& Bingley consist of general ofﬁce waste,
conﬁdential paper waste and IT equipment.
In 2005, we have reported on a weekly basis
the amount of waste generated and the
percentage recycled. In 2006, we have set a
target for 65% of our waste to be recycled.
Conﬁdential waste is collected by Hays Secure
Destruction where it is shredded. It is then sent
to Kimberley Clark where it is turned into pulp
and then into toilet paper. In an example of
true recycling we now use Kimberley Clark to
supply toilet paper at all our central locations.
In addition to the conﬁdential waste, there are
procedures in place to recycle paper, plastic
cups, toners, metals, IT components and
mobile telephones at central locations, whilst
our branches recycle toners, IT components
and mobile telephones.
CLIMATE CHANGE &
ENERGY CONSUMPTION
Principle uses of energy include heating,
lighting and air conditioning.
Mowlem Technical Services are in the second
year of a three year facilities management
contract for Bradford & Bingley. Energy
management forms part of the service, which
is being delivered nationally via a team of
mobile engineers checking on site controls and
consumption measured centrally.
This year we have carried out analysis on our
energy consumption per employee. Following
advice from The Carbon Neutral Company
(formerly known as Future Forests) we initially
set a target of 3 tonnes of CO 2 per employee
from energy consumption. We have achieved this
target for the last four years so we will be looking
at this target in 2006 to see if it is still realistic.
We will also be looking to widen the scope of
climate change reporting to include transport.

B16163 CSR BROCHURE AW  28/2/06  16:05  Page 14 WATER
All water supplied to Bradford & Bingley sites
is from mains supply. Water consumption is
measured and calculated on an annual basis
using meter readings.
Water conservation measures have been put
in place in central facilities to help reduce
water consumption.
We have also analysed our water consumption
on a usage per employee basis. We note that
water consumption is now higher per head
than it was in 2003 but will conduct further
analysis during 2006 to investigate this. Whilst
overall consumption is falling, in 2006, we are
targeting a further decrease in our overall
consumption but are keeping a target of 1 4m
3
water usage per employee. We will also carry
out a benchmarking exercise against other
ﬁnancial services companies to compare their
water usage per employee.
TRANSPORTATION
For 2005, we have publicly reported our
business mileage for the ﬁrst time. We will
examine trend data for 2006 before we
consider setting future targets.
We have changed from a company car scheme
to a car ownership scheme for staff who need a
car for business use. Under the car ownership
scheme, the cost of a car is calculated according
to its whole life cost instead of just a two or
three year initial cost. This has meant that cars
with strong residual values cost signiﬁcantly less
to staff and encourages the purchase of cars
with efﬁcient fuel consumption ﬁgures.
The scheme has been introduced as part of
the Supply Chain Development Programme
and aims to improve cost effectiveness, offer
greater ﬂexibility, as well as giving personal
choice to participating staff.
The Group’s video-conferencing facilities
continue to be in high demand and reduce the
number of journeys between West Y orkshire
and London for meetings.Video-conferencing
has also been used for an increasing number 
of external meetings in 2005.
We have introduced a shuttle bus service
between our Bingley and Crossﬂatts Head

Hockerton 
Housing Project
The Hockerton Housing Project (‘HHP’) is an
innovative residential sustainable development
in the village of Hockerton near Southwell,
Nottinghamshire. It has been designed as one
of the ﬁrst zero energy residential systems in
the UK reducing life cycle energy to a
minimum and are amongst the most energy
efﬁcient, purpose built dwellings in Europe.
Maximum use of benign, organic and recycled
materials has been made in the construction
and the development is designed to be, to a
large extent, self-sufﬁcient. The houses are
earth covered and have passive solar heating
without a space heating system. A wind
turbine and photovoltaic system provide all of
the energy required to run the homes. The
water and sewage system is self-contained.
The homes consist of a terrace of ﬁve single
storey dwellings which are earth-sheltered at
the rear, such that the ground surface slopes
and blends smoothly into the ﬁeld at the
back. Each house is 6m deep with a 1 9m
south-facing conservatory running the full
width of each dwelling. A repeated modular
bay system of 3.2m in width was used for
ease of construction. Most of the internal
rooms have 3m high French windows that
open to the conservatory. Those rooms that
are not so dependent on natural light, such
as utility and bathing areas, are located
towards the rear of the homes.
The development is located on a ten hectare
site that was previously essentially agricultural.
The large area has allowed incorporation of
features that enable the occupants to live in a
sustainable and self-sufﬁcient way. This
includes crop cultivation and the rearing of
small animals. It has also allowed for large
water catchment for the homes and waste
disposal via a reed-bed system.
In response to increasing visitors, a new
learning resource centre has recently been
constructed by project members, which
includes a dedicated audio-visual room,
seminar facilities and permanent exhibitions.
The building itself is built to similar high
environmental standards as the homes,
including meeting the zero heating and 
zero CO 2 standards. It also receives most 
of its energy from a second wind turbine
recently installed.
HHP provides school visits for National
Curriculum Key Stage 2 pupils and 
Bradford & Bingley has funded a programme
of visits in 2005, as well as funding the
development of the associated Resource
Pack which provides teachers with a
summary of all the activities and links to 
the National Curriculum. This partnership 
is to be further developed in 2006 to 
deliver the education projects to Key Stage
3 & 4 pupils.

of journeys between the two buildings and we
have continued to run a lunchtime bus service
for staff from our location in Crossﬂatts, West
Y orkshire to local shopping centres.
In 2006, we are launching a car sharing 
scheme in conjunction with Bradford District
& Metropolitan Council.
PROCUREMENT AND
SUPPLY CHAIN
Bradford & Bingley continues to work in line with
the Financial Services Purchasing Forum (‘FSPF’)
collaborative environmental best practice
principles. This document, developed by the
ﬁnancial industry, outlines six purchasing principles
consistent with environmental best practice.
Bradford & Bingley’s progress against these six
principles is detailed on page 23 of this report.
With around a thousand suppliers, accounting
for an annual cost of approximately £ 1 70
million, Bradford & Bingley has now introduced
a new Procurement Policy, which became
effective in September 2005. The policy
balances the need for line management
responsibility and accountability with the
beneﬁts derived from a Group approach to
procurement. Under the policy, the Group has
collated information on all its suppliers in
relation to environmental policies and ethical
working practices in order to develop a
supplier risk proﬁle. It also ensures that the
supplier risk proﬁles are visible to Bradford &
Bingley and managed at the appropriate level.
Printing managers Williams Lea purchase print
services on behalf of Bradford & Bingley. All
products purchased are derived from
sustainable managed forestry (plantation crop).
PROPERTY DESIGN AND
MANAGEMENT
Bradford & Bingley continues to incorporate a
number of environmental criteria into its
programme of branch refurbishments. Detailed
speciﬁcations for refurbishment works include:
• energy efﬁcient design and operation of
comfort cooling and air conditioning systems
• recycled vinyl or bitumen backed carpet 
tiles used instead of vinyl backed tiles
manufactured from new, where polyvinyl
chloride (‘PVC’) would have to be used in
the manufacturing process
• energy efﬁcient high frequency ﬂuorescent
lighting 
• wood and wood products purchased from
sustainable forestry.
CARBON NEUTRAL
®
Bradford & Bingley continues to see Carbon
Neutral
®
as a positive way to offset the
Carbon emissions from our business.
Our goal of making more departments
Carbon Neutral
®
in 2005 was achieved when
we made the Insurance Marketing, Internal
Communications and Group Strategy
departments Carbon Neutral
®
to add to the
CSR, Investor Relations, Public Relations and
Housing Finance Departments who were
already Carbon Neutral
®
.
In a sign of his commitment to leadership in this
area, Bradford & Bingley’s Group Chief
Executive also made his ofﬁce Carbon Neutral
®
.
We continue to use the Carbon Neutral
Company (formerly known as Future Forests)
as our partner for the programme of tree
planting to offset the carbon emissions.
PERFORMANCE AND TARGETS
Following feedback from stakeholders, we are
now starting to set performance targets in the
ﬁeld of environmental performance. We also
review existing targets to ensure relevance.
Our targets for 2005 relating to our
environmental policy were:
• Improve staff awareness of 
environmental issues
Achieved. By using the Group’s intranet we
provided information to staff on Bradford &
Bingley’s environmental performance and
gave suggestions how individual members of
staff could help improve our performance.
In addition, we set up an internal email
basket for staff to send in their suggestions
and a number of suggestions have been
taken forward
• Encourage feedback of staff suggestions to
improve environmental performance
Achieved. As detailed above, the use of the
email basket has seen an increase in the
number of staff suggestions
• Assess new branch design to measure
reduction in energy consumption
In progress. The new branch design roll-out
programme has only taken place in a small
number of branches. Trend data is still being
developed to determine how much more
efﬁcient the new design is
• Identify and assess key performance
indicator data trends
Achieved. We have started to report on
KPIs per employee to give a better
indication of trends and are looking at
setting performance targets 
• Work with Group Internal Audit to agree
a formal audit process
Achieved. Internal Audit are now carrying
out Health & Safety and Environmental
audits at branches across the Group when
they carry out the ﬁnancial audits.
Targets for 2006 are:
• 3 tonnes of CO 2 generated by energy use
per employee
• 65% of waste recycled
•14m
3
of water usage per employee
• T o launch an employee car sharing scheme
and encourage use
• T o identify further performance targets
• T o identify further opportunities for carbon
offset schemes.

local to our business operations 
• Setting targets for environmental
improvements, reporting on the results

CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT

VERIFICATION STATEMENT
Bradford & Bingley has commissioned Bureau
Veritas to conduct this independent assurance
of the Corporate Social Responsibility (‘CSR’)
Report for 2005.
The overall aim of the statement is to provide
independent assurance to stakeholders that 
the information provided by Bradford & Bingley
in its CSR Report is accurate, reliable, objective
and reﬂects the material corporate
responsibility issues and performance of
Bradford & Bingley business activity.
Responsibility of Bureau Veritas
Bureau Veritas’ obligation is to readers of this
report. Bureau Veritas is responsible exclusively
for the contents of this statement which has
been published in full by Bradford & Bingley.
Bureau Veritas has not been involved in the
preparation of any material included in the
CSR Report.
Scope
The scope of assurance was determined after
discussion with Bradford & Bingley and provides
an evaluation of whether the information in the
2005 CSR Report is supported by underlying
objective evidence. This included a review of
the report against the requirements of the
AA1 000 Assurance Standard in terms of
materiality and completeness.
Bureau Veritas used a 1 0% sampling approach
for all factual statements in the CSR Report.
The sample was chosen from a material risk
based perspective.
Fifty per cent of performance data relating to
the KPIs in the Results section of the report has
been veriﬁed. Bureau Veritas conducted
interviews, documentation reviews and data
collection system reviews to gather evidence
regarding factual statements and quantitative
performance data contained in the CSR Report.
Bradford & Bingley provided access to head
ofﬁce records and data required to undertake
the assurance process and Bureau Veritas is
conﬁdent that no material has knowingly 
been withheld.
Excluded from our work are activities 
outside the reporting period unless stated in
the report, and statements of opinion, belief
or aspiration.
In addition to this statement, an internal
report was produced for Bradford & Bingley.
This provides further detail of the ﬁndings of
our review summarised in this statement.
Opinion of the veriﬁer – Bureau Veritas
We are satisﬁed that Bradford & Bingley’s 
CSR Report for 2005 provides a fair and
accurate representation of the corporate
social responsibility activity for the period 
1 January to 31 December 2005 for data
(unless otherwise speciﬁed in the report) 
and that there are processes in place for
identifying, managing and understanding CSR
risks and opportunities within the business.
There are no signiﬁcant omissions which 
could affect stakeholders’ ability to make
informed judgements on Bradford & Bingley’s
performance.
Key highlights and improvements noted in
the reporting process
During the course of our work, we have
identiﬁed the following:
• Bradford & Bingley showed a clear
commitment to CSR throughout the
business. CSR has strong leadership and
support at a high level through indirect
Board reporting at the business strategy
level. As a result, the degree of
embeddedness in the business is impressive.
• Bradford & Bingley are in their second
reporting year and have already made good
headway in identifying their key material
risks. However, they should consider
formally mapping these risks across the
organisation in subsequent years.
• Bradford & Bingley demonstrated an
innovative approach towards identifying 
and implementing CSR opportunities
throughout the organisation and work
proactively with a number of external
organisations to improve performance.
Areas for ongoing improvement
• Few formal meetings exist that bring
together all CSR drivers within the business.
Whilst this does not seem to hinder CSR
activity, such a meeting could act as a useful
means by which to capture additional CSR
activity and to prioritise existing activity in a
more consultative manner. This would also
enable a greater degree of documenting of
CSR roles, responsibilities and actions.
• Although CSR data is collected throughout the
year by various people in the business, there is
no review of performance throughout the year
and no co-ordination of data until year end.
Bradford & Bingley could consider using the
formal meetings described above to review
performance throughout the year and
implement more formal data collection systems.
• Bradford & Bingley have made good
progress with engaging the SRI stakeholders
of the business, however other stakeholder
engagement is limited. Whilst the ﬁnancial
services sector does not have such diverse
stakeholders as other sectors, the example
of SRI engagement should be replicated
with other stakeholder groups throughout
the business.
• Bradford & Bingley should consider making
greater use of design in the report to present
information on KPI performance and results
to allow readers to obtain a more detailed
picture of performance improvements.

London Benchmarking Group 
Membership Statement
Bradford & Bingley plc continues to be an
active member of the London Benchmarking
Group (‘LBG’). The LBG is a group of over 60
companies, working together to improve the
management and measurement of their
community programmes.
The LBG focuses on the voluntary contributions
of a company to society, encouraging as
accurate, quantitative and complete an account
as possible. LBG members agree to apply the
LBG measurement model and share their
ﬁndings with other members. Many also use the
model in their public reporting. The model
applies consistent methods for valuing a
company’s inputs to community programmes,
including cash, time and ‘in kind’. It also examines
the programmes’ outputs and longer term
impacts. The LBG deﬁnes three broad motives
for corporate community involvement and
encourages companies to be transparent about
them, recognising that commercial and
community beneﬁts can co-exist. LBG members
take a conservative approach to measurement,
preferring to underclaim than overclaim.
LBG members share experience in using the
model and continuously improving it. The group
is facilitated by The Corporate Citizenship
Company, with a steering committee drawn
from LBG members to determine policy. The
model is explained in two workbooks, and
communicated via regular meetings and a
website at www.lbg-online.net

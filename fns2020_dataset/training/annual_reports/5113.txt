Financial highlights 
Continued growth in total revenue per seat up 5. 1% (3.3% at constant currency), following 
strong growth in the prior year (up 4. 1% at constant currency) driven by the strength of the easyJet 
network and good underlying consumer demand
Passenger numbers up 7 .9% to 48.8 million and load factor increased by 1.5ppt to 87 .0% 
Reported profit before tax of £154.0 million delivered ahead of our original guidance, this 
includes £27 .3 million of costs resulting from volcanic ash disruption. Total impact of the volcano, 
including lost contribution, estimated to be £57 million
Improvement in margins as underlying profit before tax

 increased by £144.6 million to 
£188.3 million, primarily driven by a unit fuel cost reduction equivalent to £122.7 million
Disruption costs have had a significant impact on the financial results with a £97 .9 million 
increase versus the prior year. £27 .3 million volcano related, £20.8 million snow related and  
£49.8 million of costs (wet leasing and other costs, mainly EU2004/261 related), as a result of  
Air Traffic Control (ATC) strike action and easyJet’s operational difficulties over the summer
Total underlying cost per seat
1
 (excluding fuel and currency movement) up 5.2% mainly driven 
by disruption costs. Excluding the impact of additional disruption costs, underlying cost per seat
1
 
(excluding fuel and currency movement) rose 2.2%
Continued strong cash generation, net cash flow from operations improved by £228.9 million 
to £363.4 million. Gearing fell from 37 .6% to 31.8%
Return on equity increased to 8.6% from 5.5% as easyJet delivered both capacity growth 
and margin improvement
Note 1: Underlying measures exclude £27.3 million of cost relating to the volcanic ash cloud and £7.0 million loss on disposal of A321 aircraft in 2010 and £11.0 million 
profit on disposal of A321 aircraft in 2009. 
Note 2: Return on capital employed is calculated by dividing normalised operating profit after tax by average net debt plus average shareholders’ equity.

Annual report and accounts 2010 100%
In the past year, easyJet delivered a considerably improved financial result 
as pre-tax profit increased by £99.3 million to £154.0 million despite 
some significant challenges. External factors such as the disruption 
to European airspace due to the eruption of the Eyjafjalla volcano, 
unprecedented levels of snow disruption and high levels of ATC industrial 
action have combined with some operational problems to make this past 
year an exceptionally tough one. 
easyJet’s continued strong performance in the face of major disruption is 
a tribute to the professionalism and commitment of all of easyJet’s people 
and the Board and I would to thank them for their efforts which are very 
much appreciated.
The Board and strategy
Carolyn McCall OBE and Chris Kennedy joined the easyJet Board in July 
of this year as Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer, respectively. 
Both bring significant experience in operational roles within consumer 
facing businesses and the Board and I are delighted to be working 
alongside them as they take easyJet forward.

easyJet plc
Annual report and accounts 2010 As Carolyn outlines in her Chief Executive’s review, she has over the past 
few months concluded a review of the business. Whilst it is clear from 
the operational issues experienced this summer that the business had 
lost focus on some of the basics, the financial results demonstrate that 
easyJet continues to make progress against its goal of delivering market 
share growth and improving returns thus underlining that easyJet’s 
business model and strategy are sound. Carolyn and Chris will provide 
the Company with a leadership and focus that will ensure improved 
execution of the strategy going forward and a renewed focus on 
customers and the engagement of our people.
easyJet is strongly positioned to take advantage of the continuing 
profitable growth opportunities in European short-haul aviation. This 
growth, combined with the margin improvement through a tight focus 
on costs and accessing new revenue opportunities, means that easyJet 
is poised to continue the strong operating cash generation of the past 
few years. Consequently, the Board now feel that the time is right to 
set in place a formula to trigger a dividend payment in years when 
the Company is profitable whilst at the same time ensuring that the 
Company remains prudently financed with a strong, liquid balance sheet. 
This will ensure that shareholders are able to benefit directly from the 
Company’s success as easyJet continues to take market share.
Brand licence
On 1 1 October 2010, your Board announced that easyJet, Sir Stelios 
Haji-Ioannou and easyGroup had agreed, subject to independent 
shareholder approval, to a variation of the licence agreement providing 
for the Company’s use of the easyJet brand and to remove the rights 
granted to Sir Stelios to appoint himself Chairman and to easyGroup to 
appoint Board Directors. The Board believes that the revised agreement 
better aligns the interests of easyJet shareholders and the licensor and 
that it is beneficial to end the uncertainty caused by this long running 
dispute and enables the Company to move forward.
Industry regulation 
The aviation industry plays a central role in global wealth creation and in 
the UK alone it contributes £1 1 billion to GDP. However, this does have 
an environmental impact. Aviation contributes 2% of global man-made 
greenhouse gas emissions and we know it is important that our industry 
addresses its wider responsibilities, in particular to ensure that we play 
our part in tackling climate change. 
However, if this is done through purely constraining demand the 
economic and social benefits of travel will be put at risk. It is therefore 
critical that the right policy framework is put in place to deliver 
sustainable aviation, allowing continued growth while putting emissions 
on a downward trend. This means creating a framework that drives 
airlines to use existing aircraft more efficiently but which also ensures 
airframe and engine manufacturers bring forward the next generation 
of aircraft as soon as possible. We also need to ensure that air travel 
taxes are not blunt, ineffective taxes on passengers such as APD in the 
UK, but emissions based taxes that are designed to encourage airlines 
to minimise their impact upon the environment. 
The regulatory framework that easyJet operates in is crucial, as alongside 
ensuring that we can operate in a safe environment, it has a significant 
effect on both our cost base and the opportunities available for future 
growth. We are working across Europe to persuade governments and 
the European Commission to deliver regulation that provides stability, 
is sensible and allows us to compete fairly.
Conclusion
This is my first year as Chairman of easyJet and I am delighted to have 
taken over the Chairmanship of a company which has achieved so much 
since it started 15 years ago. I look forward to working with the whole 
team at easyJet to continue to unlock the Company’s potential.

Annual report and accounts 2010 Our people make a difference
I have been truly impressed by easyJet’s people. Our front line cabin crew 
and pilots are highly trained and committed. Their warmth and focus on 
passenger care helps create a connection with our customers which 
makes us a more popular and successful airline and they need to be 
recognised for this. Our engineering, management and administration 
teams are equally important to the success of the business and I’d like to 
thank the whole team at easyJet for their commitment and hard work 
over what has been a very tough year in the airline industry. 
Taking a fresh look at the business
Over the past couple of months the senior management team has 
conducted an end to end review of the business. We have examined all 
of the assumptions that underline our business plan. We have looked 
carefully at the broader market in which we operate and the trends that 
will challenge us and provide us with opportunities.
Our conclusion is that the business model and strategy is delivering for 
customers and shareholders. We have a unique network which will 
enable us to expand in Europe as our routes and low fares  
are attractive to customers.
Market place review 
We see clear opportunities for easyJet to continue to take market share 
as charter traffic continues to decline, as weaker short-haul carriers 
retrench or fail and as new infrastructure capacity comes on stream. 
Low cost carrier penetration across Europe is expected to increase as 
several major markets including France, Switzerland, Italy, Netherlands 
and Portugal see the penetration of low cost carrier traffic increase to 
around 50% in line with that now seen in the UK and Spain.
Passenger growth in the European short-haul market is expected to 
continue at between 3% and 4% per annum, with the majority of the 
growth in point to point business and leisure travel.
Around 200 carriers currently compete in the European short-haul 
aviation market and the top five players, including easyJet, account for 
around 60% of seats flown with the rest of the market being highly 
fragmented. The average growth of the market over the past 20 years 
or so has been 4.5% per annum. In the past year, overall capacity in the 
European short-haul market grew by 4.2%.
easyJet is the only pan European short-haul carrier with a significant 
position in major airports and operates the leading network in European 
short-haul aviation measured by presence on the top 100 routes. 
Our network not only ensures that easyJet is well positioned to capture 
leisure traffic but also will enable easyJet to continue to build its share 
of the £18 billion per annum European short-haul air travel market.
Whilst we anticipate that the European short-haul market will continue 
to grow, the industry is clearly cyclical and profitable opportunities for 
expansion will not be linear. Therefore flexibility in fleet planning will be 
key in order to seize strategic opportunities when they emerge whilst 
not putting excess capacity into uneconomic markets. Consequently, 
easyJet has built flexibility into its fleet planning arrangements that 
means that its growth rate in terms of seats flown can be flexible and 
dependant on the opportunities available and economic conditions.
Introduction
This is my first Chief Executive’s review at easyJet and I am proud to be 
leading a company that has achieved so much in the past 15 years. 
easyJet was born out of the liberalisation of European aviation by 
'Open Skies'. It has been a true industry innovator pioneering the use 
of the web and low cost air travel centred around a transparent pricing 
model. Post 9/1 1, easyJet took bold strategic moves that have been the 
foundation of the Company’s present day success including the initial 
entry into primary airports such as London Gatwick. Over the past five 
years, easyJet has grown from a UK centric airline to develop a significant 
presence in mainland Europe built around valuable positions at slot 
constrained airports. 
The strength of easyJet’s business model, which is centred around 
offering low fares to convenient airports, is reflected in the performance 
of the past year. easyJet has delivered a robust financial result against 
a difficult backdrop. Reported pre-tax profit grew by £99.3 million to 
£154.0 million driven by a strong revenue performance as total revenue 
grew by 1 1.5% to £2,973.1 million. Return on equity grew by 3.1 
percentage points to 8.6%. easyJet also generated significant positive 
cash flows in the period with cash and money market deposits at  
30 September 2010 totalling £1,171.9 million (30 September 2009: 
£1,074.9 million). 
Since I joined the Company in July, my priorities have been to spend 
as much time as possible out in the network with our people to 
understand their perspective on the business; the mitigation of the 
operational issues experienced in July; resolution of the Brand Licence 
dispute; and importantly, taking a fresh look at the business to assess 
the opportunities available to it, in conjunction with a review of easyJet’s 
capital structure to ensure easyJet has the financial resources necessary 
to support its future plans.

easyJet plc
Annual report and accounts 2010 Business model and vision
easyJet’s vision is to ‘Turn Europe Orange’. This will be achieved by:
 – Ensuring no compromise on safety;
 – Giving our customers low fares to convenient airports at convenient 
times of the day combined with helpful and friendly service that is 
reliable and punctual;
 – Smart cost management so we can continue to offer 
competitive fares;
 – Attracting talented people to easyJet and keeping them with us 
because easyJet is an enjoyable and challenging place to work; and
 – Delivering a good return to shareholders by focusing on improving 
margins to achieve a profit per seat of £5.
easyJet has a number of opportunities to drive margin improvement:
 – To grow fares through continued network optimisation and driving 
the business traveller proposition harder;
 – To grow ancillary revenues through both yield management of fees 
and charges and partner and in-flight revenues through better 
execution and innovation such as easyJet Holidays; and 
 – Smart cost management by reducing complexity and disruption costs 
in the business and continuing to drive procurement initiatives in 
airports, ground handling and maintenance.
Capital structure review
It is vital that easyJet has the financial resources in place to support 
its expansion plans and to ensure it can withstand external shocks. 
Consequently, we have performed a rigorous review of the balance 
sheet including modelling downside scenarios such as extreme fuel prices 
to ensure that we have the appropriate capital structure going forward.
We will continue with a conservative policy including a liquidity target of 
£4 million cash per aircraft, a leverage cap of £10 million adjusted gross 
debt per aircraft and a 50% limit on net gearing.
easyJet is highly cash generative and will continue to be as the business 
grows and improves its margins. easyJet has also been able to access 
financing for its aircraft at attractive rates. Consequently, the Board 
is confident that easyJet has the ability to maintain a conservative 
balance sheet whilst funding growth and a regular formulaic return 
to shareholders. We therefore intend to commence the payment of 
an annual dividend based on a dividend cover of five times. The first 
dividend will be payable in 2012 in respect of the year ending 
30 September 201 1.
Return on equity (ROE) has been an important target for easyJet.  
We continue to target improvement in ROE however, with the 
introduction of a dividend policy and the belief that easyJet needs to 
maintain a strong balance sheet, the Board is of the view that Return  
on capital employed (ROCE) is a more relevant target. Our aim will  
be to achieve an average post tax ROCE of 12% through the cycle.
Disruption 
easyJet’s results this year reflect the high levels of disruption from snow, 
volcanic ash, ATC strike action and easyJet’s own operational difficulties. 
The combination of these events led to incremental costs of £97.9 million 
versus the prior year.
During December 2009 and January 2010, Europe experienced 
exceptional snowfall causing the closure of many airports. Despite this 
easyJet managed to fly 90% of its programme during the affected period. 
Nonetheless, the impact of this disruption on our customers and people 
was significant. easyJet incurred £20.8 million of additional costs associated 
with this disruption and the pre-tax result, including lost contribution, 
in the first half of the year was adversely impacted by £25 million. 
The disruption to European airspace due to the Eyjafjalla volcano in 
April and May was significant. easyJet was forced to cancel 7,314 flights, 
disrupting 960,000 passengers. The lost contribution and additional cost 
as a result of this event were £30 million and £27.3 million respectively.
easyJet gave priority to supporting its customers affected by the volcanic 
ash disruption and was able to repatriate approximately 200,000 
stranded passengers within five days by implementing the following 
special measures:
 – Operating effectively a full flying programme as soon as the 
skies reopened;
 – Operating special rescue flights to hot spot areas where many 
passengers were stranded. These flights were operated with 
additional aircraft leased at easyJet’s expense;
 – Prioritising stranded passengers over new sales. easyJet suspended 
sales on many routes to give priority to our repatriation efforts; and
 – Allowing customers to fly on stand-by. easyJet set up stand-by desks 
in airports to try to help stranded passengers get on the next 
available flight.
Prioritising stranded passengers
easyJet repatriated around 200,000 passengers within  
five days during the volcanic ash disruption.

easyJet plc
Annual report and accounts 2010 Over the summer, easyJet experienced operational difficulties, including  
a high level of cancellations and poor on time performance (OTP). 
Following a thorough review, it is clear that the root cause of these 
operational problems was that easyJet did not have the right number of 
crew in the right locations at the right times. High levels of ATC industrial 
action across Europe further exacerbated the problems.
When the extent of the problems came to light, easyJet swiftly put 
in place a series of mitigating actions including sub-chartering aircraft. 
Throughout this period our priority was ensuring no compromises 
on safety and seeking to minimise the impact of these issues on our 
passengers. Subsequently, we have seen an improvement in OTP while 
the number of cancellations has reduced. Our objective now is to ensure 
acceptable levels of OTP return for summer 201 1. 
Going forward we have implemented a series of measures to ensure 
these issues are fundamentally resolved including ensuring realistic 
planning assumptions for crew numbers, greater use of flexible rosters, 
a more robust management structure and more effective communication 
with the crew. These measures will not incur additional net costs to 
easyJet but will deliver savings as disruption costs are reduced.
Brand licence resolution
On 1 1 October 2010, we announced a resolution to the ongoing brand 
licence dispute. The proposed variations to the brand licence will ensure 
that we have a more workable agreement going forward that allows 
easyJet to carry out all current commercial activities and innovate 
without restriction within the parameters of the airline and airport 
environment. The proposed variations will be the subject of a 
shareholder circular that was issued on 16 November 2010.
Business performance
easyJet’s strategy is centred around achieving profitable growth and 
delivering improved returns. Therefore, the management team 
continually focuses its efforts on both driving revenue and managing 
costs. Margins improved in the period, mainly driven by a unit fuel cost 
decrease equivalent to £122.7 million, offset by lower interest income  
of £1 1.3 million and £97.9 million of additional disruption costs.
Revenue
Total revenue per seat was £53.07 in the year, an increase of 3.3% at 
constant currency; a good performance against a difficult backdrop and 
strong comparators driven by the strength of easyJet’s network, good 
route management and growth in ancillary revenues.
Focused network development
easyJet’s unique differentiator is its network, with a leading presence on 
the top 100 routes in Europe and positions at primary airports that are 
attractive to time sensitive consumers. Additionally, 53% of easyJet’s 
passengers now originate from outside the UK, an increase of 
3 percentage points compared with the prior year. 
easyJet has continued to manage the performance of its network 
by careful allocation of aircraft to routes and optimisation of its flying 
schedule. During the past year, 28 underperforming routes were closed 
and 1 15 new routes were launched. easyJet closed its base at East 
Midlands airport and reallocated the aircraft to bases where it will be 
able to drive an improved return. easyJet now operates 25 A320 aircraft 
across the network and this has enabled us both to extend our network 
to longer range destinations such as Israel, Egypt and Turkey and to fly 
a higher number of passengers at highly slot congested airports such 
as Paris Orly.
easyJet continues to focus its efforts on the business travel market through 
adding new routes to business destinations, improving frequencies and 
increasing the proportion of flights at peak times of the day. easyJet 
continues to see a yield premium of about 20% to 30% from flights 
booked via the GDS and Business API.
Overall, easyJet’s capacity (measured in seats flown) grew by 6% during 
the year, with an increase of 16% in mainland Europe with growth 
focused on France, Italy, Spain and Switzerland.
UK
Consolidating UK performance
The network strategy in the UK is focused around consolidating our 
position as the UK’s leading airline. Capacity in the UK was flat overall 
but careful capacity allocation decisions delivered a good revenue 
performance across all of our UK bases. 
At London Gatwick seats flown grew by 9% and we increased based 
capacity by a further three aircraft to 42 over the summer following the 
withdrawal of Aer Lingus from the routes on which they competed 
directly with easyJet.
Capacity elsewhere in the UK reduced by 6% as easyJet closed its base 
at East Midlands in January 2010 and terminated underperforming routes 
in Luton. There were good performances at a number of UK regional 
bases, particularly at Belfast and Edinburgh following competitor retreat. 
We continue to invest in our Manchester base with a range of business 
and leisure routes.

Growing our footprint through increased based  
capacity in Switzerland, France and Italy
In Switzerland three new aircraft were introduced and seats flown  
grew by 12%. Frequencies were increased on routes such as Geneva to 
London Gatwick, Paris Orly and Barcelona. An A320 was introduced at 
Geneva to enable flights to longer range destinations such as Sharm El 
Sheikh. easyJet also took advantage of Ryanair’s retreat from Basel to 
add additional capacity into the market.
France is a compelling investment opportunity for easyJet. Low cost 
carrier penetration is half the European average and easyJet is uniquely 
positioned to grow in France due to its decision to put its crew onto local 
terms and conditions. easyJet grew capacity by 22% in France in the year, 
against market growth of just 1%. At Paris Orly, easyJet has added a 
seventh aircraft and now has ten aircraft deployed at Paris Charles 
De Gaulle. At Lyon, a third aircraft has been added as we have taken 
advantage of Air France’s reduced capacity on routes such as Madrid 
and Barcelona; a fourth aircraft will be added over the winter.
Capacity in Italy increased by 25%, with 16 aircraft now based at Milan 
Malpensa where easyJet launched eight new routes and increased 
frequencies on business routes such as Rome, Madrid, Barcelona 
and Amsterdam. 
Growing our footprint through increased inbound  
flying in Germany and Spain
In Germany, easyJet continued to refocus its offering. We have increased 
capacity on key business routes out of Berlin such as Brussels, 
Copenhagen and London Gatwick. easyJet has also increased its 
presence in Scandinavia and we now have thirteen routes operating  
out of the region.
In Madrid, capacity grew by 20% in the period, with eight aircraft now 
deployed there. The Spanish market continues to be competitive 
however both city and beach in-bound routes continue to perform well.
Portugal is an important market for easyJet and we are already its 
second largest airline. In October, we announced that we are opening 
a base at Lisbon in winter 201 1. This will enable us to further develop 
our business there. 
Ancillary revenues
Ancillary revenues grew in the year by 43 pence per seat to £10.20 
despite regulatory changes to the sales process for insurance products 
which led to a reduction in insurance income of £8 million in the year 
and changes in VAT legislation which negatively impacted in-flight income 
by £2 million. There were improved performances in fees and charges 
and bag revenue. 
However, hotel and car hire revenues were down versus the prior year. 
This performance is disappointing and we are reviewing this area to 
ensure that we have the correct product offerings to underpin our 
growth plans going forward. 
Smart cost management
It is vital that easyJet effectively manages its cost base so that it can 
continue to offer competitive fares profitably. However, it is important 
that cost management is sensibly executed and does not lead to 
sub-optimal decisions such as those made around crewing this year. 
Total cost per seat excluding fuel, rose by 5.2% at constant currency to 
£36.15 in the period, principally due to disruption and wet leasing costs. 
Excluding the effect of additional disruption, cost per seat rose by 2.2%  
at constant currency to £35.14 as improvements in aircraft ownership 
and maintenance costs partially offset increased airport and navigation 
charges. We are making good progress to be on track to deliver against 
our £190 million savings programme.
Systems implementation to drive reduced fuel consumption 
and improvements in crew efficiency 
easyJet has maintained the level of fuel burn in the period. Whilst crew 
productivity savings were delivered in the year, the way in which these 
savings were achieved drove substantially more cost in the business as 
we suffered disruption due to crew shortages in part of the network. 
Consequently, we have decided to stabilise the operation during 201 1 
and have built more resilience into our crew planning. These additional 
costs will be offset by reduced disruption and wet leasing costs.

Leverage scale and the recession to deliver  
procurement efficiencies 
The renegotiation of our maintenance contract with SR Technics will 
drive savings of around £17 million per annum. We have also maintained 
our approach of leveraging our scale and buying power to challenge 
airports on the charges they levy.
Efficient fleet management 
easyJet continues to make good progress towards its goal of operating  
a common aircraft fleet. Eliminating the Boeing and ex-GB Airways 
sub-fleets will take cost out of the business and simplify our operations. 
The intention is to exit all aircraft in the two sub-fleets by 2012 to 
complete the realisation of ownership cost savings of around £30 million 
per annum. Nine Boeing 737s and three ex-GB Airways A320s were 
returned to lessors in the year. The remaining four ex-GB Airways  
A321s exited the fleet in November 2010. 
We have benchmarked easyJet cost categories against other low  
cost carriers and identified further efficiencies. We have named this 
programme easyJet Lean and the £190 million cost savings programme 
will be folded up into this initiative. One of our cost saving plans we have 
already stepped up is to build a greater proportion of A320s into our 
fleet plan. There are currently 25 easyJet 180 seat A320s in the fleet and 
our review of their introduction has shown a reduction in cost per seat 
which has led to a significant increase in contribution, although as you 
might expect there is a slight yield decrease. This is a perfect example  
of how we aim to balance yield and cost to improve margins.
Regulated costs 
A significant proportion of easyJet’s cost base is determined by 
governments and regulators and we continue to constructively engage 
with them on a number of issues that will impact easyJet’s cost base in 
the future. The closure of European airspace because of volcanic ash  
and the wide scale air traffic control disruption across Europe have 
highlighted some of the weaknesses of the current policy framework. 
We are supporting efforts to put in place a European framework to  
deal with future crises. The volcanic ash disruption also exposed the 
weaknesses in EU2004/261, which effectively requires airlines to act  
as insurer of last resort. 
We will work with the EU on consumer rules to ensure that they  
strike the right balance between the benefits that regulation brings  
to consumers over its costs to the industry. The strike disruption  
to air traffic control is due to the wider economic pressures facing 
Europe and union concerns about the forthcoming Single European  
Sky programme. We expect disruption to continue in 201 1; we will  
press for measures to be put in place that alleviate the impact of  
these strikes and push for faster reform. 
Our increasing focus on primary airports increases the importance  
of regulated airport charges to the business. We continue to work  
with airports and regulators to ensure that charges are as low as  
possible and also that charging structures do not discriminate against 
easyJet. In the UK, we are active participants in the CAA’s work on 
airport regulation methodologies and competition; we are also  
involved in regulation in the Netherlands, France and Belgium.
We are now at the initial stages of aviation’s entry into the EU Emissions 
Trading System (ETS); 2010 is a monitoring year ahead of the 
requirement in 2012 to have permits to cover emissions. We support 
moves towards a global framework for addressing aviation’s impact on 
climate change. However, this must not come at the expense of schemes 
such as ETS. These schemes are the right way to address aviation’s 
environmental obligations. We also remain concerned about the 
imposition of passenger taxes across Europe, with Germany introducing 
a €8 passenger tax for European flights. We can see no rationale for 
these taxes and where they remain we will continue to argue for their 
reform of any passenger taxes into environmentally efficient plane taxes, 
which tax flights rather than passengers.
Fleet plan
In the period, easyJet took delivery of eight A320 aircraft and nineteen 
A319 aircraft under the terms of the easyJet Airbus agreement. 
Configured with 180 seats, the A320 is enabling us to increase our 
capacity at peak times at slot constrained airports. The aircraft also 
operates with a cost per seat that is around 6% lower than the A319. 
The total fleet at 30 September 2010 comprised 196 aircraft. A further 
45 easyJet specification aircraft deliveries are currently planned for arrival 
over the next three years. The fleet is expected to comprise 220 aircraft 
by 30 September 2013.
easyJet has flexibility in its fleet planning arrangements and thus is able  
to manage the total number of aircraft in the fleet through a combination 
of deferrals and lease extensions.
25 A320 aircraft within our fleet
We have 25 A320 aircraft within our fleet at 30 September, after taking 
delivery of 8 new A320 aircraft in the year. This aircraft operates with a 
cost per seat that is around 6% lower than the A319.

Hedging positions
easyJet operates under a clear set of treasury policies agreed by the 
Board. The aim of easyJet’s hedging policy is to reduce short term 
earnings volatility and therefore the Company hedges forward, on a 
rolling basis, between 50% and 80% of the next 12 months anticipated 
requirements and between 20% and 50% of the following 12 months 
anticipated requirements. Details of our current hedging arrangements

Outlook
Capacity measured in seats flown, adjusting for the impact of disruption 
is expected to increase compared to the prior year by around 8% as 
easyJet continues with its strategy of carefully targeting growth. On a 
reported basis capacity is expected to be up by 12% for the full year and 
14% in the first half. The current expectation is that competitor capacity 
on easyJet routes will be up by low single digits.
Over 45% of the available first half seats now sold and forward bookings 
are in line with the prior year. Total revenue per seat in the first half is 
expected to be broadly flat on a reported basis (at current exchange 
rates)
6
 versus the prior year and slightly up by at constant currency 
despite a greater proportion of A320 aircraft in the fleet and the impact 
of increased APD in the UK and its introduction into Germany.
Total reported cost per seat excluding fuel (at current exchange rates)
6
 
is anticipated to fall by around 4% on an underlying basis, assuming 
normal levels of disruption. Improvements in maintenance and 
ownership costs and a reduction in disruption related costs will offset  
the impact of planned increases in crew costs as we build more resilience 
in to the operation.
The economic outlook in Europe remains uncertain and the continuing 
level of ATC industrial action is causing disruption to our flying 
programme and driving additional cost. However, the strength of the 
easyJet network combined with its proposition of offering consumers 
the best value fares to convenient airports means that easyJet is well 
positioned for future success.

2010 confirmed the underlying strength of easyJet’s business model and 
customer proposition. The Company continued to develop Europe’s 
No.1 air transport network by increasing presence at primary airports 
and continuing to enhance the route offering and timing and frequency 
of the schedule.
This investment in the network has resulted in increased revenue yields 
and profitability despite the backdrop of a recessionary economic 
environment across Europe. 
Total revenue grew 1 1.5% to £2,973.1 million and reported profit 
before tax was £154.0 million or £2.75 per seat (2009: £54.7 million or 
£1.04 per seat). This result was achieved despite the significant impact 
of disruption on the business during the year. 
easyJet continues to generate strong operating cash flows and maintain 
a strong balance sheet. Gearing levels remain low and the Company has 
sufficient liquidity to fund its future growth.
The reported financial performance in the year has been significantly 
impacted by the following factors:
 – Network improvement; 
 – Fuel prices
 – Volcanic ash disruption
 – Winter snow disruption
 – Air traffic control and strike action

Annual report and accounts 2010 Network improvement 
The move in capacity towards continental Europe continued in 2010. 
Of the 6.0% overall growth in seats flown, the increase at continental 
European bases was 15.9%, with investment being focused in Milan 
Malpensa, Rome Fiumicino, and Paris Charles de Gaulle. London bases in 
aggregate grew by 4.5% with investment continuing at Gatwick but being 
reduced at Luton. Capacity was reduced across the UK regions by 6.3% 
with only Manchester showing any significant growth.
easyJet has continued to grow in both 2009 and 2010 and has returned 
growth in total revenue per seat at constant exchange in both years. 
The strong 2009 comparators make the 2010 performance stand out 
amongst European short-haul competitors.
A consequence of investment in higher yielding routes is a mix impact on 
cost. However, the overall cost impact across the airport charges, ground 
handling and crew lines was more than recovered through additional 
revenue yield.

Fuel 733.4 13.09 1.17 807.2 15.28 1.39
Total fuel cost for 2010 was £733.4 million, a £73.8 million decrease on 
2009. After taking into account a 6% increase in volume, fuel cost per 
seat was £13.09, down £2.19 from £15.28 per seat in 2009. The market 
cost of fuel, excluding fees and charges, increased in the year from $595 
per metric tonne to $688. However, the effective price for fuel, after 
taking into account jet fuel hedging, decreased significantly from $951 
per metric tonne to $732 as higher cost hedges matured. 
The effective US dollar exchange rate reduced in the year from 1.78/£ 
to 1.64/£ resulting in a sterling cost of fuel (excluding fees and charges) 
of £445 per metric tonne compared to £536 in 2009. 
Fuel burn was flat year-on-year at 715 US gallons per block hour. 
The introduction of additional heavier A320 aircraft and a 1.5 percentage 
point increase in load factor being offset by fuel conservation initiatives 
in the year.
Volcanic ash disruption
As discussed in the Chief Executive’s review, the aviation industry was 
subject to the unprecedented closures of European airspace during April 
and May 2010 following the eruption of the Eyjafjalla volcano in Iceland. 
easyJet was forced to cancel over 7,000 sectors during this period. 
Costs of customer compensation, direct operating costs and additional 
resource in our contact centres totalled £27.3 million or £0.49 per seat. 
In addition, the Company estimates the lost contribution from these 
incidents at approximately £30 million.
Winter snow disruption
During December 2009 and January 2010, Europe experienced heavier 
than normal snowfall which caused the closure of many airports and 
the loss of nearly 2,800 sectors. As reported in the Company’s interim 
report, operating costs and customer compensation associated with 
the snow totalled £20.8 million or £0.37 per seat. Additional lost 
contribution from the snow disruption is estimated at £4 million.
Air traffic control and strike action
As a result of the recessionary environment across Europe and austerity 
measures introduced by national governments the operation has been 
affected by significant levels of industrial action and work to rule by 
ground handling suppliers and air traffic control. This caused a large 
number of cancelled flights and significant lost contribution and cost 
in the form of customer compensation. Industrial action has continued 
into the early part of the 201 1 financial year particularly in France. These 
issues and operational difficulties during the summer resulted in additional 
costs of £49.8 million in 2010 including £13.7 million of aircraft wet leasing.

The reported profit for the year includes £27.3 million of cost relating to 
the volcanic ash cloud disruption in April and May 2010 as detailed above 
and a £7.0 million loss associated with the disposal of the final four ex-GB 
Airways A321 aircraft in November 2010. This now completes the sale 
of ex-GB Airways A321 sub-fleet, generating an overall net profit of 
£4.0 million on the disposal of the seven aircraft.
Excluding these one off items underlying profit before tax for 2010 was 
£188.3 million or £3.36 per seat (2009: £43.7 million or £0.83 per seat).
Exchange rates
Movements in exchange rates, principally the US dollar and euro,  
are a key factor in determining the Company’s financial performance. 
The underlying average market rate for the US dollar in 2010 was flat 
compared to the prior year at 1.56/£. However, after taking into account 
hedging, the effective average rate for the year was 1.64/£, down from 
1.78/£ in 2009. The Company has no US dollar revenue but significant 
US dollar costs within fuel, leasing, maintenance and interest, therefore 
this movement has had an adverse impact on the result for the year 
compared to 2009.
The average euro market rate in 2010 has strengthened marginally from 
1.16/£ in 2009 to 1.15/£ in 2010. With 44% of revenue and 34% of costs 
denominated in euro, this results in a net surplus position therefore the 
movement in the euro has contributed positively to the result in 2010.

In spite of the challenging economic environment, the Company 
returned a strong commercial performance in 2010. Total revenue 
increased 1 1.5% to £2,973.1 million.
Disruption in the year meant that seat capacity increased by 6.0% 
whilst there was an increase of 9.2% in the average number of aircraft 
operated. This contributed to a 1.5 percentage point increase in load 
factor.
Total revenue per seat increased 5.1% to £53.07 with a particularly 
strong second half performance. After accounting for the positive impact 
of foreign exchange, total revenue per seat at constant currency grew by 
3.3%. Non-sterling currencies accounted for 52% of revenue in 2010 
(2009: 51%). 
This revenue increase was driven by:
 – Improvements in route mix with investment in higher yielding 
European routes and some capacity re-alignment within the UK 
(including the closure of the East Midlands base); and
 – Encouraging year-on-year performance on routes from the UK, 
these performed well throughout the summer with high levels of 
demand for both beach and European cities.
Ancillary revenue grew by 10.7% in 2010, or 4.4% on a per seat basis. 
This was driven by a 3.3% increase in checked bag revenue per seat and 
price optimisation across other fees and charges. Partner revenue was 
impacted by the regulatory change which forced travel insurance to be 
presented on an opt-in basis.

5.2% compared to 2009. 
The costs of non-volcanic ash related disruption and wet leasing in the 
year, the impact of network mix on airport, ground handling and crew 
costs and the significant reduction in interest income have all been 
factors in the increase in total costs year-on-year.

cloud and £7.0 million loss on disposal of A321 aircraft in 2010 and £11.0 million 
profit on disposal of A321 aircraft in 2009.
Operating costs increased by £2.1 1 or 6.8% per seat compared to 2009. 
Adjusting for foreign exchange, the increase was £2.06 per seat 
principally due to network mix, as we increased our presence in the 
top European airports, wet leasing and the costs of snow and other 
disruption.
Ground handling includes significant additional de-icing costs following 
the exceptional winter snow. After adjusting for foreign exchange and 
the impact of network mix, underlying price shows a decrease per seat 
year-on-year. The majority of the increase in airport charges can also 
be attributed to mix and foreign exchange. Approximately two-thirds 
of all ground handling and airports costs are now denominated in 
foreign currency.
The combined impact of mix across ground handling, airports and crew 
costs is estimated at £0.45 per seat, this has been more than recovered 
through additional revenue per seat.

easyJet plc
Annual report and accounts 2010 The increase in navigation costs per seat is driven by continued regulated 
cost increases from Eurocontrol and the 2.1% increase in average sector 
length in the year. Average cost increases across the major European 
countries covered by easyJet routes was approximately 3.5%. 
Crew costs have increased as we continue our expansion into Europe. 
Per head costs including social security at our European bases are higher 
than those in the UK but are a necessary part of our growth strategy. In 
2009 one third of crew costs were denominated in euro or Swiss francs, 
in 2010 this proportion has risen to 40% therefore this has resulted in an 
increase in sterling cost as the euro and Swiss franc have strengthened 
year-on-year. 
Crew pay negotiations and contract changes have also added cost in 
2010. Despite the expansion into Europe, the UK is still the largest 
country in terms of crew heads and, along with the introduction of 
German contracts, has been the biggest driver of the cost increase.
The reduction in utilisation due to disruption has also impacted cost per 
seat as the fixed cost element of our crew establishment is spread over 
fewer seats. Crew costs remain the key cost challenge for the Company 
in 201 1. 
Maintenance costs show an increase of £0.10 per seat but decreased 
after adjusting for foreign exchange, benefiting from the new SR Technics 
contract completed in 2009. Maintenance costs have also benefited 
from the reduction in the number of leased aircraft compared to 2009. 
During the year nine Boeing 737s and three ex-GB Airways A320s were 
returned to lessors. 
Aircraft wet leasing costs totalled £13.7 million or £0.24 per seat as the 
Company complemented its fleet with additional wet leased Boeing 757s 
during the summer period to deal with short-term operational crew 
shortages and to improve operational resilience.
Other costs show a significant £0.91 per seat increase year-on-year. 
This line includes the operational costs and compensation relating to the 
winter snow and other ATC and strike related disruption and is also 
impacted by the reduction in utilisation. In addition 2009 cost per seat 
was flattered by the Boeing spares sale. 
After excluding foreign exchange, the costs of network mix and 
disruption, the underlying cost per seat was broadly flat, demonstrating 
the strong underlying cost control now evident across the business.

cloud and £7.0 million loss on disposal of A321 aircraft in 2010 and £11.0 million 
profit on disposal of A321 aircraft in 2009.
Ownership costs increased by £0.15 per seat, however after adjusting for 
foreign exchange, ownership costs were down £0.25 per seat reflecting 
the change in the owned/leased mix of aircraft. Average owned aircraft in 
2010 was 123.7 compared to 98.1 in 2009 an increase of 26%. An additional 
23 owned aircraft were added in the year. 
The average number of leased aircraft decreased from 76.0 in 2009 
to 64.2 in 2010 as the Boeing 737 and ex-GB Airways A320 return 
programmes continued. Return of the higher cost Boeings and 
reductions in variable rates also contributed to a positive price 
variance compared to 2010. 
The net of interest receivable and interest payable shows a £0.26 per 
seat increase year-on-year. However, excluding foreign exchange, the net 
of the two lines is constant year-on-year on a per seat basis as interest 
rates have fallen. All current debt is floating rate and re-fixes on either 
a three month or six month basis. Interest payable includes the effects 
of realised and unrealised foreign exchange adjustments on the financing 
element of US dollar balance sheet hedging, the impact of which was 
significant year-on-year. Ownership costs were also impacted by 
spreading costs over a smaller number of seats as capacity was 
reduced and utilisation impacted as a result of disruption.

Build up of underlying pre-tax profit per seat
Profit after tax
Profit after tax was £121.3 million (2009: £71.2 million) resulting in a 
return on equity of 8.6% (2009: 5.5%). The current year tax charge was 
£32.7 million resulting in an effective tax rate of 21.2% (2009: tax credit 
of £16.5 million or 30.2%). 
The difference between the effective and the statutory rate is primarily 
driven by:
 – Profits arising overseas being subject to lower tax rates than the UK; 
 – Non-taxable foreign exchange gains; and 
 – The future lowering of the UK rate to 27% resulting in a lower 
deferred tax charge.
Earnings per share and dividends
Basic earnings per share was 28.4 pence, a 68.0% increase on the  
16.9 pence achieved in 2009. No dividends have been paid or proposed 
in either the current or prior financial year.
Summary consolidated statement of cash flows
easyJet generated a strong operating cash flow for the year; driven by 
growth in forward bookings and revenue per seat. Net cash generated 
from operating activities totalled £363.4 million.
Net capital expenditure of £482.6 million was incurred, principally driven 
by the acquisition of a further 27 A320 family aircraft.
Net loan and lease finance drawdown was £177.3 million, comprising 
mortgages on 13 aircraft, finance leases on two aircraft and the sale and 
operating leaseback of six aircraft, net of repayments on mortgages and 
finance leases. easyJet continues to be an attractive proposition to 
providers of aircraft finance in both the mortgage and lease markets and 
had $754 million of undrawn committed facilities at 30 September 2010.

Net assets increased by £193.4 million over the year, driven by the profit 
for the year and an increase of £58.7 million in the hedging reserve as 
high cost jet swaps matured, offset in part by the US dollar strengthening 
against sterling.
The net book value of property, plant and equipment increased by 
£315.9 million, driven principally by the addition of a net 21 owned A320 
family aircraft. 
Net working capital improved by £85.9 million to a net negative 
£589.8 million. As easyJet’s passengers pay for their flights at the time 
of booking, the key component of this balance is unearned revenue of 
£356.5 million; an increase of £32.2 million during the year driven by 
increased bookings and improvements in yield. A further benefit was 
derived from renegotiating contract terms with key card acquirers, 
contributing to a reduction in trade receivables of £81.9 million.
Restricted cash principally relates to operating lease deposits and 
customer payments for holidays and decreased by £16.7 million to 
£55.6 million. This reduction was driven by the implementation of 
insurance arrangements to meet our obligations under the Package 
Holiday Regulations and reductions in operating lease deposits as we 
continued to return the Boeing 737 fleet to lessors.
Current and deferred taxation liabilities increased by £41.4 million to 
£175.4 million, driven by higher profitability and deferred taxation on the 
gains recognised on derivatives accounted for as cash flow hedges.

2009. Net borrowings increased by £91.4 million in the period. 
The majority of mortgage and finance lease debt and all money market 
deposits are denominated in US dollars and the sterling value of this net 
liability increased by £9.1 million during the year as a consequence of the 
strengthening of the US dollar against sterling.
Net debt at 30 September 2010 was £40.1 million compared with 
£45.7 million at 30 September 2009. Strong operating cash flow and the 
increase in net assets delivered a reduction in gearing of six percentage 
points to 32% at 30 September 2010.
Going concern
In adopting the going concern basis for preparing the accounts, the 
Directors have considered the business activities as set out on pages 
8 to 13 as well as easyJet’s principal risks and uncertainties as set out on 
pages 25 to 27. Based on easyJet’s cash flow forecasts and projections, 
the Board is satisfied that easyJet will be able to operate within the 
level of its facilities and available cash for the foreseeable future. For this 
reason, easyJet continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing 
its accounts.

Policy and practice on payment of creditors
easyJet aims to have partnership agreements with suppliers, which 
stresses the importance of strong suppliers aligned to the success of 
easyJet as a business. Many of our supply agreements are unique and 
tailored to the needs of the business, to make sure that suppliers are 
rewarded appropriately for delivering services which meet pre-agreed 
performance targets and align with easyJet’s own internal performance 
goals. Our practice is to:
 – Agree the terms of payment at the start of business with the supplier
 – Ensure that those suppliers are made aware of the terms of the 
payments
 – Pay in accordance with contractual and other legal obligations
At 30 September 2010, the number of creditors days outstanding for the 
Group was 6 days (2009: 15 days), and for the Company was nil days 
(2009: nil days).

Annual report and accounts 2010 Our long-term performance and sustainability are dependent upon their 
understanding, goodwill and active support. Accordingly, we strive to 
achieve excellence in safety and embrace the highest standards of 
environmental, social and ethical behaviour.
Safety is our No.1 priority and is embedded deep within the fabric of 
easyJet. It comes first at all times, for every person, regardless of role  
or seniority. Dedicated structures and processes are in place to manage 
and monitor safety risk throughout the business.
At easyJet, one strength above all others marks us apart: our people. 
Their passion, expertise and commitment is at the heart of our emphasis 
on customer satisfaction and therefore our ongoing success as a business. 
We continue to focus on developing and improving the ways which we treat 
our people in order to maintain their engagement with our customers 
and business.
The environment is a key issue within our industry. We work hard to 
identify ways to minimise our environmental impact, so that our business 
and the aviation industry as a whole can continue to thrive. In particular, 
our investment in a young and fuel-efficient fleet, together with an 
ongoing review of how we deploy our aircraft, will help ensure that  
we minimise our impact on the environment while generating superior 
returns for our shareholders.
Safety 
The safety of our customers and people is easyJet’s No.1 priority; it 
is part of our DNA. From the boardroom to the flight deck and the 
check-in desk to the maintenance bay, safety informs everything we 
do and is the starting point for every decision, at all times.
We have an open and just culture that encourages the reporting of all 
safety-related incidents, no matter how minor they may appear at first 
glance. At easyJet, we aim to maintain structures and processes to 
manage and monitor safety related risk throughout our business. 
Our Chief Executive, Carolyn McCall OBE, and Group Operations 
Director, Warwick Brady, are responsible for all aspects of safety delivery, 
including our compliance obligations under the Air Operator’s Certificate 
(AOC). The Accountable Safety Executive is Carolyn McCall OBE and 
she chairs our Safety Review Board which meets monthly to assess 
reports from the Safety Action Groups across the business. This review 
and assessment process delivers monthly reports to both the UK Civil 
Aviation Authority (UK CAA) and the easyJet Board. Our Director of 
Safety, Captain Dave Prior, makes an independent safety report directly 
to the Board each month.
The reported safety-related incidents are assessed and categorised, with 
risk values assigned and aggregated to form our Composite Risk Value 
(CRV) index. During the year, the index showed a steady improvement, 
continuing a long-term trend reducing risk to well within the assigned 
boundary level.
The Safety Management System (SMS) launched in 2009 has now been 
successfully embedded throughout easyJet. The SMS is a continuous 
improvement process that focuses on identifying hazards, assessing 
the risks associated with those hazards, managing those risks and then 
ensuring that any changes have had the desired impact. During 2010, we 
configured a number of SMS tools and carried out a range of activities 
such as the integration of SMS derived data into the easyJet advanced 
pilot training system. In doing so, easyJet has been able to target training 
resources in a safety beneficial way whilst at the same time delivering 
cost efficiencies.
 Corporate responsibility
The success of our business is 
inextricably linked to the well-being  
of our customers, our people and the 
communities where we live and work.

easyJet plc
Annual report and accounts 2010 As part of the SMS, we are continuing to study fatigue and its effects in 
the pursuit of operational safety. We are working alongside industry 
organisations, including the UK CAA, to evolve our Fatigue Risk 
Management System (FRMS), building an understanding of the 
relationships between rostering, operational variables, crew performance 
and workload. Our work in fatigue management is respected throughout 
the industry and the FRMS developed at easyJet is now being replicated 
by many of our peers.
In 2010, our flying capabilities were significantly impacted by a number 
of weather conditions, first from the heavy snow during December and 
January and then from the ash cloud from the Eyjafjalla volcano in April 
and May. Following the full eruption of the volcano on 14 April, airspace 
across Europe was closed leading to the disruption of the entire flying 
schedule. During the period of closure and in the following weeks, we 
worked with the regulators to identify ways in which the airspace could 
be opened, such as flying our own test flights behind Met Office aircraft 
and liaising with engine manufacturers to establish sensible limits on ash 
contamination. On 23 April, the UK CAA, working with the engine 
manufacturers, set out guidelines on the level of ash that was deemed 
safe to fly in. The initial assessment set levels of ash between 200 and 
2,000 microgrammes per cubic metre within which flying was deemed 
to be safe. These levels were reviewed and revised on 18 May to extend 
the fly zones to enable flying where ash density levels did not exceed 
4mg per cubic metre.
During the ash cloud crisis, we continued to explore innovative solutions 
for future volcanic incidents. easyJet, working alongside the Norwegian 
Institute for Air Research, is the first airline in the world to start trials of a 
new technology, invented by Dr Fred Prata, known as AVOID (Airborne 
Volcanic Object Identifier and Detector). AVOID is a system which uses 
infrared technology on the aircraft, similar to weather detectors currently 
in use, to enable pilots and flight control to see an ash cloud up to 100km 
ahead and at altitudes of between 5,000ft and 50,000ft, and, if necessary, 
to amend their course to avoid areas of ash cloud thereby opening up a 
larger area of airspace than might be available using Met Office data alone.
People
Our business is only as good as the people working within it, across all 
areas, from cabin crew and pilots through to our engineering teams, 
management and administration teams and ground staff in Spain. Our 
focus is to attract the right person regardless of level within the business, 
and to ensure everyone is engaged and works together.
We also look for ways to operate more efficiently across all areas of  
the business to provide the best returns for our shareholders whilst 
maintaining the level of service and employee satisfaction to provide a 
quality service to our customers. In 2010, we introduced a new IT system 
to improve the rostering of our cabin crew, to enhance the productivity 
by an estimated 8–10%. Unfortunately, the implementation of this system 
was overly aggressive and resulted in a shortage of crew during our 
busiest period in the summer in a year when we also experienced 
unprecedented natural, economic and social disruption to the industry. 
Our short-term resolution to protect our customers, and to cancel as 
few flights as possible, was to lease additional aircraft and crew during the 
summer period and to increase the level of recruitment in this period. 
Our longer term solution has been to reassess the levels of productivity 
we would hope to gain from this system and to make these more aligned 
to the strategic requirement of the business recognising the volatility of 
the market in which we operate.
Strategy
We have developed a three-part strategy to find and retain the best 
people for our organisation.
Talent
During the year we added to our existing talent pool by recruiting  
some 1,300 cabin crew, 250 new pilots and 125 management and 
administrative staff. 
As well as recruiting our customer facing roles and support roles within 
the business, this year we have seen a number of changes across our 
leadership team. During the last 12 months we have seen the arrival of a 
new Chairman, Chief Executive, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Commercial 
Officer and IT Director. We have seized the opportunity to refresh our 
top management team, recruiting high quality people who are keen to 
look to the future and drive the Company forward after a difficult 
operational year.
To ensure that our people remain at their highest level and to support 
their progression, we have provided training at the easyJet Academy in 
the last year to ensure our crews are up to date on the latest industry 
news. We have also refreshed our induction programme, to ensure that 
our new joiners understand the easyJet culture and values and how they 
can contribute towards our success from their first day.
Our partnerships with Cranfield University and London City University 
are still in place to ensure that our managers get high quality support to 
develop their technical and management skills.
Engagement
There are proven links between an engaged workforce and excellence 
in customer service. The attitude and passion of our staff was ably 
demonstrated by their support for customers and flexibility through 
the periods of bad weather and, most notably, the ash cloud.

Recognising that needs and circumstances are different, we have developed 
a new, more targeted survey for our employees in 2010 to gauge the 
opinions of our team in the four main communities; Pilots, Cabin Crew, 
Management & Administration and Engineering & Maintenance. The 
overall response rate for completion of the uSay survey was 60%, and 
we will be reviewing the results of this in the first quarter of 201 1.
Communication
We understand that good communication is vital within a business, 
especially one which has such an extensive staff base, to ensuring that 
key issues and matters are discussed with people so that we can react 
quickly and to ensure that everyone remains engaged in the business.
We work with our employee representatives and recognise a number  
of trade unions across Europe. Over the last year there has been a 
significant increase in the level of union activity and we have not been 
immune to this, but did not lose any days through internal industrial action.
uSay
As mentioned above, we have introduced a new staff survey this 
year that has been tailored to be more specific to each of our main 
communities, so that our employees comment on the areas that affect 
them within the business. The results of this survey were received in 
October 2010 and we will be working to improve our processes and 
systems to action suggestions.
In its inaugural year, 60% of easyJet employees responded to the survey. 
We are in the process of analysing the results across our communities 
so that we are able to respond to our people in 201 1.
The results of the survey showed that only 35% of our people currently 
feel satisfied in their jobs and environment. Due to the differing nature 
of the staff survey this year, we have enabled our people to give us their 
honest and open feedback on our organisation. Whilst the result is 
disappointing, it is not a surprise when many of our people were 
impacted by the summer’s operational issues. The responses and results 
of this survey will be reviewed and actions will be taken to improve the 
working environment for our people so that their levels of engagement 
are improved in the future.
Spirit
In 2010 we launched a new employee awards scheme; Spirit. This 
scheme rewards our people for their commitment and hard work and 
recognises where our people go above and beyond to enable our 
business to succeed. During the course of the year, we have monthly, 
quarterly and annual awards recognising achievement across the  
different communities within our business.
Organisation
To succeed in our corporate ambitions, we need to have high quality 
people with the right skills in the right place at the right time. Our aim  
is to ensure that our people contribute more to our business than  
they have ever done for any other employer. We aim to ensure that  
we continue to recruit the best people and keep these people engaged 
in the business so that we can achieve these objectives. 
As with all businesses there are levels of staff attrition that will occur, and 
in 2010 our overall unforced staff turnover was 7.6%, which increased 
slightly from the historically low level in 2009. 
Turning Europe Orange
Following the growth of our network, we continue to grow our presence 
across Europe to further strengthen our position as a truly pan-European 
air transport network.
As at 30 September 2010, easyJet employed 7,359 people (2009: 6,666), 
based throughout Europe as illustrated below:
United Kingdom 4,634 
Switzerland 554 
France 640 
Spain 595 
Italy 646 
Germany 290 
Total 7,359
Reward
easyJet offers a competitive rewards package and reviews salaries 
annually in line with market rates to ensure continued alignment to the 
market. For most employees the rewards package includes an annual 
performance-driven bonus, based on personal and Company 
performance, which encourages all employees to contribute towards 
achieving our strategic objectives. Employees are also eligible to 
participate in a Group personal pension towards which easyJet 
contributes, as well as having the option to make their own 
contributions through salary sacrifice arrangements.
Share schemes
easyJet once again offered all employees the opportunity to join its 
popular all-employee share plan, easyJet Shares 4 Me. The plan has won 
five major awards to date and involves three elements: Save As You Earn 
(SAYE); Buy As You Earn (BAYE) and Free Shares. Each scheme is Her 
Majesty’s Revenue & Customs (HMRC) approved and is open to all 
employees on the UK payroll. For employees who are on non-UK 
payrolls, international schemes have been established with similar terms 
and conditions to the UK scheme, albeit without the UK tax benefits. 
Participation in the scheme remains very strong, with over 80% of eligible 
staff now taking part in one or more of the plans.
Your benefits
UK staff continued to be entitled to select from a number of benefits 
available to them through “Your Benefits”. This enables employees to 
access programmes and savings which would not be available to them on 
an individual basis. The benefit choices for 2010 were extended to also 
include “Computers at work” as well as the standard offers already 
available. The “lifestyle benefits” scheme also remained in the year and 
we continue to offer discounts on a wide range of products and services.
Employees make further savings in tax and National Insurance for many 
of these benefits, through salary sacrifice. easyJet’s National Insurance 
savings contribute to the financing of the scheme, which is fully 
outsourced.

Annual report and accounts 2010 Equality and diversity
easyJet is an equal opportunities employer. We ensure that our employees 
and applicants do not receive less favourable treatment on the basis of 
their age, colour, creed, disability, full or part time status, gender, marital 
status, nationality or ethnic origin, race, religion or sexual orientation. 
Applications from disabled employees are always fully considered, 
bearing in mind the aptitudes of the applicant concerned. In the event 
that one of our people becomes disabled every effort is made to ensure 
that their employment at easyJet continues and training is arranged 
where appropriate.
Charitable donations
easyJet supports a “charity of the year”. The airline provides access to 
staff and customers to raise funds and promotes the charity through 
brand awareness. Following a Europe-wide staff vote, easyJet is proud 
to support the Alzheimer’s Society.
The partnership raises money to support people with dementia and 
their carers. As easyJet’s charity of the year, Alzheimer’s Society receives 
donations from summer onboard collections where passengers are 
asked to donate their spare change to support the charity. The Society 
also receives a percentage of all scratch cards sold on easyJet flights.
Throughout the year, our staff have also been actively involved in 
fundraising for the charity and have undertaken a variety of fundraising 
events, including the London Marathon and the Three Peaks Challenge.
The Society is a member of Alzheimer’s Europe. Through this 
organisation the Society plays an important part in raising the profile  
of dementia throughout the European Union and has recently been 
involved in obtaining support in the European Parliament for making 
dementia a health priority throughout the Union. There are over five 
million people with dementia in Europe so it’s not surprising that staff 
across the business chose Alzheimer’s Society as the charity of the year.
Political donations
easyJet does not make any donations to any political party. This is 
not in line with our values and would be deemed as inappropriate.
Gifts and gratuities
easyJet employees are sometimes sent gifts from various companies 
throughout the year. In order to provide clear guidance to employees 
and avoid potential conflicts of interest, we have a strict policy that 
prevents any employee accepting gifts over a nominal value of £35. 
Every Christmas (and less frequently, at various times through the year) 
easyJet holds a staff raffle of all the gifts that are received. Every employee 
across Europe is entered into the draw and allocated a unique reference 
number. Numbers are then drawn at random and winners have the gifts 
sent directly to their home.
easyJet and the environment
The aviation industry is highly regulated, both for safety and many  
of its wider operations, so we therefore operate within a very defined 
framework. Similarly, our environmental impact is almost entirely from 
aviation activity – flying planes. Fuel is our largest single cost item, so we are 
heavily incentivised to minimise its use, and therefore CO 2 emissions. But 
this also means that there are no easy ways to further reduce our emissions.
Unlike many companies we face a very limited set of choices in our 
efforts to reduce our environmental impact. We are constrained by the 
technology available to us, the development of which is a highly regulated 
and lengthy process. Our steady growth almost inevitably means that 
easyJet’s total emissions will increase, as we are already at the front of the 
technology curve. However, easyJet is one of the most efficient airlines 
for short-haul European travel, an easyJet passenger is responsible for 
22% fewer emissions than a passenger on traditional airline to the same 
destination and using the same plane. So as we gain market share over 
other less efficient operators we are improving the overall efficiency 
of European air travel. Significantly reducing our environmental impact 
requires technological change across the industry, so our environment 
policy focuses on these long-term gains. easyJet is actively engaged with 
the major manufacturers and providing operational data to influence 
new technology.
Environment
The aim of our business is to be as efficient as we can be – this applies  
to our environmental impact as well. Our environmental policy is 
governed by three promises:
 – To be efficient in the air
 – To be efficient on the ground
 – To lead in shaping a greener future for aviation
Governance
Many people within easyJet help deliver our environmental aims. 
Oversight of our environmental policy is carried out by a manager  
in our regulatory team, and the executive management team receives 
regular updates on environmental policy as part of the reporting  
on regulatory issues.
Three peaks challenge
Fundraising events included a gruelling ascent of the three  
largest peaks in England, Scotland and Wales, where our  
team raised more than £2,230.

Environment data
In total we emitted 4.51 tonnes of CO 2 in the year and per passenger 
trip this was 96.9kg. Our CO 2 emissions per passenger kilometre 
decreased again in 2010 to 84.4 grams per kilometre.
Progress over time
We believe the most important environmental issue facing the industry 
is climate change. We have focused on ensuring the industry plays its role 
in tackling climate change and on improving the efficiency of our flying 
in terms of CO 2 emissions.
Over the last ten years, easyJet has successfully improved its CO 2 
efficiency every single year. Emissions per passenger km (the standard 
industry measure of efficiency) has improved every year, from 1 16.2 g/
km in 2000 to 83.1 g/km in 2010. We have continued to reduce CO 2 
emissions per passenger journey, from 97.7 kg in 2009 to 96.9 kg in 2010.
Aviation and the environment
Aviation has three main environmental impacts:
On climate change
Aviation contributes to climate change through both the direct emission 
of CO2 from fuel burn and due to other non-CO 2 effects from the 
emission of Nitrogen Oxides (NOx), particles and aerosols and cloud 
formation. The science surrounding the impact of aviation’s CO 2 
emissions is very well developed, while the science surrounding  
non-CO2 effects remains uncertain. It is clear, however, that the 
long-lasting impact is from CO 2 emissions.
On local air quality
Local air quality impacts arise from NOx emissions during aircraft 
take-offs and landings. We operate the latest standard CFM (with the 
Tech Insertion upgrade) engines on 40% or our fleet, and are continuing 
to invest in this upgrade so that it will be in place across the fleet. This 
reduces emissions (by about 1%) but also reduces NOx emissions by 
20% to 30%. These engines are the best in class and help minimise our 
impact on local air quality.
On noise levels
Aircraft noise clearly has an impact on residents around airports. easyJet 
complies with local rules that govern noise at airports (such as curfews 
and routeings to avoid built up areas). Our aircraft meet the tightest 
international noise standards (ICAO chapter 4). Our focus on improving 
the efficiency of our flying has also reduced our noise impact; by changing 
the flap settings used for landings we have both improved fuel efficiency 
and reduced noise levels at landing.
Climate change is the dominant global environmental issue and it is 
also of long-term strategic importance to the airline industry. We have 
therefore focused our reporting and public policy work on this issue.
Why the environment matters
Addressing our environmental impact is clearly part of our responsibility 
as an airline. However, it is also a business imperative. Environmental 
concerns have a significant impact on public policy towards aviation, 
from restrictions on airport expansion to passenger taxes. It is therefore 
in our own interest to ensure that both we and the wider industry 
properly address environmental concerns. This is why we have focused 
on considering public policy solutions to the challenges the industry faces.
Long-term sustainability of the industry
Aviation emissions have increased steadily over time, despite significant 
improvement in environmental efficiency – the growth in air traffic has 
outweighed the efficiency gains. Over the last ten years, global aviation 
traffic has grown by over 5% a year, while efficiency gains have been 
about 2%. This has led to concerns that aviation emissions will continue 
to grow into the future and that this will be inconsistent with the overall 
reductions in greenhouse gas emissions that are needed to limit the 
impact of climate change. This is clearly unsustainable and needs to 
change going forward. 
Environmental efficiency
We improved our CO 2 emissions per passenger 
kilometre by a further 3.3% in 2010.

easyJet plc
Annual report and accounts 2010 We believe that the main environmental challenge facing the industry 
is to ensure that emissions are put on a downwards path. There is a 
real risk that if the industry does not achieve this on its own, it will have 
growth constraints placed up on it. We have already seen suggestions of 
this in the UK, where the Committee on Climate in its December 2009 
report on aviation emissions suggested the growth of the industry would 
need to be limited to 60% over the next 40 years to control UK emissions. 
To ensure the industry does not face any artificial constraints we need  
to significantly improve the efficiency of flying, through step-changes in 
technology and the right incentives to ensure that airlines and passengers 
fly as efficiently as possible.
Delivering our environmental promises
Our promises revolve around actions we can take in the short-term to 
directly improve the environmental efficiency of our business and at the 
same time working to deliver a sustainable long-term outcome for the 
industry. The latter involves changing the framework within which the 
industry operates to ensure it delivers sustainable outcomes. 
easyJet’s actions
We are continually working to improve the environmental impact of  
our current operations, by improving our fuel efficiency. These measures 
are incremental by nature, given that we operate under the constraints 
of defined technology. We have a fuel efficiency programme which is 
continually monitored. While some of these measures save relatively 
small amounts of CO 2 per flight, as we average nearly 1,000 flights a day, 
the total savings can be very large.
In 2010, our fuel efficiency and therefore our environmental efficiency, 
improved by 1.6%.
Examples of this programme are:
 – We have instituted a policy of using ground based power where 
possible (rather than the Auxiliary Power Unit on the aircraft);  
this is considerably more efficient;
 – We have reduced the height at which the landing lights gear are 
lowered on landing (reducing drag);
 – We now use a single engine to taxi the aircraft before departure  
and upon arrival at airports where it is possible to do so. 
Entry into ETS
Aviation entered ETS in 2010, which is the monitoring year for the 
reporting of our CO 2 emissions and the Revenue Tonne Kilometres 
flown by easyJet. From 2012, we will be required to surrender permits 
to cover CO2 emissions. We have put in place the required systems and 
processes to ensure compliance with the monitoring and reporting plans 
approved by the Environment Agency. An external verifier, accredited 
for aviation will be appointed in due course.
Changing the industry framework
Achieving step change in the environmental efficiency of aviation will 
require significant progress in the development of next-generation 
aircraft. Without significant improvements in fuel efficiency it will not be 
possible to increase the rate of environmental efficiency improvement. 
We are concerned that the current effective duopoly in the production 
of large commercial aircraft is restricting the development of next-
generation aircraft. Whilst there has been some discussion around 
re-engineing current generation aircraft, this will at best deliver only half 
the fuel efficiency of a next-generation short-haul aircraft which appears 
to be a decade away. We are continuing to press the manufacturers 
to hasten the introduction of new technology. 
It is also vital that the policy framework set out by governments supports 
these objectives. We believe there are three parts to this, only one of 
which is currently in place.
 – Aviation in ETS
Aviation entered the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) in 2010, 
and airlines will have to surrender permits in 2013 to cover their 2012 
emissions. We were a strong supporter of aviation’s entry and we 
continue to believe that this is the best way to ensure aviation makes 
its fair contribution to tackling climate change.
 – Ensuring any taxes support environmental objectives
We do not support the imposition of aviation specific taxes. However, 
where they are in place (such as the UK) we believe they must be 
designed to provide incentives for more environmentally efficient flying. 
This means the tax base must be flights, not passengers.
 – Minimum standards for aircraft
International minimum standards are needed to drive the development 
of new technology aircraft.

Principles statement 
easyJet is committed to meeting the required standards of 
corporate governance. 
Statement of compliance 
During the year, the Board considers that it and the Company have 
complied without exception with the best practice provisions of 
Section 1 of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance of 
June 2008. The Combined Code is issued by the Financial Reporting 
Council and is available on the Financial Reporting Council’s 
website, http://www.frc.org.uk/corporate. 
Board of Directors 
As at 30 September 2010, the Board comprised seven Non 
Executive Directors (including the Chairman) and two Executive 
Directors. 
The roles of Chairman (as fulfilled by Sir David Michels as Interim 
Chairman and subsequently Sir Michael Rake) and Chief Executive 
(as fulfilled by Andrew Harrison and subsequently Carolyn McCall 
OBE) are separated, clearly defined, and approved by the Board.  
Sir David Michels is the Senior Independent Non Executive 
Director and holds the post of Deputy Chairman. 
The Company regards David Bennett, Professor Rigas Doganis, John 
Browett, Sven Boinet and Keith Hamill as Independent Non 
Executive Directors.  
Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou (who served until 14 May 2010) was not 
regarded as independent due to his significant beneficial 
shareholding in the Company and his prior involvement in an 
executive management capacity. Bob Rothenberg (who also served 
until 14 May 2010) was not considered to be independent due to 
his appointment by Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou pursuant to Article 87 
of the Company’s Articles of Association. 
Board engagement with investors 
The Board continues to consider that it is appropriate for the 
Chairman to be the primary conduit with investors given his 
experience in liaising with shareholders. 
The Chairman has made himself available for investor meetings and 
questions, in person, during the year and has updated the whole 
Board on the results of these meetings and the opinions of 
investors. The Senior Independent Non Executive Director has also 
acted as an alternative point of contact and attended meetings in 
order to help develop a balanced understanding of the issues and 
concerns of major shareholders. Regular feedback is provided to 
the Board on the opinions of shareholders and an investor 
perception audit is carried out by an independent third party on an 
annual basis. 
The Board meets regularly, with 10 meetings having been held 
during the year ended 30 September 2010. All members of the 
Board are supplied in advance with appropriate information 
covering matters which are to be considered. It is standard practice 
for the Non Executive Directors to meet without any Executive 
Directors present on a regular basis during the year, usually prior to 
or immediately after each Board meeting. 
 
The appointments of Carolyn McCall OBE and Chris Kennedy as 
Executive Directors during the year were the result of search 
processes carried out using external recruitment consultants in 
accordance with longstanding Board practice.

With effect from 1 January 2010, Sir David Michels stood down 
from the post of Interim Chairman, taking up the post of Deputy 
Chairman (and Senior Independent Non Executive Director) and 
Sir Michael Rake was appointed Chairman.  
The Board has taken advice during the year from expert 
management search and development consultants with a view  
to both enhancing its development of key managers and reviewing 
its succession planning for the top executive roles in the Company.  
Directors and officers insurance cover has been established for all 
Directors to provide cover against their reasonable actions on 
behalf of easyJet. During the year a performance review of the 
Board was undertaken using an external evaluation tool provided  
by a corporate advisory company. This process involved a detailed 
questionnaire completed by each of the Directors and one on one 
discussions with individual Directors. The performance of the Board 
(including the Chairman), the Board’s Committees and also that of 
the individual Board Directors was reviewed as part of the same 
process. The Senior Independent Director led the Non Executive 
Directors in a review of the Chairman’s performance which also 
involved feedback from the Executive Directors. 
The Board regularly receives updates, via the Company Secretary, 
on relevant legislation, regulation and governance best practice.  Overview Business review Governance Accounts Other information

Board Committees 
Remuneration Committee 
At 30 September 2010, the Remuneration Committee comprised 
four Independent Non Executive Directors, namely Keith Hamill 
(Chairman), David Bennett, Professor Rigas Doganis and Sven 
Boinet. This Committee, which meets at least twice per year, has 
responsibility for making recommendations to the Board on the 
compensation of senior executives and determining, within agreed 
terms of reference, the specific remuneration packages for each of 
the Executive Directors and the Chairman. In addition to meetings 
to allot shares under the Company’s share option schemes, the 
Remuneration Committee has met two times during the year. 
The Board has reviewed the composition of the Remuneration 
Committee during the year and is satisfied that the Directors who 
are currently members of this Committee are those who are best 
able to contribute to the Committee’s objectives. 
Shareholders are generally required to approve all new Long Term 
Incentive Plans and significant changes to existing plans. Further 
details of these plans can be found in the Report on Directors’ 
remuneration and the full text of the terms of reference for the 
Remuneration Committee is available in the governance section 
of easyJet’s corporate website, http://corporate.easyJet.com. 
Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee comprises three Non Executive Directors, all 
of whom are independent. At 30 September 2010, the Audit 
Committee members were David Bennett (Chairman), John 
Browett and Keith Hamill. This Committee meets at least three 
times per year. 
The primary function of the Audit Committee is to assist the Board 
in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities by reviewing the financial 
reports and other financial information in advance of publication, 
reviewing on a continuing basis the systems of internal controls 
regarding finance and accounting that management and the Board 
have established and reviewing generally the auditing, accounting 
and financial reporting processes. The ultimate responsibility for 
reviewing and approving the annual and other accounts remains 
with the Board. The Audit Committee has met three times during 
the course of the year. 
The Audit Committee is charged with reviewing the effectiveness 
of internal control, approving and monitoring the internal audit 
work plan, considering issues arising from internal audit’s work, 
reviewing management’s response to internal control issues, 
approving the external audit fee, considering the external audit 
strategy and plans, reviewing the external auditors’ reports and 
reviewing and approving the annual accounts. Both internal and 
external auditors are given the opportunity to meet privately 
with the Audit Committee without any member of management 
present. It is standard practice for the external auditors to meet 
with the Audit Committee without the Executive Directors being 
present at each Audit Committee meeting. 
 
The terms of reference of the Audit Committee are documented 
and agreed by the main Board. The full text of the terms of 
reference is available in the governance section of easyJet’s 
corporate website, http://corporate.easyJet.com. The key terms 
set out that the Audit Committee will: 
– Serve as an independent and objective party to monitor the 
quality and timeliness of the financial reporting process and 
monitor the internal financial control system; 
– Review and appraise the audit efforts of the external auditors; 
– Provide an open avenue of communication among the external 
auditors, financial and senior management and the Board; 
– Confirm and assure the independence and objectivity of the 
external auditors (in particular, in the context of the provision  
of additional services to the Company); 
– Review and ensure the effectiveness of the risk management 
processes of the Company; 
– Review and monitor the effectiveness of the internal audit 
function and management’s responsiveness to any findings and 
recommendations; and 
– Assess potential conflicts of interest of Directors on behalf of 
the Board. 
The Audit Committee has the responsibility for appointing the 
external auditors. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP were reappointed 
auditors of the Group at the Annual General Meeting held in 
February 2010. In order to preserve auditor objectivity and 
independence, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP will not be asked 
to provide consulting services unless this is in the best interests 
of the Company. Clause 9 of the Audit Committee’s terms 
of reference sets out the formal policy on non-audit work. The 
auditors are asked on a regular basis to articulate the steps that  
they have taken to ensure objectivity and independence. easyJet 
monitors the auditors’ performance, behaviour and effectiveness 
during the exercise of their duties, which informs, on an annual 
basis, the Audit Committee’s decision to recommend re-
appointment. This included this year obtaining a report on the 
auditors’ own quality control procedures and a consideration of 
their annual audit quality and transparency report. In the financial 
year, easyJet spent £0.1 million with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP 
(2009: £0.1 million) in respect of non-audit services. 
The Board is satisfied that the Directors who are currently 
members of this Committee are those who are best able to 
contribute to the Committee’s objectives. David Bennett has served 
as the Chairman of the Committee during the year. David was until 
31 July 2009 an Executive Director of Abbey National plc prior 
to which he was Chief Executive Officer and Finance Director of 
Alliance and Leicester plc, experience which the Board considers 
to be recent and relevant for the purposes of undertaking the role 
as Chairman of the Committee.

Nominations Committee 
The Nominations Committee comprises at least three members. 
During the year, the Nominations Committee members were 
Sir David Michels (Chairman), David Bennett and Professor 
Rigas Doganis.  
This Committee is responsible for nominating candidates to fill 
Board positions and for making recommendations on Board 
composition and balance. In appointing Non Executive Directors, 
the Board’s practice is to use external recruitment consultants. 
The Nominations Committee has met twice during the year to deal 
with the appointments of the Chief Executive and Chief Financial 
Officer. The searches for the Chief Executive and Chief Financial 
Officer both involved the use of independent recruitment 
consultants.  
The terms of reference of the Nominations Committee are 
documented and agreed by the main Board. The full text of the 
terms of reference is available in the governance section of easyJet’s 
corporate website, http://corporate.easyJet.com.  
Before selecting new appointees, the Nominations Committee 
considers the balance of skills, knowledge and experience on the 
Board to ensure that a suitable balance is maintained. All job 
specifications prepared include details of the time commitments 
expected in the role. 
On joining the Board, new Board members receive a full and 
tailored induction. Shareholders are offered the opportunity  
to meet new Directors. 
Contracts and letters of appointment with Directors are made 
available at the Annual General Meeting or on request. 
Litigation Committee 
As a result of the proceedings brought by easyGroup IP Licensing 
Limited (a company under the ultimate control of Sir Stelios Haji-
Ioannou) in 2008 in relation to the clarification of the brand licence, 
the Board continues to operate a separate Litigation Committee to 
deal with the proceedings and all matters related to them. Neither 
Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou nor Bob Rothenberg (as his nominee) sat 
on this Committee which comprises every other Director of the 
Board. It is anticipated that the Committee shall continue to exist 
until the proceedings and any related circumstances giving rise to a 
conflict of interest between Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou’s interests and 
those of the Company have been resolved.  
Relations with investors and the  
Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) 
The AGM gives all shareholders the opportunity to communicate 
directly with the Board. There is also regular communication with 
institutional investors on key business issues. easyJet has an investor 
relations department which runs an active investor relations 
programme to facilitate engagement with investors including one  
on one meetings, visits to easyJet’s operations and presentations. 
The investor relations website can be accessed at 
http://corporate.easyjet.com. 
Internal control 
The overall responsibility for easyJet’s systems of internal control 
and for reviewing its effectiveness rests with the Directors of the 
Company. The responsibility for establishing and operating detailed 
control procedures lies with the Chief Executive. However, the 
internal control systems are designed to manage rather than 
eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and by 
their nature can only provide reasonable but not absolute assurance 
against material misstatement or loss. 
The Board has conducted an annual review of the effectiveness  
of the system of internal control during the year under the auspices 
of the Audit Committee. No material failings or weaknesses were 
identified during the course of this review. 
The internal control regime is enhanced by the operation of a 
whistleblower reporting function. The system is operated by a 
specialist external third-party service provider and allows employees 
to report concerns in confidence on a no names basis. The Audit 
Committee has approved the processes and reporting structure  
for the function and receives regular reports on the operation  
of the function. 
Risk management 
A formal process is in place to identify, evaluate, manage and report 
upon significant risks faced by the Company. The process involves a 
regular, rigorous, mandatory reporting regime across middle tier 
management with reporting of risks subject to review by the 
Executive Management Team which produces consolidated risk 
reports to the Board. As at year end the Internal Audit and 
Company Secretarial functions were undertaking a review of risk 
reporting with a view to enhancing the process. 
An ongoing process for the effective management of risk has been 
defined by the Directors and has been adopted as follows: 
– Ongoing assurance and risk management is provided through the 
various monitoring reviews and reporting mechanisms embedded 
into the business operations. Key monitoring reviews include 
those conducted continuously in weekly meetings. Operational 
meetings include the Safety Audit Group which meets monthly to 
discuss safety, security and environmental risks. The Safety Review 
Board meets monthly, or more regularly where events require, to 
review safety performance. In addition, there are regular 
Commercial, Financial and IT functional meetings; 
– The Executive Management Team meets quarterly to consider 
significant current risks. Individual department and overall business 
performance is reviewed. The reporting of significant risks to the 
Executive Management Team and the Board of the Company has 
been enhanced by the risk management processes referred to 
above; 
– Written reporting of current significant risks is provided to the 
Board on a quarterly basis. Control weaknesses or failings are 
considered by the Board if they arise;

– Internal audit considers, reviews and tests internal control and 
business risk matters throughout the Group. Further details of  
the internal audit function’s operations are set out below; 
– As described above, a quarterly risk and control identification 
process, together with an annual control effectiveness review,  
is conducted. The key risks are identified and the key controls to 
manage these risks to the desired level are also identified; and 
– Action plans are set to address any control weaknesses or gaps  
in controls identified. 
The Directors review the effectiveness of internal control, including 
operating, financial, compliance and risk management controls, which 
mitigate the significant risks identified. The procedures used by the 
Directors to review the effectiveness of these controls include: 
– Reports from management. Reporting is structured to ensure that 
key issues are escalated through the management team and 
ultimately to the Board as appropriate; 
– Discussions with senior personnel throughout the Company;  
– Consideration by the Audit Committee of any reports from 
internal and external auditors; and 
– The controls, which mitigate or minimise the high-level risks, are 
reviewed to ensure that they are in operation. The results of this 
review are reported to the Board which considers whether these 
high-level risks are effectively controlled.

Internal audit’s work is focused primarily on areas of greatest risk 
to easyJet, as determined by management’s risk identification 
and assessment processes as validated by the Executive Directors. 
The output from this process is summarised in an audit plan, 
which is approved by the Board and Audit Committee, and 
updated on a rolling quarterly basis.  
The Head of Internal Audit reports to the Chief Financial Officer 
and the Chairman of the Audit Committee. The Head of Internal 
Audit was invited to and attended all of the Audit Committee 
meetings in the year (with the exception of one meeting when 
the post of Head of Internal Audit was vacant but which has now 
been filled) and reported regularly on internal audit reviews to the 
Executive Management Team meetings during the course of the 
year. A formal audit charter is in place.  
The internal audit department reviews the extent to which systems 
of internal control: 
– are effective; 
– are adequate to manage easyJet’s significant risks; and  
– safeguard the Company’s assets. 
The key objectives are to provide independent and objective 
assurance on risks and controls to the Board and senior 
management and to assist the Board with meeting its corporate 
governance and regulatory responsibilities.  
The role of internal audit and the scope of its work continue to 
evolve to take account of changes within the business and emerging 
best practice.

Activities of the Committee 
The Committee has responsibility for determining, within agreed 
terms of reference, the specific remuneration packages for each  
of the Executive Directors and the Chairman and making 
recommendations to the Board on the remuneration of the 
Company’s senior executives. 
During the year ended 30 September 2010, the Committee 
considered the following items of business: 
– Executive Director and senior executive remuneration, including 
those for the recruitment of the new Chief Executive and Chief 
Financial Officer;  
– The fee of the new Chairman and Deputy Chairman; 
– Annual bonus awards for the financial year ended  
30 September 2009; 
– The structure and targets of the annual bonus scheme for the 
financial year ended 30 September 2010;  
– All-employee Save As You Earn scheme grants; 
– The performance targets and award levels for grants during the 
financial year ended 30 September 2010 under the Long Term 
Incentive Plan; 
– The structure and targets of the annual bonus scheme for the 
financial year ending 30 September 2011 and the targets for the 
Long Term Incentive Plan grants during that year;  
– Testing of performance conditions and vesting of Long Term 
Incentive Plan awards granted in December 2006; and 
The Committee also approved proposals relating to the retention 
for a fixed-term period of the former Chief Executive when 
previous retention arrangements expired on 1 April 2010. These 
enabled the Company to continue to operate its activities as an 
airline on the basis of appropriate management resources and 
structure while it undertook an effective recruitment process for  
a new Chief Executive and a Chief Financial Officer. These 
arrangements, which are described later in this report, are not  
in compliance with normal good corporate governance 
remuneration practices or the Company’s normal remuneration 
policies and their approval reflected the exceptional circumstances 
and difficulties with which the Company was confronted.  
The Remuneration Committee will not approve such arrangements 
in the future. 
Remuneration policy 
easyJet’s remuneration policy is to reward the Company’s 
Executive Directors and senior executives competitively against the 
comparative market place, in order to recruit and retain Executive 
Directors and ensure that they are properly motivated to perform 
in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.  
The Committee considers remuneration of directors in companies 
of broadly equivalent size on the structure of the remuneration 
packages and also considers the budget for pay of employees within 
the Company as a whole, to assess the appropriateness of 
remuneration arrangements for Executive Directors. 
Significant changes in the employee remuneration structure are  
also considered by the Committee (via regular liaison with the 
Company’s People Director and Head of Reward). 
The Company aims to provide competitive ‘total pay’ for  
‘on target’ performance, with superior rewards for exceptional 
performance.  
The remuneration packages of the Executive Directors and senior 
executives comprise a combination of basic salary, annual bonus, 
participation in share-based Long Term Incentive Plans and a very 
low level of benefits provision. easyJet has a “no frills” approach to 
pension and benefit provision and does not include, for example, 
company cars or final salary pensions as part of the package. 
Therefore, performance related elements form a significant 
proportion of the packages of the Executive Directors and  
senior executives. 
Reflecting best practice, the Committee regularly reviews  
the structure of its incentive arrangements and, in particular,  
the balance between short and long-term incentives in light of  
the circumstances prevailing each year.  
In line with the Association of British Insurers’ Guidelines on 
Responsible Investment Disclosure, the Committee considers 
whether the incentive policies for Executive Directors and senior 
executives will raise unacceptable environmental, social or 
governance (‘ESG’) risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible 
behaviour. More generally, with regard to the overall remuneration 
policies, there is no restriction on the Committee which prevents it 
from taking into account corporate governance on ESG matters and 
the Committee takes due account of issues relating to risk when 
structuring incentive policies (via, for example, regular liaison with 
the Audit Committee to ensure that the remuneration policies 
adopted do not encourage inappropriate risk-taking).

Basic salary  
The basic salaries of the Executive Directors are reviewed annually and are set taking account of the salary required to deliver an overall 
total package that reflects a number of factors including: 
– practice adopted in companies of a broadly similar size. This is taken to be the thirty companies larger and smaller than easyJet  
by reference to comparative market capitalisation; 
– a formal appraisal of their contribution to the business; 
– the competitive environment; and 
– pay and employment conditions of employees elsewhere within easyJet. 
Annual bonus 
All Executive Directors participate in an annual bonus scheme. The maximum annual bonus opportunity of the Chief Executive during 
the year was 200% of salary (pro-rata for service), with a 100% of salary maximum for other senior executives. The maximum will remain 
at these levels during the financial year ending 30 September 2011. 
Bonus targets are aligned with easyJet’s strategic objectives, with specific targets around its key performance indicators. Performance 
targets for Executive Directors’ annual bonus opportunities in the financial year ending 30 September 2011 are as follows: 
Measure % maximum bonus opportunity
Profit before tax 70%
Customer satisfaction targets 10%
Operating costs (exc fuel) per seat at constant currency 10%
On time performance 10%
The safety of our customers and people underpins all of the operational activities and is required to be achieved before any bonus would 
be payable and therefore is not included in the bonus targets. 
Performance against the targets set for the year under review is discussed below. 
Long Term Incentive Plan 
The easyJet Long Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) provides for annual awards of performance shares and matching shares. The plan was 
approved by shareholders at the AGM in 2005 and amended at the 2008 AGM.  
The annual award limit for performance shares is 200% of basic salary. 
Matching share awards are linked to the investment of up to 50% of annual bonus earned into easyJet shares, which are then matched 
on a 1:1 gross basis.  
Performance and matching share awards vest three years after grant, subject to continued employment and the satisfaction of challenging 
performance conditions (which to date have largely related to ROE performance).  Overview Business review Governance Accounts Other information

Annual report and accounts 2010

LTIP awards to be granted in 2011 
The policy for future LTIP awards and targets will be determined in line with the outcome of reviews being undertaken by management 
and the Board which are described in the Chief Executive’s statement. An announcement relating to grants and targets will be made as 
soon as is practical. Any significant changes in policy will be discussed with shareholder representative bodies and major shareholders.  
A full summary of the performance targets applying to all subsisting LTIP awards are set out on pages 51 and 52. 
All-employee share plan participation 
easyJet encourages share ownership throughout the Company by the use of a Share Incentive Plan and a Sharesave Plan. Take up of the 
schemes remains very positive with over 80% of eligible staff now participating in one or more of the plans. Executive Directors may also 
participate in these plans. They are summarised in the Corporate responsibility section on page 30. 
Previous share awards 
Executive Share Option Scheme 
The LTIP replaced the existing Approved and Unapproved Executive Share Option Schemes (the “ESOS”) as the primary long term 
incentive arrangement for the Executive Directors and other senior employees although the ESOS was retained for flexibility, but lapsed 
on 30 October 2010. There were no grants during the year. 
Shareholding guideline 
Executive Directors are required to build up a shareholding equivalent to 175% of basic salary. There is no specific timeframe within which 
the shares must be acquired. However, executives must retain all the shares acquired on the vesting of LTIP awards (net of tax) until the 
required holding is attained. Any shares already held by the executive will count towards the guideline, as will shares bought by participants 
as “Investment Shares” under the Matching Shares element of the LTIP, together with any shares held on an executive’s behalf through 
participation in the Company’s all-employee share plans. These shares are owned absolutely by the executive. Any unvested performance 
shares or matching shares granted under the LTIP will not count since they are subject to future performance.  
For senior executives who report to the Executive Management Team and receive LTIP awards, a 50% share ownership guideline 
will apply. 
Pension contributions  
easyJet makes a contribution for Executive Directors to a defined contribution pension scheme of 7% of basic salary. While individuals 
are not obliged to make a contribution, easyJet operates a pension salary sacrifice arrangement where individuals can exchange their salary 
for Company paid pension contributions. Where individuals exchange salary this reduces easyJet’s National Insurance contributions. easyJet 
credits half of this saving to the individual’s pension (currently 6.4% of the amount exchanged). Executive Directors cannot contribute to a 
pension during their first three months of employment. Where an Executive Director has reached the lifetime pension limit, a cash 
alternative may be paid with the agreement of the Committee.  easyJet plc

Benefits 
easyJet has a very low level of benefits provision and does not include, for example, company cars or final salary pensions as part of the 
package.  
External appointments 
Executive Directors are permitted to accept one appointment on an external board or committee so long as this is not deemed to 
interfere with the business of the Group. Any fees received in respect of these appointments are retained directly by the relevant 
Executive Director. No fees were received by Executive Directors during the year ended 30 September 2010. 
Service contracts 
Carolyn McCall’s contract provides for 12 months’ notice by either party. On termination by the Company, she will continue to receive 12 
monthly instalments of basic salary and benefits that would cease to the extent that commensurate alternative employment was taken up. 
Alternatively, by mutual consent, the Company may elect to make a payment to the value of 12 months basic salary only. With regard to 
bonus, this would be included in a termination payment, payable on a pro-rata basis, only for the period of time served from the start of 
the financial year to the date of termination and not for any period in lieu of notice. Any bonus paid would be subject to the normal 
bonus targets, tested at the end of the year.  
Chris Kennedy’s notice period is six months by either party, during the first six months of employment and twelve months by either party 
thereafter. There is no provision for bonus to be paid on termination.  
In recognition of the Company’s low level of benefits provision and to avoid consolidation into basic salary, the absence of future benefit 
provision equivalent to those provided under previous employment arrangements for Chris Kennedy was compensated by two payments 
each of £25,000, one made in the month of joining (July 2010) and one made three months later (October 2010). As payments are 
intended to compensate future benefit provision, these will be repayable if Chris Kennedy were to leave within 12 months of his  
start date. 
The arrangements in place for Andrew Harrison throughout the year under review are set out on pages 48 and 49. 
The Company’s relationship with its Non Executive Directors is governed by letters of appointment. The Non Executive Directors  
are appointed for a period not exceeding three years and their appointment may be terminated with three months’ notice without 
compensation.  
Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou did not have a letter of appointment and his appointment was of no fixed term.

Non Executives Directors (NEDs) 
The NEDs, including the Chairman, have letters of appointment which set out their duties and responsibilities. The key terms of the 
appointments are set out in the table below:

Appointment letters Aligned to the standard terms appended to the UK Corporate Governance Code. 
Copies of the service contracts and letters of appointment are available on request from

Fees See below 
Expenses Reimbursement of reasonable travel and other expenses incurred in the performance 
of their duties 
Time Commitment Anticipated to be twelve days per annum depending on Board and Committee requirements 
and corporate activity 
The Board as a whole determines the remuneration of the Company’s Non Executive Directors, with Non Executive Directors exempting 
themselves from discussions and voting as appropriate. When determining the remuneration of Non Executive Directors, account is taken 
of practice adopted in competitors and other similar sized organisations, committees chaired and anticipated time commitment. With the 
exception of the Chairman and Deputy Chairman during the year under review the NEDs received a basic annual fee of £45,000 in 
respect of their Board duties. A further fee of £10,000 is paid in respect of Chairmanship of Board committees. The annual fee for the 
Chairman from 1 January 2010 was £250,000 and for the Deputy Chairman was to £70,000. 
Fees are regularly reviewed and are set by the Board to attract individuals with the required range of skills and experience. The basic 
annual fee increased to £55,000 with effect from 1 October 2010. The fee for the Chairman increased to £300,000 and the fee for 
Deputy Chairman increased to £90,000. 
Total shareholder return  
Given the nature of easyJet’s operations, the Committee does not consider that there is a suitable comparator group against which to 
measure total shareholder return. However, for completeness, the following graphs show the Company’s performance compared with 
the performance of the FTSE 250 and that of a group of European Airlines

. The FTSE 250 has been chosen as it is the FTSE index in 
which the Company resides. The group of European Airlines comprises companies operating in a comparable sector.

The table above excludes gains as a result of the exercise of share options. Details of share options and share awards and any movements 
during the year are shown on pages 50 and 51. 
The annual basic salary of Carolyn McCall OBE is £665,000, plus £48,000 as a cash alternative to a contribution to a pension scheme 
made by the Company. The annual basic salary for Chris Kennedy is £400,000. 
The salary payment for Andrew Harrison includes a payment in lieu of notice on the termination of his contract of £1,221,300, plus 
revised remuneration arrangements from 1 April 2010 as detailed below. 
Pension contributions for Andrew Harrison shown above are greater than 7% of salary for the period to 31 March 2010 as they include 
half of the National Insurance saving resulting from employee contributions made through easyJet’s salary exchange scheme (equivalent to 
6.4% of the sum sacrificed). Andrew Harrison exchanged £96,000 for additional pension contributions in the period to 31 March 2010 
(2009: £195,000). 
Arrangements relating to Andrew Harrison 
Andrew Harrison ceased to be Chief Executive and stepped down from the Board on 30 June 2010. 
As was reported in the 2009 Report on Directors’ remuneration, the Company entered into a retention agreement with him on 15 May 
2009. The terms and reasons for that agreement are set out in that report. This agreement effectively expired on 31 March 2010. 
Under the terms of this agreement, Andrew Harrison continued to receive a salary equivalent to £590,000 per annum plus benefits. In the 
event of resignation or termination (other than for bad leaver reasons) at any time after 31 March 2010 he would also receive a lump sum 
payment in lieu of notice in respect of his full 12 month notice period with no obligation to mitigate the payment. The payment in lieu of 
notice would include the value of 12 months’ salary; 12 months’ pension contributions and the on target level of annual bonus equivalent 
to 100% of salary. In addition, he would receive a pro rata bonus for the year in which he left the Company based on performance and 
would be considered a good leaver in relation to an LTIP award made in December 2007, subject to a pro rata amount for his period of 
service. The maximum number of shares which could vest under this provision was 193,325. The agreement precluded the Company 
from commencing the recruitment of his successor until after 31 March 2010.  Overview Business review Governance Accounts Other information

In order to enable the Company to operate its activities as an airline on the basis of appropriate management resources and structure 
while it undertook an effective recruitment process for a new Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer, the Remuneration Committee 
subsequently approved a further fixed term agreement covering the period 1 April to 30 September 2010. Under these arrangements, 
Andrew Harrison agreed that he would continue to act as Chief Executive until 30 June 2010 and that he would be available for 
consultation and to provide advice as requested for the three months to 30 September 2010. The total remuneration for the period from 
1 April to 30 September 2010 was fixed at £750,000 plus a bonus of £250,000. Also, under these arrangements he agreed that the 
previous entitlement under the 15 May 2009 agreement relating to the 2007 LTIP of up to 193,325 shares would not apply. 
For reasons explained below in the section “2010 Bonus”, Andrew Harrison has also agreed to waive a potential claim for a pro rata 
bonus for the period 1 October 2009 to 31 March 2010 which could have amounted up to £590,000. 
The amount shown in the Directors’ emoluments table above for Andrew Harrison includes a lump sum payment of £1,221,300 under 
the 15 May 2009 agreement and the amounts paid under the 1 April 2010 fixed term agreement covering the period 1 April  
to 30 September 2010. 
Directors’ remuneration 2010 
There was a pay freeze in place during the year under review for Executive Directors and the wider senior management population. 
Remuneration for the new Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer was agreed with them to secure their recruitment and is consistent 
with the Company’s remuneration policies. 
2010 Bonus  
The results and performances targets for the year were not achieved in full. However, these were materially affected by the substantial 
disruption following the eruption of the Eyiafjalla volcano, which increased costs by £27.3 million and resulted in lost contribution 
estimated at approximately £30 million. In view of this it was decided that certain management and staff with bonus entitlements, 
excluding the Executive Management Team, would benefit from discretion on the profit element of their bonuses at 50% of their 
maximum entitlements. The Executive Management Team (including Carolyn McCall OBE and Chris Kennedy who joined the Company  
in July 2010) informed the Board and Remuneration Committee, that in view of the effect of the further operating problems over the 
summer and the resulting difficulties experienced by customers and staff, they did not consider that it would be appropriate for its 
members to receive bonuses, even if it were deemed to be appropriate to make an adjustment for the effect of volcanic ash.  
Accordingly, no bonus will be paid to the Executive Directors or other members of the Executive Management Team. Had it been 
appropriate for the discretion applied to certain management and staff to be applied in the same way for Executive Directors, Carolyn 
McCall OBE would have received £159,000 and Chris Kennedy would have received £48,000. Andrew Harrison would have received 
£267,000.  easyJet plc

No Non Executive Director has been granted any share options or awards. 
The closing share price of the Company’s ordinary shares at 30 September 2010 was £3.70 and the range during the year ended 
30 September 2010 was £3.40 to £5.00.

F Share Incentive Plan – Matching Shares  
Note 1: The number of shares are calculated according to the scheme rules of individual plans based on the middle-market closing share price of the day prior to grant (except 
for the June 2005 ESOS award which was based on the previous practice of the average middle-market price of the five days prior to grant). As is usual market practice, the 
option price for SAYE awards is determined by the Committee in advance of the award, by reference to the share price following announcements of results. 
Note 2: Participants purchase shares monthly under the plan and the Company provides one matching share for each share purchased. These are first available for vesting three 
years after purchase. 
The potential vesting of outstanding awards if the performance were based on that for the year under review is nil as shown at the end of 
this section. 
The performance criteria for vesting of these share options and awards are as follows: 
Discretionary Share Option Schemes (A&B)  
Based on the average annual growth in earnings per share (EPS), where no shares vest if EPS growth is less than RPI plus 5%, 30% vest 
where EPS growth is RPI plus 5% and 100% vest where EPS growth is RPI plus 20%. Straight-line vesting will occur between these points. 
Long Term Incentive Plan (C&D) 
Awards prior to those made during the year under review were subject to the achievement of the following ROE targets: 
Grant date Basis year
Threshold  
(25% vests) 
Target  
(50% vests) 
Maximum  
(100% vests)
December 2007 30 September 2010 12.5% 14.0% 16.5%
February 2008 30 September 2010 13.5% 15.5% 17.5%
January 2009 (awards up to 100% of salary) 30 September 2011 7.0% 10.0% 13.0%
January 2009 (awards over 100% of salary) 30 September 2011 11.0% 13.0% 15.0%
Straight-line vesting will occur between the threshold, target and maximum targets set out above. The returns on equity shown for the 
February 2008 grant relate to awards in excess of 100% of basic salary. 
The December 2007 and February 2008 award is due to be tested against the performance targets in December 2010. The award has 
performance targets relating to return on equity achieved in the year ended 30 September 2010. However, the targets have not been met 
and the award will not vest.  easyJet plc

The actual targets that applied to the awards of performance shares made to Executive Directors during the year under review were 
as follows: 
Awards up to 100% of salary 
 
Threshold  
(25% vests) 
Target 
(50% vests)

Matching Share Awards 
No matching shares were granted to Executive Directors in the year under review. 
Position against dilution limits 
easyJet complies with the 5% in five years guidelines on share dilution and current dilution is 2.5%. It is the intention of easyJet to source 
shares by market purchase, rather than by the issue of new shares. The requirement for shares under all current share-based schemes will 
be met by market purchased shares (LTIP, Share Saving and Share Incentive Plans). The remaining options under the Discretionary Share 
Option Schemes will continue to be met from new issue shares. 
Potential vesting of outstanding awards 
The table below shows how vesting of outstanding share awards would take place if the performance was based on that for the year 
under review. 
Grant date Actual basis year Vesting
December 2007 30 September 2010 0%

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities 
 
53
The Directors are responsible for preparing the annual report, the Report on Directors’ remuneration and the accounts in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare accounts for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have prepared the Group 
and parent company accounts in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. 
Under company law the Directors must not approve the accounts unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state 
of affairs of the Group and the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing these accounts, the Directors 
are required to: 
– select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
– make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
– state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European Union have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the accounts; and 
– prepare the accounts on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the Company will continue  
in business. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions 
and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and the Group and enable them to ensure that 
the accounts and the Report on Directors’ remuneration comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group accounts, 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing 
the preparation and dissemination of accounts may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.   
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed on page 35 confirm that, to the best of their knowledge: 
– the Group and the Company accounts, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union,  
give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the Group and the Company; and 
– the Directors’ report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Group and the 
Company, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face. 
In the case of each Director in office at the date the Directors’ report is approved and in accordance with Section 418 of the Companies 
Act 2006: 
(a) so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; and 
(b) he has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken as a Director in order to make himself aware of any relevant audit information 
and to establish that the Company’s auditors are aware of that information. 
The annual report on pages 1 to 53 was approved by the Board of Directors and authorised for issue on 15 November 2010 and signed 
on behalf of the Board by:

We have audited the accounts of easyJet plc for the year ended 30 September 2010 which comprise the Consolidated income statement, 
Consolidated statement of comprehensive income, Consolidated statement of financial position, Consolidated statement of changes  
in equity, Consolidated statement of cash flows, Company statement of financial position, Company statement of changes in equity, 
Company statement of cash flows, and the related notes. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation  
is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the parent 
company accounts, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. 
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors  
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ responsibilities set out on page 53, the Directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the accounts and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit the accounts in 
accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the 
Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.  
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 
of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for 
any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed 
by our prior consent in writing. 
Scope of the audit of the accounts 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the accounts sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the 
accounts are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; 
the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the accounts. 
Opinion on accounts 
In our opinion:  
– the accounts give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Company’s affairs as at 30 September 2010 and of the 
Group’s profit and the Group’s and Company’s cash flows for the year then ended; 
– the Group accounts have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;  
– the Company accounts have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and as applied  
in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and 
– the accounts have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group accounts, 
Article 4 of the lAS Regulation.  
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006  
In our opinion:  
– the part of the Report on Directors’ remuneration to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and  
– the information given in the Directors’ report for the financial year for which the accounts are prepared is consistent with the accounts. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception  
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:  
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:  
– adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or  
– the Company accounts and the part of the Report on Directors’ remuneration to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting 
records and returns; or  
– certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or  
– we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:  
– the Directors’ statement, set out on page 23, in relation to going concern; and 
– the parts of the Corporate governance statement relating to the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the June 2008 
Combined Code specified for our review.

1 Accounting policies 
Statement of compliance 
easyJet plc (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (“easyJet” or the “Group” as applicable) is a low cost airline carrier operating principally 
in Europe. The Company is a public limited company whose shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol EZJ 
and is incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom. The address of its registered office is Hangar 89, London Luton Airport, 
Bedfordshire LU2 9PF.  
The accounts are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union, 
taking into account International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) interpretations and those parts of the Companies 
Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.  
Basis of preparation 
The accounts are prepared based on the historical cost convention except for certain financial assets and liabilities including derivative 
financial instruments that are measured at fair value. 
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all years presented in these accounts. 
In adopting the going concern basis for preparing the accounts, the Directors have considered the business activities as set out on pages 8 
to 13 as well as easyJet’s principal risks and uncertainties as set out on pages 25 to 27. Based on easyJet’s cash flow forecasts and 
projections, the Board is satisfied that easyJet will be able to operate within the level of its facilities and available cash for the foreseeable 
future. For this reason easyJet continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing its accounts. 
Significant judgements, estimates and critical accounting policies 
The preparation of accounts in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions 
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the accounts and the reported amounts of income and expenses 
during the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of the amount, events or actions may 
mean that actual results ultimately differ from those estimates, and these differences may be material. The estimates and the underlying 
assumptions are reviewed regularly. 
The following three accounting policies are considered critical accounting policies as they require a significant amount of management 
judgement and the results are material to easyJet’s accounts. 
Goodwill and landing rights (note 7) 
Goodwill and landing rights are tested for impairment at least annually. easyJet has one cash-generating unit, being its route network. 
In making this assessment, easyJet has considered the manner in which the business is managed including the centralised nature of its 
operations and the ability to open or close routes and redeploy aircraft and crew across the whole route network.  
The value in use of the cash-generating unit is determined by discounting future net cash flows to their present value. When applying this 
method, easyJet relies on a number of estimates including its strategic plans, fuel prices, exchange rates, long-term economic growth rates 
for the principal countries in which it operates and its pre-tax weighted average cost of capital. 
Aircraft maintenance provisions (note 17) 
easyJet incurs liabilities for maintenance costs in respect of aircraft leased under operating leases during the term of the lease. These arise 
from legal and constructive contractual obligations relating to the condition of the aircraft when it is returned to the lessor. To discharge 
these obligations, easyJet will also normally need to carry out one heavy maintenance check on each of the engines and the airframe 
during the lease term.  
A charge is made in the income statement based on hours or cycles flown to provide for the cost of these obligations. Estimates required 
include the likely utilisation of the aircraft, the expected cost of the heavy maintenance check at the time it is expected to occur, the 
condition of the aircraft and the lifespan of life-limited parts. 
The bases of all estimates are reviewed annually, and also when information becomes available that is capable of causing a material change 
to an estimate, such as renegotiation of end of lease return conditions, increased or decreased utilisation, or changes in the cost of heavy 
maintenance services. 
Tax (note 5) 
In drawing up the accounts, estimates are made of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities for each jurisdiction in which easyJet 
operates. These estimates are affected by transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination was uncertain at the time the 
accounts were finalised. The issues involved are often complex and may take an extended period to resolve. Where the final tax outcome 
of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the current and deferred tax assets 
and liabilities in the period in which such determination is made.  Overview Business review Governance Accounts Other information

Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated accounts incorporate those of easyJet plc and its subsidiaries for the years ended 30 September 2009 and 2010. 
A subsidiary is an entity controlled by easyJet. Control exists when easyJet has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial  
and operating policies of an entity so as to benefit from its activities. 
Intragroup balances, transactions and any unrealised gains and losses arising from intragroup transactions are eliminated in preparing the 
consolidated accounts. 
Foreign currencies 
The primary economic environment in which a subsidiary operates determines its functional currency. The consolidated accounts of 
easyJet are presented in sterling, which is the Company’s functional currency and the Group’s presentation currency. Certain subsidiaries 
have operations that are primarily influenced by a currency other than sterling. Exchange differences arising on the translation of these 
foreign operations are taken to reserves until all or part of the interest is sold, when the relevant portion of the exchange gains or losses is 
recognised in the income statement. Profits and losses of foreign operations are translated into sterling at average rates of exchange during 
the year, since this approximates the rates on the dates of the transactions. 
Transactions arising in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets 
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling using the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date 
and (except where the asset or liability is designated as a cash flow hedge) the gains or losses on translation are included in the income 
statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at foreign exchange rates 
ruling at the dates the transactions were effected. 
Revenue recognition 
Revenues comprise the invoiced value of airline services (net of air passenger duty, VAT and discounts), and ancillary revenue. 
Passenger revenue arises from the sale of flight seats and is recognised when the service is provided. Unearned revenue represents 
flight seats sold but not yet flown and is included in trade and other payables until it is realised in the income statement when the service 
is provided. 
Ancillary revenue is generally recognised when the flight to which it relates departs. Certain types of ancillary revenue are recognised 
at the time the benefit of the service provided passes to the customer. 
Amounts paid by “no-show” customers are recognised as passenger or ancillary revenue as appropriate when the booked service  
is provided as such customers are not generally entitled to change flights or seek refunds once a flight has departed.  
Business combinations 
Business combinations in prior years were accounted for by applying the purchase method. The cost of the acquisition was measured  
at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given and liabilities incurred or assumed plus any costs directly 
attributable to the business combination. The acquiree’s identifiable assets and liabilities were recognised at their fair values at the 
acquisition date. There have been no business combinations since the effective date of IFRS 3 Business Combinations (Revised).  
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business 
combination over easyJet’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.  
Goodwill and other intangible assets 
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. It has an indefinite expected useful life and is tested for impairment  
at least annually or where there is any indication of impairment.  
Landing rights are stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. They are considered to have an indefinite useful life as they will 
remain available for use for the foreseeable future provided minimum utilisation requirements are observed, and are tested for impairment 
at least annually or where there is any indication of impairment. 
Other intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation, which is calculated to write-off their cost, less estimated residual 
value, on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives. Expected useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually.

Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost, less 
estimated residual value, of assets on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives. Expected useful lives are reviewed annually. 
 Expected useful life 
Aircraft 23 years 
Aircraft spares 14 years 
Aircraft improvements 3–7 years 
Aircraft – prepaid maintenance 3–10 years 
Leasehold improvements 5–10 years or the length of lease if shorter 
Fixtures, fittings and equipment 
 
3 years or length of lease of property where equipment is used 
if shorter 
Computer hardware 5 years 
Items held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their expected useful lives, as shown above. 
Residual values, where applicable, are reviewed annually against prevailing market rates at the balance sheet date for equivalently aged 
assets and depreciation rates adjusted accordingly on a prospective basis. The carrying value is reviewed for impairment if events or 
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. 
An element of the cost of a new aircraft is attributed on acquisition to prepaid maintenance and is depreciated over a period ranging from 
three to ten years from the date of manufacture. Subsequent costs incurred which lend enhancement to future periods, such as long-term 
scheduled maintenance and major overhaul of aircraft and engines, are capitalised and depreciated over the length of period benefiting 
from these enhancements. All other maintenance costs are charged to the income statement as incurred.  
The cost of new aircraft comprises the invoiced price of the aircraft from the supplier less the estimated value of other assets received  
by easyJet for nil consideration. These other assets principally comprise cash (recognised as an asset) and aircraft spares and service credits. 
Pre delivery and option payments made in respect of aircraft are recorded in property, plant and equipment at cost. These amounts are 
not amortised. 
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the net proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised in the  
income statement. 
Impairment of non-current assets 
An impairment loss is recognised to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the higher of the asset’s fair value less cost to sell and its 
value in use. Impairment losses recognised on assets other than goodwill are only reversed where changes in the estimates used result in 
an increase in recoverable amount. Impairment losses recognised on goodwill are not reversed.  
Leases 
Non-contingent operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease. A number 
of operating leases require easyJet to make contingent rental payments based on variable interest rates; these are expensed as incurred. 
easyJet enters into sale and leaseback transactions whereby it sells to a third party rights to acquire aircraft. On delivery of the aircraft, 
easyJet subsequently leases the aircraft back, by way of an operating lease. Surpluses arising on disposal, where the price that the aircraft 
is sold for is above fair value, are recognised in deferred income and amortised on a straight-line basis over the lease term of the asset.  
Finance leases, which transfer to easyJet substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item, are recognised 
at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. 
Any directly attributable costs of entering into financing sale and leasebacks are included in the value of the asset recognised. Lease 
payments are apportioned between the finance charges and the reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest 
on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are included in interest payable and other financing charges.  Overview Business review Governance Accounts Other information

Financial instruments 
Financial instruments are recognised when easyJet becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the relevant instrument and 
derecognised when it ceases to be a party to such provisions.  
Where market values are not available, the fair value of financial instruments is calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest 
rates and by applying year end exchange rates. 
Non-derivative financial assets 
Non-derivative financial assets are recorded at amortised cost and include loan notes, trade receivables, cash and money market deposits. 
Investments in equity instruments are carried at cost where fair value cannot be reliably measured due to significant variability in the range 
of reasonable fair value estimates.  
Restricted cash comprises cash deposits which have restrictions governing their use and is classified as a current or non-current asset based 
on the estimated remaining length of the restriction. Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash held in bank accounts with no access 
restrictions and bank or money market deposits repayable on demand or maturing within three months of inception. Interest income  
on cash and money market deposits is recognised using the effective interest method. 
Impairment losses are recognised on financial assets carried at amortised cost where there is objective evidence that an impairment loss 
has been incurred. The amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of 
future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. 
If, subsequently, the amount of the impairment loss decreases, and the decrease can be related objectively to an event that occurred after 
the impairment was recognised, the appropriate portion of the loss is reversed. Both impairment losses and reversals are recognised in the 
income statement as components of net finance charges. 
Non-derivative financial liabilities  
Non-derivative financial liabilities are initially recorded at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs, and subsequently at amortised 
cost. Interest expense on loans is recognised using the effective interest method. 
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless there is an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months 
after the balance sheet date. 
Derivative financial instruments 
Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value. 
Derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges are used to mitigate operating and investing transaction exposures to 
movements in jet fuel prices and currency exchange rates. Hedge accounting is applied to these instruments. 
Changes in intrinsic fair value are recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent that the cash flow hedges are determined  
to be effective. All other changes in fair value are recognised immediately in the income statement. Where the hedged item results in a 
non-financial asset or liability the accumulated gains and losses previously recognised in other comprehensive income form part of the 
initial carrying amount of the asset or liability. Otherwise accumulated gains and losses are recognised in the income statement in the  
same period in which the hedged items affect the income statement. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when a hedging instrument is derecognised (e.g. through expiry or disposal), or no longer qualifies  
for hedge accounting. Where the hedged item is a highly probable forecast transaction, the related gains and losses remain in other 
comprehensive income until the transaction takes place. 
When a hedged future transaction is no longer expected to occur, any related gains and losses previously recognised in other 
comprehensive income are immediately recognised in the income statement. 
Financial guarantees 
If a claim on a financial guarantee given to a third party becomes probable, the obligation is recognised at fair value. For subsequent 
measurement, the carrying amount is the higher of initial measurement and best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the 
obligation on the statement of financial position date.  easyJet plc

Tax  
Tax expense in the income statement consists of current and deferred tax. The charge for current tax is based on the results for the  
year as adjusted for income that is exempt and expenses that are not deductible using tax rates that are applicable to the taxable income. 
Tax is recognised in the income statement except when it relates to items credited or charged directly to other comprehensive income  
or shareholders’ equity, in which case it is recognised in other comprehensive income or shareholders’ equity. 
Deferred tax is provided in full on temporary differences relating to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, where it is probable that 
the recovery or settlement will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less, tax in the future, with the following exceptions: 
– where the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other 
assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither taxable income nor accounting profit.  
– deferred tax arising on investments in subsidiaries is not recognised where easyJet is able to control the reversal of the temporary 
difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.  
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which recovery of 
assets and settlement of liabilities are expected to take place, based on tax rates or laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance 
sheet date. 
Deferred tax assets represent amounts recoverable in future periods in respect of deductible temporary differences, losses and tax credits 
carried forward. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that there will be suitable taxable profits from which 
they can be deducted. 
Deferred tax liabilities represent the amount of income taxes payable in future periods in respect of taxable temporary differences. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and it is the intention to settle these on a net basis. 
Aircraft maintenance provisions 
The accounting for the cost of providing major airframe and certain engine maintenance checks for owned and finance leased aircraft  
is described in the accounting policy for property, plant and equipment. 
easyJet has contractual obligations to maintain aircraft held under operating leases. Provisions are created over the term of the lease based 
on the estimated future costs of major airframe checks, engine shop visits and end of lease liabilities. These costs are discounted to present 
value where the amount of the discount is considered material. 
A number of leases also require easyJet to pay supplemental rent to the lessor. Payments may be either a fixed monthly sum up to a cap 
or are based on usage. The purpose of these payments is to provide the lessor with collateral should an aircraft be returned in a condition 
that does not meet the requirements of the lease. Supplemental rent is either refunded when qualifying maintenance is performed, or is 
offset against end of lease liabilities. Where the amount of supplemental rent paid exceeds the estimated amount recoverable from the 
lessor, provision is made for the non-recoverable amount. 
Employee benefits 
easyJet contributes to defined contribution pension schemes for the benefit of employees. easyJet has no further payment obligations once 
the contributions have been paid. The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of easyJet in independently administered 
funds. easyJet’s contributions are charged to the income statement in the year in which they are incurred. 
The expected cost of compensated holidays is recognised at the time that the related employees’ services are provided. 
Share-based payments 
easyJet has a number of equity-settled share incentive schemes. The fair value of share options is measured at the date of grant using the 
Binomial Lattice option pricing model. The fair value of awards under the Long Term Incentive and Share Incentive Plans is the share price 
at the date of grant. 
The fair value of the estimated number of options and awards that are expected to vest is expensed to the income statement on a 
straight-line basis over the period that employees’ services are rendered, with a corresponding increase in shareholders’ equity. Where 
performance criteria attached to the share options and awards are not met, any cumulative expense previously recognised is reversed. 
The social security obligations payable in connection with grant of the share options is an integral part of the grant itself and the charge is 
treated as a cash-settled transaction. 
easyJet settles share awards under the Long Term Incentive and Share Incentive Plans by purchasing its own shares on the market through 
employee share trusts. The cost of such purchases is deducted from retained earnings in the period that the transaction occurs.  Overview Business review Governance Accounts Other information

Segmental disclosures 
easyJet has one operating segment, being its route network, based on management information provided to the Executive Management 
Team; which is easyJet’s Chief Operating Decision Maker. Resource allocation decisions are made for the benefit of the route network 
as a whole, rather than for individual routes within the network. Performance of the network is assessed based on the consolidated profit 
or loss before tax for the year. 
Revenue is allocated to geographic segments on the following bases: 
– Revenue earned from passengers is allocated according to the location of the first departure airport on each booking;  
– Commission revenue earned from partners is allocated according to the domicile of each partner.  
Assets held for sale 
Where assets are available for sale in their current condition, and their disposal is highly probable, they are reclassified as held for sale 
and are measured at the lower of their carrying value less costs to sell. Depreciation ceases at the point of their reclassification from  
non-current assets.

The prior year adjustments in 2010 reflect the resolution and reassessment of various tax matters following discussions with the UK tax 
authorities. This has resulted in the net credits to prior year current tax and debits to prior year deferred tax referred to above. During 
2009, agreement was reached with the UK tax authorities on certain tax matters, resulting in the release to the income statement  
of £30.7 million relating to current tax liabilities provided for in prior years. 
Current tax liabilities at 30 September 2010 amounted to £27.5 million (2009: £57.7 million), of which £25.6 million relates to years prior 
to 2010 which remain open with the relevant tax authorities. As in prior years a significant portion of this balance may not be settled in 
cash but accounted for as a movement in the deferred tax liability. During the year ended 30 September 2010, cash tax paid amounted  
to £14.1 million (2009: £9.4 million), which principally comprises foreign taxes paid.

It is estimated that deferred tax liabilities of approximately £12.2 million (2009: assets of £7.4 million) will reverse during the next financial 
year. Deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset where they relate to taxes levied by the same taxation authority. There are no 
unrecognised deferred tax assets. 
6 Earnings per share 
Basic earnings per share has been calculated by dividing the profit for the year by the weighted average number of shares in issue during 
the year after adjusting for shares held in employee share trusts.  
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential 
shares. Share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Company’s ordinary shares 
during the year are considered to be dilutive potential shares. Where share options are exercisable based on performance criteria and those 
performance criteria have been met during the year, these options are included in the calculation of dilutive potential shares.

easyJet has one cash-generating unit, being its route network. The recoverable amount of goodwill and other assets with indefinite 
expected useful lives has been determined based on value in use calculations of the route network. 
Pre-tax cash flow projections have been derived from the five-year strategic plan approved by the Board in November 2010, using the 
following key assumptions: 
Pre-tax discount rate (derived from weighted average cost of capital)  9–10%
Fuel price, per metric tonne, in US dollars 720
Exchange rates:  
US dollar 1.50
Euro 1.20
Swiss franc 1.65
Both fuel price and exchange rates are volatile in nature, and the assumptions used represent management’s view of reasonable average 
rates. Operating margins are sensitive to significant changes in these rates.  easyJet plc

7 Goodwill and other intangible assets continued 
Cash flow projections beyond the forecast period have been extrapolated using growth rate scenarios ranging from zero up to an 
estimated average of long term economic growth rates for the principal countries in which easyJet operates. No impairment resulted 
from any of these scenarios. 
No reasonably possible combination of changes to the key assumptions above would result in the carrying value of the cash-generating 
unit exceeding its recoverable amount.

During the year ended 30 September 2010, six aircraft were sold and leased back under operating leases. Two of these aircraft were 
acquired during the year ended 30 September 2009. The amounts shown above under the caption “aircraft sold and leased back”  
relate to these two aircraft and deposits paid on the other four aircraft before 1 October 2009. 
During the year ended 30 September 2009, five A319 aircraft were transferred back to property, plant and equipment from assets  
held for sale. 
The net book value of aircraft includes £153.2 million (2009: £148.5 million) relating to advance and option payments for future deliveries 
of aircraft. This amount is not depreciated. 
Aircraft with a net book value of £1,107.6 million (2009: £984.5 million) are mortgaged to lenders as loan security. 
Aircraft with a net book value of £105.4 million (2009: £71.1 million) are held under finance leases. 
easyJet is contractually committed to the acquisition of 47 (2009: 74) Airbus A320 family aircraft with a total list price of US$2.2 billion 
(2009: US$3.4 billion) before escalations and discounts, for delivery in the period to May 2013. 
9 Loan notes 
In 2001, easyJet in consortium with six other UK airlines formed The Airline Group Limited in order to acquire a non-controlling interest  
in NATS, the company that owns the UK air traffic control system. easyJet’s investment is principally in the form of unsecured loan notes 
bearing interest at a fixed rate of 8%. Interest receivable is settled by the issue of additional loan notes. Redemption is governed by a 
priority agreement among the consortium members.

11 Assets held for sale 
Following the acquisition of GB Airways in the year ended 30 September 2008, seven A321 aircraft were classified as assets held for sale. 
During the year ended 30 September 2009 three of these aircraft were sold realising a net profit of £11.0 million. At 30 September 2009, 
easyJet continued to market the remaining four A321 aircraft and although the period over which the assets were classified as held for sale 
exceeded one year, the Directors considered that this classification remained appropriate. 
easyJet has entered into an arrangement to dispose of the remaining four aircraft. Subsequent to the year end, in November 2010,  
the legal title to these four aircraft was transferred. The total cash consideration to be received is £75.2 million. easyJet has incurred certain 
costs in connection with the disposal and the aggregate net loss on the disposal of £7.0 million has been charged to the income statement 
in the year ended 30 September 2010.  easyJet plc

Options vested in tranches of 25% ending on the third anniversary of easyJet’s admission to the Official List on 22 November 2000, 
and have now expired. 
Discretionary schemes 
Options awarded in 2001 in connection with easyJet’s admission to the Official List had a three year vesting period and no performance 
conditions. 
All other awards had a three year vesting period and performance conditions based on growth in earnings per share. All options expire 
ten years after grant. 
Long Term Incentive Plan  
The plan is open, by invitation, to Executive Directors and senior management, and provides for annual awards of performance shares 
worth up to 200% of salary each year and matching shares linked to the investment of up to 50% of annual bonus in easyJet shares. 
The vesting of these awards is dependent on return on equity targets being achieved. 
Sharesave 
Sharesave is open to all employees on the UK payroll. Participants may elect to save up to £250 per month under a three year savings 
contract. An option is granted by the Company to buy shares at a discount of 20% from market price at the time of the grant. At the end 
of the savings period, a tax free bonus is applied to the savings and the option becomes exercisable for a period of six months.  
Employees who are not paid through the UK payroll may save under similar terms and conditions, albeit without tax benefits. 
Share incentive plan 
The share incentive plan is open to all employees on the UK payroll. Participants may invest up to £1,500 of their pre-tax salary each year 
to purchase partnership shares in easyJet. For each partnership share acquired easyJet purchases a matching share. Employees must remain 
with easyJet for three years from the date of purchase of each partnership share in order to qualify for the matching share, and for five 
years for the shares to be transferred to them tax free. The employee is entitled to dividends and to vote at shareholder meetings.  
Employees on the Swiss payroll may save under similar terms and conditions, albeit without tax benefits.  Overview Business review Governance Accounts Other information

Share price is the closing share price from the last working day prior to the date of grant.  
Exercise price for the discretionary schemes was determined using a five-day weighted average price. For the Sharesave scheme,  
a 20% discount has been given between share price and exercise price. 
Expected volatility is based on historical volatility over a period comparable to the expected life of each type of option. 
In all cases the assumed dividend yield is zero as easyJet does not currently pay dividends. 
Levels of early exercises and lapses are estimated using historical averages. 
The weighted average fair value of shares granted under the share incentive plan during the year was £4.15 (2009: £3.00).  easyJet plc

Fair value calculation methodology 
Derivative financial instruments are forward contracts and are valued based on market rates and market-accepted models. Fair value for 
financial instruments held at amortised cost has been estimated by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest rates and by applying year 
end exchange rates.  easyJet plc

For currency contracts, quantity represents the nominal value of currency contracts held, disclosed in the contract currency. For jet fuel 
contracts, quantity represents contracted metric tonnes.  
All derivative financial instruments are in level 2 of the IFRS 7 fair value hierarchy. 
Derivatives designated as cash flow hedges 
All derivatives to which hedge accounting is applied are designated as cash flow hedges.  
Changes in fair value are recognised directly in other comprehensive income, to the extent that they are effective, with the ineffective 
portion being recognised in the income statement.  
Where the hedged item is a non financial asset or liability, the accumulated gains and losses previously recognised in other comprehensive 
income are included in the carrying value of that asset or liability. Otherwise accumulated gains and losses are recognised in the income 
statement in the same period in which the hedged items affects the income statement. 
easyJet uses forward contracts to hedge US dollar transaction currency risk (comprising fuel, leasing and maintenance payments and, in  
the prior year only, capital expenditure), jet fuel price risk and euro and Swiss franc revenues. Where these hedges are assessed as highly 
effective, gains and losses are deferred in other comprehensive income and transferred to the income statement or cost of property,  
plant and equipment when the related cash flow occurs.   Overview Business review Governance Accounts Other information

23 Financial risk and capital management 
easyJet is exposed to financial risks including fluctuations in exchange rates, jet fuel prices and interest rates. Financial risk management 
aims to limit these market risks with selected derivative hedging instruments being used for this purpose. easyJet policy is not to trade 
in derivatives but to use the instruments to hedge anticipated exposure. Gains and losses arising on derivative financial instruments 
designated as hedging instruments are offset by the outcome of the underlying exposure being hedged. In addition to market risks, easyJet 
is exposed to credit and liquidity risk. 
The Board is responsible for setting financial risk and capital management policy and objectives which are implemented by the treasury 
function on a day-to-day basis. The policy outlines the approach to risk management and also states the instruments and time periods 
which the treasury function is authorised to use in managing financial risks. The policy is regularly reviewed to ensure best practice, 
however there have been no significant changes during the current year. 
Capital management 
The objective of capital management is to ensure that easyJet is able to continue as a going concern whilst delivering shareholder 
expectations of a strong capital base as well as returning benefits for other stakeholders and optimising the cost of capital.  
easyJet manages its capital structure in response to changes in both economic conditions and strategic objectives. The cash and net debt 
position, together with the maturity profile of existing debt, is monitored to ensure the continuity of funding. During the year funding 
totalling $837 million was put in place of which $333 million was utilised during the year.  
The principal measure used by easyJet to manage capital risk is the gearing ratio of debt (defined as debt plus seven times aircraft 
operating lease payments less cash, including money market deposits and restricted cash) to shareholders’ equity. Gearing decreased in the 
year from 38% to 32%, principally due to the strong operating cash flow. 
Liquidity risk management 
The objective of liquidity risk management is to ensure sufficient cash resources and the availability of funding as required. easyJet holds 
financial assets either for which there is a liquid market or which are expected to generate cash inflows that are available to meet liquidity 
needs.  
easyJet continues to hold significant cash and liquid funds to mitigate the impact of potential business disruption events with policy stating 
an absolute minimum level of liquidity that must be maintained at all times. Total cash (including restricted cash) and money market 
deposits at 30 September 2010 was £1,227.5 million (2009: £1,147.2 million). Surplus funds are invested in high quality short-term 
liquid instruments, usually money market funds or bank deposits.  
In addition, easyJet has committed undrawn bank facilities of $754 million (2009: $528 million), comprising a $250 million revolving credit 
facility and $504 million of mortgage and finance lease facilities available to finance a significant proportion of the aircraft due to be 
delivered during the next eighteen months. Since the year end further funding totalling $237 million has been arranged.  Overview Business review Governance Accounts Other information

The maturity profile has been calculated based on spot rates for the US dollar, euro, Swiss franc and jet fuel at close of business on  
30 September each year. 
Credit risk management 
easyJet is exposed to credit risk arising from liquid funds, derivative financial instruments and trade and other receivables. Credit risk 
management aims to reduce the risk of default through setting credit exposure limits to counterparties based on credit ratings, which also 
determine the maximum period of investment. Counterparty exposures are regularly reviewed and adjusted as necessary. Accordingly, the 
probability of material loss arising in the event of non-performance by counterparties is considered to be low.  
Credit risk is limited to the carrying amount recognised at the balance sheet date. Disclosure relating to the credit quality of trade and 
other receivables is detailed in note 12. The credit risk for liquid funds and other short-term financial assets is considered negligible, since 
the counterparties are reputable banks with external credit ratings. For deposits with financial institutions, internal limits are placed on the 
maximum exposure to individual counterparties and a minimum external credit rating of A is required. 
Foreign currency risk management 
The principal exposure to currency exchange rates arises from fluctuations in both the US dollar and euro rates which impact operating, 
financing and investing activities. The aim of foreign currency risk management is to reduce the impact of exchange rate volatility on the 
results of easyJet. Foreign exchange exposure arising from transactions in various currencies is reduced through a policy of matching, 
as far as possible, receipts and payments in each individual currency. Any remaining significant anticipated exposure is managed through 
the use of forward foreign exchange contracts. In addition, easyJet has substantial US dollar balance sheet liabilities, partly offset by holding 
US dollar cash; any residual net liability is managed through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts. 
Financing and interest rate risk management 
Interest rate cash flow risk arises on floating rate borrowings and cash investments. 
Interest rate risk management policy aims to provide certainty in a proportion of financing while retaining the opportunity to benefit from 
interest rate reductions. Interest rate policy is used to achieve the desired mix of fixed and floating rate debt. All borrowings are at floating 
interest rates repricing every three to six months. A significant proportion of US dollar loans by value are matched with US dollar cash, 
with the cash being invested to coincide with the repricing of the debt. Operating leases are a mix of fixed and floating rates. Of the 
operating leases in place at 30 September 2010 approximately 66% of lease payments were based on fixed interest rates and 34% were 
based on floating interest rates (2009: 60% fixed, 40% floating).  
All debt is asset related, reflecting the capital intensive nature of the airline industry and the attractiveness of aircraft as security to lenders. 
These factors are also reflected in the medium term profile of easyJet’s borrowings and operating leases. During the year nine aircraft were 
cash acquired (2009: four aircraft).  easyJet plc

Fuel price risk management 
easyJet is exposed to fuel price risk. The objective of the fuel price risk management policy is to provide protection against sudden 
and significant increases in jet fuel prices, thus mitigating volatility in the income statement in the short term. In order to manage the risk 
exposure, forward contracts are used in line with policy to hedge between 50% and 80% of estimated exposures up to 12 months in 
advance, and to hedge between 20% and 50% of estimated exposures from 13 up to 24 months in advance. In exceptional market 
conditions, the Board may accelerate or limit the implementation of the hedging policy. 
Market risk sensitivity analysis 
Financial instruments affected by market risk include borrowings, deposits, trade and other receivables, trade and other payables and 
derivative financial instruments. The following analysis illustrates the sensitivity of such financial instruments to changes in relevant foreign 
exchange rates, interest rates and fuel prices. It should be noted that the analysis reflects the impact on profit or loss after tax for the year 
and other comprehensive income on financial instruments held at the reporting date. It does not reflect changes in revenue or costs that 
may result from changing currency rates, interest rates or fuel prices. Sensitivity is calculated based on all other variables remaining 
constant. The analysis is considered representative of easyJet’s exposure over the 12 month period. 
The currency sensitivity analysis is based on easyJet’s foreign currency financial instruments held at each balance sheet date taking into 
account forward exchange contracts that offset effects from changes in currency exchange rates. The increased sensitivity in the US dollar 
and euro rate represents sterling weakening against each variable currency with the –10% sensitivity reflecting stronger sterling.  
The interest rate analysis assumes a 1% change in interest rates over the reporting year applied to end of year financial instruments. 
The fuel price sensitivity analysis is based on easyJet’s fuel related derivative financial instruments held at the end of each reporting period.  
The impact of a 1% increase in interest rates and a 10% increase in the fuel price is disclosed. A corresponding decrease results in an equal 
and opposite impact on the income statement and other comprehensive income in both reporting periods. 
Sensitivities are calculated based on a reasonably possible change in the rate applied to the value of financial instruments held at each 
balance sheet date.

25 Contingent liabilities 
easyJet is involved in various disputes or litigation in the normal course of business. Whilst the result of such disputes cannot be predicted 
with certainty, management considers that the ultimate resolution of these disputes will not have a material effect on easyJet’s financial 
position, results or cash flows. 
At 30 September 2010 easyJet had outstanding letters of credit, guarantees and performance bonds totalling £32.1 million (2009:  
£29.4 million), of which £27.7 million (2009: £28.7 million) expires within one year. The fair value of these instruments at each year end 
was negligible. 
No amount is recognised on the statement of financial position in respect of any of these financial instruments as it is not probable that 
there will be an outflow of resources.

Southern Europe comprises countries lying wholly or mainly south of the border between Italy and Switzerland, plus France. 
easyJet’s non-current assets principally comprise its fleet of aircraft (including 62 held under operating leases). All of these aircraft are 
registered in the United Kingdom except for 15 registered in Switzerland. These assets are used flexibly across the entire route network, 
and accordingly there is no suitable basis for allocating them to geographic segments.  Overview Business review Governance Accounts Other information

27 Subsequent events 
On 11 October 2010, easyJet announced that, subject to shareholder approval in an Extraordinary General Meeting (‘EGM’), agreement 
had been reached to resolve its ongoing dispute with easyGroup IP Licensing Ltd (‘easyGroup’) and Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou over the 
terms and operation of the ‘easyJet’ brand licence. 
Under the present brand licence terms, the Company pays easyGroup an annual fee of £1 for use of the ‘easyJet’ brand, but is subject to 
certain limitations, for example, in relation to the extent of revenues to be derived from ancillary activities (the ‘75/25 rule’). In addition 
easyJet has made contributions totalling £0.4 million in the last two years towards the costs incurred by easyGroup in protecting the ‘easy’ 
brand name. 
In addition, easyGroup currently has the right to appoint up to two non-executive directors of the Company and Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou 
has the right to appoint himself Chairman of the Company. At the forthcoming EGM a special resolution will be proposed to amend the 
Articles of Association of the Company to remove these rights. If this resolution is passed, easyGroup will have no rights beyond those 
afforded to an equivalent shareholder by the general law. 
The principal effects of the variations to the brand licence are as follows: 
– The Company will continue to have exclusive worldwide rights to use the easyJet brand in relation to operating passenger carrying 
flights using fixed wing aircraft under an AOC for a period of 50 years; 
– The Company will commit to the brand for a minimum of ten years, with any earlier termination requiring a payment to easyGroup  
of the residue of the 10-year royalty (based on a set formula); 
– The Company will pay an annual royalty of 0.25% of total revenue, fixed at £3.9 million for the year ending 30 September 2011 
and £4.95 million for the year ending 30 September 2012; 
– The 75/25 Rule and other commercial and operational freedoms and limitations will be replaced by various new rights, freedoms and 
limitations on the conduct its commercial operations to the mutual benefit of both the Company and easyGroup; 
– The Company will adopt certain service level indices. The service levels will be reviewed annually and performance against these will be 
reported to easyGroup on a monthly basis. Failure to meet service levels will entitle easyGroup to serve a cure notice and ultimately a 
termination notice for continued failure to comply; 
– There will be a new brand protection regime whereby enforcement costs to protect the ‘easy’ and ‘easyJet’ brands will be shared 
between the Company and easyGroup in a ratio of 10:1 up to a combined cost contribution of £5.5 million per annum for any individual 
action. All costs over this limit will be met by the Company, which will then have the right to conduct any such actions; and 
– easyGroup will have greater freedom to license or use the ‘easy’ brand to provide tour operator, travel agency and flight price 
comparison services potentially in competition with easyJet. 
Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou has entered into a separate agreement under which, in return for a fee of £300,000 per annum for a period 
of five years from 1 October 2010, he has undertaken: 
– To procure that easyGroup does not license the ‘easy’ brand to an ATOL holder on terms permitting the sale of airline seats for  
a period of 12 months; 
– Not to sell the shares in easyGroup or the easyJet brand or any part of it for a period of two years and not to any airline (or the owner 
of any airline) licensed in the EEA or Switzerland for a period of three years; 
– Not to acquire an interest in any other airline licensed in any EEA country (nor Switzerland) for a period of two years (unless the 
interest is less than 10% and he is not involved in an executive capacity); 
– Not to use his own name or a derivation of it to brand any other airline which flies to or from any country in Europe for a period 
of five years; and 
– To abide by the mutual brand respect provisions and certain public communication protocols agreed with easyJet.

a) Income statement and statement of comprehensive income 
In accordance with Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own income 
statement. The Company’s profit for the year was £24.5 million (2009: £263.6 million). Included in this amount are dividends received  
of £19.6 million (2009: £261.7 million), which are recognised when the right to receive payment is established. The Company recognised 
no other income or expenses in either the current or prior year. 
The Company has seven employees at 30 September 2010 (2009: nine). These are the Non Executive Directors of easyJet plc; their 
remuneration is paid by easyJet Airline Company Limited. The Executive Directors of easyJet plc are employed and paid by easyJet Airline 
Company Limited. Details of Directors’ remuneration are disclosed in the Report on Directors’ remuneration and in note 4 to the 
consolidated accounts. 
b) Investments in subsidiary undertakings 
Investments in subsidiary undertakings were as follows: 
 
2010 
£ million 
2009
£ million
At 1 October 65.7  700.2 
Investments 200.0  – 
Capital contributions 4.8 7.4 
Capital distributions –  (641.9)
At 30 September 270.5 65.7 
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost, less any provision for impairment. Where subsidiary undertakings incur charges for share-
based payments in respect of share options and awards granted by the Company, a capital contribution in the same amount is recognised 
as an investment in subsidiary undertakings with a corresponding credit to shareholders’ equity. 
During the prior year a Group reorganisation was effected whereby a number of subsidiaries distributed their retained earnings and the 
majority of their share capital to easyJet plc. These distributions, being satisfied by the transfer of amounts due from another subsidiary 
undertaking, are non-cash transactions and have therefore been excluded from the Company cash flow statement. 
The principal trading subsidiary undertakings, all of which are included in the consolidated accounts, are shown below. A full list of Group 
companies will be included in the Company’s next annual return, in accordance with Section 410 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Country of incorporation Principal activity Class and percentage of ordinary shares held
easyJet Airline Company Limited England and Wales Airline operator 100%
easyJet Switzerland S.A. Switzerland Airline operator 49%
easyJet Aircraft Company Limited Cayman Islands Aircraft trading and leasing 100%
easyJet Sterling Limited Cayman Islands Aircraft trading and leasing 100%
easyJet Leasing Limited Cayman Islands Aircraft trading and leasing 100%
The Company has a 49% interest in easyJet Switzerland S.A. with an option that expires in 2014 to acquire the remaining 51%.  
easyJet Switzerland S.A. is consolidated as a subsidiary on the basis that the Company exercises a dominant influence over the 
undertaking. A non-controlling interest has not been reflected in the accounts on the basis that holders of the remaining 51% of the 
shares have no entitlement to any dividends from that holding and the Company has an option to acquire those shares for a 
predetermined consideration.   easyJet plc

d) Guarantees and contingent liabilities 
The Company has given a formal undertaking to the Civil Aviation Authority to guarantee the payment and discharge of all liabilities 
of easyJet Airline Company Limited, a subsidiary of the Company. The guarantee is required for that company to maintain its operating 
licence under Regulation 3 of the Licensing of Air Carriers Regulations 1992. 
The Company has issued a guarantee in favour of easyJet Airline Company Limited, a subsidiary undertaking, in relation to the processing 
of credit card transactions, and also in respect of hedging transactions carried out according to treasury policy. 
The Company has guaranteed the contractual obligations of easyJet Airline Company Limited and easyJet Leasing Limited, both subsidiary 
undertakings, in respect of their contractual obligations to Airbus SAS in respect of the supply of Airbus 320 family aircraft. 
The Company has guaranteed the repayment of borrowings that financed the acquisition of aircraft by subsidiary undertakings. 
The Company has also guaranteed the payment obligations for the lease of aircraft by subsidiary undertakings. 
The Company has guaranteed certain letters of credit which have been issued by a bank on behalf of subsidiary undertakings. 
No amount is recognised on the Company statement of financial position in respect of any of these guarantees as it is not probable that 
there will be an outflow of resources. 
e) Related party transactions 
Transactions with subsidiary undertakings, which principally relate to the provision of funding within the Group, are carried out on an 
arm’s-length basis. Outstanding balances are placed on intercompany accounts with no specified credit period, are unsecured, and bear 
market rates of interest. 
f) Subsequent events 
On 11 October 2010 the Company announced that, subject to shareholder approval in an Extraordinary General Meeting, agreement 
had been reached to resolve its ongoing dispute with easyGroup IP Licensing Ltd and Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou over the terms and 
operation of the ‘easyJet’ brand licence. Further details are given in note 27 to the consolidated accounts.

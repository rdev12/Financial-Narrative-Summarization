Wolseley is the world’s 
number one distributor 
of heating and plumbing
products to the professional
market and a leading supplier 
of building materials.
This has been a particularly
demanding year for Wolseley.
While the short-term outlook
for our markets continues to
be uncertain, our objective
remains to ensure the
appropriate sizing of our 
cost base and an unrelenting
drive for cash flow generation.
In doing so, Wolseley will
emerge from this economic
cycle leaner and fitter for 
the future.

Chairman’s statement 03
Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Trading conditions across the Group
became increasingly challenging over the
year. Our European markets weakened 
in addition to the continuing deterioration 
of the US housing market, exacerbated by
global liquidity issues in the banking sector.
As a consequence, the Group has seen
little revenue growth with substantial
variation across the businesses as typified
by Stock Building Supply, (‘Stock’) whose
revenue in constant currency was down 
24 per cent. This was offset by stronger
performances in Europe, particularly in 
the first six months of the financial year. 
In order to ameliorate the impact of this
particularly harsh market environment, 
a variety of management actions have 
been taken to adjust the Group’s cost
base. In the US, there have been significant
headcount reductions at both Stock 
and Ferguson Enterprises, along with 
the closure of a number of branches. 
In Europe, headcount and overhead cost
reductions have been announced, and 
in part implemented; further rationalisation 
and restructuring of businesses will 
be undertaken.
Additional focus has also been given 
to cash generation, with considerable
success. Targets for working capital have
been met and, across both continents,
actions have been taken to reduce capital
spend and dispose of non-core assets 
and businesses.
Within this environment, revenues were 
up 2 per cent at £16,549 million, earnings 
per share before exceptional items and 
the amortisation and impairment of acquired
intangibles down 35.6 per cent to 56.58
pence and free cash flow at £571 million.
Whilst the principal elements of our
strategy remain in place, it has been
necessary to achieve the appropriate
balance between realising market
opportunities and the husbanding of 
cash. Acquisition spend was reduced to
£223 million, with no acquisitions since 
the interim results announcement in March
2008. Nevertheless, the Board was not
aware of any major opportunities being
missed as a consequence of this reduction
in expenditure. We have also reduced 
the rate of expenditure on our Business
Change Programme and IT but we remain
committed to business improvement 
and have implemented SAP in several 
pilot businesses in both Europe and 
North America. In May, we opened the
Sustainable Building Center in the UK 
to showcase products and help develop
our future position in the high growth
market in sustainable materials and in 
the energy management sector. 
Inevitably your Board has focused its
attention on cost reduction, cash generation
and restructuring the businesses. We have
rigorously reviewed our ability to comply
with our banking covenants, in the event
that markets continue to deteriorate, 
to ensure that adequate headroom exists
for the future. A contribution to this is the
recommendation that there will be no final
dividend paid in 2008, resulting in a cash
saving of £150 million. The dividend for the
year will therefore be 11.25 pence per share. 
Shareholders will also have noted that
Wolseley delisted from the New York
Stock Exchange and deregistered from
the Securities and Exchange Commission
(‘SEC’) on 2 January 2008 with the
Company now having a Level I American
Depository Receipt (‘ADR’) programme.
The costs associated with SEC registration
and, in particular, compliance with the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act requirements became
increasingly prohibitive for little benefit.
Indeed, since delisting, we have retained
the key elements of our established
internal controls process and our US
shareholder base has almost trebled.
In summary, it has been a particularly
demanding year for Wolseley. The 
Board is acutely aware of the decline 
in market capitalisation along with the
need for recovery. While the short-term
outlook for our markets continues to 
be uncertain, our objective remains 
to ensure the appropriate sizing of our 
cost base in line with the expected
environment. The Board remains
committed to ensuring that Wolseley
emerges from this economic cycle a
stronger business ready to meet the
challenges and growth opportunities 
that will undoubtedly be presented. 
The management team, led by Chip
Hornsby, has demonstrated enormous
energy and commitment to ensuring your
Company is robust in the short run whilst
positioning it as a platform for growth 
in the future. Further, our staff have
demonstrated dedication and initiative 
in difficult conditions over the past year.
My thanks go to all employees and
associates across the Group.

Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Overview
We are now entering the third
financial year where macro-
economic conditions have
continued to have a profound
impact on our industry and
consequently the Group’s
financial results. In fact, in 
many ways, the current cycle
reflects some of the toughest
market conditions that I have
seen in my 30 years in the
construction industry.
There are no signs of any immediate 
upturn in our principal markets and the
constraints on liquidity in global financial
markets, which are driving the cyclical
downturn, show no signs of abating. With
this in mind, our focus within the current
environment remains unchanged and has
been firmly on the areas we can continue
to influence – aggressive cost reduction
and cash flow enhancement. 
We are resolute in our determination to
take the appropriate action to position the
business to respond to the current market
conditions. We will drive our business hard,
take the necessary decisions to lower our
cost base and continue to generate strong
cash flow to further reduce net debt. In
doing this, I strongly believe we will be
better placed for the challenges ahead 
and to benefit from the market recovery
when it occurs.
Group results
Our results this year have continued to
reflect the deteriorating US housing market
and reducing consumer confidence arising
from global credit restrictions. While the
principal effects of the liquidity squeeze
have continued to be felt by the US
consumer during 2008, in the second half
of the financial year we have increasingly
started to see the deterioration of market
conditions across Europe. After currency
translation, Group revenue increased by 
2 per cent to £16,549 million (2007:
£16,221 million) although trading profit
reduced by 22 per cent to £683 million
(2007: £877 million), before charging £76
million of exceptional restructuring costs. 
In North America, in addition to the impact
of the deteriorating US housing and repairs,
maintenance and improvement (‘RMI’)
markets, the results were adversely
affected by price deflation in lumber and
panels and the weakness of the dollar.
However, the US commercial and industrial
markets have remained stable. The Group’s
European division achieved revenue growth
although profits declined, reflecting a rapid
deterioration in market conditions in the 
UK in the final three months of the financial
year and a softening in many other
European markets. 
Despite the lower profitability, operating
cash flow performance was strong at
£1,262 million (2007: £1,299 million)
reflecting increased focus by the Group 
in this area over the past two years. We
have established aggressive improvement
targets for each business in inventory,
receivables and payables and intend 
to keep all of our operating companies
focused on keeping up the momentum. 
Further details of market conditions 
and financial performance in each of 
the Group’s businesses are set out in the
Performance review on pages 10 to 31.
Actions to cut costs and reduce 
net debt
During the year we have remained focused
on positioning Wolseley to meet the
challenges created by the increasingly
difficult market conditions. Throughout this
period we have also remained cognisant 
of the need to ensure the Group remains
compliant with its borrowing covenants,
which require net debt to be less than 
3.5 times annualised EBITDA, before
exceptional items. At 31 July 2008, net
debt to EBITDA (before exceptional items)
was 2.7 times EBITDA, which was well
within the Company’s agreed covenants. 
We will continue to take the necessary
action to preserve cash and reduce
overheads in order to protect our profit
position, while at the same time, generating
cash to reduce our debt. We have a
number of contingency plans in place 
to ensure continued compliance with 
our banking covenants should markets
deteriorate further. 
Since the year-end, additional actions 
have been taken which include further
restructuring and streamlining of
management in key businesses, driving 
our working capital even harder, limited
asset disposals and curtailment of some
planned capital expenditure over the next
12 months. I would like to stress that 
our actions will continue to be designed 
to achieve the best long-term value for 
the Group, ensuring that our strategic
objectives are not compromised and 
that infrastructure is protected. 
The key actions taken during the year and
since the year-end are as set out below:
1. Cost cutting
Annualised savings of £176 million are
expected from business improvement
initiatives and actions taken to reduce
headcount by 7,100 and close 270
branches. To achieve these savings, the
Group incurred £76 million of exceptional
restructuring costs in the year ended 
31 July 2008. The 2008 results benefited
by around £47 million of these savings. 
Since 1 August 2008, another 600 
people have left the Group. Further plans
are in the process of being developed 
to carry out additional restructuring 
and cost reductions. In particular, a
fundamental review is currently being
undertaken to reduce Stock’s impact 
on the Group’s results.
2. Cash flow and debt
The rigorous focus on cash flow
continues, with further improvements 
in working capital ratios. Spot cash to
cash days improved by 5.9 days (11.4 
per cent), from 51.8 days at 31 July 2007
to 45.9 days at 31 July 2008. This reflects
an improvement of 30 per cent in working
capital days over the last two years. The
benefits of the distribution centre (‘DC’)
network have helped Ferguson Enterprises
(‘Ferguson’) to reduce inventory by 
23.4 days (30 per cent) in the past two
years, while improving service levels to
customers. In Europe, cash to cash days
improved significantly by 13.6 days to
30.9 days (2007: 44.5 days), reflecting 
a 15.1 days improvement in the UK, 
11.6 days improvement in France and 
5.6 days improvement in Central and
Eastern Europe (‘C&EE’), as a direct 
result of the focus and initiatives to
improve working capital during the year.
These working capital reductions have
been achieved without compromising
customer service levels. In July 2008,
Wolseley France entered into a receivables
factoring arrangement which reduced 
net debt at 31 July 2008, by £74 million.
The additional cost of servicing this
arrangement is expected to be £2 million
per annum. An additional factoring facility
has been agreed by Wolseley France
since the year end, reducing net debt by 
a further £78 million, the incremental cost
of which is £3 million.

WO40011_R&A_01-09  3/10/08  14:42  Page 05 06 Group Chief Executive’s review
Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Cash conversion was up at 185 per cent,
compared to 148 per cent in the prior year.
The Group is targeting an improvement of
more than 10 per cent in working capital
cash to cash days in 2009, excluding the
effect of receivables factoring. 
Net debt was relatively unchanged at
£2,469 million (2007: £2,467 million) despite
an adverse currency translation impact 
of £321 million, due to collective actions
taken to drive working capital improvement,
curtail capital expenditure and acquisitions
and to make selective business and asset
disposals. Gearing was 73.5 per cent
compared to 71.5 per cent in July 2007
and 83.9 per cent in January 2008. 
The Group has committed and undrawn
banking facilities available of £1.2 billion 
as at 31 July 2008 and has no need for
additional facilities until after the year 
ended 31 July 2011.
3. Capital expenditure and acquisitions
The Group continues to adopt a highly
selective approach to acquisitions with 
no further transactions completed since 
the interim results announcement in 
March 2008. As previously indicated,
capital expenditure plans have also been
curtailed. Capital expenditure for the year
ended 31 July 2008 was £317 million
(2007: £396 million), compared to an
original estimate of £500 million, as all
capital expenditure across the Group 
was carefully scrutinised and non-essential
projects, such as branch openings,
refurbishments, and other infrastructure
projects, were postponed. 
Capital expenditure for the year ended 
31 July 2009 is expected to be further
reduced to around £180 million. This
follows the decision to continue to defer
non-essential works and also to slow down
the deployment of the Group’s Business
Change Programme to conserve cash 
and to avoid business disruption in current
difficult markets. Following the recent
implementation in Switzerland, no further
roll-out will take place in C&EE in 2009
and, as a consequence, the shared central
services centre in Brno, Czech Republic 
will close. Plans to begin implementation 
of the programme across Canada and
extend the pilots in Ferguson are also 
being deferred. These delays have resulted
in an impairment charge of £15 million being
incurred in the year ended 31 July 2008,
with £12 million related to C&EE and 
£3 million to central costs.
We remain absolutely committed to the
long-term delivery of the Business Change
Programme. Longer term, the programme
will continue to play a fundamental role in
enabling us to achieve the organisation’s
strategy and increase our long-term
competitive advantage. Specifically, the
programme which will result in a common
IT platform for the Group will improve
working capital efficiencies, and deliver
more efficient business processes and
better quality information, which will allow
us greater insight into our business, our
suppliers and, of course, our customers. 
4. Asset disposals – property, plant,
equipment and businesses
Wolseley continues to actively manage 
its portfolio of more than 900 properties
and, where it makes financial sense,
routinely enters into sale and leaseback
arrangements or makes disposals. As a
result, property, plant and equipment was
sold for £84 million during the financial 
year, realising a profit of £16 million (2007:
£62 million, with a profit of £27 million).
Since the year end, a further eight
Ferguson properties have been sold for
£43 million, with a profit of £11 million.
Three peripheral businesses that were 
not strategic to Wolseley were disposed 
of in the year ended 31 July 2008, for a
consideration of £18 million. An additional
£3 million has been realised since the 
year end. 
Group strategy
While our short-term priority must remain
on the cost base, it is critical we do not
lose sight of the need to continue to build
our long-term business model. However,
this year we have needed to strike an
appropriate balance between continuing 
to take the necessary short-term actions
commensurate with the market conditions
we face, while maintaining the momentum
of driving our long-term strategy to build 
a truly world class company.
The Group continues to place a great deal
of emphasis on the ‘Earn, Turn, Grow’
initiative which is now in its second year of
operation. The programme has established
priorities for each business on margin
enhancement, strong cash flow generation
and growth. This initiative has been widely
communicated across the Group with 
clear objectives at the individual, branch,
business and Group levels. Remuneration
is also being linked to performance
measured against each area of focus. 
The continued success of the programme
was evidenced this year by the Group’s
strong cash flow performance. The
objective of the ‘Earn, Turn, Grow’ initiative
is to provide a framework for driving
improved performance and expectations
across the Group. This year there will be
continued emphasis on further enhancing
working capital performance and increasing
cash flow generation. 
Group Chief Executive’s review
WO40011_R&A_01-09  3/10/08  14:42  Page 06 Group Chief Executive’s review 07
Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Where appropriate, we continue to
selectively invest in our business and 
will work to increase our competitive
advantage. We aim to deliver purchasing
and sourcing opportunities that our
competitors find hard to replicate. For
example, during the year we added to 
the DC capacity opening new facilities in
Chorley, UK and Stockton, USA. In France,
the national DC which opened at the end
of last year in Orléans is now operating 
at very high service levels of more than 
97 per cent. This has led to reduced
inventory and it has also recently started to
distribute plumbing and heating products.
Elsewhere this year we have rationalised
the supply chain in the UK, closing surplus
warehouse facilities. We are now also
seeing increased efficiencies at the national
DC in Leamington Spa.
An example of the competitive advantage
the DC network brings was highlighted this
year in the retention, by Wolseley UK, of an
important contract with one of its largest
customers, British Gas. For over 25 years,
Wolseley has supplied the energy company
with boilers, radiators and parts to install
and maintain domestic heating systems.
Recently Wolseley won more business 
from British Gas following their decision 
to reduce suppliers from three to two. 
An innovative, centralised solution was
devised, with deliveries direct to customers
from dedicated ‘branches’ within two DCs
– replacing a decentralised branch-based
system. This was especially important as
British Gas has grown in the installation
market and has ambitious plans for the
future. Wolseley’s distribution network
utilisation is a key competitive advantage
and differentiator in the marketplace.
Sourcing also continues to be a major
source of competitive advantage and 
this year Wolseley North America (‘WNA’)
launched a private label range that has
been hugely successful. Wolseley acquired
the handtools brand ‘Raptor’ through the
acquisition of DT Group in September
2006, which is an established private label
brand within their DIY business, Silvan in
Denmark. WNA launched a new range of
Raptor tools geared for the North American
market in February of this year, which
includes over 160 stock keeping units
(SKUs) and is already generating significant
sales and profits since its introduction.
Raptor has now been launched in over
1,300 Wolseley locations across North
America and shares some of the same
global sources as DT Group, allowing 
us to leverage our supplier relationships.
Corporate responsibility
With the future firmly in mind, we will 
place greater emphasis on corporate
responsibility (‘CR’) and our vision is to 
be one of the most trusted companies in
the markets in which we operate. We take
our responsibilities seriously. Issues such 
as the health and safety of our employees
and customers and minimising the Group’s
adverse contribution to climate change 
are important subjects for the Board, 
and for me personally. 
Our CR strategy to support this is outlined
in a five-year programme which sets 
out our principal areas of focus, helps us
define our priorities as an organisation and
to all our stakeholders. We recognise we
are on a journey. As ever, some of our
operating companies have shown excellent
improvements this year and the challenge
is to instil a culture of best practice and
continuous improvement throughout the
Group. You can read about our progress
this year and our aspirations for the future
in the CR report on pages 32 to 39. 
Summary
We have continued to make good
progress this year in what has been 
an extremely challenging period for 
the Group with many of our businesses
continuing to gain market share. In the
short term we remain very focused 
on aggressive cost reduction and an
unrelenting drive for cash generation. 
I remain confident in the long-term
fundamentals of our markets and also
that Wolseley will emerge from this
current downturn as a stronger
organisation, with an excellent platform
for growth.

We have a wide range of customers
operating in different industry sectors
ranging from the individual plumber or
builder through to national contractors,
house builders and large industrial and
commercial organisations.
Our primary customer focus is on
professional contractors who work 
with households, governments, 
property developers and industrial
companies in the construction of new
homes, offices and industrial buildings, 
or in the repair and maintenance of

Company overview and
performance monitoring
Company overview
Wolseley’s business is the distribution of
construction materials and the provision 
of related services primarily to a specialist
market of professional contractors. The
Group is the world’s number one distributor
of heating and plumbing products to
professional contractors and a leading
supplier of building materials to the
professional market. The Group is an
international business, operating 5,310
branches in 27 countries and employing
around 74,000 people.
Wolseley plc is the parent company of the
Group and its subsidiaries are organised
into two geographic divisions – Europe and
North America. Divisional management are
primarily responsible for the profits of the
operating companies they oversee and 
for driving organic growth, which includes
achieving additional sales from existing
branches, new branch openings and
expansion into new geographies, new
customer types and product areas.
The principal activities of the Group are:
• the distribution of plumbing, heating,
ventilation and air conditioning equipment
within Europe and North America;
• the distribution of building materials 
in the UK, Ireland, France, the Nordic
region, Eastern Europe and the USA;
• the distribution of electrical components
and supplies primarily in the UK, Ireland
and France;
• the distribution of pipes, valves, 
fittings and waterworks in Europe 
and North America; and
• the provision of construction and
installation services in the USA and
equipment hire in the UK and Austria.
Wolseley’s products
The Group supplies materials used in 
the construction industry. The range 
of products used in construction is 
broad and the Group continually seeks
opportunities to widen that choice for its
customers. The main product categories
supplied to customers are set out on
page 12.
Wolseley’s customers
The Group has a wide range of
customers operating in different industry
sectors that range from the individual
plumber or builder through to national
contractor chains and house builders,
and include large industrial and
commercial organisations. Wolseley’s
primary customer focus is on professional
contractors. These contractors work 
with households, governments, property
developers and industrial companies in
the construction of new homes, offices
and industrial buildings or in the repair
and maintenance of existing premises.
Increasingly, the Group is structured
around core business groups or brands,
allowing its local companies to put real
focus on these, whilst enhancing
customer service and developing further
product expertise.
Competitive environment
The Group aims to be a leading
distributor in each of the markets in which
it operates. The markets where the Group
operates are, typically, fragmented with 
a few large players and a significant
portion of the market supplied by small
local operations. In certain markets the 
Group competes with the large DIY 
chains which have increased their
offerings to professional contractors.
Recently, several of these markets have
experienced sharp reductions in the 
level of activity. In the shorter term, 
the pressure on margins and cash flow
favours the larger and better capitalised

businesses, which will gain market share
from weaker competitors. In the longer
term, the opportunities for organic and
acquisitive growth in these fragmented
markets are substantial.
Other market factors
Recently, the North American markets have
been experiencing a reduction in demand,
due to restrictions on credit availability,
falling house prices and low consumer
confidence, in combination with a relatively
high supply of newly built or repossessed
housing stock. In the short term, it is likely
that the Group’s markets in the US will
continue to be depressed by these factors.
Similar trends are becoming increasingly
apparent in European markets, with the 
UK and Ireland in particular experiencing 
a sharp contraction in available credit, 
falling house prices and a steep fall in 
the level of new residential construction.
In the longer term, the changing
demographics of the European and 
North American markets, with a generally
ageing population and increasing immigration,
should support demand for new housing 
at relatively high levels. As the housing
stock ages, it will increase demand in 
the repair and remodelling sector. Activity 
in the commercial and industrial sector 
varies according to the level of business
investment, government spending and
commercial property yields. 
The Group’s business model gives it a 
level of flexibility and agility to respond 
to changes in the marketplace across
different business cycles. The diversity 
of the Group’s business provides further
resilience in performance. 
While the Group does not operate in a
regulated industry, the performance of the
Group can be impacted by government
legislation. The key regulatory influences
centre on environmental legislation and
stipulations imposed when building or
remodelling buildings. Such changes 
in legislation present an opportunity for
growth in response to increasing demand
as customers or end-users respond by
changing their buying habits. For example,
the UK business has recently opened the
Sustainable Building Center to provide 
a showcase for energy efficient products
increasingly required by regulation and in
response to the increasing environmental
awareness of customers. Further details
are given in the Corporate responsibility
report on page 37.
Performance monitoring
The Group employs a rigorous performance
management framework to plan, monitor
and review the activities of its businesses.
A long-term strategic plan is reviewed
annually by all businesses which sets out
business plans and resource requirements.
Linked to this is the annual budget process,
which is core to the target-setting process.
The form and components of the budget
are, in general, cascaded down to branch
level within the businesses. Each month,
the businesses submit their results, which
also include a forecast for the remainder 
of the financial year. Performance against
both budget and prior month forecast is
reviewed with the businesses by continental
and Group management. Corrective actions
or additional resource deployments are
discussed with the benefit of such information.
The Board of Wolseley plc meets regularly
to discuss trading results and uses a set 
of Key Performance Indicators (‘KPIs’) to
measure the overall progress of the Group
against its business objectives. These KPIs
are aligned with the Group’s ‘Earn, Turn,
Grow’ initiative and bonus targets for all
eligible staff are based on them.

Key Performance Indicator and definition
Change in like-for-like revenue
The total increase or decrease in revenue for the year, excluding
the effect of currency exchange, sales days, new acquisitions,
branch openings or branch closures in the year, and the incremental
effect of acquisitions, branch openings and branch closures in 
the prior year. The Group expects changes in like-for-like revenue
in each of its markets to exceed changes in the overall level of
economic activity in those markets.
Change in organic revenue
The increase or decrease in like-for-like revenue and in revenue
derived from branch openings or closures in the year, and the
incremental effect of branch openings and closures in the prior
year. The Group seeks to achieve, on average, double-digit
growth in revenue both through organic growth and through
acquisitions. Over the economic cycle the Group would expect
growth to come broadly evenly from both sources.
Growth in acquired revenue
The growth in revenue from businesses that the Group has
acquired during the financial year and the incremental effect 
of the prior year’s acquisitions.
Review of performance
• Group like-for-like revenue reduced by 5.4 per cent during 
the year, compared to a reduction of 0.9 per cent in the
previous year.
• Stock Building Supply’s (‘Stock’) like-for-like revenue declined
by 24.4 per cent, following a 24.3 per cent decline in the
previous year.
• Performance in the other businesses ranged from an 
increase of 1.3 per cent in the Nordic region to a reduction 
of 5.4 per cent in Central and Eastern Europe, with Ferguson
Enterprises (‘Ferguson’) contracting by 4.5 per cent. In the
previous period all businesses apart from Stock achieved 
like-for-like growth.
• Organic revenue reduced in the year by 4.8 per cent,
compared to an increase of 0.5 per cent in the previous year.
• The Nordic region achieved organic growth of 1.7 per cent, 
Canada of 0.5 per cent and the Swiss business of 5.6 per cent.
• The declines in organic revenue of 2.4 per cent in Ferguson
and 27.2 per cent in Stock reflected the weakness of the 
new residential housing market in the US. Both businesses
maintained or increased market share.
• The declines of 0.3 per cent in the UK and Ireland and of 
1.3 per cent in France reflected the deteriorating housing
markets and consumer confidence in their markets.
• Over the past five years the Group has delivered average
organic revenue growth of 5.7 per cent.
• A total of 15 acquisitions were completed during the year, for
an aggregate consideration, including net debt, of £223 million.
• Acquisitions made in financial year 2008 contributed £218
million to revenue in the year or 1 per cent and £26 million 
to trading profit or 4 per cent.
• Over the past five years the Group has delivered average
acquired revenue growth of 11.9 per cent with 4.8 per cent 
in the last year.

Key Performance Indicators
The Group has utilised the following indicators of performance to assess its progress against its strategy and financial objectives
during the year ended 31 July 2008. Growth in like-for-like revenue and reduction in cash to cash days are KPIs which were given
special prominence during the year because of the more difficult markets within which the Group was operating. The Group does 
not have the historical information to give a five-year record for these measures. The other KPIs are those which have been
presented in previous years with a five-year record. They are all shown here for consistency, although growth in acquired revenue
has ceased to be a key measure of performance in current markets. Trading margin and return on gross capital employed are 
both based on trading profit, which excludes exceptional items and the amortisation and impairment of acquired intangible assets.

Key Performance Indicator and definition
Trading margin
The ratio of trading profit to revenue expressed as a percentage.
The Group seeks to achieve a growth in trading profits higher 
than the growth in revenue through year-on-year improvements 
in trading margin as a result of continuous improvement in
operations and the benefits of its international scale and leverage.
Cash to cash days
The average number of days from payment for items of inventory
to receipt of cash from customers. The Group monitors this
measure to assess the efficiency with which trading profit before
depreciation is converted into net cash collected.
Free cash flow
Free cash flow represents cash flow from operating activities 
less maintenance capital expenditure, tax, dividends and interest.
The Group seeks to generate sufficient free cash flow over the
business cycle to fund normal bolt-on acquisitions and expansion
capital expenditure.
Return on gross capital employed
The ratio of trading profit to the aggregate of the monthly average
of shareholders’ funds, minority interests, net debt and cumulative
goodwill and acquired intangibles written off. The Group targets 
to deliver an incremental return on gross capital employed
(‘ROGCE’) at least 4 per cent in excess of the pre-tax weighted
average cost of capital. A major driver of decisions relating to
acquisitions and capital expenditure is the incremental return on
capital generated by those investments.
Review of performance
• Overall, Group trading margin fell from 5.4 per cent in 2007 
to 4.1 per cent in 2008, primarily as a result of the weak new
residential housing market.
• The Nordic region improved margins from 6.1 per cent in 
the prior year to 7.2 per cent and the Swiss business from 
7.8 per cent to 8.2 per cent.
• Margin fell in all other businesses, with Stock falling into loss.
• Over the past five years, the Group’s trading margin has
averaged 5.5 per cent.
• Cash to cash days, measured with spot exchange rates, 
was 46 at 31 July 2008, compared to 52 at 31 July 2007. 
The reduction reflected the greater focus being placed on
enhancing working capital performance across the Group.
• Free cash flow reduced by £55 million from £626 million in 2007
to £571 million; the reduction of £194 million in trading profit
was partly offset by improved management of working capital.
• Over the past five years, after dividends, average free cash flow
was £349 million.
• ROGCE in 2008 decreased from 13.7 per cent to 9.6 per cent
due to the losses at Stock and reduced profitability in Central
and Eastern Europe. It was 0.4 per cent ahead of the estimated
pre-tax weighted average cost of capital of 9.2 per cent.
• Average ROGCE over the past five years was 15.9 per cent,
while pre-tax weighted average cost of capital averaged 
11.4 per cent over the same period.
• ROGCE in Europe was 10.5 per cent, down from 12.7 per cent
in 2007 and in North America 10.2 per cent, down from 
16.2 per cent in 2007.

Human resource development 
performance indicators
Wolseley’s people are central to providing
service to its customers and they provide
key competitive advantages, as important
elements of the customer experience come
through ongoing relationships with branch
personnel or members of the sales force.
Staff turnover rates are considered 
an important indicator and these are
reviewed regularly.
The overall turnover rate for 2008 was 
31 per cent (2007: 24 per cent) and has
increased from 12 per cent to 17 per cent
at management level. During the year
under review, the Group has undertaken
extensive restructuring activities in
response to the reduced levels of activity 
in certain markets, which have resulted in 
a significant reduction in staffing levels both
at branches and in management. Further
measures are expected in the current
financial year.
The safety of Wolseley’s people is regarded
as paramount and lost time incident rates
are monitored closely by health and safety
committees established in each of the
major businesses.
Further information on the Group’s policies
and performance in health and safety and
people development can be found in the
Corporate responsibility report on page 34.
Other performance areas
In order to measure the success of its
strategy execution, the Group uses 
a variety of financial and non-financial
performance indicators.
Business diversity
A key element of the Group’s growth
strategy is the enhancement of business
diversity, which has a number of elements. 
Over the longer term, the Group seeks 
to enhance its branch network to provide
improved service and a wider product
offering to new and existing customers.
The expansion of the branch network 
over the last five years is detailed in the
table below. However, in response to 
the worsening conditions in some of its
markets, the Group has closed a number
of branches which were either performing
poorly or where there was scope for
merging outlets without restricting supply 
to a given market.

Total 5,310 5,296 4,658 3,920 3,637
The Group also seeks to expand its
geographical footprint in its chosen areas
of operation. During the year the Group
acquired Gama, which increased its
presence in Slovakia and the Czech
Republic, and Davidson Pipe Company, Inc.,
which gave the Group access to the New
York metropolitan market, in the USA.
The Group also seeks to enter new market
segments, extending its product range and
customer base. Wolseley France acquired
Sofiparts, in line with its strategy to move
into the truss assembly market and further
increase its presence in the new residential
sector. Sofiparts designs, engineers and
assembles roof trusses, operating from 
19 production sites across France. Four of
Stock’s acquisitions have been distributors
of doors and hardware to the commercial
and industrial sector, diversifying its product
offering to reduce its reliance on residential
new build. The Group’s electrical distribution
activities have been expanded through the
acquisition of T&R Electrical in the UK.

Sourcing
The Group has financial measures 
for the progress of its global sourcing
programme. These are primarily annual
targets for the margin benefit from new
rebate agreements and improvements 
to existing rebate schemes and also 
cash flow measures such as improved
payment terms.
Supply chain
There are diverse supply chain initiatives
around the Group, which are monitored
both by financial measures, such as
annualised savings in transportation costs,
and also by non-financial measures such
as inventory turns and the fill rates achieved
in the Group’s network of distribution
centres, which is the proportion of orders
that can be fulfilled from inventory on hand
at the time of the order.
Environmental
The Group’s approach to environmental
measures is set out in the Corporate
responsibility report on pages 32 to 39.
In accordance with the reporting guidelines
suggested by the UK government’s
Department for Environment, Food and
Rural Affairs, the Group has developed 
a range of environmental measures,
which include monitoring carbon dioxide
emissions, waste management and
water use which are disclosed in 
the Corporate responsibility report 
on pages 35 and 36.
Wolseley is taking an active role in the
sourcing and supply of renewable and
sustainable building materials. Wolseley
UK’s Sustainable Building Center 
(‘SBC’), a 6,800 square feet, interactive
showcase for renewable and sustainable
building materials, opened in May 2008.
The building features the best available
sustainable construction products
selected from a bespoke range provided
through Wolseley UK trading brands.

Operations
Europe
Market
The European division continues to develop
under four geographic areas (‘clusters’) –
UK and Ireland, France, the Nordic region
and Central and Eastern Europe (‘C&EE’).
During 2008, the latter was responsible 
for the division’s operations in Austria, 
the Benelux region, Italy, Switzerland and
Eastern Europe.
The division has 3,389 branches serving 
a diverse range of customers and market
sectors within construction materials. 
In the opinion of management, Wolseley
UK’s plumbing business is the UK’s largest
distributor of plumbing and heating products;
in France, Brossette is the second largest
distributor of plumbing and heating equipment
and, PBM is the second largest integrated
distributor of heavyside building materials,
and DT Group is the leading distributor of
building materials for trade professionals
and consumers in the Nordic region.
European markets each have their 
own economic growth rates and market
participants. In the short term, some
markets – particularly the UK and Ireland 
– have been contracting owing to the
reduction in housing starts and consumer
confidence. The diversity of the Wolseley
operations and the fragmentation that
exists in the European markets present
significant growth opportunities for the
Group in the longer term. Some important
trends include:
• an increasing rate of residential repair
and maintenance across Europe, as
more is spent on upgrading the ageing
housing stock;
• an increasing percentage of
flats/apartments in the building mix,
helping to increase sales of plumbing
and heating products;
• infrastructure growth in recently joined
EU members in C&EE;
• high levels of migrant workers creating
both employment within construction 
and ‘hot spots’ for residential growth;
• the growth of sustainable construction
products across Europe; and
• increased application of modern
methods of construction, such as 
offsite fabrication.
Wolseley has a well balanced product offer
across Europe and is able to adopt and
adapt business practices to exploit market
trends within its specific country markets.
Market size
In the 2007 Annual Report and Accounts,
management included an estimate of the
overall market size for products which
Wolseley distributes for the countries in
which the Group operates, and for Europe
as a whole. According to this estimate,
Wolseley’s current operations had a 4 per
cent share of a market size of some £200
billion, and a 3 per cent share of a total
European market of some £290 billion,
illustrating that the Group continues to
operate in highly fragmented markets.
Management has reviewed market
research reports currently available for
more recent periods, which are based 
on historical information although in 
some cases market conditions are rapidly
changing. Furthermore, they are potentially
seriously distorted by assumptions made
about prevailing exchange rates between
sterling, euro and Danish krone. In view of
the quickly changing economic environment
which the Group is experiencing, and the
risk that any historic information may be
misleading as a guide to future trading
conditions, the Group has concluded that 
it would not be appropriate to present a
revised estimate this year.
Demand in the European markets is driven by activity in a number of key market sectors:
• the residential market split between new construction and repairs, maintenance and improvements (‘RMI’);
• the non-residential market (the commercial and industrial market) analysed between new construction and RMI; and
• the civil infrastructure market.
The division’s split of business by each of these key market sectors is given below:
Revenue Revenue
£bn %
Residential:
New construction 2.0 24%
RMI 3.5 41%
Non-residential:
New construction 1.4 17%
RMI 1.2 14%
Civil infrastructure 0.4 4%
Total 8.5 100%
The division has more activity generated from residential compared to non-residential and civil infrastructure work. However, 
the actions underway both through acquisitions and enhancement of business diversity, continue to broaden the business base.

Divisional performance
The European operations achieved revenue
growth although profits were lower due to
deteriorating market conditions, particularly
in the UK and Ireland, and the costs of
restructuring a number of businesses.
Reported revenue, in sterling, for this division
increased by 12.7 per cent to £8,517 million
(2007: £7,559 million). Recent acquisitions,
including DT Group in the Nordic region in
September 2006, accounted for £522 million
(6.9 per cent) of revenue growth. Trading
profit, in sterling, reduced 1.2 per cent to
£428 million (2007: £433 million). Currency
translation increased divisional revenue 
by £475 million (6.3 per cent) and trading
profit by £25 million (5.9 per cent). Excluding
DT Group, European revenues, in sterling,
increased by 6.4 per cent while trading
profit was 19.3 per cent lower. 
The overall divisional trading margin, 
after the allocation of central costs, declined
from 5.7 per cent to 5.0 per cent of
revenue, due to the lower trading margins
in Wolseley UK and Ireland, France and
C&EE operations. DT Group increased its
margin to 7.2 per cent in its first full year 
of Wolseley’s ownership.
During the year, a net 78 branches were
added to the European network, giving 
a total of 3,389 locations (2007: 3,311),
including 47 added through acquisitions.
UK and Ireland
The results for Wolseley UK reflect tougher
trading conditions in Ireland throughout the
period combined with an increasingly difficult
UK housing market, as the year progressed.
New housing starts in the UK slowed
significantly in the final quarter in response
to the lower availability and increased
cost of mortgage financing. Deteriorating
consumer confidence is also affecting the
RMI market. Government expenditure on
social housing, health and education
remained positive.
Against this background, Wolseley UK and
Ireland recorded a 1.0 per cent increase
in revenue to £3,203 million (2007: 
£3,171 million), due to acquisitions.
Organic revenue growth of 1.8 per cent
was achieved in the UK, excluding Ireland,
with market share increased.
Gross margin increased slightly due to 
a change in business mix, including an
increase in private label sales and despite
increased pricing pressure as markets
deteriorated. Trading profit was 16.6 per cent
lower at £176 million (2007: £211 million)
excluding £12 million of exceptional
restructuring costs, principally relating to 
13 branch closures and 150 redundancies,
in Ireland. These restructuring plans and
other business initiatives should give rise
to annualised savings of £17 million. 
The trading margin fell from 6.7 per cent 
to 5.5 per cent, primarily due to lower
profitability in Ireland, whilst the plumbing
and heating business improved its margin.
During the year, a new regional
distribution centre (‘DC’) was opened in
Chorley and the benefits of the national
DC in Leamington Spa continue to be
realised, with significant improvements
in working capital, whilst achieving high
fill rates to branches and customers.
Ten net new locations were added in the
UK and Ireland taking the total number 
of branches to 1,927 (2007: 1,917).
France
In France, housing starts slowed
significantly during the period and lower
consumer confidence also affected 
RMI markets.
Against this background, Wolseley’s
French operations improved their 
relative performance over the course
of the year, despite the generally more
challenging business environment. Local
currency revenue was up 2.7 per cent 
to a2,850 million (2007: a2,774 million)
due to acquisitions, with organic revenue
declining 1.3 per cent. Trading profit 
was 7.2 per cent lower at a139 million
(2007: a150 million), including property
and other asset disposal profits
of around a17 million but excluding 
a28 million of exceptional restructuring
costs to reduce headcount by 400 and
close 43 branches. These restructuring
plans are designed to result in improved
productivity in sales, administration
and logistics and give rise to annualised
savings of a15 million (£11 million).
Trading margin for the year ended 
31 July 2008 was 4.9 per cent (2007:
5.4 per cent). 
WO40011_R&A_10-31  3/10/08  14:43  Page 17 Performance review continued
The net number of branches in France
increased by 23 to 848 (2007: 825), 
mainly due to acquisitions. The national
DC, opened at the end of last year in
Orléans, is now operating at very high
service levels of around 97 per cent, has
led to reduced inventory and has recently
started to distribute plumbing and heating
products. A new customer delivery centre
(‘CDC’) was also opened in August 2007
near Lyon to service the Rhône area with
plumbing and heating products. A further
CDC is scheduled to open in January 2009
near Nancy to serve the east of France. 
Further repositioning continues within
Wolseley France. Brossette, in response 
to the decline in traditional heating markets,
is increasing its branch specialisation 
to sell renewable energy solutions (heat
pumps, condensing boilers, solar panels),
spare parts, electrical products and
increasing its branch-within-a-branch
concept. The logistics programme drawn
up four years ago for the Brossette
business to increase efficiency in customer
deliveries and reduce inventory is almost
complete, with plans in place to modernise
four existing branches to become CDCs. 
In August 2008, Wolseley France sold its
19-branch tool hire business, Réseau Loc,
in order to focus on its core heavyside
distribution business.
Nordic region
Growth rates in the Nordic region slowed
during the year as higher interest rates
affected the rate of new homes being 
built and adversely impacted house prices
and the Group’s DIY businesses. The
professional RMI market had held up better
for most of the year, although since June,
sales have started to decline when compared
against a very buoyant market in the
comparative period in the prior year. 
DT Group has achieved a strong
performance, taking further market share,
since being acquired by Wolseley on 
25 September 2006. For the year ended
31 July 2008, revenue was DKK22,061
million (£2,197 million) compared to
DKK17,858 million (£1,617 million) in 
the 10 months to 31 July 2007. Trading
profit was DKK1,595 million (£159 million)
compared to the 10-month period in the
prior year of DKK1,097 million (£99 million).
Gross margins improved, although there
was increased pricing pressure during 
the second half, and working capital 
was reduced further. Trading margin was 
7.2 per cent as management demonstrated 
its ability to reduce costs as business
growth slowed.
For the 12 months to 31 July 2008, 
DT Group’s internal management accounts
show an underlying increase in revenue
over the prior year of 3.9 per cent, including
2 per cent organic growth, and in trading
profit, of 10.9 per cent.
DT Group had 278 branches as at 
31 July 2008 (2007: 275).
Central and Eastern Europe
The Group’s C&EE businesses showed
modest constant currency revenue growth,
due to acquisitions, against generally
worsening markets. Revenue, in sterling,
was up 11.2 per cent to £1,001 million
(2007: £899 million), reflecting the benefits
of exchange rates and acquisitions, partly
offset by an organic revenue decline of 
3.3 per cent. Gross margin was lower,
particularly in Eastern Europe, where
increased manufacturing capacity of
insulation products caused a significant
oversupply and resulted in price pressure.
Trading profit in C&EE, in sterling, was 
£nil (2007: £35 million) as a result of a 
£12 million impairment charge relating 
to a deferred IT project, business disruption
resulting from IT implementations and 
DC start-up issues earlier in the year. This
masked a good performance in Switzerland
where the trading margin increased to 
8.2 per cent as a result of an increase 
of over 10 per cent in trading profit.
As a direct result of the focus on working
capital, cash to cash days improved by 
5.6 days when compared to the prior year.
During the year, 42 net new locations were
added in C&EE, taking the total number to
336 (2007: 294).

North America
Market
The Group’s activities in North America
centre on two main market areas –
plumbing and heating distribution, which
are served by Ferguson and Wolseley
Canada, and building materials distribution,
which is served by Stock. There is an
executive management team for Wolseley
North America, which oversees these
operations. During the year, significant
progress has been made in bringing the
activities of Wolseley Canada under the
management of Ferguson.
Ferguson is the largest wholesale
distributor of plumbing supplies, pipes,
valves and fittings in the USA and a 
major distributor of heating, ventilation 
and air conditioning (‘HVAC’) systems.
The company also distributes waterworks
products, fire protection products and
industrial pipes, valves and fittings as
well as operating a number of speciality
businesses, serving markets such as the
nuclear industry and a maintenance, repairs
and operations management services
business. Ferguson is managed through
‘business groups’ such as HVAC and
Waterworks. These business groups
allow management to focus on the 
specific needs of key groups of customers.
Ferguson is present in 50 states, as well 
as the District of Columbia, and has
1,382 branches (2007: 1,417 branches).
Wolseley Canada distributes plumbing,
heating and piping products, including
HVAC, waterworks, refrigeration, industrial
pipes, valves and fittings and fire protection
products as well as industrial plumbing
supplies, to customers through its
254 branches (2007: 260 branches).
Stock is the second largest supplier of
building materials to professional home
builders and contractors in the USA. Stock
is present in 32 states with 285 locations
(2007: 308 locations) and provides
contractors with building materials such
as structural timber products, roofing
materials, doors, windows, insulation and
hardware. Stock also assembles and sells
a variety of engineered wood products
including roof trusses and offers customer
delivery, design and installation, as well as
financing and credit services. The contractor
base has been increasingly diversified
from purely residential construction into
commercial and industrial markets.
In general, the North American plumbing and
heating distribution market is fragmented
with an estimated 95 per cent of distribution
operations employing fewer than 100 people.
Consolidation of market players has
accelerated with some of the major retailers
having moved more significantly into the
market. The North American building
materials market is also very fragmented.
The new residential sector of the market
has been significantly affected by an
oversupply of new homes, rising interest
rates and sub-prime mortgage default
issues. Housing starts have reduced 
from an annualised rate of 1.37 million 
at July 2007 to 0.97 million at July 2008. 
As Stock derives over 70 per cent of its
revenue from the new residential sector,
its turnover has declined, although it has
outperformed the market. It has also
been affected by lumber and panel
commodity prices which have declined 
in this period of weak demand.
In the long term, demographic trends
support high rates of home ownership
and residential construction with ‘baby
boomers’ entering their peak earnings
time and purchasing second or trade-up
homes. Baby boomers, who are thought
to control a majority of the wealth in 
the USA, are also expected to have 
a significant effect on the repair and
remodel market as their decision to
improve their existing homes will be less
influenced by the state of the economy.
The plumbing and heating distribution
market is driven by new construction
and remodelling sales. The latter 
market is less cyclical. Ferguson has
experienced only a small organic decline
in revenue, outperforming the market 
and gaining market share.

Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Grouping the US into four geographic
regions and using US Census information
(for housing starts) and estimates provided
by North America’s Home Improvement
Research Institute (for remodelling), it is
possible to analyse the split and growth 
or decline in activity of new housing and
remodelling by region. Comparable figures
for Canada can be compiled using
information from Canada Mortgage and
Housing Corporation, Home Improvement
Research Institute, and Statistics Canada.
This can then be compared to Wolseley’s
share of its business in each of these
regions although it should be noted that
this also includes some revenue from 
non-residential sources.
In general, the division shows a 
broad spread of business across the
categories. Actions are being taken to
widen the Group’s North American
business base and increase Wolseley’s
presence in market segments other than
residential new construction. The use
of the business group model providing
dedicated focus on customer segments
in North America is assisting progress
towards this objective.
Wolseley remains confident that with the
continued development in the strength and
depth of its management and the investment
being made in the supply chain, the business
is well placed to outperform in its markets
and succeed in meeting its growth targets
and improving margins over time.

Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Market size
In the 2007 Annual Report and Accounts,
management included an estimate of 
the overall market size in North America 
for products which Wolseley distributes.
According to this estimate, Wolseley’s
businesses had a 2 per cent share of 
a market size of some £415 billion.
Management monitors economic statistics
and market research reports which are
available for more recent periods, but as
with Europe, the Group has concluded
that, in view of the quickly changing
economic environment which the Group is
experiencing, and the risk that any historic
information may be misleading as a guide
to future trading conditions, it would not be
appropriate to present a revised estimate
this year.
Divisional performance
Wolseley’s North American division
performed well ahead of a market which
was seriously impacted by a significant
slowdown in the new housing sector,
maintaining its position as the leading
distributor of construction products to the
professional contractor in North America. 
Reported revenue, in sterling, of the
division decreased by 7.3 per cent to
£8,032 million (2007: £8,662 million),
reflecting an organic revenue decline of 
8.9 per cent, and a 1.7 per cent negative
impact of currency translation, partly offset
by acquisitions. Trading profit, in sterling,
declined by 37.4 per cent to £305 million
(2007: £487 million). Currency translation
reduced divisional revenue by £151 million
(1.7 per cent) and trading profit by £7 million
(1.6 per cent).
There was a net decrease of 64 branches
in North America to 1,921 (2007: 1,985)
with a new DC in Stockton, California 
being opened in spring 2008, adding
645,000 square feet of space to the 
North American DC network. A further
537,000 square feet DC will open in
October 2008, in Frostproof, Florida.
US plumbing and heating
Ferguson produced another strong
performance, gaining market share.
Although it benefited from the stability
of the commercial and industrial sector, 
the new residential market has weakened
further and the RMI market has slowed.
Local currency revenue in the US plumbing
and heating operations rose by 1.3 per cent
to $11,226 million (2007: $11,079 million)
with trading profit 0.8 per cent lower at 
$794 million (2007: $800 million), excluding
$42 million of exceptional restructuring
costs. Organic revenue was 2.4 per cent
lower, but was significantly ahead of the
market generally, benefiting from the diversity
of the business. Over 90 per cent of
Ferguson’s branch locations are outperforming
their local market in residential product 
sales and over 70 per cent in non-residential
product sales. Gross margin was unchanged,
with some underlying pricing pressure being
offset by a focus on managing the pricing
matrix, an increase in sales via trade
counters and showrooms and higher private
label sales. The trading margin was slightly
lower at 7.1 per cent (2007: 7.2 per cent),
reflecting a $22 million increase in provisions
for doubtful debts, higher fuel and
infrastructure costs and the absence
of one-off profits on commodity copper
achieved in the prior year, of some $20 million. 
During the year, headcount was reduced 
by more than 2,250 associates and 
123 branches were closed. The annualised
benefits arising from the restructuring
actions and other business initiatives are
expected to be $148 million, of which
$53 million was reflected in the year
ended 31 July 2008.
Ferguson’s overall branch numbers
reduced by 35 to 1,382 locations
(2007: 1,417). 
US building materials
The continued slowdown in the new
residential market, which accounted 
for approximately 72 per cent of the
activity in this business, caused a
reduction in volumes and increased
price competition. These factors have
inevitably impacted Stock’s financial
performance despite an aggressive cost
reduction programme, which has seen
70 locations close and a reduction 
in workforce of around 40 per cent, 
over the past few years.
Housing starts in the USA have fallen 
28.6 per cent from an average annual
rate of around 1.54 million in the year
ended 31 July 2007 to 1.10 million this
year. The housing starts figure for August
2008 was 895,000. There continues
to be significant regional variation with
the markets in Texas and the Carolinas
performing relatively better than the
weakest markets in the Midwest,
Florida, Arizona and California. Despite
the deterioration in trading conditions,
Stock outperformed across all its districts,
with the degree of outperformance
accelerating in the second half of the
financial year.

Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008
In local currency, Stock’s revenue was
down 24.5 per cent to $3,471 million
(2007: $4,596 million), principally reflecting
a 21 per cent decline in same store sales
volumes, the effect of previous branch
closures (4 per cent) and 3 per cent price
deflation in lumber and panels. Acquisitions
contributed $126 million (3 per cent) to
revenue. Stock’s gross margin continued 
to decline due to pricing pressure in the
difficult markets. A trading loss of $246
million was reported for the year, excluding
exceptional restructuring costs of $13 million
relating to 36 branch closures and
headcount reductions, compared to 
a trading profit of $86 million in the prior
year. These restructuring plans and other
business initiatives should give rise to
annualised savings of $124 million. The
trading loss reflected higher provisions of
$65 million for doubtful accounts receivable
and construction loans.
During the year, around $150 million 
of costs were removed, including an
underlying headcount reduction of 3,150,
representing a further 20 per cent of the
total workforce. 
At 31 July 2008, Stock had 285 branches
(2007: 308).
Wolseley Canada
In Canada, the housing market held 
up reasonably well and there has been 
no significant effect from the factors
affecting the US housing market. However,
the stronger Canadian dollar caused a
weakening in sales to Wolseley Canada’s
industrial customers and some price
deflation and gross margin pressure was
experienced as products were bought
more competitively in the US and price
reductions passed into the more
competitive markets.
Against this background, Wolseley Canada’s
local currency revenue increased by 1.4 
per cent to C$1,376 million (2007: C$1,357
million) while trading profit was 14.1 per cent
lower at C$79 million (2007: C$92 million),
excluding C$10 million of exceptional
restructuring costs relating to 15 branch
closures and 50 headcount reductions.
These restructuring plans should give rise
to annualised savings of C$5 million.The
prior year included around C$10 million of
one-off profits, including property profits
and other items. The trading margin was
5.8 per cent (2007: 6.8 per cent). 
Branch numbers in Canada were reduced
by 6 to 254 (2007: 260).
Outlook
While the US commercial and industrial
markets are likely to remain stable for the
next few months, a number of markets in
which the Group operates are expected 
to deteriorate in the short term. The Group
will continue to focus on the necessary
cost reduction and cash maximisation actions
appropriate in difficult markets, to achieve
increased productivity and efficiency, with
further restructuring being undertaken.
Although headcount in Stock has already
been reduced by more than 40 per cent,
further deterioration in the US new housing
market has necessitated a fundamental
review of the business, in order to reduce
its impact on Group results.
Against this background, the Board
remains confident that it will continue to 
be compliant with its banking covenants
over the year to 31 July 2009, and beyond.
Accordingly, the Board has no plans to raise
equity or renegotiate banking covenants,
although these remain options should market
conditions deteriorate very dramatically.

Risk
Market conditions
Wolseley’s products are distributed to a wide range of customers
in connection with commercial, industrial and residential
construction projects and the Group’s results are consequently
dependent on the levels of activity in its markets. The level of
activity varies by market depending on many factors including
general economic conditions, the availability of credit to finance
customer investment, mortgage and other interest rates, inflation,
unemployment, demographic trends, weather, the price of fuel and
consumer confidence.
Financial liquidity and flexibility
Wolseley needs continuing access to funding in order to meet 
its trading obligations, to support investment in the organic growth
of the business and to make acquisitions when opportunities
arise. There is a risk that Wolseley may be unable to obtain
additional funds when needed, or that such funds will only 
be available on unfavourable terms. 
Wolseley’s existing bank facilities include a covenant that its 
net debt should not exceed 3.5 times its annualised EBITDA. 
A breach of this covenant could result in a significant proportion 
of the Group’s borrowings becoming payable immediately.
In order to remain in compliance with this covenant, and
depending on the future performance of its business, Wolseley
might have to take actions that it would not otherwise have
chosen, or might be unable to take opportunities it would
otherwise have pursued.
Product prices and availability
The market price and availability of products distributed by the
Group, such as stainless steel, copper, plastic, lumber and other
products (or commodities used in such products), can fluctuate.
These fluctuations can affect operating results.
Lumber prices are affected both by changes in the availability 
of the raw logs and by changes in the volume and age profile 
of production capacity in the industry. Panel prices in the US 
are affected by housing demand and production capacity.
Product shortages may arise as a result of unexpected demand 
or production difficulties and this could have an effect on the
Group’s operations.
Resource management
The Group’s businesses closely monitor both market and
geographic trends and understand lead and lag indicators 
in order to take timely actions to address issues affecting trading.
The diversity of the Group’s operations, the nature of its
customer base and its ability to react to market changes also
provide a degree of protection.
The Group regularly updates its five-year strategic plan to 
reflect changing market conditions and prepares medium-term
financial forecasts and shorter-term budgets on the basis of 
this plan.
These allow the Group to monitor its capital structure and to
assess its requirement for financing over the forecast period,
and its future compliance with covenants attaching to the
sources of finance. The Group can also assess whether the
overall balance of debt and equity remains appropriate, and
whether it may be appropriate to diversify its sources of funding.
The Group’s policy is to maintain committed facilities for at least
two years forward which give it 20 per cent headroom over the
highest forecast level of borrowing within that period. Expiring
facilities are renewed or replaced and additional facilities obtained,
whenever market conditions are favourable, subject to this
overriding requirement.
If these forecasts indicate periods of limited headroom against
covenants, the Group is able to identify such rigorous and 
timely actions as are necessary to restore a comfortable 
margin of compliance, while remaining focused on the existing 
strategy, and ensuring that the infrastructure of the business 
is not damaged.
The Group’s businesses actively review market prices for 
their supplies and take steps to protect themselves or, indeed,
maximise opportunities arising from significant anticipated price
rises. In many cases, the businesses are able to cooperate with
their supplier base to manage the effects of such product price
changes. Generally, the Group is able to pass on price increases
from its suppliers to its customers.
The Group sources products from a wide variety of
manufacturers and suppliers with none of these accounting for
more than 5 per cent of its total material and supply purchases
during the 2008 financial year. Increasing collaboration with
suppliers including joint demand forecasting initiatives is also
helping to better manage product shortage issues.

Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Risk management
In any business, there are a number of
risks and uncertainties which could have 
an impact on its long-term performance.
The Group has an extensive risk
management structure in place which is
designed to identify, manage and mitigate
business risk. The Group recognises that
the risks and uncertainties facing its
businesses are constantly changing and 
it therefore empowers local companies 
to monitor these and deploy mitigation
resources as appropriate.
Risk assessment and evaluation is an
essential part of the annual planning cycle
and an important aspect of the Group’s
internal control system. The relevant
structures and processes across the 
Group are more fully described on 
pages 48 and 49.
The ability of Wolseley to monitor, 
assess and respond to these business
risks can often provide it with competitive
advantages and hence the business’s
resources are carefully managed in these
areas. The principal risks faced by the

Risk
Competitive pressures
The Group operates in a number of different markets with differing
characteristics. The principal aspects of the Group’s offerings that
have an impact on its competitive position in a market are product
availability, supply chain efficiency, pricing, the quality of its people,
customer service, branch location, availability of credit, an efficient
and streamlined organisation, technical product knowledge 
with respect to application and usage, and advisory and other
service capabilities.
In its markets, Wolseley competes with, and is affected by, 
the actions of many local and regional distributors together with
product manufacturers. Consolidation in the building materials
market may produce pressure on prices and margins, although
the competitive environment remains highly fragmented.
Systems and infrastructure capabilities
Wolseley targets sustained double-digit growth from a
combination of acquisitions and organic growth. This growth
places increasing demands on Wolseley’s existing systems 
and on its supply chain and logistics infrastructure. Additionally, 
to support and enable future growth, the Group is undertaking
multiple business change initiatives and is in the process of
installing a common IT platform across the Group.
Identification and successful integration of acquisitions
While Wolseley is currently focused on cost reduction and 
cash flow enhancement, its long-term growth strategy is in part
dependent on acquiring businesses. It may be unable to identify
businesses that are available-for-sale at a price that the Group
considers acceptable in the prevailing market conditions. 
If opportunities are identified, the Group may not have sufficient
financial capacity to be able to exploit them.
The integration of acquisitions also involves a number of further
risks, including diversion of management’s attention, failure to
retain key personnel of the acquired business and risks associated
with unanticipated events or liabilities.
Resource management
The Group actively works with its customers to find innovative
ways to meet their changing needs in order to remain at the
forefront of its chosen markets. Wolseley’s value proposition 
is based on the service, expertise and the product breadth it 
offers rather than strictly competing on price.
The combination of Wolseley’s international scale, allowing it to
continually invest efficiently in people, technology and logistics,
thus reducing the underlying cost base, together with local
company autonomy for managing the customer base, is designed
to enhance the Group’s competitive position.
Wolseley is committed to investing to support its short-, medium-
and long-term growth targets and ensures the appropriate
infrastructure is in place. There are several business improvement
initiatives under way relating to supply chain, sourcing, private
label, human resources, the deployment of technology and
customer service, although certain of these have been slowed 
or deferred because of current restrictions on capital expenditure.
These initiatives are actively and carefully planned with defined
governance procedures in place. An important component of 
this planning process is to ensure that the risks of disruption 
to the business are controlled and monitored.
The Group continues to expect to find sufficient, suitably priced
acquisitions, to enable it to meet its growth targets. The Group
also has the advantage of being able to expand and leverage its
extensive existing network as an alternative means to achieving
growth in certain areas.

Risk
Governmental regulations
The Group’s operations are affected by various statutes,
regulations and laws in the countries and markets in which it
operates. While the Group is not engaged in a regulated industry,
it is subject to the laws governing businesses generally, including
laws affecting land usage, zoning, environmental management
(including laws and regulations affecting the supply of lumber),
health and safety, transportation, labour and employment practices
(including pensions), competition and other matters. In addition,
building codes or particular tax treatments may affect the 
products Wolseley’s customers are allowed to use and,
consequently, changes in these may affect the saleability 
of some Wolseley products.
Litigation
The international nature of Wolseley’s operations exposes it to 
the potential for litigation from third parties. In the US, the risk 
of litigation is generally higher than that in Europe in such areas 
as workers’ compensation, general employer liability and
environmental and asbestos litigation.
There is risk that due to the increasing sourcing of products from
lower cost countries, recourse to the manufacturer by a customer
may be more difficult were a product to fail.
People
Wolseley’s ability to provide leadership and products and services
to customers is dependent on retaining sufficiently qualified,
experienced and motivated personnel.
In order to achieve its growth strategy and increase productivity,
Wolseley must continue to increase this skill and experience base
to develop the managers of the future.
The current difficult conditions experienced in certain markets, 
and the Group’s response to them, have increased staff turnover
and may demotivate remaining staff.
Resource management
The Group monitors regulations across its markets to ensure
that the effects of changes are minimised.
Certain changes in regulations may also positively impact the
businesses. For instance, changes in building regulations in the
UK with regard to the level of heat insulation required in new
buildings have presented a growth opportunity for Wolseley UK.
Such changes may also provide demand for a broader and
higher margin product range.
Wolseley has a culture and approach which is designed to
resolve disputes directly with the party in question in a spirit 
of openness and cooperation.
In the case of asbestos litigation, Wolseley employs independent
professional advisers to actuarially determine the potential gross
liability, which necessitates the application of certain assumptions
relating to claims development and the cost of settling such
claims over the remaining lifetime of the potential litigants, which
is approximately 50 years. There are a number of factors which
could enable actual experience to differ from the assumptions
made. Actual experience is reviewed against the assumptions
each year and the liability adjusted in the financial statements.
Wolseley has insurance cover which comfortably exceeds the
current estimated liability relating to asbestos claims. Based 
on current estimates, no profit or cash flow impact is therefore
expected to arise in the foreseeable future. Wolseley has
recognised a discounted liability of £36 million in respect of
asbestos litigation. An equal receivable amount of £36 million 
is shown in other receivables reflecting the discounted sum
recoverable from insurers in respect of this liability.
One of Wolseley’s key competitive advantages is the quality 
and experience of its people. Local companies have allocated
specific responsibilities for reviewing the performance of senior
managers and employees with high potential. Development and
succession planning for these individuals is planned and strong
performance is actively rewarded.
The Group continues to invest significant time and money 
in senior management, manager development, and graduate
trainee and recruitment programmes.

Risk
Risks related to international operations
Wolseley has its principal operations in Europe and North America
and is therefore subject to the specific risks of conducting
business in these regions. In addition, there are particular risks
arising from managing operations internationally:
• fluctuations in currency exchange rates may affect Wolseley’s
reported operating results and its financial position;
• changes in tax regulation and international tax treaties could
affect the financial performance of Wolseley’s foreign operations;
and
• changes in other regulations/treaties may also affect the ability
of the Group to repatriate profits from its foreign operations.
The management of Wolseley’s businesses and personnel 
across 27 countries can also present logistical and management
challenges due to different business cultures, laws and languages.
Credit risk
Wolseley provides sales on credit terms to many of its customers.
There is an associated risk that customers may not be able to pay
outstanding balances.
Stock also provides loans to finance the construction of properties.
There is an associated risk that customers may not be able to pay
outstanding loan balances.
Resource management
Wolseley believes that the benefits of its geographical spread
outweigh the associated risks. The portfolio effect of economic
conditions, exchange rates and other associated factors of having
operations in Europe and North America provide some protection
in terms of the long-term performance of Wolseley.
The Group continually seeks opportunities to increase its business
diversity and has programmes in place to share best practice.
Increasingly, the Group’s businesses are working together to 
meet customers’ needs and to ensure the Group achieves more
international leverage.
The Group seeks to manage its foreign currency risk and the
steps it takes are described in note 26 to the consolidated
financial statements on page 90. 
The Group actively works with its taxation advisers to understand
the implications of changes to tax legislation, and to minimise its
tax exposure and risk.
Each of the businesses have established procedures in place to
review and collect outstanding receivables. Significant outstanding
and overdue balances are reviewed on a regular basis and resulting
actions are put in place on a timely basis. In many cases, protection
is provided through lien rights on projects or through credit
insurance arrangements.
All of the major businesses use professional, dedicated credit
teams, in some cases field based. Not only does this lessen the
risk of non-payment but it can also provide opportunities where
these teams can work with higher-risk customers to provide
innovative, secured credit arrangements.
Historic write-off rates are low and appropriate provisions 
are made for debts that may be impaired on a timely basis.
Stock’s construction loans are secured on the related properties
and are managed by a dedicated lending team within that
business. Policies are also applied to provide further protection
and KPIs are monitored regularly by management outside the
business. A significant increase in the level of provisions held
against these loans has been recorded in the current year.

Financial review
Revenue and operating profit
Group revenue increased by 2.0 per cent
from £16,221 million to £16,549 million.
Operating profit decreased by 60.1 per
cent from £753 million to £301 million, after
charging exceptional items of £76 million.
Trading profit decreased by 22.1 per cent
from £877 million to £683 million, before
deducting amortisation and impairment 
of acquired intangibles of £306 million
(2007: £124 million) and exceptional items
of £76 million (2007: £nil).
Currency translation
Currency translation increased Group revenue
by £324 million (2.0 per cent) and Group
trading profit by £18 million (2.0 per cent)
compared with 2007. On a constant
currency basis, Group revenue remained
unchanged and trading profit reduced by
23.7 per cent compared with the prior year.
The constant currency growth of the 
Group over the past five years is shown 
in Table 1 below.
The effect of US dollar depreciation has
been to decrease translated US trading
profits by £11 million (2.6 per cent) compared
with 2007. US dollar denominated profits
account for 39 per cent of the Group’s
trading profit. If the results of the Group are
translated into US dollars at the average
rate for the respective year the results of
the Group are as shown in Table 2 below.
Further US dollar figures and the basis of
computation of the amounts in Table 2 can
be found within the Pro forma information
in US dollars section on page 121.
There has been a significant increase in the
euro translation rate which has increased
euro trading profits by £12 million 
(10.0 per cent) compared with 2007. 
euro denominated profits accounted for 
16 per cent of Group trading profit in 2008.
Finance costs
Net finance costs of £156 million (2007:
£119 million), reflect the full year impact of the
DT Group acquisition and higher interest
rates, partly offset by stronger operating
cash flow, and include a one-off charge of
£22 million in respect of the impairment of
an equity investment in Building Materials
Holding Corporation (‘BMHC’) which was
made more than two years ago. Net interest
receivable on construction loans amounted
to £12 million (2007: £11 million). Interest
cover was 5 times (2007: 7 times).
Tax
The effective tax rate, being tax payable 
on profit before tax, exceptional items
and amortisation and impairment of
acquired intangibles, increased from 
25.4 per cent to 29.7 per cent. One of
the main reasons was the effect of the
fall in the Group’s share price on the
deferred tax relating to share-based
payments. After excluding the effect of
deferred tax on share-based payments,
the underlying tax rate for the year is
26.1 per cent (2007: 25.1 per cent).
Earnings per share
Before exceptional items and the
amortisation and impairment of acquired
intangibles, earnings per share decreased
by 35.6 per cent from 87.80 pence to
56.58 pence. Basic earnings per share
were 84.6 per cent lower at 11.33 pence
(2007: 73.52 pence). The average
number of shares in issue during the 
year was 655 million (2007: 644 million).
Dividends
In light of current market conditions, 
the Board has recommended no final
dividend (2007: 21.55 pence per share).
This will result in a cash saving in
November 2008 of approximately

to review the Group’s ability to pay a
dividend and will revert to paying a dividend
as soon as it is prudent to do so.
Financial position
Shareholders’ funds decreased by £92
million from £3,451 million to £3,359 million.
The net decrease comprised the elements
shown in Table 3 below.
During the year the Group entered into
certain foreign exchange transactions 
to hedge the Group’s foreign currency 
net assets. Gains and losses on these
transactions were taken to reserves. The
gains and losses are subject to taxation
and accordingly the taxation arising has
been charged to reserves.
Net debt, excluding construction loan
borrowings, at 31 July 2008 amounted to
£2,469 million compared to £2,467 million at
31 July 2007, giving gearing of 73.5 per cent
compared with 71.5 per cent at the previous
year end and down from 83.9 per cent 
at the half year. The movement of sterling
against overseas currencies, particularly 
the euro, resulted in a translation difference
of £321 million which increased net debt
on the balance sheet.
The Group seeks to maintain a level of
gearing, generally in the range of 40 to 
75 per cent, to strike an appropriate
balance between maintaining an efficient
capital structure and having sufficient
flexibility to fund further acquisitions.
Interest cover for the year was 5 times
(2007: 7 times). The Group is content to
see interest cover in the 7–10 times range
over a number of years but allows the cover
to reduce in appropriate circumstances.
In the US, construction loan receivables,
financed by an equivalent amount of
construction loan borrowings, were £237
million (2007: £286 million). The decrease
reflects a more cautious approach to
lending following the decline in the US 
new housing market.
ROGCE decreased from 13.7 per cent 
to 9.6 per cent as a result of the reduced
profitability, particularly at Stock, and the
weakening of sterling against the euro. 
The ROGCE remains marginally above the
Group’s weighted average cost of capital.
The unamortised balance of acquisition
goodwill in the balance sheet as at 31 July
2008 is £1,995 million (2007: £1,890
million) with the increase being due to the
goodwill arising on acquisitions in the year,
the strengthening of the euro and Danish
krone offset by goodwill impairments in
Stock (£114 million), the Irish business 
of Wolseley UK (£46 million) and the Italian
business of Central and Eastern Europe
(£11 million). As set out on page 80 in 
note 13 to the financial statements, 
the Group recognised, in accordance with 
IAS 38, acquired intangibles of £64 million
(2007: £549 million). These represent,
principally, customer relationships and
brand names.
Provisions in the balance sheet (note 28)
include the estimated liability for asbestos
claims on a discounted basis. This liability
has been determined by independent
professional actuarial advisers. The asbestos
related litigation is covered by insurance
and accordingly an equivalent insurance
receivable has been included in receivables.
The level of insurance cover available
comfortably exceeds the expected level 
of future claims and no profit or cash flow
impact is therefore expected to arise in the
foreseeable future. There were 293 claims
outstanding at 31 July 2008 (2007: 320).
The Group’s retirement benefit obligations
have increased from £111 million to £236
million, largely due to an actuarial loss of
£122 million on the main UK defined benefit
pension scheme comprising a reduction 
of £103 million in the market value of
investments and an increase of £19 million
in the present value of the defined benefit
obligation. Full details of the pension
schemes operated by the Group are set 
out in note 29 to the financial statements.

Net cash flow from operating activities
decreased by only £37 million from 
£1,299 million to £1,262 million, despite
the reduction in trading profit, as the Group
has improved its management of working
capital. Free cash flow after dividends was
£571 million (2007: £626 million).
Capital expenditure decreased from 
£396 million to £317 million, reflecting the
curtailment of certain capital investment
plans. During the year the distribution 
centre network in the US was expanded
and further expenditure was incurred on
the Group’s common IT platform. Capital
expenditure is expected to decrease
significantly in the next financial year following
a decision to postpone certain aspects of the
implementation of the Group’s IT platform
in selected operating companies and to
reduce other planned capital investment 
to reflect current market conditions.
Investment in bolt-on acquisitions
completed during the year, including 
any deferred consideration and net debt,
amounted to £223 million (2007: £379
million, excluding DT Group acquisition of
£1,339 million). These 15 bolt-on acquisitions
are expected to add around £282 million
per annum of incremental revenues in a full
year. Further details regarding acquisitions
are included on page 102 in note 33 to the
financial statements.
Shareholder return
The Group monitors relative Total Shareholder
Return (‘TSR’) for incentive purposes 
(as set out within the Remuneration report
on pages 51 and 58 and for assessing
relative financial performance.
For the year ended 31 July 2008, Wolseley
achieved an annualised TSR of minus 
62 per cent based on the average closing
price achieved during July 2008, which put
it in 59th position against the monitored
peer group of 67 companies drawn from
the FTSE 100 and the building materials
and construction sectors utilised for the
latest award under the long-term incentive
plan. Details of TSR performance since
2004 and the composition of the peer
group are set out in the Remuneration
report on page 58. We continue to
monitor return on capital including
goodwill, throughout the Group, as one of
the key measures of business performance.
ROGCE (as defined on page 14) was 
9.6 per cent (2007: 13.7 per cent), 
above the Group’s weighted average
cost of capital. At the close of business
on the date of the Report of the Directors,
the value of an ordinary share as quoted
in the Financial Times was 470 pence
(2007: 807.5 pence), a decline of 41.79
per cent. The decrease primarily reflects
adverse market sentiment relating to the
Group’s exposure to the weak US
housing market. The market
capitalisation of the Group at the date 
of this Report was £3,111 million (2007:
£5,399 million). The total dividend of
11.25 pence per share in respect of the
financial year gives a yield of 2.4 per cent.

Other financial matters
Financial risk management
The Group is exposed to market risks
arising from its international operations, and
the financial instruments which fund them.
The main risks arising from the Group’s
financial instruments are interest rate risk,
liquidity risk and foreign currency risk. 
The Group has well defined policies for 
the management of interest rate, liquidity,
foreign exchange and counterparty
exposures, which have been consistently
applied during the financial years ended 
31 July 2007 and 2008. By the nature 
of its business, the Group also has trade
credit and commodity price exposures, 
the management of which is delegated 
to the operating businesses. There has
been no change since the year end in the
major financial risks faced by the Group.
The Treasury Committee of the Board
reviews and agrees policies for managing
each of these risks and they are
summarised below. The Group’s financial
instruments, other than derivatives,
comprise borrowings, cash and liquid
resources and various items, such as trade
receivables and trade payables that arise
directly from its operations. The Group 
also enters into derivative transactions
(principally interest rate swaps and forward
foreign currency contracts). The purpose 
of such transactions is to hedge certain
interest rate and currency risks arising 
from the Group’s operations and its
sources of finance.
Details of financial instruments are shown
on pages 89 to 92 in note 26 to the
financial statements.
It is, and has been throughout the period
under review, the Group’s policy that 
no trading in financial instruments or
speculative transactions be undertaken.
Capital structure and covenants
The Group monitors two principal
measures of financial gearing, the ratio 
of net debt to shareholders’ funds and 
the ratio of net debt to EBITDA (earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortisation). Over the longer term the
Group aims to maintain the ratio of net
debt to shareholders’ funds within the
range of 40 to 75 per cent while allowing 
it to go up to 100 per cent for short
periods if there is a firm plan to return to
the target range. As at 31 July 2008 the
ratio was 73.5 per cent. The Group aims 
to maintain the ratio of net debt to EBITDA
generally in the range of 1.5 to 2.3.
At 31 July 2008, the Group’s main
borrowing facilities all had a financial
covenant that required that the ratio of net
debt to EBITDA should not exceed 3.5. 
As at 31 July 2008 the ratio was 2.7:1
(2007: 2.2:1), calculated as shown in 
Table 4 below.
Liquidity risk
The Group maintains a policy of ensuring
sufficient borrowing headroom to finance 
all investment and bolt-on acquisitions 
for the following financial year with an
additional contingent safety margin. Large
acquisitions, such as that of DT Group in
September 2006, are funded shortly before
the acquisition is made.
The year-end maturity profile of the Group’s
borrowings and committed undrawn
facilities was as shown in Table 5 below.

WO40011_R&A_10-31  3/10/08  14:44  Page 30 During the year ended 31 July 2008, a fully
drawn facility for a500 million (£393 million)
expired, and a fully drawn facility for
US$500 million (£252 million) was repaid
early and cancelled. Two new facilities were
entered into, for US$200 million and a250
million (£297 million in aggregate), both of
which will expire on 1 August 2011. The
undrawn loan facilities are available to fund
working capital, investments and general
corporate purposes.
Interest rate risk
The Group finances its operations through
a mixture of retained profits and bank and
other borrowings. The Group borrows in
the desired currencies principally at floating
rates of interest and then uses interest 
rate swaps to generate the desired interest
rate profile, thereby managing the Group’s
exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
At the year end, approximately £1,256
million of the Group’s net debt was at fixed
rates for one year or more, after taking
account of swaps.
Foreign currency risk
The Group has significant overseas
businesses whose revenues are mainly
denominated in the currencies of the
countries in which the operations are
located. The Group does not have
significant transactional foreign currency
cash flow exposure. However, those that
do arise are generally hedged with either
forward contracts or currency options. 
The Group does not normally hedge profit
translation exposure since such hedges
have only temporary effect. Most of the
foreign currency earnings generated by the
Group’s overseas operations are reinvested
in the business to fund growth in those
territories. The Group’s policy is to maintain
the majority of its debt in the currencies 
of its operating companies as this hedges
both the net assets and cash flows of 
the Group.
Commodity risk
The Group’s operating performance is
affected by price fluctuations in stainless
steel, nickel alloy, copper, aluminium,
plastic, lumber and other commodities. 
The Group seeks to minimise the effects 
of changing prices through economies of
purchasing and inventory management,
resulting in cost reductions and productivity
improvements as well as price increases 
to maintain reasonable profit margins. 
Financial reporting
These financial statements are the Group’s
third prepared under IFRS. The Group’s
accounting policies set out on pages 63 
to 67 of the accounts have remained
unchanged from those disclosed last year,
except for the definition of exceptional
items, and the effects of adopting IFRS 7,
IFRS 8 and IFRIC 11, which have resulted
in additional disclosures but have not had 
a significant impact on the Group’s financial
position or results of operations.
Insurance
The Group has a captive insurance company
which is registered and operational in the 
Isle of Man. No policies are written for third
parties. The administration is undertaken 
by a specialist management company. 
The Group’s insurance arrangements are
reviewed annually.
Going concern
The Directors are confident, on the basis 
of current financial projections and facilities
available, that the Company and the Group
have adequate resources to continue 
in operation for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly the Directors continue to adopt
the going concern basis in preparing the
financial statements.

Corporate responsibility report
Over the years, our operating
companies have developed
good practices in environmental
management and have
introduced award-winning 
health and safety programmes.
However, after rapid expansion through
organic growth and acquisitions, there 
is an opportunity to share and strengthen
best practices for the benefit of all Group
companies. This year we have developed 
a strategy to deliver a coordinated
approach to corporate responsibility 
across the Group.
The strategy was approved by the Board 
in July 2008 and will help us to build on 
our strengths, improve performance, share
best practices and, where we are able to,
implement industry-leading initiatives.
It introduces, for the first time, a framework
to set consistent standards across the
Group. This will allow individual operating
companies, and the Group as a whole, 
to measure progress over time.
Our strategy is based on five focus areas:
• health and safety;
• environment;
• people development;
• responsible business;
• community engagement.
The strategy establishes a clear framework
for the Group over a five-year period. 
The framework allows sufficient flexibility 
for our operating companies to set their
own objectives by reference to their local
priorities and resources. 
We anticipate that those objectives will
evolve over time as the needs and priorities
of our customers, employees, suppliers
and shareholders develop. 
Progress against objectives will be
measured by each operating company
using our ‘Building Block’ concept: 
each of the five focus areas has minimum
standards and a hierarchy of progression
leading to the highest reasonable standard
that can be achieved. The ‘Building Block’
structure, an outline of which is shown
above, will allow operating companies 
to measure their progress in reaching the
highest standards and recognises that
not all companies are at the same stage
of development in all five focus areas. 
The drivers for progression through each
level will be different in each business. It
is also envisaged that some businesses
might achieve their goals within an earlier
time frame than the overall five-year plan.

Corporate responsibility report continued
The values and behaviours which support 
our corporate responsibility strategy, 
and which help us to sustain and build 
on our current achievements, include:
• making our work environments safe 
for our employees and customers;
• placing our customers at the heart 
of everything we do;
• creating efficient operations that 
minimise waste, reduce our contribution
to climate change and promote
sustainable products;
• conducting our business with integrity;
• supporting the communities and
societies in which we work; and
• developing our employees at all levels of
our organisation to strengthen customer
service and ensuring long-term career
development.
Essential to the delivery of our corporate
responsibility strategy are our employees
around the Group, whose expertise,
experience and enthusiasm will help us 
to achieve the ambitious targets that we
set ourselves.
We will provide a safe and
healthy working environment
and we will not compromise
the health and safety of any
individual.
Wolseley’s health and safety policy 
requires local management to have suitable
procedures in place to ensure compliance
with applicable laws and regulations. Whilst
our operating companies have measured
performance and improvements efficiently,
it is intended that we set consistent
standards and adopt a consistent
methodology for review of performance
across the Group.
Our Year 1 initiatives are aimed at
standardising the governance of health 
and safety and delivering information 
to enable performance to be measured
consistently:
• a standardised process for reporting
major incidents, issuing safety alerts 
and communicating key learning points;
• improvement actions for key safety
hazards, risks and controls;
• engaging more employees in training
programmes;
• production of local safety action plans;
and
• identifying improvements from reviewing
existing KPIs and developing new KPIs.
Whilst data has been collected for some
time, the following KPIs will be measured
on a common basis across the Group from
1 August 2008:
• Medical injury frequency
Number of at-work injuries requiring
medical treatment per 100 employees;
• Fleet collision frequency
Number of third-party vehicle collisions
per 100 vehicles.
With 74,000 employees and a fleet 
of 22,000 vehicles, the safety of our 
people and our vehicles is essential to 
our operations. We always aim to identify
areas for improvement and, where good
practices exist, we are improving our
processes to share them across the Group.
We intend to introduce additional KPIs to
further improve the measurement of our
performance as our systems develop. 
We will report on progress against our Year 1
initiatives, including our KPIs, in 2009.
In addition to health and safety training 
for all employees, examples of current
practices and progress in 2007/08 include:
Wolseley Europe
UK
• The Executive Safety Steering Group
reviews the UK business’ performance 
in health and safety matters, promotes
good practice and ensures appropriate
consultation on any intended changes to
its health and safety management systems. 
• Internal ‘health and safety awards’,
covering five separate categories, are
awarded to the highest performing
branch locations and promote a positive
attitude towards occupational health 
and safety.
• Wolseley UK has achieved a 50 per cent
reduction in third-party fleet collisions in
four years and was recognised for its
achievements during the year with fleet
safety awards from the UK Royal Society
for the Prevention of Accidents, the UK
Minister for Transport and from Brake,
the UK road safety charity.
• 200 managers completed the Institute of
Occupational Safety and Health’s Safety
for Senior Executives training.
• Implementation of an industry-leading
substance abuse policy and screening
programme.
• Wolseley UK has reduced its reportable
injury accident rate by over 30 per cent in
three years. In recognition of its continued
improvement in occupational health and
safety performance, the company was
awarded a Gold award by the UK Royal
Society for the Prevention of Accidents
for the second consecutive year.
France
• The Health and Safety Committee
promotes enhanced health and safety
performance throughout the French
businesses.
• A Safety Charter demonstrates a
commitment by all Wolseley France
executive committee members in relation
to health and safety matters.
• Representatives of Brossette and its
employees sit on local health and safety
committees, together with occupational
health doctors.
Austria
• ÖAG operates an employee
immunisation programme. 
Wolseley North America
• The Health and Safety Committee was
established to share best practices and
has driven significant improvements to
the long-term trends in health and safety
records across the continent. 
• The Winning Ideas in Safety & Health
(W.I.S.H.) competition for employees
promotes safety as an underlying theme in
the way the businesses operate each day.
• Over 7,000 drivers have completed a
‘Decision Driving’ online driver training
course and over 500 drivers have
completed a one-day course which 
uses a ‘train the trainer’ concept so 
that lessons can be cascaded to 
other drivers.
• Drivers are trained in a variety of ways 
to recognise hazardous conditions, plan
the appropriate response and take
decisive action.
• Entry level driver training is required 
of all newly recruited drivers.

Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Our business Performance review Governance Financial statements Other information 
We will run efficient
operations that minimise
waste and reduce our
contribution to climate
change. We will promote
sustainable development.
The Group has a responsibility to manage
the impact of its operations on the
environment so that any harm is minimised
and positive contribution is maximised. 
At every stage of our products’ life-cycle,
from the sourcing of materials through 
their transportation and ultimate use and
disposal, we are finding ways to reduce 
our carbon impact. Wolseley will continue
to make improvements in environmental
performance through the efficient use of
energy, water and packaging and will
promote the use of sustainable products. 
Environmental data collection
The Group has developed a data collection
tool to evaluate the data reported in 
this section. The data was reviewed for
completeness and quality and analysed 
by an independent third party. This is the
second year in which the Group has
reported on its environmental performance.
We have continued to develop the
systems to enable the reporting of
reliable data across all Group businesses
and, over time, we expect to improve 
the scope and integrity of the data that
we collect. This year, we have been able
to report on a larger proportion of the
Group’s operations compared with 2007,
with an improvement in data quality.
Because of the change in the Group’s
activities over the year, and the increase
in volume of data gathered, comparison
of this year’s results with those from
2007 does not provide a useful indication
of performance or trends. We will
continue to develop our data systems in
order to present a basis for year-on-year
comparisons in future reports.
Carbon (CO2) emissions 
Emissions of CO2 have been reported
according to the Greenhouse Gas
(‘GHG’) Protocol, which was jointly
developed by the World Business
Council for Sustainable Development 
and the World Resources Institute. 
The standard differentiates between
emissions for which businesses are
directly responsible, indirect emissions
caused in the generation of supplied
electricity and all other indirect emissions
both upstream and downstream. As it 
is impossible to know or control the
downstream emissions caused when
products sold by the Group are used,
they have been excluded from this
report. Similarly, reporting on the
upstream emissions of our businesses
would currently rely heavily on estimates
and, as a result, they have also been
excluded from this analysis. However,
given the nature of our operations, the
Group does believe that it is appropriate
to report on the emissions from third-
party provided transportation.

Waste management
Wolseley recognises its responsibility to
measure and minimise the waste generated
by its business activities. Waste is divided
into hazardous and non-hazardous – with
hazardous waste containing properties
which may render it harmful to human
health or the environment and non-
hazardous waste comprising general
waste, such as paper, card, wood, 
plastics and metals. 
Water use
We have continued to measure water
consumption throughout the Group during
the year to enable the appropriate goals to
be set for greater water efficiency. 
Timber
Wolseley recognises the importance of
sourcing timber from sustainable, well-
managed forests. We are committed to 
the elimination of illegally logged timber 
from our supply chain. 
In support of our global timber policy,
which sets out Wolseley’s commitment 
to the responsible purchasing of forest
products, we have developed a global 
risk assessment system that identifies the
legal and sustainable status of the timber
products we purchase. The system
provides an assessment of product
information from our suppliers, including
details of species and country of origin, 
and captures supporting documentary
evidence. This information is verified for
Wolseley by an independent third party.

The system is particularly valuable where
timber is sourced from forest areas
where credible certification schemes do
not currently operate, which may pose 
a greater risk of non-compliance with our
policy. Assessments began in April 2008
and we continue to work with our suppliers
to collect and evaluate their data and to
take appropriate action where required.
We will report on progress in next year’s
Corporate responsibility report.
Wolseley operates chain of custody
schemes in its European businesses that
provide independently certified verification
of the ownership of products throughout
the supply chain. Documentation to
support the chain of custody is also
captured by our risk assessment system,
further supporting our efforts to supply
only timber sourced from well-managed
forests. In the US, Stock Building Supply
(‘Stock’) relies upon the chain of custody
procedures operated by its suppliers. 
The vast majority of purchases made by
Stock are from North American suppliers
who hold recognised certifications and
whose harvests are strictly controlled by
US and Canadian Federal and State law.
Stock also maintains an extensive
dialogue with its suppliers regarding
sustainability issues.
Our aim is to be certain that all our timber
is obtained from legal sources operating
responsible forest management practices.
Where we cannot be certain, we
encourage our suppliers to make efforts
to improve their own practices and work
towards credible certification. This should
ensure that, as well as being compliant
with all applicable laws, our timber 
is sourced from sustainable forests. 
We monitor our progress each year.
Examples of current practices and
progress in 2007/08 include:
Wolseley Europe
UK
• Wolseley UK has continued
development of its Environmental
Management System. ISO 14001
accreditation has been achieved in 
a further two branches, bringing the 
total to 13.
• Over the past year, more than 100
vehicles have been removed from the
Wolseley UK fleet through transport
planning and other initiatives.
Wolseley Sustainable 
Building Center
This year, Wolseley opened the UK’s 
first showcase for sustainable building
products and construction methods. 
The Wolseley Sustainable Building
Center (‘SBC’), at Leamington Spa in
Warwickshire, aims to accelerate the 
UK building industry’s move towards
sustainable construction. 
Built at a cost of £3.2 million, the 6,800
square feet SBC is a living, interactive
centre for decision-makers throughout
the construction industry. 
The unique new building will enable 
all involved in construction – from
architects through to jobbing builders –
to experience the latest technologies 
and the widest range of sustainable,
energy-efficient and recycled building
products. For the first time, it brings
together information about 7,000
sustainable products that are available
through Wolseley UK’s network of 
1,800 branches. 
The building itself features 170 types 
of products, including photovoltaic
technology for converting daylight into
electricity, harvested rainwater used 
for flushing toilets and landscaping,
sustainable drainage systems, sedum
roofing, sheep’s wool natural insulation,
biomass boiler heating, ground source
heat pumps, engineered timber, natural
and low energy lighting, water saving
devices and energy-efficient glazing.
Wolseley’s specially trained staff 
provide visitors with information, 
data and guidance on the most
appropriate materials for specific
projects, from single homes through to
large-scale commercial developments.
The two-storey building also features 
a training and presentation theatre 
and café facilities for events, launches
and demonstrations, to engage 
with groups from all sectors of the
construction industry. 
The SBC opened formally in May 2008,
following a series of preview days 
for Wolseley staff. Leading industry
figures and journalists also attended
other opening events resulting in
widespread media coverage.
The SBC is already attracting great
interest from some of the UK’s leading
developers and property companies
engaged in major building programmes.
At the time of its opening, more than 
140 groups had booked visits to the SBC.
These include existing and potential
customers, government agencies,
professional bodies and suppliers.
In an industry first, ‘self-builders’ across
the UK are being given the opportunity
to see first hand the range of sustainable
products and renewable technologies
available to them. In October 2008, the
SBC will host the first of a series of 
‘Self-Build Saturdays’, free events that
will enable ‘self-builders’ to gain a
greater understanding of the latest
sustainable products and technologies 
– from design and application to
efficiencies and payback. Wolseley’s
SBC team and key suppliers will offer
expert advice on the benefits of
choosing eco-friendly products.
Seminars and demonstrations of
sustainable products and technologies
will form a key part of the SBC’s ongoing
engagement with the building industry. 
The SBC has already been recognised
by several industry awards. These
include an award for innovation from 
the UK Institution of Civil Engineers 
and a sustainable supplier award from
the UK health sector.
More information is available on the 
SBC website at www.wolseleysbc.co.uk.

For example, where it is efficient to do so, 
the company’s delivery fleet is utilised to
collect orders from suppliers, saving over
10,000 supplier deliveries in the past year
with a net saving of 1.5 million kilometres
per year. Wolseley UK’s target is to
reduce its fleet by a further 75 vehicles 
or 2 million kilometres per year.
• A Carbon Reduction Working Group has
been established to develop a strategy to
reduce carbon emissions.
• All branches participate in a waste
backhauling initiative, sending their clear
plastic, cardboard and good pallets back
to the distribution centres on Wolseley 
UK-owned vehicles. In addition to
reducing the amount of waste sent 
to landfill, this creates a revenue stream
for the business.
• Over the past two years, Wolseley UK
has increased its rate of waste recycling
from 3 per cent to approximately 
40 per cent.
• A waste rationalisation programme in all
branches has reduced scheduled waste
collection services by approximately 
50 per cent in the year. 
Ireland
• All cardboard and plastic waste is
backhauled from branches to the
distribution centre for recycling.
Netherlands
• A sustainable energy product centre 
was established in 2000.
Nordic region
• Beijer Byggmaterial has achieved 
ISO 14001 accreditation. 
Wolseley North America
• Businesses aim to purchase forklift
vehicles with enhanced emissions controls.
• Fleet mileage reduction initiatives for 
all vehicles have been implemented.
• A Green Committee was established 
in 2007 to formalise a green business
strategy.
We value our employees 
and their diversity. We will
develop our people, reward
them competitively and
engage them in our corporate
responsibility activities.
We encourage all employees to achieve
their best personal performance. We aim 
to achieve this by providing a supportive
workplace environment that promotes
development, learning and advancement.
Training programmes for all levels of
employee continue to be a high priority 
for the Group with over £13 million 
spent on employee training during 
the 2007/08 financial year.
Wolseley continues to operate continental
and global leadership development
programmes designed to develop and
improve the management and leadership
skills of its senior and high potential
employees. To date, over 800 employees
have attended Wolseley management
training programmes and 35 executives
have attended leadership development
programmes at universities in North
America and Europe.
During the year to 31 July 2008, over 900
new graduates were recruited onto our six
graduate training programmes in Europe
and North America. The programmes 
have been very effective in developing 
talent within our businesses and our
retention rates exceed industry standards
for similar schemes. Once graduates
complete the programmes, they are placed
into operational and management roles 
with Wolseley businesses.
Promotion from within is part of our culture.
There are no limits for those employees
who demonstrate the skills and experience
to achieve their ambitions. Over 90 per cent 
of Ferguson Enterprises (‘Ferguson’) branch
managers were developed through its
training programme. Many of our senior
executives, including Chip Hornsby our
Group Chief Executive, began their careers
as Ferguson branch manager trainees.
Our other businesses are aiming for 
similar successes.
Key accomplishments and initiatives during
2007/08 include:
Group
• This year we launched a scheme
designed to link incentives from the
Boardroom to the branch by aligning
operating companies’ objectives with 
the Group’s ‘Earn, Turn, Grow’ initiative.
• As part of our overall Business Change
Programme, this year we have seen
excellent progress with the Group’s
Human Resource Management System
solution. By 31 December 2008, over 
60 per cent of our operating companies
will be live on the system. This begins a 
new era in the continued development 
of human resources within the business.
• Employee satisfaction surveys were
carried out in DT Group, Ferguson,
Wolseley France and Wolseley UK.
Wolseley Europe
Wolseley has continued to encourage
and enable employees in the Continental
European companies to purchase
Wolseley shares through a renewed
invitation to participate in its European
Sharesave Plan. Approximately 20,000
employees are eligible to join the plan.
Wolseley North America
Our North American human resources
function has continued its process of
consolidation in order to deliver cost
savings while improving the benefits
package the business offers its employees.
Examples include the introduction of 
a primary retirement plan as well as a
combined life insurance and disability
programme across Ferguson and Stock.
We are committed to 
working within the laws 
and regulations of all
jurisdictions in which we
operate and to comply with
our Code of Ethics. We will
encourage our suppliers 
to meet similar standards.
The Group’s Code of Ethics sets out a
number of fundamental principles which
all Group companies and employees 
are required to follow. The Code covers
many areas including fair competition,
compliance with laws, including anti-trust
laws, and maintenance of the Group’s
reputation for integrity, including a
prohibition on bribery and general
principles for dealing with suppliers 
and authorities. The Code can be 
viewed on the Company’s website at
www.wolseley.com or a printed copy is
available from the Company Secretary. 
Our subsidiary businesses are required 
to adopt their own codes which respect
local cultures and practices but which
also set clear standards which are no
less exacting than those detailed in the
Group Code. These individual codes 
are appropriate to the scope of the 
local operation. All new companies
joining the Group are required to adopt 
codes of ethics on the same basis as
existing businesses.

businesses support many charities relevant
to the countries and locations in which they
operate. These are wide-ranging and cover
health, welfare, sports, education, civic and
community projects as well as culture and
the arts.
In addition to the donations and
contributions in kind made at a local
business level, several hundred donations 
to charitable activities are made each year
by the Group’s UK-based charitable trust.
This year, the trustees of the charitable 
trust will review its policies and strategy,
with the aim of developing a more focused
programme of partnership with selected
organisations.
Further details of the amount of donations
made during the year can be found on
page 43.
Examples of some of the wide range of
initiatives the Group’s businesses were
involved in during the year include:
Wolseley Europe
UK
• Wolseley UK is a patron of the 
UK construction industry charity 
CRASH, which supports projects for
homeless people.

Gymnastics as part of the FTSE-British
Olympic Association initiative. Wolseley 
is advising on various strategic and
commercial projects as the Association
works towards its goals for the London
2012 Olympics.
• Wolseley UK supplies building materials
to skills centres around the UK run by
MITIE, one of its largest customers. 
The centres teach construction industry
skills and students who complete the

Wolseley employees.
Ireland
• Wolseley businesses support many
local sports events and charities.
Nordic region
• DT Group companies sponsor various
local sports teams.
Wolseley North America

fires that spread throughout southern
California in October 2007.

in south-eastern Virginia in April 2008,
Ferguson and Stock employees worked
together to distribute relief materials
such as tarpaulins, plywood, nails and
hammers supplied by the businesses.
• Wolseley Canada is a national sponsor
of Special Olympics Canada, supporting
athletes with intellectual disabilities. As
well as corporate donations, employees
across Canada volunteer in various
Special Olympics events.
Community
Engagement 5
Over the coming financial year, we intend 
to develop two new initiatives, which will
strengthen our standards and demonstrate
our commitment to sustaining our ethical
business practices:
• we will begin the process of seeking
assurances from our suppliers regarding
a number of social measures, including 
in relation to labour standards; and
• we will develop an anti-fraud and
corruption prevention programme which
will reinforce the standards we expect
from our employees and suppliers. 
We will also provide further training 
for our employees to minimise the 
risks associated with working in an
increasingly competitive environment.
We will report on the progress of these
initiatives in 2009. 
We will be a responsible
member of the communities
in which we work.
Our corporate responsibility strategy 
defines targets at both Group and local
levels designed to help us contribute 
to society. We aim to engage with the 
local communities where our operations 
are based, as well as nationally and
internationally. We recognise that the 
way we do business can have a positive
impact at all levels. We continue to build
strong relationships with our neighbours,
our suppliers and our customers in order 
to maximise our contribution to the
communities that they and we support.
In the UK, we continue to work with
Business in the Community to identify 
ways in which we can improve our impact
as an employer. Across the Group, local

For the year ended 31 July 2008
42 Report of the Directors
Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008
The Directors submit their annual report and the audited
consolidated financial statements of the Company and its
subsidiaries for the year ended 31 July 2008.
Principal activities and business review
Wolseley plc is the parent company of the Group and its
operating subsidiaries are organised into two geographical
divisions, which are set out in the Performance review on pages
16 to 22. The principal activities of the Group are the distribution 
of plumbing, heating and air conditioning equipment, pipes, 
valves and fittings and building materials (including timber) within
Europe and North America. In the USA, the Group also supplies
other construction and installation services. In the UK, France 
and Austria, the Group operates tool hire centres and, in the 
UK, France and USA, it distributes electrical components and
supplies. Details of the development of the Group’s businesses
during the year, including an assessment of the Group’s exposure
to financial risks and how these are managed, and information
which fulfils the requirements of the Business Review, are given 
in the Performance review and in the Group Chief Executive’s
review, which are incorporated into this report by reference.
Results and dividends
The Group’s consolidated income statement, set out on page 
60, shows a decrease of 60 per cent in Group operating profit
from £753 million in 2007 to £301 million. An analysis of revenue
and trading profit is given in note 2 to the financial statements.
Details relating to post balance sheet events are given in note 
42. Shareholders were paid the 2008 interim dividend of 11.25
pence per share (2007: 10.85 pence) on 30 May 2008. No final
dividend is recommended for the year ended 31 July 2008 (2007:
21.55 pence).
The Wolseley plc 2004 Overseas Employee Benefit Trust, the
Wolseley plc 2004 Employee Benefit Trust and the Wolseley plc
2004 Directors Benefit Trust were established on 5 October 2004
in connection with the Wolseley Share Option Plan 2003 and 
the Wolseley plc 2002 Long Term Incentive Scheme, details of
which are set out in the Remuneration report on pages 51 to 
58. The trustees of each of the trusts have waived their rights to
receive dividends on any shares held by them. Following purchases
of shares in the capital of the Company made between November
2004 and January 2007 and the vesting of 6,472 shares in 
March 2008, the trustees of the Wolseley plc 2004 Employee
Benefit Trust hold 6,193,528 ordinary shares in the capital of the
Company and the average purchase price was 1174.7 pence per
share (excluding dealing costs). The amount of dividends waived
that would have been payable during the year ended 31 July
2008 was £2,032,872 (2007: £1,572,000). 
Change of control
The Company does not have agreements with any Director 
or Officer that would provide compensation for loss of office 
or employment resulting from a change of control following a
takeover bid, except that provisions of the Company’s share 
plans may cause options and awards granted under such
schemes to vest on a takeover.
All of the Company’s share schemes contain provisions relating 
to a change of control. Outstanding options and awards would
normally vest and become exercisable for a limited period of time
upon a change of control following a takeover, reconstruction or
winding up of the Company (not being an internal organisation),
subject at that time to rules concerning the satisfaction of any
performance conditions.
Acquisitions and disposals
Details of acquisitions and disposals made during the year are
contained in the Performance review and in notes 33 and 35 
to the financial statements. 
Future development
It remains the Board’s intention to develop the Group through
organic growth and by selective acquisitions. The Board will 
aim to position the Group to meet the challenges created by the
current market conditions with actions designed to achieve the
best long-term value for shareholders whilst ensuring that the
strategic objectives of the Group are not compromised, in order
that the Group is in a position to capitalise from the opportunities
created by any market recovery.
Share capital
As at 31 July 2008, 661,982,888 fully paid ordinary shares of 
25 pence were in issue and listed on the London Stock Exchange.
The rights and obligations attaching to the Company’s ordinary
shares, as well as the powers of the Company’s Directors, are 
set out in the Company’s Articles of Association, copies of which
can be obtained from Companies House in the UK or by writing 
to the Company Secretary. There are no restrictions on the voting
rights attaching to the Company’s ordinary shares or on the
transfer of securities in the Company. No person holds securities
in the Company carrying special rights with regard to control 
of the Company. The Company is not aware of any agreements
between holders of securities that may result in restrictions on 
the transfer of securities or on voting rights. The Company’s
Articles of Association may be amended by a special resolution 
of the Company’s shareholders.
The Company now has a Level I American Depositary Receipt
(‘ADR’) programme in the USA for which the Bank of New York
Mellon acts as Depositary. The ADRs are traded on the US 
over-the-counter market, where each ADR represents one
Wolseley plc ordinary share. Further details are given on page 124.
During the year ended 31 July 2008, options were exercised
pursuant to the Company’s share option schemes, resulting in 
the allotment of 817,664 new ordinary shares. A further 3,700 
new ordinary shares have been allotted under these schemes
since the end of the financial year to the date of this report. 
Details of shares issued during the year are set out in note 30 
to the financial statements.
The Directors propose (Resolution 8 in the Notice of Meeting) 
to renew the authority granted to them at the Annual General
Meeting held in 2007 to allot equity shares up to an aggregate
nominal value of £34,503,353 (representing the authorised 
but unissued ordinary share capital of the Company at the date 
of this report) (the ‘section 80 authority’). If approved at the
forthcoming Annual General Meeting, the authority will expire 
no later than 15 months from the date on which the resolution 
is passed, or at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting 
to be held in 2009, whichever is the sooner.

Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Our business Performance review Governance Financial statements Other information 
The limited power granted to the Directors at last year’s Annual
General Meeting to allot equity shares for cash other than pro
rata to existing shareholders expires no later than 28 February
2009. Subject to the terms of the section 80 authority, the
Directors recommend (Resolution 9 in the Notice of Meeting) 
that this authority should be renewed so as to give them the
ability, until the Annual General Meeting to be held in 2009, to
issue ordinary shares for cash, other than pro rata to existing
shareholders, in connection with a rights issue or up to a limit of
5 per cent of the ordinary share capital issued at the date of this
report. The Directors currently have no intention to issue ordinary
shares, other than pursuant to the Company’s employee share
schemes and any share dividend alternatives. The Directors
recommend that you vote in favour of Resolutions 8 and 9 to
maintain the Company’s flexibility in relation to future share issues,
including any issues to finance business opportunities should
appropriate circumstances arise.
A Special Resolution will also be proposed (Resolution 10 in the
Notice of Meeting) to renew the Directors’ limited authority last
granted in 2007 to repurchase the Company’s ordinary shares 
in the market. The authority will be limited to a maximum of
66,198,659 ordinary shares (being 10 per cent of the Company’s
issued share capital at the date of this report) and also sets the
minimum and maximum prices which may be paid. This authority
will enable the Directors to continue to respond promptly should
circumstances arise in which they consider such a purchase
would result in an increase in earnings per share and would 
be in the best interests of the Company. 
The Companies (Acquisition of Own Shares) (Treasury Shares)
Regulations 2003 allow shares purchased by the Company 
to be held as treasury shares that may be cancelled, sold for 
cash or used for the purpose of employee share schemes. 
The Company holds no shares in treasury but the Directors
currently intend that any shares which are purchased will be held
in treasury. The authorities to be sought by each of Resolutions 9
and 10 are intended to apply equally to shares to be held by the
Company as treasury shares and to the sale of treasury shares.
The Directors consider it desirable for these general authorities 
to be available to provide flexibility in the management of the
Company’s capital resources.
CREST
The Company’s ordinary shares are in CREST, the settlement
system for stocks and shares.
Substantial share interests
At 31 July 2008 and, unless otherwise stated, at the date of this
report the Company had received notification of the following
material shareholdings pursuant to the Disclosure Rules and

*On 16 September 2008, Capital Group International, Inc. notified the

Directors
Brief particulars of the Directors in office at the date of this
report are listed on page 41. Further details of the Board
composition as well as the Company’s procedure with regard 
to the appointment and replacement of Directors are contained
in the Corporate governance report on page 45. The Directors
standing for re-election at the 2008 Annual General Meeting 
are Robert Marchbank, Stephen Webster and John Whybrow.
Each Director, being eligible, offers himself for re-election and
each, following a performance evaluation by the Non Executive
Directors during the year, continues to be considered by the
Board to be effective and to demonstrate commitment to his
respective role. 
Directors’ interests in shares 
The interests of the Directors in office at 31 July 2008, and 
of their families, in the ordinary shares of the Company at the
following dates were:
31 July 2008 1 August 2007
G Davis 10,664 10,664

N M Stein 10,500 6,500
S P Webster 60,784 55,535
J W Whybrow 85,284 70,284
There were no changes to the shareholdings of those Directors
in office at the date of this report.
Donations
The Group’s charitable donations in 2008 totalled £1,591,000
(2007: £2,019,500). 
At each of the Annual General Meetings held since 2002,
shareholders have passed a resolution, on a precautionary
basis, to approve donations to political organisations and 
to incur political expenditure (as such terms are defined in
section 347A of the Companies Act 1985 (as amended) and
sections 362 to 379 of the Companies Act 2006). The Board
has repeatedly confirmed that it operates a policy of not giving
any cash contribution to any political party in the ordinary
meaning of those words and that it has no intention of changing
that policy. The Directors propose to seek, once more, authority 
for the Group to make political donations and/or incur political
expenditure in respect of each of the heads identified in
Resolution 11 in the Notice of Meeting in amounts not exceeding
£125,000 in a total aggregate, which they might otherwise be
prohibited from making or incurring under the terms of the
Companies Act 2006 and which would not amount to
‘donations’ in the ordinary sense of the word. The authority
sought by Resolution 11 in the Notice of Meeting will last until
the Company’s next Annual General Meeting.

For the year ended 31 July 2008
44 Report of the Directors
Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Creditor payment policy
All Group companies are responsible for establishing terms and
conditions of trading with their suppliers. It is the Group’s policy
that payments to suppliers are made within agreed terms and
are, where applicable, consistent with the UK Government-
backed Better Payment Practice Code. Copies of this Code 
can be obtained from the Company Secretary at the Company’s
registered office. At 31 July 2008, the Company had no trade
creditors (2007: nil). The amount of trade creditors for the Group
as at 31 July 2008 was equivalent to 58 days (2007: 59 days) 
of trade purchases.
Auditors and audit information
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP are willing to continue as auditors 
of the Company and Resolution 6 in the Notice of Meeting
concerning their reappointment, and Resolution 7 concerning 
the determination of their remuneration, are to be proposed at 
the Annual General Meeting.
The Directors in office at the date of this report confirm that, so
far as they are each aware, in respect of the consolidated financial
statements for the financial year ended 31 July 2008, there is no
relevant audit information of which PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
are unaware and each Director has taken all the steps that ought
to have been taken as a Director to be aware, in respect of the
consolidated financial statements for the financial year ended 
31 July 2008, of any relevant audit information and to establish
that PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP are aware of that information.
Employee communication and involvement
The Group places particular importance on involving its
employees; keeping them regularly informed through informal
bulletins, such as its management magazine ‘Directions’ and 
other in-house publications, meetings and the Company’s
intranet, on matters affecting them as employees and on the
issues affecting their performance. A European Works Council
(‘EWC’) has been operating since 1996 to provide a forum for
informing and consulting Europe-based employees on such
matters as significant developments in the Group’s operations,
management’s plans and expectations, organisational changes
within the Group and also for employee representatives to 
consult Group management about concerns over any aspect 
of the Group’s operations. At the date of this report, there 
were 27 EWC representatives of which 21 were employee
representatives and six were management representatives.
Employee representatives are appointed from each European
country in which Wolseley operates, with more than one
employee representative appointed from the UK, France 
and Denmark. 
Permanent UK employees are invited to join the Company’s 
pension arrangements which include both defined contribution 
and defined benefit pension schemes. The principal UK scheme
has one corporate and two individual trustees. The chairman of
the trustees is David Tucker and, save for an independent trustee, 
all of the other trustees and trustee directors are UK-based
employees or former employees of the Group. The other main 
UK scheme provides benefits for employees of the William Wilson
Group, which has, with effect from July 2008, three member-
nominated trustees and three Company-nominated trustees. 
The chairman of the trustees is Ian Percy CBE and all of the other
trustees are UK-based employees of the William Wilson Group or
of the Company. Permanent employees outside the UK are offered
membership of their employing companies’ pension arrangements.
Employees are offered a range of benefits depending on their local
environment and are encouraged to become shareholders in the
Company, where possible, through participation in the Company’s
share schemes. 
Employment policies
The Group remains committed to equality of opportunity in all 
of its employment practices. It is Group policy that the selection 
of employees for training, development and promotion should be
determined solely on their skills, attributes and other requirements
which are relevant to the job and which are in accordance with 
the laws of the country concerned. Priority is given to the training
of employees and the development of their skills is of prime
importance. Employment of disabled people is considered on
merit with regard only to the ability of any applicant to carry out
the function required. Arrangements to enable disabled people 
to carry out the function required will be made if it is reasonable 
to do so. An employee becoming disabled would, where
appropriate, be offered retraining. The Group continues to operate
on a largely decentralised basis; this provides encouragement for
the development of entrepreneurial flair, balanced by a rigorous 
control framework exercised by a small head office team. Local
management is responsible for maintaining high standards 
of health and safety and for ensuring that there is appropriate
employee involvement in decision making.

Our business Performance review Governance Financial statements Other information 
Compliance with the Combined Code
The Board is committed to the highest standards of corporate
governance and recognises that it is accountable to the
Company’s shareholders for good governance. The principal
governance rules applying to UK companies listed on the 
London Stock Exchange are contained in the Combined Code 
on Corporate Governance (the ‘Code’), adopted by the Financial
Reporting Council (www.frc.org.uk/corporate) and published in
June 2006. The Code was most recently revised in June 2008
(‘Revised Code’) and the Company is already in a position to
comply with this Revised Code. This report, together with the
Report of the Directors and the Remuneration report, describes 
how the Board applied the principles of good governance, 
as contained in section 1 of the Code, and seeks to demonstrate
how the principles of good governance have been applied, and
continue to be applied, during the year under review. 
The Board
The Board meets regularly during the year, as well as on an 
ad hoc basis as required by time critical business needs. The
Board’s primary role is to provide entrepreneurial leadership,
necessary to enable the Group’s business objectives to be met,
and to review the overall strategic development of the Group as 
a whole. It has a formal schedule of matters reserved to it for its
decision. Day-to-day operational decisions are managed by the
Executive Committee, as referred to on page 46. 
Board composition
As at 31 July 2008, the Board of Directors was made up of nine
members consisting of the Chairman, four Executive Directors and
four Non Executive Directors. The Chairman and the Non Executive
Directors are each considered by the Board to be independent of
management and free of any relationship which could materially
interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement. The
Board considers that each of the Non Executive Directors brings
his own senior level of experience and expertise. Biographical
details of the Directors currently in office are shown on page 41.
The Company’s policy relating to the terms of appointment and
the remuneration of both the Executive and Non Executive
Directors is detailed in the Remuneration report on pages 51 and
52. The distinct roles of Chairman and Group Chief Executive are
acknowledged and set out in writing. The Chairman has confirmed
that he would not chair any other major company’s board of
directors. Gareth Davis is the Company’s Senior Independent
Director and is available to shareholders where communication
through the Chairman or the Executive Directors would not be
appropriate. Robert Walker stepped down from the Board as a
Non Executive Director on 31 October 2007. The Nominations
Committee, and the Board as a whole, considers succession
planning and the appropriate composition of the Board. 
The Company’s Articles of Association provide that one third of
the Directors retire by rotation each year and that each Director
will seek re-election by the shareholders at the Annual General
Meeting at least once every three years. Additionally, new
Directors are subject to election by shareholders at the first
opportunity after their appointment. It is Board policy that 
Non Executive Directors are normally appointed for an initial 
term of three years, which is then reviewed and extended for 
up to a further two three-year periods. It is also Board policy that 
Non Executive Directors should not generally serve on the Board
for more than nine years and that, in cases where it is proposed 
to exceed this period, the Director concerned will retire annually 
and offer himself for re-election. Details of the Directors seeking
re-election at the 2008 Annual General Meeting are given in the
Notice of Meeting. 
Board procedures and responsibilities 
A 12-month rolling programme of items for discussion by the
Board is prepared to ensure that all matters reserved and other
key issues are considered at appropriate times. The Board 
met 10 times during the year and Director attendance for 
each meeting is shown in the table on page 48. Together with 
the Group Chief Executive and the Company Secretary, the
Chairman ensures that the Board is kept properly informed 
and is consulted on all matters reserved to it. Board papers 
and other information are delivered at times to allow Directors 
to be properly briefed in advance of meetings. 
The Board has established a procedure for Directors, if deemed
necessary, to take independent professional advice at the
Company’s expense in the furtherance of their duties. This is 
in addition to the direct access that every Director has to the
Company Secretary, who is charged with ensuring that Board
procedures are followed and that good corporate governance
and compliance is implemented throughout the Group. 
Following their appointment, formal comprehensive and tailored
induction is offered to all Directors. This is supplemented by
meetings, as required, with major shareholders, visits to key
locations within the Group and meetings with members of the
Executive Committee and other key senior executives. Meetings
between the Non Executive Directors, both with and without 
the presence of the Chairman and the Group Chief Executive,
are scheduled in the Board’s annual timetable. The Board 
has also arranged to hold at least two Board meetings each
year at divisional locations to help all Board members gain a
deeper understanding of the business, whilst also providing
senior managers from across the Group the opportunity to
present to the Board as well as to meet the Directors on more
informal occasions. 
During the year the Non Executive Directors reviewed the
performance of both the Chairman and the Group Chief
Executive and, together with the Chairman and the Group Chief
Executive, reviewed the performance of each of the Executive
Directors. A full evaluation of the Board’s performance will be
carried out during 2008. The Chairman has confirmed that
should any Director have any concerns or observations which
they wished to raise, these should be notified to him directly or
to the Company Secretary, to be addressed appropriately. The
Chairman has further confirmed there were no items which had
been brought to his attention during the year.
As part of their ongoing development, the Executive Directors
are encouraged to take up an external non-executive position
on the board of a non-competitor company, for which they 
may retain payments received in respect of such appointment.
In order to avoid any conflict of interest, all appointments 
are subject to the Board’s approval and, generally, outside
appointments for Executive Directors are limited to one
company board. The Board monitors the extent of Directors’
other interests to ensure that the effectiveness of the Board 
is not compromised. Details of external directorships and the
fees retained are shown on page 58.

Indemnities
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association, the
Company has always indemnified its Directors to the maximum
extent permitted by law in respect of liabilities incurred as a result
of their office. Qualifying third-party indemnity provisions (as
defined in section 234 of the Companies Act 2006) have been
granted to the Directors and the Company Secretary and these
remain in force as at the date of this report. The Company has
also arranged appropriate insurance coverage in respect of legal
action against its Directors and Officers. Neither the Company’s
indemnity nor insurance would provide any coverage to the
extent that a Director is proved to have acted fraudulently 
or dishonestly. 
Board committees
The formal terms of reference for the Board committees, 
approved by the Board and complying with the Code to assist 
in the discharge of its duties, are available from the Company
Secretary and can also be found on the Company’s website 
at www.wolseley.com. Membership of the various committees 
is shown below. The Group Company Secretary acts as secretary
to all Board committees. 
Nominations Committee 
The Nominations Committee meets as required and met once
during the year ending 31 July 2008. The committee consists 
of Messrs Davis, Duff, Murray, Stein and Whybrow, who chairs 
the committee. Mr Walker left the committee on 31 October 
2007. Mr Whybrow would not chair the committee or attend if 
it were to consider the appointment of a successor Chairman. 
The committee reviews the structure, size and composition of 
the Board and its committees and makes recommendations 
with regard to any changes that are considered necessary, both 
in the identification and nomination of new Directors and the
continuation of existing Directors in office. The committee retains
external search consultants as appropriate. The committee 
also advises the Board on succession planning for Board
appointments although the Board itself has overall responsibility
for succession generally. During the year, the committee reviewed
and updated its terms of reference.
Remuneration Committee 
The committee consists of Messrs Davis, Stein, Whybrow and
Duff, who chairs the committee, all of whom are considered
independent within the definition set out in the Code. Messrs
Stein and Whybrow were appointed to the committee with effect
from 31 October 2007, following the departure of Mr Walker from
the Board. The committee met four times during the year and
Director attendance for each meeting is shown in the table on
page 48. The committee has delegated authority to deal 
with remuneration matters, including pension rights and any
compensation payments on behalf of the Board. It is responsible
for setting the remuneration of the Executive Directors and the
Group Company Secretary in accordance with the remuneration
policy approved by the Board. It is also responsible for
determining the fees of the Chairman and for monitoring and
approving the remuneration policy in relation to senior managers
below Board level. The committee prepares, for the Board’s
approval, the Remuneration report, which is presented to
shareholders at each Annual General Meeting. 
During the year, the committee reviewed and updated its terms 
of reference. The chairman of the committee attends the Annual
General Meeting to respond to any questions shareholders may
raise on the committee’s activities. 
Executive Committee 
The Executive Directors of the Company together with the 
Group Chief Information Officer, the Director of Financial Reporting
and Strategic Planning, the Group HR Director and the Group
Company Secretary and General Counsel, meet at least eight
times each year, usually prior to Board meetings. The committee
addresses operational business issues and is responsible for
implementing strategy and Group policies, day-to-day management
and monitoring business performance. 
Treasury Committee 
The committee consists of the Group Chief Executive, the 
Chief Financial Officer, who chairs the committee, and the Group
Treasurer. The committee’s role is to consider treasury policy,
including financial structures and investments; tax strategy and
hedging policies and certain transactions on behalf of the Group,
within a framework delegated by the Board. 
Disclosure Committee 
The committee consists of the Chairman, the Group Chief
Executive, the Chief Financial Officer, who chairs the committee, 
the Director of Communications and the Group Company Secretary
and General Counsel. The committee meets as required to deal
with all matters relating to public announcements of the Company
and the Company’s obligations under the Listing and Disclosure
Rules of the UK Listing Authority. The committee also assists in the
design, implementation and periodic evaluation of the Company’s
disclosure controls and procedures.
Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee has wide-ranging oversight responsibilities
assigned to it by the Board. It reports regularly to the Board on
compliance in relation to the business activities for which it has
responsibility within its terms of reference. 
The committee consists of Messrs Davis, Stein and Murray, 
who chairs the committee, all of whom are independent Non
Executive Directors. The committee’s membership is reviewed 
by the Nominations Committee and by Mr Murray at regular
intervals. Members of the committee are appointed by the Board
following recommendations by the Nominations Committee. 
Each member of the committee brings relevant financial experience
at a senior executive level; the expertise and experience of 
the members of the committee are summarised on page 41. 
The Board considers that each member of the committee is
independent within the definition set out in the Code. Mr Stein is
considered by the Board to have significant, recent and relevant
financial experience, having been, until September 2007, Finance
Director of GKN plc.

Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Our business Performance review Governance Financial statements Other information 
All members of the committee receive appropriate induction,
which is in addition to the induction which all new Directors
receive and includes an overview of the business, its financial
dynamics and risks. Members of the committee undertake
ongoing training as required. Audit Committee members are
expected to have an understanding of the following areas:
• the principles of, contents of and developments in, financial
reporting, including the applicable accounting standards and
statements of recommended practice and, in particular, the
appropriateness of the Company’s accounting policies and
integrity of the financial statements; 
• the Company’s wider corporate policies and its financing; and 
• the Company’s systems of internal control and matters that
require the use of judgement in the presentation of accounts
and key figures as well as the role of internal and external
auditors.
The committee meets regularly throughout the year and its
agenda is linked to events in the Company’s financial calendar.
The agenda is mostly cyclical although each member of the
committee may require reports on matters of interest in addition 
to the regular items. Members’ attendance at the meetings held
during the year is set out in the table on page 48. 
The committee invites the Chairman, the Group Chief Executive,
the Chief Financial Officer, the Director of Financial Reporting 
and Strategic Planning and the Head of Internal Audit, together
with senior representatives of the Company’s external auditors, 
to attend each meeting and receive its papers, although it reserves
part of each meeting for discussions without the invitees being
present. Other senior executives are invited to present such
reports as are required for the committee to discharge its duties.
The Audit Committee members regularly meet the Head of
Internal Audit and the external auditors without the presence of
executive management. The Chairman of the Audit Committee
attends the Annual General Meeting to respond to any shareholder
questions that might be raised on the committee’s activities. 
The committee assists the Board to fulfil its responsibilities related
to external financial reporting and associated announcements.
During the year, the matters reviewed, either as a committee or 
as part of the Board, included:
• the interim and annual financial statements, including the
requirements for financial reporting; 
• the interim and preliminary announcements made to the 
London Stock Exchange; 
• the Company’s trading and interim management statements
and, where practicable, all proposed announcements to be
made by the Company to the extent that they contained
material financial information; 
• changes proposed to the Company’s policies and practices; 
• the documentation in relation to the Company’s delisting from
the New York Stock Exchange and deregistration from the 
US Securities and Exchange Commission;
• significant accounting and auditing issues; 
• the operation of the Company’s whistle-blowing policy; 
• litigation and contingent liabilities and tax matters, including
contingencies against tax liabilities together with compliance
with statutory tax obligations; 
• fraud reports; and 
• the Company’s risk management process. 
The committee is also responsible for the development,
implementation and monitoring of the Company’s policy 
on external audit and the committee reserves oversight
responsibility for monitoring independence, objectivity and
compliance with ethical and regulatory requirements. 
The committee recommends the appointment and reappointment
of the Company’s external auditors and annually reviews a
formal letter provided by the external auditors confirming their
independence and objectivity within the context of applicable
regulatory requirements and professional standards. 
The committee monitors the rotation of key partners within 
the external auditors from time to time in accordance with 
UK regulations. The committee also monitors the extent of 
non-audit work which the external auditors can perform for 
the Company, to ensure that the provision of those non-audit
services that can be undertaken by the external auditors falls
within the agreed policy and does not impair their objectivity
or independence. Under the policy, the external auditors cannot
be engaged to perform any of the following services:
• book-keeping services related to accounting records or
financial statements; 
• financial information systems’ design and implementation; 
• appraisal or valuation services, fairness opinions and
contributions in kind reports; 
• actuarial services; 
• internal audit outsourcing services; 
• management functions including human resources; 
• broker or dealer, investment adviser or investment banking
services; or 
• legal and other services unrelated to the audit. 
The policy requires pre-approval by the committee of any non-
audit work subject to maximum budget levels. The external
auditors provide audit-related services such as regulatory and
statutory reporting as well as formalities relating to shareholder
or other circulars. The external auditors report to the committee
any material departures from Group accounting policies and
procedures that they identify during the course of their audit
work. Within the constraints of applicable UK Ethical Standards,
the external auditors undertake due diligence reviews and
provide assistance on tax matters given their in-depth knowledge
of the Group’s business. The provision of non-audit services
within such constraints and the agreed policy is assessed on a
case-by-case basis so that the best-placed adviser is retained. 
During the year, the committee reviewed the effectiveness of 
the external auditors, which included receiving responses from
each of the Group’s operating companies and considered
whether the agreed audit plan had been fulfilled and the reasons
for any variation from the plan. The committee also considered
the external auditors’ robustness and the degree to which the
external auditors were able to assess key accounting and audit
judgements and the context of the management letter. In
accordance with its remit, the committee reviewed and approved
the terms, areas of responsibility and scope of the audit (including
schedules of unadjusted errors and representation letters) as set
out in the external auditors’ engagement letter; the overall work
plan for the forthcoming year, together with the cost-effectiveness
of the audit as well as the auditors’ remuneration and performance;
any issues which arose during the course of the audit and 
their resolution; key accounting and audit judgements; errors
identified during the audit; and the recommendations made to
management by the auditors and management’s response.

The total fees paid to PricewaterhouseCoopers in the year ended
31 July 2008 were £9.2 million (2007: £10.5 million), of which 
£5.0 million (2007: £4.2 million) related to non-audit work. Further
disclosure of the non-audit fees paid during the year ended 
31 July 2008 can be found in note 3 to the financial statements
on page 74.
The committee also reviews the effectiveness of the Group’s
internal audit function, including its terms of reference, audit 
plans, general performance and its relationship with the external
auditors. Throughout the year, the committee reviewed the
internal audit function’s plans and its achievements against 
such plans. The committee considered the results of the audits
undertaken by the internal audit function and considered the
adequacy of management’s response to matters raised, including
the time taken to resolve any such matters. The committee
carried out its annual review to consider the effectiveness of the
internal audit function using guidance issued by the Institute of
Chartered Accountants in England & Wales and the Institute 
of Internal Auditors – UK. 
The committee monitors and reviews the effectiveness of 
the Group’s internal control systems, accounting policies and
practices, standards of risk management and risk management
procedures and compliance controls as well as the Company’s
statements on internal controls before they are agreed by the
Board for each year’s annual report. The Board retains overall
responsibility for internal control and for the identification and
management of business risk. 
The Company’s whistle-blowing policy, which is an extension of 
the Group-wide Code of Ethics, gives details of the international
whistle-blowing hotlines which are operated on behalf of the
Company by an independent third party. The hotlines facilitate 
the arrangements whereby employees can make confidential
disclosures on accounting, risk issues, internal controls, auditing
issues and related matters. Any matters reported are duly
investigated and are escalated to the committee, as appropriate.
Statistics on the volume and general nature of all disclosures
made are reported to the committee on an annual basis. A copy
of the Group’s Code of Ethics is available on the Company’s
website at www.wolseley.com. 
Each year the committee critically reviews its own performance 
and considers where improvements can be made. The
committee’s terms of reference were reviewed and updated 
during the year.

This table only shows those meetings which each Director 
attended as a member rather than as an invitee.
Internal audit 
The internal audit function is fully independent of the day-to-day
operations of the Group. It is involved in the assessment of the
quality of risk management and internal control and helps to
promote and further develop effective risk management within 
the businesses. Certain internal audit assignments (such as those
requiring specialist expertise) continue to be outsourced by the 
Head of Internal Audit to KPMG LLP as required. A policy has been
established regarding the recruitment of staff from both KPMG LLP
and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. The Head of Internal Audit
attends all Audit Committee meetings in addition to having 
regular meetings with the chairman of that committee. The Audit
Committee reviews key performance indicators relating to the activity 
of the department. 
Internal control 
In a decentralised Group, where local management has 
considerable autonomy to run and develop their businesses, 
a well designed system of internal control is necessary to safeguard
shareholders’ investment and the Company’s assets. The Directors
have overall responsibility for the Group’s systems of internal 
control and for reviewing their effectiveness. In accordance with the
guidance set out in the Turnbull Report ‘Internal Control: Guidance
for Directors on the Combined Code’, an ongoing process has 
been established for identifying, managing and evaluating the risks
faced by the Group and has been in place for the full financial year
and up to the date on which the financial statements were approved.
These systems are designed to manage rather than eliminate
business risk; safeguard the Group’s assets against material loss;
fairly report the Group’s performance and position; and to ensure
compliance with relevant legislation, regulation and best practice,
including that related to social, environmental and ethical matters.
The systems provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance against
material misstatement or loss and are reviewed by the Board 
regularly to deal with changing circumstances.

Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Our business Performance review Governance Financial statements Other information 
Summaries of the key financial risks inherent in the Group’s
business are given in the Performance review on pages 23 to 
26 and in note 26 on pages 89 to 92. Risk assessment and
evaluation is an integral part of the Group’s annual planning 
cycle. Each business documents the strategic objectives and 
the effectiveness of the Group’s systems of internal control and, 
as part of this review, each business area and function has been
required to identify and document each significant risk, together
with the mitigating actions implemented to manage, monitor and
report to management on the effectiveness of actions taken.
Group operating companies also submit risk management and
internal control representation letters biannually to the Chief
Financial Officer, with comments on the control environment 
within their operations. The Chief Financial Officer summarises
these submissions for the Audit Committee and the Executive
Committee. The chairman of the Audit Committee reports to the
Board on any matters which have arisen from the committee’s
review of the way in which the risk management and internal
control processes have been applied, or any breakdowns in, 
or exceptions to, these procedures. These processes have been 
in place throughout the year ended 31 July 2008 and have
continued to the date of this report. The Board has reviewed the
effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal control for the year
under review and a summary of the principal control structures
and processes in place across the Group is set out below.
Control structures
Whilst the Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system
of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness, it has
delegated responsibility for the risk management and internal
control programme to the Chief Financial Officer. The detailed
review of risk management and internal control has been
delegated to the Audit Committee. The management of each
Group company is responsible for risk management and internal
control within its own business and for ensuring compliance with
the Group’s policies and procedures. Each Group company has
appointed a risk director whose primary role in such capacity is 
to ensure compliance by local management with the Group’s risk
management and internal control programme. Both the internal
and external auditors have reviewed the overall approach
adopted by the Group towards its risk management activities 
so as to reinforce these internal control requirements. 
Control processes 
The Board reviews its strategic plans and objectives on an 
annual basis and approves Group company budgets and
strategies in light of these. Control is exercised at Group,
continental, cluster and subsidiary board level through monthly
monitoring of performance by comparison to budgets, forecasts
and cash targets and by regular visits to Group companies by 
the Group Chief Executive, Chief Financial Officer and continental
CEOs. The Board has formal procedures in place for the approval
of investment, acquisition and disposal projects, with designated
levels of authority, supported by post-investment review processes
for major acquisitions or disposals and capital expenditure. 
The Board takes account of social, environmental and ethical
matters in relation to the Group’s businesses when reviewing 
the risks faced by the Group. The Board is conscious of the
effect such matters may have on the short- and long-term value
of the Company. 
Delisting from the New York Stock
Exchange and deregistration from the
Securities and Exchange Commission
As noted in the Report of the Directors on page 42, the
Company delisted from the New York Stock Exchange and
deregistered from the US Securities and Exchange Commission
(‘SEC’) on 2 January 2008. As a result, the Company now has 
a Level I American Depositary Receipt programme with the
Bank of New York Mellon. 
Prior to deregistration from the SEC, the Group Chief Executive
and the Chief Financial Officer, in accordance with Section 404
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002, provided certifications that
there were no changes to the Company’s internal control 
over financial reporting which materially affected, or would 
be reasonably likely to materially affect, the internal control
procedures of the Company. The Company was also
responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate
system of internal controls over financial reporting for the 
Group and used the framework developed by the Committee 
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 
(the ‘COSO framework’) which has been adopted as industry
best practice for defining internal control structures to evaluate
the effectiveness of that system. Following deregistration, 
the Company is no longer required to comply with the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act as a foreign private issuer. However, 
the Directors recognise the benefits of the established system 
of internal controls over financial reporting and have therefore
retained the key elements of those controls, including the 
COSO framework, under what is known as an ‘Advanced
Control Environment’ programme.
Compliance statement 
The Company applied all of the principles set out in section 1 
of the Code for the period under review and has, throughout 
the year, complied with the detailed provisions set out therein. 
The Company’s auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, are
required to review whether the above statement reflects the
Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the Code
specified for their review by the Listing Rules of the UK Listing
Authority and to report if it does not reflect such compliance. 
No such report has been made. 
Communications with shareholders
The Company places considerable importance on communication
with its shareholders, including its employee shareholders. The
Group Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer are closely
involved in investor relations and a senior executive has day-to-day
responsibility for such matters. The views of our major shareholders
are reported to the Board by the Chief Financial Officer and by
the Chairman and are discussed at its meetings. The Annual
Report and Accounts are available to all shareholders either 
in paper form or electronically and can be accessed via the
Company’s website at www.wolseley.com or via Shareview, 
an internet service offered by the Company’s Registrars, as
detailed in Shareholder information on page 124.

The Company has regular dialogue with institutional shareholders
and meetings with shareholder representatives and promotes
communications with private shareholders through attendance 
at the Annual General Meeting. Contact with institutional
shareholders and with financial analysts, brokers and the media 
is controlled by written guidelines to ensure the protection of
sensitive information which could affect the Company’s share 
price and which has not already been made generally available
to the Company’s shareholders. Contact is also maintained, when
appropriate, with shareholders to discuss overall remuneration
plans and policies. The Chairman also ensures that the Board
maintains an appropriate dialogue with shareholders and,
although the Non Executive Directors are not formally asked, 
at present, to meet the Company’s shareholders, their attendance
at presentations of the preliminary and interim results is
encouraged. The Group’s preliminary and interim results, as well
as all announcements issued to the London Stock Exchange, are
published on the Company’s website, www.wolseley.com. The
Company issues regular trading updates to the market and these,
together with copies of presentations to analysts and interviews
with the Group Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer, are 
also posted on the Company’s website. The Notice of the Annual
General Meeting is circulated to all shareholders at least 20
working days before such meeting and it is Company policy 
not to combine resolutions to be proposed at general meetings.
All shareholders are invited to the Company’s Annual General
Meeting at which they have the opportunity to put questions 
to the Board and it is standard practice to have the Senior
Independent Director and the chairmen of the Audit, Nominations
and Remuneration Committees available to answer questions. 
The proxy votes for and against each resolution, as well as
abstentions which may be recorded on the proxy form
accompanying the Notice of Meeting, are counted before the
Annual General Meeting and the results are made available at 
the meeting after shareholders have voted on each resolution 
on a show of hands. The results are also announced to the
London Stock Exchange and are published on the Company’s
website shortly after the meeting. 
Annual General Meeting resolutions 
The resolutions to be proposed at the Annual General Meeting 
to be held on 18 November 2008, together with explanatory
notes, appear in the Notice of Annual General Meeting which has
been posted to each shareholder. This document is also available
on the Company’s website at www.wolseley.com.

Directors’ responsibility statement 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, 
the Remuneration report and the financial statements in accordance
with applicable law and regulations. UK company law requires 
the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year.
Under that law the Directors have prepared the Group financial
statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards (‘IFRSs’), as adopted by the European Union, and the
parent Company financial statements and the Remuneration report
in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting
Standards (UK GAAP). The Group and parent Company financial
statements are required by law to give a true and fair view of the
state of affairs of the Company and the Group and of the profit 
or loss of the Group for that period.
In preparing the financial statements the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them
consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state that the Group financial statements comply with IFRSs, 
as adopted by the European Union, and with regard to the
parent company financial statements that applicable UK
Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any
material departures disclosed and explained in the financial
statements; and
• prepare the Group and parent Company financial statements 
on the going concern basis. 
The Directors confirm that they have complied with the above
requirements in preparing the financial statements. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting
records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the
financial position of the Company and the Group and to enable
them to ensure that the Group financial statements comply with

Introduction
This report, approved by the Board, has been prepared in
accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 1985
(the ‘Act’), as amended by the Directors’ Remuneration Report
Regulations 2002, and the Listing Rules of the Financial Services
Authority. Furthermore, the Board has applied the principles of
good governance relating to Directors’ Remuneration contained
within the Combined Code.
The Act requires the auditors to report to the Company’s
shareholders on the audited information within this report and 
to state whether, in their opinion, those parts of the report have
been prepared in accordance with the Act. The auditors’ opinion
is set out on page 107 and those aspects of the report which
have been subject to audit are clearly marked.
Remuneration Committee
The Board sets the Company’s remuneration policy. The
Remuneration Committee makes recommendations to the Board,
within its agreed terms of reference (available on the Company’s
website, www.wolseley.com) on the Company’s framework of
executive remuneration and its cost, which takes into account 
all factors which it deems necessary. It also determines, with
agreement of the Board, specific remuneration packages for each
of the Executive Directors, the Chairman, the Company Secretary
and members of the Executive Committee. The Chairman and 
the Executive Directors of the Board determine the remuneration
of the Non Executive Directors. The committee is also responsible
for the Company’s share incentive schemes for employees. 
The current members of the committee, as detailed on page 46,
consist of three Non Executive Directors and the Chairman 
(as permitted by the Code), all of whom are independent within
the definition set out in the Code, and the Company Secretary
acts as its secretary. The Group Chief Executive and the Group
HR Director are normally invited to attend the meetings of the
committee to respond to specific questions raised by members 
of the committee. This specifically excludes such matters
concerning the details of and any discussions relating to their 
own remuneration. The committee has access to detailed 
external research on market data and trends from experienced
independent consultants. Since 2003, the committee has sought
external advice from Hewitt New Bridge Street (formerly known 
as New Bridge Street Consultants LLP). Hewitt New Bridge 
Street provides no other services to the Company.
The committee met four times during the year, at which all
committee members were in attendance. At these meetings,
amongst other items, the committee considered:
• determination of bonus performance criteria and a review 
of performance prior to payment;
• operation and award levels under the long term incentive 
plan and executive share option scheme;
• awards in relation to all employee share plans; and
• consideration and review of remuneration policy, for both
Executive Directors and Executive Committee members.
The Remuneration report has been received and adopted by
shareholders at each of the Annual General Meetings held 
since 2003 and shareholders will again be invited to receive 
and adopt this report at the Annual General Meeting to be held
on 18 November 2008. 
Policy on Directors’ remuneration
Non Executive Directors
The remuneration of Non Executive Directors is made up of a
basic fee and an additional fee where a Non Executive Director
acts as chairman of either the Audit or Remuneration Committees
and for the Director nominated as Senior Independent Director.
Fees are reviewed from time to time by the Chairman and the
Executive Directors of the Board. The Non Executive Directors
have letters of engagement rather than service contracts and 
do not participate in any incentive plan, nor is any pension
payable in respect of their services as Non Executive Directors.
The Board’s policy is that Non Executive Directors are normally
appointed for an initial term of three years, which is then reviewed
and extended for a further three-year period. Appointments may
be terminated upon six months’ notice. There are no provisions
for compensation in the event of termination. The terms and
conditions of appointment of the Non Executive Directors are
available for inspection at the Company’s registered office during
normal business hours and at the Annual General Meeting. 
Executive Directors
The Company’s policy continues to be to provide remuneration
packages that fairly reward Executive Directors for the
contribution they make to the business, having regard to the
size and complexity of the Group’s operations and the need 
to attract, retain and motivate executives of the highest quality.
Remuneration packages comprise salary, performance bonuses,
share options, long-term incentive awards, benefits in kind and
retirement benefit provisions. The Company takes fully into
account all of these individual elements in adopting a total
approach to remuneration. The Company’s policy is that 
each of the packages should incorporate components linking
individual and company performance, short- and long-term
returns as well as absolute and relative financial performance.
None of the variable elements of remuneration are pensionable.
These packages are designed to be broadly comparable with
those offered by other similar international businesses and
reflect competitive practices in the countries and markets 
in which the Executive Directors operate.
The committee believes that the choice of performance measures
for the incentive plans continues to be suitable and provides 
an appropriate mix and balance. The measures are earnings per
share (‘EPS’) for executive options and total shareholder return
(‘TSR’) for long term incentive awards. The targets are felt to 
be demanding for the next three years and align executives’
interests with those of shareholders over this period.

For the year ended 31 July 2008
52 Remuneration report
Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008
The policy is designed to incentivise the Executive Directors to meet
the Company’s financial and strategic objectives, such that a
significant proportion of total remuneration is performance related.
The committee considers that the targets set for the different
elements of performance related remuneration are appropriate and
demanding in the context of the Company’s trading environment
and the business challenges it faces. The following chart shows
the average of total remuneration attributable to salary, target
bonus and the estimated value of long-term incentive awards 
and executive share options granted during the financial year 
to Executive Directors in office at the date of this report:
Service agreements
The Executive Directors have service agreements with Wolseley
plc, which are subject to a maximum of 12 months’ notice of
termination if given by the Company and six months’ notice 
of termination if given by the Executive Director. Such notice
periods reflect current market practice and the balance that
should be struck between providing contractual protection 
to the Directors that is fair and the interests of shareholders. 
The date of each service agreement and the year in which each
Executive Director was last re-elected are noted in the table
below. There are no provisions in any service agreement for early
termination payments and, in the event of early termination of 
any service agreement, the committee will give full and proper
consideration to mitigation, which should be taken into account
when computing any compensation payable.
Year of
Name of Director Date of service agreement re-election

R H Marchbank 18 March 2005 2005
F W Roach 27 February 2006 2006
S P Webster 25 September 2002 2005
The Non Executive Directors do not have service agreements;
their terms of service are contained in their respective letters 
of engagement.
Salaries
Basic salaries are determined having regard to individual
responsibility and performance and are benchmarked with 
market data which is derived from a group of companies 
selected on the basis of comparable size, geographic spread 
and business focus. Consideration is also given to general pay
and employment conditions across the Group. The target salary 
is set at the median, with the opportunity to go above this level,
subject to sustained individual performance. New appointments,
and in particular internal promotions, will tend to move to 
the median over two to three years once their expertise and
performance has been proven. The payment of salaries at this 
level is considered appropriate for the motivation and retention 
of the calibre of executive required to ensure the successful
management of the Company in the challenging international
business environment in which it operates. The committee 
reviews the fees of the Chairman and the salaries of the Executive
Directors annually on 1 August, having sought the views of both 
the Chairman and the Group Chief Executive (other than in the 
case of their own remuneration). In recognition of the financial
circumstances currently being faced by the Company, an increase 
of 3 per cent was awarded to each member of the Board and 
the Executive Committee for the financial year commencing 
1 August 2008. The fees payable to the Chairman and base 
salaries in respect of the Executive Directors for the financial year
commencing on 1 August 2008 are as follows: J W Whybrow
£360,500; C A S Hornsby US$1,493,500; R H Marchbank 
US$964,100; F W Roach US$957,900; and S P Webster £556,200. 
Benefits in kind
These principally consist of car benefits, healthcare insurance 
and, in the case of Messrs Hornsby and Marchbank, relocation 
and housing allowances following their relocation from the USA 
to the UK. In addition, to ensure that senior executives who 
are US citizens are not disadvantaged as a result of paying both 
UK and US taxes on their income, there is a mechanism of tax
equalisation, which avoids the need to increase salaries to meet 
any additional tax burden. 
Performance bonuses
Performance bonus arrangements for the Executive Directors 
are designed to encourage individual performance, corporate
operating efficiencies and profitable growth. Stretching targets are
set for each element of the bonus, determined by the committee
each year, which also considers the levels of performance targets 
to be achieved for bonus payments to be made in the succeeding
year. The annual bonus awards are based on a mix of demanding
financial targets, derived from the Company’s historic performance,
annual long-term strategic business plan and annual budget, 
as well as market expectations. For 2007/08, performance 
was measured by trading margin, cash flow and growth in EPS,
reflecting key performance indicators in line with the Group’s 
‘Earn, Turn, Grow’ initiative. These elements accounted for 
80 per cent of the potential bonus with the balance depending 
on specific personal objectives set for each Executive Director.
The following percentages of base salary, which vary between
Executive Directors depending on their particular responsibilities, 
will be paid as bonus for the year ended 31 July 2008, subject to
the achievement of the minimum, on-target and maximum levels 
of performance for each element (with the percentages increasing 
on a linear basis for achievement between each level):

Other senior executives 
The non-Board members of the Executive Committee are 
senior executives whose roles significantly influence the ability 
of the Group to meet its strategic objectives. The committee
determines the level of remuneration for this group, based on
proposals from the Group Chief Executive. Their total remuneration
including salary and benefits, actual bonus and the fair value 
of long-term incentives granted/awarded during the year ended
31 July 2008 is summarised below:

Long-term incentives (audited)
The Company currently operates a long-term incentive plan
under the Wolseley plc 2002 Long Term Incentive Scheme
(‘2002 Scheme’), which was approved by shareholders in
December 2002 and amended at the 2004 Annual General
Meeting. The 2002 Scheme (as amended) provides for awards
of ordinary shares in the capital of the Company, subject to the
Company meeting TSR targets over single three-year periods.
All awards are made subject to the achievement of stretching
performance conditions and TSR has been selected as the
appropriate performance measure to align more closely the
interests of the Executive Directors and senior executives with
those of shareholders over the long term. The 2002 Scheme
rewards the relative outperformance of the Company against 
a defined list of comparator companies. Calculations of TSR 
are independently carried out and verified before being
approved by the committee.
The lists of comparator companies for awards made under the
2002 Scheme are based upon the constituent members of the
FTSE 100 as at the respective dates of grant, excluding banks,
telecommunications, IT and utility companies but together with
CRH plc and Travis Perkins plc, which compete in the same
sector as the Company. A similar group of companies will be
selected for the 2008 awards under the 2002 Scheme.
The 2002 Scheme is discretionary. The committee’s current
policy is to make annual awards to the Group Chief Executive,
Executive Directors and other senior executives. Awards are
made in shares, save where there are material securities or tax
law constraints in overseas jurisdictions where the scheme
would be operated, in which case conditional awards in cash
would be considered.

and all awards lapsed.
3 The performance periods range from 1 August 2006 to 31July 2010.
The maximum amount that can be granted under the amended
2002 Scheme for each award is 200 per cent of base salary 
per annum; however, awards made to date have not exceeded 
125 per cent, or 150 per cent in the case of the Group Chief
Executive, of base salary. Each year the committee assesses 
the proportion of awards that should be made up of both share
options and long-term incentive awards.
The vesting levels for Long Term Incentive Scheme (‘LTIS’) awards 
are shown in the following graph:
Extant awards remain subject to the achievement of performance
conditions following a participant’s agreed retirement and vesting 
is determined at the end of the performance period.
The following table sets out the percentage of each award which

Executive share options (audited)
The Wolseley Share Option Plan 2003 (‘2003 Plan’) received
shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting held in
November 2003. Consequently, no further options will be 
granted under the Executive Share Option Scheme 1984 
(‘1984 Scheme’) nor under the Executive Share Option Scheme
1989 (‘1989 Scheme’) which are now closed. No options under
any such scheme have or will be granted at a discount to the
relevant middle market price at the time of grant and no option
under any such scheme can be exercised unless performance
conditions have been satisfied. 
All employees and Executive Directors of the Company, its
subsidiaries and joint ventures, are eligible to participate in 
the 2003 Plan. Participants are selected by the committee at 
its discretion. The committee considers annually the levels of
grant, which are phased over time and they determine the size of
each award at the time of grant based on individual performance, 
the ability of each individual to contribute to the achievement 
of the performance conditions and market levels of remuneration.
Awards may not exceed an amount equal to five times salary for
US-based executives and three times salary for UK and other Europe-
based executives, although the committee may, if it so determines, 
also use the five times salary limit in exceptional circumstances.
No options may be granted more than 10 years after the date on
which the 2003 Plan was approved by the Company’s shareholders
and the committee will formally review the 2003 Plan by no later
than November 2008.

The Company monitors awards made under the various
employee and discretionary share plans which it operates in
relation to their effect on dilution limits. Options are either satisfied
by the issue of new shares or shares purchased in the market. 
In accordance with the recommendations of the Association of
British Insurers (‘ABI’), the number of new shares that may be
issued to satisfy options granted under the 2003 Plan and any
other employee share scheme is restricted to 10 per cent of the
issued ordinary share capital of the Company over any rolling 
10 years. Further, as set out in the ABI principles and guidelines,
the number of new shares that may be issued to satisfy executive
options granted under the 2003 Plan and any other discretionary
share scheme is restricted to 5 per cent of the issued ordinary
share capital of the Company over any rolling 10 years. In
addition, for US-based participants, the 2003 Plan will be
restricted such that the aggregate number of shares for which
options may be granted to such participants during the life of the
2003 Plan will not exceed 5 per cent of the issued ordinary share
capital of the Company as at the date the 2003 Plan was
approved by shareholders.
At 31 July 2008, awards had been granted resulting in shares
being issued or capable of being issued during the preceding 
10 years under all of the Company’s employee share plans
representing some 7.7 per cent of the issued ordinary share
capital at that date and 4.4 per cent of the issued ordinary 
share capital under the Company’s discretionary share plans.
The extent to which the options will be capable of exercise
depends on the satisfaction of a performance condition, based 
on achieving growth above UK inflation in the Company’s EPS 
(as calculated under UK GAAP before goodwill amortisation and
exceptional items), measured from the year ended immediately
prior to grant.
The performance condition for options now granted under the
2003 Plan operates on the following sliding scale:
Multiple of salary Total margin over UK inflation
worth of shares under option after three years
First 100% of salary 9%
Second 100% of salary 12%
Next 50% of salary 15%
Greater than 250% of salary 15% to 21%
The performance of the Company is measured over three
financial years, starting with the financial year in which the option
grant takes place. For all grants made under the 2003 Plan on or
after 5 November 2004 there is a single three-year performance
period and, in the event that the performance conditions are 
not fully met on the third anniversary of the date of grant, the
unvested options will lapse. Provided the performance condition
has been satisfied, an option may be exercised at any time until it
lapses, 10 years from the date of grant. No amount is payable on
the grant of an option.
The committee can set different EPS targets from those
described above for future options, provided that the new
conditions are no less challenging in the circumstances than the
initial ones. Similarly, the committee can vary the terms of existing
options to take account of technical changes, for example,
changes in accounting standards. The amended target will be
materially no less challenging as a result of any such change.
The committee continues to believe that the EPS condition 
is appropriate for share options, as it requires substantial
improvement in the Company’s underlying financial performance
and complements the inherent requirement for share price
growth for an option to have value.
Following the introduction of International Financial Reporting
Standards (‘IFRS’), the Group now reports results on this basis.
EPS calculated under the IFRS basis will be utilised to measure
performance in respect of options granted since 2005 but EPS
and, to the extent required, return on capital employed, will be
calculated on as near a UK GAAP basis as possible in respect 
of options granted prior to 2005 under which performance is 
still required to be measured in order to assess whether 
options have vested.
In November 2007, a total of 9,154,472 options (2007: 5,432,414)
were granted to 1,370 employees (2007: 1,133) across the Group.
The first table on page 56 shows the number of share options
held by Directors in office during the year under all executive
share option schemes as at 31 July 2008.
Savings related share option schemes
(audited)
The UK- and US-based Executive Directors may, along with 
all eligible employees, also participate in the UK Savings 
Related Share Option Scheme (‘SRSOS’) and the Employee 
Share Purchase Plan (‘ESPP’) respectively. Under the SRSOS,
participants can enter into a savings contract for three, five or
seven years, to a maximum level of £250 per month and are
granted options to subscribe for shares in the Company. Under
the ESPP , a US Code 423 Plan, US participants may enter into
a one-year savings contract to a maximum level of $400 per
month. The Board may determine that the options granted
under either scheme may be awarded at a discount. The
maximum discount, as applied to the 2008 awards, is 20 per cent
for the SRSOS and 15 per cent for the ESPP of the average
market prices used to determine the price of the award. Similar
schemes are also offered to employees across Europe under
the Wolseley European Sharesave Plan (‘WESP’) and in Ireland
under the Wolseley Irish Sharesave Scheme. 
In April 2008, a total of 1,378,956 options (2007: 668,431) were
granted to 5,725 employees in North America under the ESPP
and 1,155,174 options (2007: 557,612) under the WESP to
1,082 employees across Europe, all at an option price of 431
pence per share. A total of 4,297,235 options (2007: 814,350)
were granted in the UK and Ireland at an option price of 405
pence to 4,085 employees in the UK and 249 employees in
Ireland. The second table on page 56 sets out the number 
of share options held under the SRSOS and ESPP by the
Executive Directors.

1 Options exercisable subject to meeting performance targets. 
2 These options lapsed on 4 November 2007 as performance conditions for the 2004 grant only partially passed the performance conditions.
3 The performance conditions for option awards under the 1984 and 1989 Schemes granted in, and subsequent to, December 1997 may not be exercised unless
growth in EPS over a period of three consecutive financial years exceeds growth in the UK Retail Prices Index over the same period by at least 9 per cent. 
The number of options exercisable for Executive Directors under the 1984 and 1989 Schemes are, in addition, determined by the return on capital employed
(‘ROCE’) achieved over the same rolling three-year period. For options granted in 1997 and 1998, achieving a ROCE of 15 per cent per annum will enable 
50 per cent of options granted to become exercisable, rising on a sliding scale to 100 per cent for achieving a ROCE of 20 per cent or more. With effect from
October 1999 the ROCE required to permit exercise of 100 per cent of options granted was reduced from 20 per cent to 17.5 per cent and the sliding scale 
was adjusted accordingly. 
4 ROCE performance targets not passed prior to options reaching 10-year limit from date of grant.

Pensions (audited)
Mr Webster, a UK citizen, participates in the Wolseley Group
Retirement Benefits Plan (the ‘Plan’). The Plan is a defined 
benefit scheme and provides benefits based on final pensionable
salaries. The Company makes contributions to the Plan based 
on the recommendation of the Plan actuary. Bonuses payable 
to Executive Directors are not pensionable. Mr Webster currently
contributes 8 per cent per annum of his pensionable salary to 
the Plan. 
The Finance Act 1989 introduced an earnings cap (the ‘Cap’) 
for employees joining the Plan after 31 May 1989. This has the
effect of limiting the amount of an employee’s salary that can 
be pensioned through a tax approved pension scheme. A Plan-
specific earnings cap was introduced as a result of changes
introduced by the Finance Act 2004, effective 6 April 2006, when
the Cap was prospectively abolished. The current Plan-specific
annual limit, to which Mr Webster is subject, is £112,800. The
Company previously agreed to provide Mr Webster with benefits
which are broadly comparable with those that would have applied
under the Plan had the Cap not been introduced, which were
provided for by payments into a Funded Unapproved Retirement
Benefit Scheme (‘FURBS’). Following the introduction of the
Finance Act 2004, the FURBS was no longer a tax efficient 
vehicle to fund pension benefits. Accordingly, since 6 April 2006,
Mr Webster’s benefits have been provided through the Plan 
and through a cash supplement which, together, are broadly
comparable to those to which he would previously have been
entitled. No further monies have been paid into the FURBS.
Additionally, the Finance Act 1989 capped life assurance 
payable through a registered pension scheme in respect of such
executives. Mr Webster receives life cover up to the HM Revenue
& Customs’ Lifetime Allowance under the Plan. A separate
insurance policy, paid for by the Company, has been taken out 
to cover the excess above the Lifetime Allowance. The amount
charged to the profit and loss account during the year in respect
of his future obligation was £1,513 (2007: £1,256).
Messrs Hornsby, Marchbank and Roach, who are US citizens,
participate in the defined contribution pension arrangements 
of Ferguson Enterprises, Inc. Messrs Marchbank and Roach
received contributions at the level of 23 per cent of their base
salary and Mr Hornsby at a level of 20 per cent. Bonus is not
included in the calculation of pension contributions.
The following table shows those Executive Directors participating
in defined contribution pension plans and the cost of the
Group’s contributions thereto:

Brossette, a French subsidiary undertaking, has a commitment 
to a former Director, who is a French citizen, to pay an annual
pension of a228,891 (2007: a225,597), with a widow’s
entitlement of 60 per cent, subject to an annual increase based
on the agreed French pension index. The full actuarial cost 
of this arrangement was provided in previous years as part 
of Brossette’s ongoing pension obligations. The Company is
guarantor of this future pension commitment which at 31 July
2008 was approximately £2.3 million (2007: £2.2 million).
The table below shows the Executive Director in office on 
31 July 2008 who participated during the year in the Group’s
defined benefit schemes and the amount of benefit accrued at
the end of the year as if the Director had left service on 31 July
2008, the change in accrued benefit over the year, the transfer
value at both the beginning and end of the year as well as the
change in the transfer value over the year as required by the
Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002. The increase
in transfer value figures represents an obligation on the pension
fund or the Company – they are not sums due or paid to the
Director. The Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority require
additional disclosure of the change in accrued benefit net of
inflation and the transfer value of this change. These pension
liabilities are calculated using the cash equivalent transfer value
method prescribed in the Listing Rules.

Executive share ownership 
A share ownership programme was introduced with effect from 
1 August 2004. It is designed to encourage all Directors and
members of the Executive Committee to build up a shareholding
to the following levels:
Group Chief Executive 1.5 times basic salary
Other Executive Directors 1 times basic salary
Chairman and Non Executive Directors 1 times annual fees
Executive Committee members 0.5 times basic salary
For Executive Directors and members of the Executive Committee
share ownership may be achieved by retaining shares received 
as a result of participating in a Company share plan, other than
the shares sold to finance option exercises or to pay a National
Insurance or income tax liability or overseas equivalent. The
programme specifically excludes the need for executives to make
a personal investment should awards not vest. Normally these
levels of shareholding should be expected to be achieved within
three to five years from the time the individual is included in the
programme. The committee has reviewed and noted the progress
which has been made towards meeting these targets during the
year. Directors’ current shareholdings are set out in the Report 
of the Directors. 
This report has been approved by the Board for submission 
to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 
18 November 2008 and is signed on its behalf by the chairman 
of the committee.

Performance graph
The following graph shows the Company’s TSR performance
against the performance of the FTSE 100 Index over the five-year
period to 31 July 2008. The FTSE 100 Index has been chosen 
as being a broad equity market index consisting of companies
comparable in size and complexity to Wolseley.
External directorships 
Executive Directors are encouraged to take on not more than 
one external non executive directorship on a non-competitor
board, as the committee believes there are significant benefits 
to be achieved to both the Company and the individual. In order
to avoid any conflict of interest, all appointments are subject to 
the Board’s approval. Executive Directors may retain payments
received in respect of these appointments. Mr Hornsby is a 
non executive director of Virginia Company Bank for which he 
received no fees during the year; he received 3,000 stock options
at US$10 each on appointment in 2006. Mr Webster is a non
executive director of Bradford & Bingley plc, for which the annual
rate of his fees is £70,000 (2007: £70,000).

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
(‘IFRS’) as adopted by the European Union, including
interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards
Board (‘IASB’) and its committees, and with those parts of the
Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under
IFRS. The date of transition to IFRS was 1 August 2004.
A summary of the principal accounting policies applied by the
Group in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements
is set out below.
Basis of accounting
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under
the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of
available-for-sale investments and financial assets and liabilities
held for trading.
Accounting standards, interpretations 
and amendments to published standards
adopted during the year
During the year the following standards, interpretations of, and
amendments to published standards were adopted by the Group:
IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ and amendment 
to IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements – 
Capital Disclosures’
IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’
IFRIC 11 ‘Group and Treasury Share Transactions’
The adoption of these has not had a significant impact on the
Group’s financial position or results of operations. The adoption 
of IFRS 7 and the complementary amendment to IAS 1 has
resulted in additional disclosures in this Annual Report.
The Group has elected to adopt IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’ 
in the financial year ended 31 July 2008 and has presented the
segmental analysis of results in note 2 on this basis. Segmental
disclosures equivalent to those required by IFRS 8 were previously
presented in the Group’s Form 20-F, prepared in accordance with
US GAAP , and were provided as additional information in the
Group’s Annual Report and Accounts 2007.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items are those material items which, by virtue 
of their size or incidence, are presented separately in the income
statement to enable a full understanding of the Group’s financial
performance. These exclude impairments of acquired intangibles
which are also presented separately in the income statement.
Transactions which may give rise to exceptional items include
restructurings of business activities and gains or losses on the
disposal of businesses.
Consolidation
The consolidated financial information includes the results of 
the parent Company and its subsidiary undertakings drawn up 
to 31 July 2008.
The trading results of businesses acquired, sold or discontinued
during the year are included in profit on ordinary activities from 
the date of acquisition or up to the date of sale or discontinuance.
Intra-group transactions and balances and any unrealised gains
and losses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated 
on consolidation.
Foreign currencies
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s
subsidiary undertakings are measured using the currency 
of the primary economic environment in which the subsidiary
undertaking operates (the ‘functional currency’). The
consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling,
which is the presentational currency of the Group and the
functional currency of the parent Company.
The trading results of overseas subsidiary undertakings are
translated into sterling using average rates of exchange ruling
during the relevant financial period.
The balance sheets of overseas subsidiary undertakings 
are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling 
at the period end. Exchange differences arising between the
translation into sterling of the net assets of these subsidiary
undertakings at rates ruling at the beginning and end of the 
year are recognised in the currency translation reserve as are
exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings to the
extent that they are used to finance or provide a hedge against
foreign currency net assets.
Changes in the fair value and the final settlement value of
derivative financial instruments, entered into to hedge foreign
currency net assets and that satisfy the hedging conditions of 
IAS 39, are recognised in the currency translation reserve (see 
the separate accounting policy on derivative financial instruments).
In the event that an overseas subsidiary undertaking is sold, 
the gain or loss on disposal recognised in the income statement
is determined after taking into account the cumulative currency
translation differences that are attributable to the subsidiary
undertaking concerned.
Foreign currency transactions entered into during the year 
are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling 
on the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate 
of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. All currency
translation differences are taken to the income statement with
the exception of differences on foreign currency borrowings 
to the extent that they are used to finance or provide a hedge
against foreign currency net assets as detailed above. 
Revenue
Revenue is the amount receivable for the provision of goods
and services falling within the Group’s ordinary activities,
excluding intra-group sales, estimated and actual sales returns,
trade and early settlement discounts, value added tax and
similar sales taxes.
Revenue from the provision of goods is recognised when the
risks and rewards of ownership of goods have been transferred
to the customer. The risks and rewards of ownership of goods
are deemed to have been transferred when the goods are
shipped to, or are picked up by, the customer.
Revenue from services, other than those that arise from
construction service contracts (see below), are recognised 
when the service provided to the customer has been completed.

Year ended 31 July 2008
64 Group accounting policies
Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Revenue in respect of construction service contracts, where 
the Group is providing framing lumber installation services 
to residential property companies, is recognised using the
percentage of completion method, with the percentage complete
being determined by comparing the percentage of costs incurred
to date with the estimated total costs of the contract. Losses on
these contracts, if any, are recognised in the period when such
losses become probable and can be reasonably estimated.
Revenue from the provision of goods and all services is only
recognised when the amounts to be recognised are fixed 
or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured.
Cost of sales
Cost of sales includes purchased goods, the cost of bringing
inventory to its present location and condition, and labour and
overheads attributable to assembly and construction services.
Vendor rebates
The Group enters into arrangements with certain vendors
providing for inventory purchase rebates. These purchase rebates
are accrued as earned and are recorded initially as a reduction in
inventory with a subsequent reduction in cost of sales when the
related product is sold.
Business combinations
The Group has applied the purchase method in its accounting 
for the acquisition of subsidiaries.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the
assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or
assumed at the date of exchange, plus costs directly attributable
to the acquisition. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and
contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are
measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date,
irrespective of the extent of any minority interest.
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the
Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded
as goodwill. If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value 
of the Group’s share of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired,
the difference is recognised directly in the income statement.
Intangible assets
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over
the fair value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable assets 
of the acquired subsidiary undertaking at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiary undertakings is included 
in intangible assets.
Goodwill is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment
and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Gains
and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying
amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose 
of impairment testing. Each of those cash-generating units
represents the lowest level within the Group at which the
associated goodwill is monitored for management purposes 
and are not larger than the reporting segments determined 
in accordance with IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’.
Other intangible assets
An intangible asset, which is an identifiable non-monetary asset
without physical substance, is recognised to the extent that it is
probable that the expected future economic benefits attributable
to the asset will flow to the Group and that its cost can be
measured reliably. The asset is deemed to be identifiable when it 
is separable or when it arises from contractual or other legal rights.
Intangible assets, primarily brands, trade names and customer
relationships, acquired as part of a business combination are
capitalised separately from goodwill and are carried at cost less
accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Amortisation is calculated using the reducing balance method for
customer relationships and the straight-line method for other
intangible assets. The cost of the intangible assets is amortised
over their estimated useful lives as follows:
Customer relationships 4 – 25 years
Trade names and brands 1 – 15 years
Other 1 – 4 years
Computer software that is not integral to an item of property, 
plant and equipment is recognised separately as an intangible
asset and is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation 
and accumulated impairment losses. Costs include software
licences, consulting costs attributable to the development, design
and implementation of the computer software and internal costs
directly attributable to the development, design and implementation
of the computer software. Costs in respect of training and data
conversion are expensed as incurred. Amortisation is calculated
using the straight-line method so as to charge the cost of the
computer software to the income statement over its estimated
useful life (three to five years).
Property, plant and equipment (‘PPE’)
PPE is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and
accumulated impairment losses, except for land and assets in 
the course of construction, which are not depreciated and are
carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Cost includes
expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the
items. In addition, subsequent costs are included in the asset’s
carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate,
only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated
with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can
be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance costs 
are charged to the income statement during the financial period 
in which they are incurred.
Depreciation on assets is calculated using the straight-line method
to allocate the cost of each asset to its residual value over its
estimated useful life, as follows:
Freehold buildings and long leaseholds 35 – 50 years
Short leaseholds Over the period 
of the lease
Plant and machinery 7 – 10 years
Fixtures and fittings 5 – 7 years
Computers 3 – 5 years
Motor vehicles 4 years
The residual values and useful lives of PPE are reviewed and
adjusted if appropriate at each balance sheet date.
Borrowing costs attributable to assets under construction are
charged to the income statement in the period in which they 
are incurred.

Our business Performance review Governance Financial statements Other information 
Leased assets
Assets held under finance leases, which are leases where
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset
have transferred to the Group, are capitalised in the balance sheet
and depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or their useful
lives. The asset is recorded at the lower of its fair value and the
present value of the minimum lease payments at the inception of
the lease. The capital elements of future obligations under finance
leases are included in liabilities in the balance sheet and analysed
between current and non-current amounts. The interest elements
of future obligations under finance leases are charged to the
income statement over the periods of the leases and represent 
a constant proportion of the balance of capital repayments
outstanding in accordance with the effective interest rate method.
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and
rewards of ownership are classified as operating leases. The cost
of operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor)
is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over
the periods of the leases.
Assets held for sale
Assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount 
will be recovered by sale rather than by continuing use in the
business. For this to be the case, the asset must be available 
for immediate sale in its present condition, management must 
be committed to and have initiated a plan to sell the asset which,
when initiated, was expected to result in a completed sale within
twelve months. Assets that are classified as held for sale are not
depreciated and are measured at the lower of their carrying
amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Impairment of assets
Assets that have an indefinite useful life, such as goodwill, are not
subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment 
and whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the
carrying amount may not be recoverable. Assets that are subject
to amortisation and assets under construction are tested for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate
that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment
loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying
amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount
is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value 
in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are
grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately
identifiable cash flows.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable 
value. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) 
method or the average cost method as appropriate to the nature
of the transactions in those items of inventory. The cost of goods
purchased for resale includes import and custom duties, 
transport and handling costs, freight and packing costs and 
other attributable costs less trade discounts, rebates and other
subsidies. It excludes borrowing costs. Net realisable value is 
the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, 
less applicable variable selling expenses.
Taxation
Current tax represents the expected tax payable (or recoverable)
on the taxable income for the year using tax rates enacted or
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and taking into
account any adjustments arising from prior years.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on
temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets
and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated
financial statements. Deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises
from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction,
other than a business combination, that at the time of the
transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have
been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet
date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax
asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled. Deferred
tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that
future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary
differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on
investments in subsidiaries except where the timing of the
reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group
and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse
in the foreseeable future.
Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments, in particular, interest rate 
swaps and currency swaps, are used to manage the financial
risks arising from the business activities of the Group and the
financing of those activities. There is no trading activity in
derivative financial instruments.
At the inception of a hedging transaction entailing the use 
of derivative financial instruments, the Group documents 
the relationship between the hedged item and the hedging
instrument together with its risk management objective and the
strategy underlying the proposed transaction. The Group also
documents its assessment, both at the inception of the hedging
relationship and subsequently on an ongoing basis, of the
effectiveness of the hedge in offsetting movements in the fair
values or cash flows of the hedged items.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised as assets and
liabilities measured at their fair values at the balance sheet date.
Where derivative financial instruments do not fulfil the criteria 
for hedge accounting contained in IAS 39, changes in their 
fair values are recognised in the income statement.

Year ended 31 July 2008
66 Group accounting policies
Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008
When hedge accounting is used, the relevant hedging
relationships are classified as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges
or net investment hedges. Where the hedging relationship is
classified as a fair value hedge, the carrying amount of the hedged
asset or liability is adjusted by the increase or decrease in its fair
value attributable to the hedged risk and the resulting gain or loss
is recognised in the income statement where, to the extent that
the hedge is effective, it will be offset by the change in the fair
value of the hedging instrument. Where the hedging relationship 
is classified as a cash flow hedge or as a net investment hedge, 
to the extent the hedge is effective, changes in the fair value of 
the hedging instrument arising from the hedged risk are recognised
directly in equity rather than in the income statement. When 
the hedged item is recognised in the financial statements, the
accumulated gains and losses recognised in equity are either
recycled to the income statement or, if the hedged item results 
in a non-financial asset, are recognised as adjustments to its initial
carrying amount. 
Pensions and other post-retirement benefits
Contributions to defined contribution pension plans and other 
post-retirement benefits are charged to the income statement 
as incurred.
For defined benefit pension plans and other retirement benefits, 
the cost is calculated annually using the projected unit credit
method and is recognised over the average expected remaining
service lives of participating employees, in accordance with the
recommendations of independent qualified actuaries. The current
service cost of defined benefit plans is recorded within operating
profit. The total expected return from pension scheme assets less
the total interest on pension scheme liabilities is recorded within
finance revenue if a gain and finance costs if an expense. Past
service costs resulting from enhanced benefits are recorded within
operating profit and recognised on a straight-line basis over the
vesting period, or immediately if the benefits have vested. Actuarial
gains and losses, which represent differences between the
expected and actual returns on the plan assets and the effect 
of changes in actuarial assumptions, are recognised in full in the
statement of recognised income and expense in the period in
which they occur. The defined benefit liability or asset recognised 
in the balance sheet comprises the net total for each plan of the
present value of the benefit obligation at the balance sheet date,
less any past service costs not yet recognised, less the fair value 
of the plan assets, if any, at the balance sheet date. Where a plan
is in surplus, the asset recognised is limited to the amount of any
unrecognised past service costs and the present value of any
amount which the Group expects to recover by way of refunds 
or a reduction in future contributions. 
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and
measured subsequently at amortised cost using the effective
interest method, less provision for impairment. A provision for
impairment of trade receivables is established when there is
objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all
amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
Examples of such evidence include significant financial difficulties
of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or
financial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments.
The amount of the provision is the difference between the asset’s
carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash
flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. The amount
of the loss is recognised in the income statement. Trade receivables
are written off against the provision when recoverability is assessed
as being remote. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously
written off are credited to the income statement.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held
at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with
original maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts.
Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities
on the balance sheet to the extent that there is no right of offset
and no practice of net settlement with cash balances.
Share capital
The Company only has one class of shares, ordinary shares,
which are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares
or options are shown in equity as a deduction from the proceeds,
net of tax.
Where any Group company purchases the Company’s equity
share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including
any directly attributable incremental costs (net of tax), is deducted
from equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders until the
shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed of. Where such shares
are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received, net
of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the
related tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the
Company’s equity holders.
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at the fair value of the
consideration received net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost with any
difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the
redemption value being recognised in the income statement over
the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has
an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least
12 months after the balance sheet date.

Financial assets
The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories:
financial assets at fair value through profit or loss; loans and
receivables; held-to-maturity investments; and available-for-sale
financial assets. The classification depends on the purpose for
which the financial assets were acquired. Management determines
the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition and 
re-evaluates this designation at every reporting date.
(a) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
This category comprises financial assets held for trading which
have been acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the
short term. Derivatives also fall within this category unless they are
designated as hedges and the hedge is effective for accounting
purposes. Assets in this category are classified as current.
(b) Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with
fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active
market and with no intention of trading. They are included in
current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months
after the balance sheet date, which are classified as non-current
assets. Loans and receivables are included in trade and other
receivables in the balance sheet.
(c) Held-to-maturity investments
Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets
with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities that the
Group’s management has the positive intention and ability to hold
to maturity. They are included in non-current assets unless the
investment is due to mature within 12 months of the balance
sheet date.
(d) Available-for-sale financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivative financial
assets that are either designated in this category or not classified
in any of the other categories. They are included in non-current
assets unless management intends to dispose of the financial
asset within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
Financial assets are initially recognised at fair value plus
transaction costs for all financial assets not carried at fair value
through profit or loss. Financial assets are derecognised when 
the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have
expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred
substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.
Available-for-sale financial assets and financial assets at fair 
value through profit or loss are subsequently carried at fair value.
Loans and receivables and held-to-maturity investments are
subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest
method. Realised and unrealised gains and losses arising from
changes in the fair value of the ‘Financial assets at fair value
through profit or loss’ category are included in the income
statement in the period in which they arise. Unrealised gains 
and losses arising from changes in the fair value of non-monetary
securities classified as available-for-sale are recognised in equity.
When securities classified as available-for-sale are sold or impaired,
the accumulated fair value adjustments are included in the income
statement as gains and losses from investment securities.
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there
is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial
assets is impaired. In the case of equity securities classified as
available-for-sale, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair
value of the security below its cost is considered as an indicator
that the securities are impaired. If any such evidence exists for
available-for-sale financial assets, the cumulative loss, measured
as the difference between the acquisition cost and the current
value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously
recognised in profit or loss, is removed from equity and
recognised in the income statement.
Provisions
Provisions for environmental restoration, restructuring costs and
legal claims are recognised when the Group has a present legal
or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is more
likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to
settle the obligation, and the amount can be reliably estimated.
Such provisions are measured at the present value of
management’s best estimate of the expenditure required to
settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date. The
discount rate used to determine the present value reflects
current market assessments of the time value of money.
Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
Provisions for insurance represent an estimate, based on
historical experience, of the ultimate cost of settling outstanding
claims and claims incurred but not reported at the balance
sheet date.
Share-based payments
Share-based incentives are provided to employees under the
Group’s executive share option, long-term incentive and share
purchase schemes. The Group recognises a compensation 
cost in respect of these schemes that is based on the fair 
value of the awards, measured using Black-Scholes, Binomial
and Monte Carlo valuation methodologies. For equity-settled
schemes, the fair value is determined at the date of grant 
and is not subsequently remeasured unless the conditions 
on which the award was granted are modified. For cash-settled
schemes, the fair value is determined at the date of grant and 
is remeasured at each balance sheet date until the liability 
is settled. Generally, the compensation cost is recognised on 
a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Adjustments are
made to reflect expected and actual forfeitures during the
vesting period due to the failure to satisfy service conditions 
or non-market performance conditions.
Dividends payable
Dividends on ordinary shares are recognised in the Group’s
financial statements in the period in which the dividends are
approved by the shareholders of the Company (generally in the
case of the final dividend) or paid (in the case of interim dividends).

68 Notes to the consolidated financial statements
Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008
1. Critical accounting estimates 
and judgements
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with 
IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
in certain circumstances that affect reported amounts. The most
sensitive estimates affecting the financial statements are in the
areas of assessing the recoverability of receivables, the net
realisable value of inventory, the impairment of goodwill and 
long-lived intangible assets, the reserves in respect of self-insured
insurance, the consideration received from vendors, taxation and
the cost and liability for pensions and other post-retirement benefits.
Allowance for doubtful accounts
Provision is made against accounts that in the estimation of
management may be impaired. Within each of the businesses
assessment is made locally of the recoverability of accounts
receivable based on a range of factors including the age of 
the receivable and the creditworthiness of the customer. The
provision is assessed monthly with a detailed formal review 
of balances and security being conducted at the full year and 
half year. Determining the recoverability of an account involves
estimation as to the likely financial condition of the customer 
and their ability to subsequently make payment. If the Group is
cautious as to the financial condition of the customer the Group
may provide for accounts that are subsequently recovered.
Similarly if the Group is optimistic as to the financial condition 
of the customer the Group may not provide for an account that 
is subsequently determined to be irrecoverable. Furthermore, 
while the Group has a large geographically dispersed customer
base, a slowdown in the markets in which the Group operates
may result in higher than expected uncollectible amounts and
therefore higher (or lower) than anticipated charges for irrecoverable
receivables. The amount charged to the income statement 
in 2008 in respect of doubtful accounts represented 0.6 per cent 
of revenue (2007: 0.3 per cent).
Wolseley held a provision for impairment of receivables at 
31 July 2008 amounting to £79 million (2007: £55 million).
Inventories
For financial reporting purposes the Group evaluates its inventory
to ensure it is carried at the lower of cost or net realisable value.
Provision is made against slow moving, obsolete and damaged
inventories. Damaged inventories are identified and written down
through the inventory counting procedures conducted within each
business. Provision for slow moving and obsolete inventories 
is assessed by each business as part of their ongoing financial
reporting. Obsolescence is assessed based on comparison 
of the level of inventory holding to the projected likely future sales. 
Future sales are assessed based on historical experience, and
adjusted where the manufacturer has indicated that it will no
longer continue to manufacture the particular item. To the extent
that future events impact the saleability of inventory these provisions
could vary significantly. For example, changes in specifications 
or regulations may render inventory, previously considered to 
have a realisable value in excess of cost, obsolete and requiring
such inventory to be fully written off. The Group held allowances 
in respect of inventory balances at 31 July 2008 amounting to 
£160 million (2007: £168 million).
Impairment of long-lived assets
Wolseley periodically evaluates the net realisable value of 
long-lived assets, including goodwill, other intangible assets 
and tangible fixed assets, relying on a number of factors, including
operating results, business plans and projected future cash flows.
Assets that have an indefinite useful life, such as goodwill, 
are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for
impairment and whenever events or changes in circumstance
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. 
Assets that are subject to amortisation are tested for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the
carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is
recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount
exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the
higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
The fair value is in most cases based on the discounted present
value of the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-
generating unit to which the goodwill relates, or from the individual
asset or asset group. Estimates are used in deriving these cash
flows and the discount rate. 
The complexity of the estimation process and issues related 
to the assumptions, risks and uncertainties inherent with the
application of the intangible and tangible fixed asset accounting
policies affect the amounts reported in the financial statements. 
In particular, if different estimates of the projected future cash
flows or a different selection of an appropriate discount rate 
or long-term growth rate were made, these changes could
materially alter the projected value of the cash flows of the asset,
and as a consequence materially different amounts would be
reported in the financial statements. These estimates are
interlinked and specific to the circumstances of each asset, 
so that it is not appropriate to indicate how reported amounts
might change if different estimates were made.
As disclosed in note 3 and notes 12 and 13, the Group has
charged £186 million in respect of the impairment of long-lived
assets during the year ended 31 July 2008 (2007: £5 million).

Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Our business Performance review Governance Financial statements Other information 
Self-insured insurance
The Group operates a captive insurance company, Wolseley
Insurance Limited, which is registered and operational in the 
Isle of Man. This company provides reinsurance exclusively 
to certain companies within the Group, principally to cover 
US casualty, UK employers’ liability and Group property damage
risks. Provision is made based on actuarial assessment of the
liabilities arising from the insurance coverage provided. The
actuarial assessment of the reserve for future claims necessarily
includes estimates as to the likely trend of future claims costs and
the estimates as to the emergence of further claims subsequent 
to the year end. An actuarial review of claims is performed
annually. To the extent that actual claims differ from those
projected the provisions could vary significantly. At 31 July 
2008, the provision for claims arising from this insurance was 
£51 million (2007: £48 million).
Consideration received from vendors
The Group enters into agreements with many of its vendors
providing for inventory purchase rebates primarily upon
achievement of specified volume purchasing levels with many of
these agreements applying to sales in a calendar year. For certain
agreements the rebate rises as a proportion of purchases as
higher quantities or values of purchases are made. The Group
accrues the receipt of vendor rebates as part of its cost of sales
for products sold, taking into consideration cumulative purchases
of inventory to date and projected purchases through to the end
of the qualifying period. Rebates are accrued for each reporting
period with an extensive reassessment of the rebates earned
being performed at the end of the financial year and half way
through the financial year. The Group has agreements with
numerous and geographically dispersed suppliers, but a
slowdown in the markets in which the Group operates, or a
significant change in the profile of products purchased may result
in purchases for the remainder of the year differing significantly 
from those projected. Consequently the rebate actually received
may vary from that accrued in the financial statements.
Taxation
Accruals for tax contingencies require management to make
judgements and estimates in relation to tax audit issues and
exposures. Amounts accrued are based on management’s
interpretation of country-specific tax law and the likelihood 
of settlement. Tax benefits are not recognised unless the tax
positions are probable of being sustained. Once considered 
to be probable, management reviews each material tax benefit 
to assess whether a provision should be taken against full
recognition of the benefit on the basis of the potential settlement
through negotiation and/or litigation. All such provisions are
included in creditors due within one year. Any recorded exposure 
to interest on tax liabilities is provided for in the tax charge.
Pensions and other post-retirement benefits
The Group operates defined benefit pension schemes in the
United Kingdom and in a number of overseas locations that are
accounted for using methods that rely on actuarial assumptions
to estimate costs and liabilities for inclusion in the financial
statements. These actuarial assumptions include discount rates,
assumed rates of return, salary increases and mortality rates,
and are disclosed in note 29.
While management believes that the actuarial assumptions are
appropriate, any significant changes to those used would affect
the balance sheet and income statement. The Group considers
that the most sensitive assumptions are the discount rate and
life expectancy. The Group has estimated the sensitivity of the
financial statements to changes in these assumptions as follows:
(Increase)/decrease in liability
2008
Effect of a change in discount rate £m
Increase of 0.5% 93
Decrease of 0.5% (107)
Effect of an increase in life expectancy
Increase of 1 year (27)

2. Segmental analysis
Wolseley’s reportable segments, which are those reported to the Board, are the operating businesses overseen by distinct continental
and divisional management teams responsible for their performance. All reportable segments derive their revenue from a single
business activity, the distribution and supply of construction materials and services.
The Group’s business is not highly seasonal and its customer base is highly diversified, with no individually significant customer.
The revenue, trading profit and operating profit of the Group’s reportable segments are detailed in the following three tables.

The change in revenue and trading profit between the years ended 31 July 2007 and 2008 can be analysed into the effects of 
changes in exchange rates, the effects of acquisitions made during the financial year, and the effect of taking in a full year’s revenue
and trading profit of businesses acquired part way through the previous year, with the remainder being organic change.

4. Exceptional items
Exceptional items are those material items which, by virtue of their size or incidence, are presented separately in the income statement
to enable a full understanding of the Group’s financial performance.
In 2008, the Group recognised exceptional restructuring costs of £76 million before tax. The costs comprise staff redundancy costs
of £32 million and other costs, including provisions for future lease rentals on closed branches and asset write-downs, of £44 million.
There were no exceptional items in 2007 as restructuring costs in that year were not considered to be material (£20 million).

Ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement arising from cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign operations
is immaterial in both years.
In 2008, the Group determined that an equity holding in Building Materials Holding Corporation categorised as an available-for-sale
investment was impaired. The cumulative loss as at 31 July 2007 of £13 million that had been recognised in equity has accordingly
been recycled from equity and recognised in finance costs along with the £9 million fair value reduction experienced in the year.

9. Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share of 11.33 pence (2007: 73.52 pence) is calculated on the profit for the year attributable to equity shareholders 
of £74 million (2007: £474 million) on a weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those held
by Employee Benefit Trusts, of 655 million (2007: 644 million). As detailed in note 10 below, the Group believes that profit measures
before exceptional items and the amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles provide valuable additional information for users 
of the financial statements. Basic earnings per share, before exceptional items and the amortisation and impairment of acquired
intangibles, has, therefore, been presented in the following table.
2008 2007
Before exceptional items and the amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles 56.58p 87.80p
Add back: exceptional items (net of tax) (7.62)p –
Add back: amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles (net of deferred tax) (37.63)p (14.28)p
Basic earnings per share 11.33p 73.52p
The impact of all potentially dilutive share options on earnings per share would be to increase the weighted average number of 
shares in issue to 656 million (2007: 647 million) and therefore reduce basic earnings per share to 11.32 pence (2007: 73.17 pence).
Diluted earnings per share before exceptional items and the amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles is 56.50 pence 
(2007: 87.39 pence).
10. Non-GAAP measures of performance
Trading profit is defined as operating profit before exceptional items and the amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles.
It is a non-GAAP measure. Exceptional items are material non-recurring items which are excluded from trading profit to enable a
clear and consistent presentation of the Group’s underlying financial performance. In addition, the current businesses within the Group
have arisen through internal organic growth and through acquisition. Operating profit includes only the amortisation and impairment
of acquired intangibles arising on those businesses that have been acquired subsequent to 31 July 2004 and as such does not 
reflect equally the performance of businesses acquired prior to 31 July 2004 (where no amortisation or impairment of acquired
intangibles was recognised), businesses that have developed organically (where no intangibles are attributed) and those businesses
more recently acquired (where amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles is charged). 
The Group believes that trading profit provides valuable additional information for users of the financial statements in assessing the
Group’s performance since it provides information on the performance of the business that local managers are more directly able
to influence and on a basis consistent across the Group. The Group uses trading profit, and certain key performance indicators
calculated by reference to trading profit, for planning, budgeting and reporting purposes and for its internal assessment of the
operating performance of individual businesses within the Group.

All goodwill has arisen from business combinations. On transition to IFRS, the balance of goodwill as measured under UK GAAP 
was allocated to cash-generating units (CGUs). These are independent sources of income streams, and represent the lowest level
within the Group at which the associated goodwill is monitored for management purposes, which may be at country, divisional, brand
or regional level. Goodwill arising on business combinations after 1 August 2004 has been allocated to the CGUs that are expected
to benefit from that business combination.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. 
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. These calculations use cash flow projections
based on five-year financial forecasts approved by management. The key assumptions for these forecasts are those regarding 
revenue growth, net margin and the level of working capital required to support trading, which management estimates based on 
past experience and expectations of future changes in the market. To prepare value in use calculations, the cash flow forecasts
are extrapolated after the five-year period at an estimated average long-term nominal growth rate for each market (ranging from
1 per cent to 4 per cent), and discounted back to present value. The discount rate assumptions use an estimate of the Group’s
weighted average cost of capital, based on the five-year historic volatility of Wolseley shares and on benchmark interest rates,
adjusted for the risk attributable to individual CGUs. The pre-tax discount rate ranges from 11 per cent to 14 per cent.
Impairment tests were performed for all CGUs during the year ended 31 July 2008. 
At Stock Building Supply (‘Stock’), the US building materials business, the further significant deterioration in the US housing market 
has continued to adversely affect revenue and trading profit. The Group has consequently reassessed its short- and medium-term
outlook for Stock’s cash-generating units and has recognised an impairment loss in the year ended 31 July 2008. The loss mainly
relates to the Texas, Florida, Nevada, New York and Massachusetts regions. It is calculated on a value in use basis and consists
of a £110 million write down of goodwill and a £4 million write down of other acquired intangible assets. In the year ended 31 July 2007, 
the Group recognised an impairment loss in respect of the Midwest region of £2 million relating to goodwill and £3 million relating 
to other intangible assets.
The housing market in Ireland has also deteriorated significantly over the last year, and the Group has revised its expectations about 
the level of activity which will be sustainable in the long term. An impairment loss has been calculated on a value in use basis and
consists of a £33 million write down of goodwill and a £13 million write down of other acquired intangible assets.
The Group’s business in Italy has performed poorly in recent years and the Group has reappraised how long it will take to restore
previous levels of profitability. An impairment loss has been calculated on a value in use basis and consists of a £10 million write down 
of goodwill and a £1 million write down of other acquired intangible assets.

Software assets are generally either purchases from third parties or internally generated. In 2007 a small amount of software (£4 million)
was acquired with the DT Group. Other intangible assets arise on business combinations. Included in the amounts above are 
£132 million (2007: £60 million) relating to assets under construction.
The Group has reduced its planned capital expenditure significantly in the medium term. As a consequence, certain software assets
under development will not be implemented in the short term in as many territories as was originally intended. As a result of the
consequent reduction in anticipated benefits from improved margins, productivity and working capital utilisation, the estimated value 
in use of these assets has fallen below the accumulated costs to date, and a £15 million impairment loss has been recognised.
More details on the impairment charge for the year in respect of trade names and brands and customer relationships is provided 
in note 12.

There are other potential deferred tax assets in relation to tax losses totalling £93 million (2007: £43 million) that have not been
recognised on the basis that their future economic benefit is uncertain. All of these losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
No deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of a further £679 million (2007: £650 million) of unremitted earnings of
subsidiaries because the Group is in a position to control the timing of reversal of the associated temporary deferred tax differences
and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Provisions for impairment of receivables are made locally, and have two components:
• a provision for amounts that have been individually determined not to be collectible in full, because of known financial difficulties
of the debtor or evidence of default or delinquency in payment, amounting to £57 million at 31 July 2008 (2007: £43 million); and
• a provision based on historic experience of non-collectibility of receivables, amounting to £22 million at 31 July 2008 (2007: £12 million).
Concentration of credit risk in trade receivables is limited as the Group’s customer base is large and unrelated. Accordingly,
management considers that there is no further credit risk provision required above the current provision for impairment. 
Trade receivables can be aged with respect to the payment terms specified in the terms and conditions established with customers
as follows:

Other receivables include an amount of £36 million (2007: £35 million) which has been discounted at a rate of 4.6 per cent 
(2007: 5.0 per cent) due to the long-term nature of the receivable. The fair value of the remaining balances in trade and other
receivables approximates to book value.

Interest rate swaps
The Group uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its borrowings. The fair value of interest
rate swaps is estimated on the basis of the market values of equivalent instruments at the balance sheet date. 
The Group’s bank borrowings generally attract variable interest rates based on six-month LIBOR. Certain interest rate swaps are
designated and effective as cash flow hedges, with the valuation gains being deferred in equity until realised.

The Group’s private placement borrowings are at fixed rates. Certain interest rate swaps are designated as hedges of the fair values
of these borrowings. The movement in fair value of these interest rate swaps has been analysed into a proportion that is effective
as a hedge, and a proportion that is ineffective: both portions have been charged to the income statement with the effective portion
offsetting the change in fair value of the hedged borrowings (see note 6).

(2007: US$1,079 million) and basis point swaps with notional principal of US$300 million and a400 million. The contracts expire
between September 2008 and November 2020 (2007: September 2007 and November 2020), and the gains deferred in equity will
reverse in the income statement over that period. The fixed interest rates vary between 2.488 and 5.415 per cent (2007: 2.313 and
5.415 per cent).

Currency swaps
The Group uses currency swaps either to obtain the optimum return on its surplus funds or to hedge cash flows in respect of
committed transactions. The fair value of currency swaps has been estimated as the cost of closing out the contracts using market
prices at the balance sheet date. 
At the balance sheet date the Group had entered into certain short-term currency swaps amounting to assets of £119 million, 
US$177.5 million, C$5 million, CHF2 million, SEK50 million, DKK1,784 million, HUF1,000 million and SKK59 million (2007: £98 million,
US$150 million, DKK640 million and SEK16 million) and liabilities of a459 million and C$96 million (2007: a172 million, C$136 million
and CHF127 million) which were designated and effective as hedges of net investments in overseas operations. Valuation gains have
been deferred in equity.

Construction loans receivable, which are secured principally against homes in the course of construction or completed homes awaiting
sale, are made to customers of Stock and are all denominated in US dollars. These loans are generally settled when completed homes
are sold, rather than at a fixed term. The average age since origination is 14 months (2007: 9 months). As at 31 July 2008, the effective
rate of interest thereon was 9.3 per cent (2007: 9.9 per cent). The fair value of construction loans receivable and borrowings to finance
construction loans approximates to book value.

At 31 July 2008, £600 million of loans carried a fixed interest rate (2007: £594 million). The weighted average interest rate paid on 
fixed interest borrowings is 5.0 per cent (2007: 5.0 per cent). Interest receipts and payments on the floating rate assets and liabilities
are determined by reference to short-term benchmark rates applicable to the relevant currency or market, such as LIBOR.
The fair value of fixed interest rate loans is £602 million, compared to their book value of £600 million (2007: £590 million compared 
to their book value of £594 million). The floating rate loans payable after one year generally attract variable interest rates based on 
six-month LIBOR. Thus the fair value of these instruments approximates to their book value.

The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk. The Group 
has well-defined policies for the management of interest rate, liquidity, foreign exchange and counterparty exposures, which have
been consistently applied during the financial years ended 31 July 2007 and 2008. By the nature of its business the Group also has
trade credit and commodity price exposures, the management of which is delegated to operating businesses. There has been no
change since the year end in the major financial risks faced by the Group. 
The Treasury Committee of the Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
These policies are regularly reviewed. The Group’s financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise borrowings, cash and liquid
resources and various items, such as trade receivables and trade payables, that arise directly from its operations. The Group also
enters into derivative transactions (principally interest rate swaps and forward foreign currency contracts). The purpose of such
transactions is to hedge certain interest rate and currency risks arising from the Group’s operations and its sources of finance.
Derivatives are also used to a limited extent to hedge movements in the price paid for lumber. These options and futures hedging
contracts mature within one year and all are with organised exchanges. The Group’s policy is to control credit risk by only entering
into financial instruments with authorised counterparties after taking account of their credit rating. It is, and has been throughout the
period under review, the Group’s policy that no trading in financial instruments or speculative transactions be undertaken.
Foreign currency risk
The Group has significant overseas businesses whose revenues are mainly denominated in the currencies of the countries in which
the operations are located. Approximately 44 per cent of the Group’s revenue is in US dollars and 21 per cent in Euros. The Group
does not have significant transactional foreign currency cash flow exposure. However, those that do arise are generally hedged with
either forward contracts or currency options. The Group does not normally hedge profit translation exposure since such hedges 
have only temporary effect.
Most of the foreign currency earnings generated by the Group’s overseas operations are reinvested in the business to fund growth
in those territories. The Group’s policy is to maintain the majority of its debt in the currencies of its operating companies as this hedges
both the net assets and cash flows of the Group.
Details of average exchange rates used in the translation of overseas earnings and of year-end exchange rates used in the translation
of overseas balance sheets, for the principal currencies used by the Group, are shown in the Five year summary on page 119. The
net effect of currency translation was to increase revenue by £324 million (2.0 per cent) (2007: £776 million, or 5.5 per cent) and to
increase trading profit by £18 million (2.0 per cent) (2007: £51 million, or 5.8 per cent). These currency effects reflect a movement
of the average sterling exchange rate against each of the major currencies with which the Group is involved as follows:
2008 2007
(Strengthening) (Strengthening)
weakening weakening
of sterling of sterling
US dollar (2.6)% (8.2)%
Euros 10.0% (1.7)%
Interest rate risk
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and bank and other borrowings. The Group borrows in 
the desired currencies principally at floating rates of interest and then uses interest rate swaps to generate the desired interest rate
profile, so managing the Group’s exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
The Group reviews deposits and borrowings by currency at both Treasury Committee and Board meetings. The Treasury Committee
gives prior approval to any variations from floating rate arrangements.
The Group’s financial assets and liabilities are exposed to both fair value interest rate risk (fixed rate borrowings) and cash flow interest
rate risk (floating rate borrowings). The interest rate profile of the financial assets and liabilities that comprised the Group’s net debt 
at 31 July 2008 and 31 July 2007, after including the effect of interest rate swaps, are set out in the following tables.

The Group maintains a policy of ensuring sufficient borrowing headroom to finance all investment and bolt-on acquisitions for the
following financial year with an additional contingent safety margin. Large acquisitions are funded shortly before the acquisition is made.

During the year ending 31 July 2009 facilities with a value of £135 million will mature. These facilities will only be refinanced when
market conditions are appropriate.
During the year ended 31 July 2008 facilities amounting to £645 million matured or were repaid early, and new facilities of 
£298 million were arranged.
Capital risk management
The Group monitors two principal measures of financial gearing, the ratio of net debt to shareholders’ funds and the ratio of net debt 
to EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation). Over the longer term the Group aims to maintain the ratio 
of net debt to shareholders’ funds within the range of 40 per cent to 75 per cent and as at 31 July 2008 the ratio was 73.5 per cent.
The Group’s main borrowing facilities all contain a financial covenant limiting the ratio of net debt to EBITDA. For all facilities agreed
after 1 August 2005 this ratio has been set at 3.5. As at 31 July 2008 the ratio was 2.7:1 (2007: 2.2:1). The Group aims to maintain
this ratio generally in the range of 1.5 to 2.3.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amounts of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital 
to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
Credit risk
Wolseley provides sales on credit terms to many of its customers. There is an associated risk that customers may not be able to pay
outstanding balances. Stock also provides loans to finance the construction of properties. There is an associated risk that customers
may not be able to pay outstanding loan balances. At 31 July 2008 the maximum exposure to credit risk was £2,830 million (2007:
£2,901 million).
Each of the businesses have established procedures in place to review and collect outstanding receivables. Significant outstanding
and overdue balances are reviewed on a regular basis and resulting actions are put in place on a timely basis. In many cases,
protection is provided through lien rights on projects or through credit insurance arrangements. All of the major businesses use
professional, dedicated credit teams, in some cases field based. Historic write-off rates are low and appropriate provisions are made 
for debts that may be impaired on a timely basis.
Stock’s construction loans are secured on the related properties and are managed by a dedicated lending team within that business.
Policies are also applied to provide further protection and KPIs are monitored regularly by management outside the business.
The Group has cash balances deposited for short periods with financial institutions, and enters into certain contracts (such as interest
rate swaps) which entitle the Group to receive future cash flows from financial institutions. These transactions give rise to credit risk 
on amounts due from counterparties. This risk is managed by setting credit and settlement limits for a panel of approved counterparties,
all of which have credit ratings equivalent to Standard & Poor’s A or higher. The limits are approved by the Treasury Committee, and
ratings are monitored regularly.
Market price risk
The Group regularly monitors its interest rate and currency risk by reviewing the effect on profit before tax over various periods of a
range of possible changes in interest rates and exchange rates. On the basis of the Group’s analysis, it is estimated that the maximum
effect of a rise of one percentage point in the principal interest rates on the Group’s continuing businesses would result in an increase 
in the interest charge of approximately £25 million (2007: £17 million). Similarly, it is estimated that a strengthening of sterling by 
10 per cent against all the currencies in which the Group does business would reduce operating profit before amortisation and
impairment of acquired intangibles by approximately £52 million (9 per cent) due to currency translation, with the US dollar reduction
being £24 million and the euro reduction being £8 million (2007: £72 million, £45 million and £12 million respectively).
The Group does not require operating businesses to adhere to a formalised risk management policy in respect of trade credit 
risk or commodity price risk, and does not consider that there is a useful way of quantifying the Group’s exposure to any of the
macro-economic variables that might affect the collectibility of receivables or the prices of commodities.

Wolseley Insurance provisions represent an estimate, based on historical experience, of the ultimate cost of settling outstanding claims
and claims incurred but not reported on certain risks retained by the Group (principally US casualty and global property damage).
Environmental and legal liabilities include known and potential legal claims and environmental liabilities arising from past events where 
it is probable that a payment will be made and the amount of such payment can be reasonably estimated. Included in this provision
is an amount of £36 million (2007: £35 million) related to asbestos litigation involving certain Group companies. This liability is covered
by insurance and accordingly an equivalent insurance receivable has been recorded in ‘Other receivables’ (note 18). The liability has
been actuarially determined as at 31 July 2008 based on advice from independent professional advisers. The provision and the related
receivable have been stated on a discounted basis using a long-term discount rate of 4.6 per cent (2007: 5.0 per cent). The level
of insurance cover available significantly exceeds the expected level of future claims and no profit or cash flow impact is therefore
expected to arise in the foreseeable future.
The majority of restructuring provisions fall due within one year.
Other provisions relate to rental commitments on vacant properties, dilapidations on leased properties and warranties. The weighted
average maturity of these obligations is approximately nine years.
29. Retirement benefit obligations
(i) Description of plans
United Kingdom
The principal scheme operated for UK employees is the Wolseley Group Retirement Benefits Plan which provides benefits based on
final pensionable salaries. The assets are held in separate trustee administered funds. The scheme’s retirement benefits are funded
by a contribution from employees with the balance being paid by Group companies. The contribution rates paid by employees at 
31 July 2008 are either 5 per cent or 8 per cent of earnings depending on the level of benefits that were accruing at that date. The
Group and employee contribution rates are calculated on the Projected Unit Method and agreed with an independent consulting actuary.
Outside the United Kingdom
North America
The principal schemes operated for US employees are defined contribution schemes, which are established in accordance with 
US 401k rules. Companies contribute to both employee compensation deferral and profit sharing plans. Contributions are charged 
to the income statement in the period in which they fall due. In the year to 31 July 2008 the cost of defined contribution plans
charged to the income statement was £24 million (2007: £24 million).
In addition, the Group operates three defined benefit schemes in the United States. In Canada a defined benefit scheme and a 
defined contribution scheme are operated. Two of the US schemes and the Canadian scheme are funded; two plans are closed to 
new entrants. The majority of assets are held in trustee administered funds independent of the assets of the companies. The closed
plans now provide a minimum pension guarantee in conjunction with a defined contribution scheme. The remaining schemes provide
benefits based on final pensionable salaries. The contribution rate is calculated on the Projected Unit (credit) Method as agreed with
independent consulting actuaries.

Our business Performance review Governance Financial statements Other information 
Europe
Both defined contribution and defined benefit schemes are operated. Liabilities arising under defined benefit schemes are calculated
in accordance with actuarial advice. Contributions to defined contribution schemes are accounted for in the period in which they fall
due. The cost of defined contribution schemes charged to the income statement was £20 million (2007: £15 million).
Post-retirement health care
There are no material obligations to provide post-retirement health care benefits.
The Group expects to contribute £33 million to the UK defined benefit scheme in the year ending 31 July 2009 and £8 million to the
non-UK defined benefit schemes.

The expected long-term rates of return for equities are long-term assumptions and were set after taking actuarial advice. The expected
equity returns can be considered as a risk free rate of return (determined by reference to government bond rates in the countries in
which the plans are based) plus a risk premium to reflect the additional risks associated with equities. For the UK scheme the expected
return implies a premium of 3.4 per cent per year as at 31 July 2008 (2007: 3.0 per cent) over the expected return from government
bonds. For the principal overseas schemes in the USA, Canada and Switzerland, a similar approach was adopted with returns set by
reference to long-term bond rates after taking actuarial advice.
The Group’s investment strategy for its funded post-employment plans is decided locally by the Group and, if relevant, the trustees
of the plan, and takes account of the relevant statutory requirements. The Group’s objective for the investment strategy is to achieve a
target rate of return in excess of the increase in the liabilities, while taking an acceptable amount of investment risk relative to the liabilities.
This objective is implemented by using specific allocations to a variety of asset classes that are expected over the long term to deliver the
target rate of return. Most investment strategies have significant allocations to equities, with the intention being that this will result in the
ongoing cost to the Group of the post-employment plans being lower over the long term and be within acceptable boundaries of risk.

For the UK scheme, the policy is to invest approximately 75 per cent of the assets in equities and 25 per cent in other asset classes,
principally bonds. The investment strategy is subject to regular review by the scheme trustees in consultation with the Group. For the
overseas schemes, the investment strategy involves the investment in defined levels of predominantly equities with the remainder of 
the assets being invested in cash and bonds.

shares held by the Employee Benefit Trusts at 31 July 2008, which have a nominal value of £2 million, was £21 million (2007: £67
million). Dividends due on shares held by the Employee Benefit Trusts are waived in accordance with the provisions of the trust deeds.

31. Share-based payments
The Group operates seven share option plans: the 1984 Executive Share Option Scheme, the 1989 Executive Share Option Scheme
and the Wolseley Share Option Plan 2003 (collectively, the ‘Executive Option Schemes’); the Wolseley Employees Savings Related
Share Option Scheme 1981, the Wolseley Irish Sharesave Scheme 2000 and the Wolseley European Sharesave Plan 2001 (collectively,
the ‘Employees Savings Option Schemes’); and the Wolseley Employee Share Purchase Plan 2001 (the ‘ESPP’).
Awards granted under the Executive Option Schemes are subject to a condition such that they may not be exercised unless the
growth in earnings per share over a period of three consecutive financial years exceeds growth in the UK Retail Price Index over the
same period by at least 9 per cent and consequently vest over a period of three years. Awards granted under the Employee Savings
Option Schemes vest over periods ranging from three to seven years. Awards granted under the Employee Share Purchase Plan vest
over a one-year period.
The Group also operates a Long Term Incentive Scheme (‘LTIS’) and the Wolseley Restricted Share Plan (‘RSP’) for senior executives.
Under the LTIS, executives will be awarded a variable number of shares depending on the level of total shareholder return over the
next three years relative to that of a number of comparator companies. The vesting period is three years. The maximum award under
the scheme is determined at grant date, and then adjusted at vesting date in accordance with the market performance condition.
Under the RSP , executives are granted free shares. The vesting period is three years and there are no performance measures.

The fair value at the date of grant of options awarded during the year has been estimated by the binomial methodology for all schemes
except the LTIS, for which a Monte Carlo simulation was used. The fair value of shares granted under the RSP was calculated as the
market price of the shares at the date of grant reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid over the vesting period.
The principal assumptions required by these methodologies were:
Executive Employee Long Term

*The initial assumption was for 2008 interim and final dividends of 11.94 pence and 23.71 pence respectively (2007: 10.84 pence
and 21.51 pence respectively).
Expected volatility has been estimated on the basis of historic volatility over the expected term. Expected life has been estimated
on the basis of historical data on the exercise pattern.

33. Acquisitions
A list of businesses acquired during the year, and the month of acquisition, is set out on page 122. All these businesses are engaged
in the distribution of building materials. In all these acquisitions, the Group acquired 100 per cent of the issued share capital, and has
accounted for the transaction by the purchase method of accounting.

The fair value adjustments shown above for the year ended 31 July 2008 are provisional figures, being the best estimates currently
available. Further adjustments to goodwill may be necessary when additional information is available concerning some of the
judgemental areas.
The goodwill arising on these acquisitions is attributable to the anticipated profitability of the new markets and product ranges to 
which the Group has gained access, and to additional profitability and operating efficiencies in respect of existing markets.
The acquisitions contributed £218 million to revenue, £26 million to trading profit and £15 million to the Group’s operating profit
for the period between the date of acquisition and the balance sheet date. It is not practicable to disclose profit before tax, as the
Group manages its borrowings as a portfolio and cannot attribute an effective borrowing rate to an individual acquisition. It is not
practicable to disclose profit attributable to equity shareholders, as the complexity of the Group’s tax arrangements is such that it
cannot attribute an effective tax rate to an individual acquisition.
If each acquisition had been completed on the first day of the financial year, Group revenue would have been £16,613 million 
and Group trading profit would have been £689 million. It is not practicable to disclose profit before tax or profit attributable to 
equity shareholders, as stated above. It is not practicable to disclose operating profit as the Group cannot estimate the amount
of intangible assets that would have been acquired at a date other than the acquisition date.

Operating lease payments mainly represent rental payable by the Group for certain of its properties. Some of these operating lease
arrangements have renewal options and rental escalation clauses, though the effect of these is not material. No arrangements have
been entered into for contingent rental payments.
The total minimum sublease payments expected to be received under non-cancellable subleases at 31 July 2008 is £21 million 
(2007: £18 million).
41. Contingent liabilities
The Group has quantifiable contingent liabilities under sundry guarantees, performance bonds and indemnities of £13 million 
(2007: £37 million) which arose in the ordinary course of business and which have not been provided in these accounts since no 
actual liability is expected to arise.
At 31 July 2008, the Group has counterparty exposure of £408 million (2007: £232 million) in respect of unsettled currency swaps.
These currency swaps have a fair value of £1 million and further details are included in note 21.
As of 31 July 2008, cash deposits of Wolseley Insurance Limited amounting to £65 million (2007: £58 million) were charged in favour
of Lloyds TSB Bank plc to secure letters of credit provided by that bank.

In August 2008, the US plumbing and heating business sold eight properties as part of a sale and leaseback arrangement 
generating sale proceeds of £43 million.

44. Accounting standards, interpretations of and amendments to published standards 
not yet effective
Certain new standards, amendments to and interpretations of existing standards have been published that are mandatory for 
the Group’s accounting periods beginning on or after 1 August 2008 or later periods, but which the Group has not early adopted.
The new standards which are expected to be relevant to the Group’s operations are as follows:
Amendment to IFRS 2 Share-based Payment (effective from 1 August 2009)
This amendment clarifies that vesting conditions are service conditions and performance conditions only. Other features of a 
share-based payment are not vesting conditions. It also specifies that all cancellations, whether by the entity or by other parties,
should receive the same accounting treatment. Management is currently assessing the impact of this amendment on the Group’s
financial statements.
Amendment to IFRS 3 Business Combinations and amendment to IAS 27 Consolidated 
and Separate Financial Statements (effective from 1 August 2009)
These amendments make a number of changes to the method of accounting for business combinations, including a requirement 
to expense acquisition costs and to measure contingent consideration at fair value at acquisition date, and then record subsequent
changes to the estimate in the income statement. Management is currently assessing the impact of this amendment on the Group’s
financial statements.
Amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements (effective from 1 August 2009)
This amendment requires information in financial statements to be aggregated on the basis of shared characteristics and introduces
a statement of comprehensive income. Preparers will have the option of presenting items of income and expense and components 
of other comprehensive income either in a single statement of comprehensive income with subtotals, or in two separate statements
(a separate income statement followed by a statement of comprehensive income). Management is currently assessing the impact 
of this amendment on the Group’s financial statements.
Amendment to IAS 23 Borrowing Costs (effective from 1 August 2009)
This amendment requires the capitalisation of borrowing costs, to the extent they are directly attributable to the acquisition, production
or construction of assets that need a period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale. Management is currently assessing
the impact of this amendment on the Group’s financial statements.
IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes (effective from 1 August 2008)
IFRIC 13 addresses accounting by entities that grant loyalty award credits to customers who buy other goods or services. It requires
the award to be accounted for as a separate component of the sale transaction, with the fair value of the award being deferred until
the obligation to provide free or discounted goods or services has been redeemed. Management is currently assessing the impact of
this interpretation on the Group’s financial statements.
IFRIC 14 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction 
(effective from 1 August 2008)
Paragraph 58 of IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ limits the measurement of the defined benefit asset in a pension plan to the ‘present value
of economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.’ IFRIC 14 clarifies
how to measure this limit in the case of plans subject to a minimum funding requirement. Management does not expect adoption of
this interpretation to have a significant impact on the Group’s financial statements.
IFRIC 16 Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation (effective from 1 August 2009)
IFRIC 16 provides guidance on identifying the foreign currency risks that qualify as a hedged risk in the hedge of a net investment in 
a foreign operation; where, within a group, hedging instruments that are hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation can be held
to qualify for hedge accounting; and how an entity should determine the amounts to be reclassified from equity to profit or loss for 
both the hedging instrument and the hedged item. Management is currently assessing the impact of this interpretation on the Group’s
financial statements.

as having been audited.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report 
and the Group financial statements in accordance with applicable
law and International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) 
as adopted by the European Union are set out in the Directors’
responsibility statement.
Our responsibility is to audit the Group financial statements in
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). This report,
including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for the
Company’s members as a body in accordance with section 235 
of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose. We do not,
in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other
purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or
into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by
our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Group financial
statements give a true and fair view and whether the Group
financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance
with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We also report to you whether in our opinion the information given
in the Report of the Directors is consistent with the Group financial
statements. The information given in the Report of the Directors
includes that specific information presented in the Performance
review that is cross-referred from the business review section

remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate governance statement reflects
the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the
Combined Code (2006) specified for our review by the Listing
Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it 
does not. We are not required to consider whether the Board’s
statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, 
or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate
governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report
and consider whether it is consistent with the audited Group
financial statements. The other information comprises only 
those sections listed in the contents page under the headings
‘Our business’, ‘Performance review’, ‘Governance’, and 
‘Other information’. We consider the implications for our report 
if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material
inconsistencies with the Group financial statements. Our
responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis,
of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the
Group financial statements. It also includes an assessment of
the significant estimates and judgements made by the directors
in the preparation of the Group financial statements, and of
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary 
in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the Group financial statements are free from
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated 
the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the
Group financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, 
of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 July 2008 and of 
its profit and cash flows for the year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 
of the IAS Regulation; and
• the information given in the Report of the Directors is
consistent with the Group financial statements.

Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Our business Performance review Governance Financial statements Other information 
1. Company accounting policies
Basis of accounting
These Companies Act 1985 financial statements are prepared
under the historical cost convention and in accordance with
applicable UK accounting standards. The principal accounting
policies, as set out below, have been applied consistently
throughout the period.
Note 8 on page 77, note 29 on pages 94 to 98, note 30 on 
page 98 and note 31 on pages 99 to 100 of the Wolseley plc
consolidated financial statements form part of these financial
statements.
Under section 203(4) of the Companies Act 1985 the Company 
is exempt from the requirements to present its own profit and loss
account. Under Financial Reporting Standard 1 (revised 1996) the
Company is exempt from the requirement to prepare statements
of cash flow as the consolidated statements have been published.
Foreign currencies
The cost of the Company’s investments in overseas subsidiary
undertakings is translated into sterling at the rate ruling at the 
date of investment.
Foreign currency transactions entered into during the year are
translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling on the dates
of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated 
in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling
at the balance sheet date. All currency translation differences are
taken to the income statement with the exception of differences
on foreign currency borrowings to the extent that they are used 
to finance or provide a hedge against foreign currency investments.
Investments
Fixed asset investments are recorded at cost less provision for
impairment. The Company assesses at each balance sheet date
whether there is objective evidence that an investment or a group
of investments is impaired.
Taxation
Current tax represents the expected tax payable (or recoverable)
on the taxable income for the year using tax rates enacted or
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and taking into
account any adjustments arising from prior years.
Provision is made for deferred taxation in so far as a liability or
asset has arisen as a result of transactions that had occurred by
the balance sheet date and have given rise to an obligation to pay
more tax in the future, or the right to pay less tax in the future. 
An asset has not been recognised to the extent that the transfer
of economic benefits in the future is uncertain. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities recognised have not been discounted. Provision is
made for UK or foreign taxation arising on the distribution to the
UK of retained profits of overseas subsidiary undertakings where
dividends have been recognised as receivable.
Derivatives and financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments, in particular, interest rate swaps
and currency swaps, are used to manage the financial risks
arising from the business activities of the Company and the
financing of those activities. There is no trading activity in
derivative financial instruments.
At the inception of a hedging transaction entailing the use 
of derivative financial instruments, the Company documents 
the relationship between the hedged item and the hedging
instrument together with its risk management objective and 
the strategy underlying the proposed transaction. The Company
also documents its assessment, both at the inception of the
hedging relationship and subsequently on an ongoing basis, 
of the effectiveness of the hedge in offsetting movements in 
the fair values or cash flows of the hedged items.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised as assets and
liabilities measured at their fair values at the balance sheet date.
Where derivative financial instruments do not fulfil the criteria 
for hedge accounting contained in FRS 26, changes in their 
fair values are recognised in the income statement. 
When hedge accounting is used, the relevant hedging
relationships are classified as fair value hedges, cash flow
hedges or net investment hedges. Where the hedging
relationship is classified as a fair value hedge, the carrying
amount of the hedged asset or liability is adjusted by the
increase or decrease in its fair value attributable to the hedged
risk and the resulting gain or loss is recognised in the income
statement where, to the extent that the hedge is effective, 
it will be offset by the change in the fair value of the hedging
instrument. Where the hedging relationship is classified as a
cash flow hedge or as a net investment hedge, to the extent 
the hedge is effective, changes in the fair value of the hedging
instrument arising from the hedged risk are recognised directly
in equity rather than in the income statement. When the hedged
item is recognised in the financial statements, the accumulated
gains and losses recognised in equity are either recycled 
to the income statement or, if the hedged item results in a 
non-financial asset, are recognised as adjustments to its initial
carrying amount.
Financial guarantees
Financial guarantee contracts are recognised as assets 
and liabilities measured at fair value as at the reporting date. 
Fair value is estimated by discounting expected cash flows 
at a market rate. Changes in fair value are recognised in the
income statement.

Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008
1. Company accounting policies continued
Pensions and post-retirement benefits
Contributions to defined contribution pension plans and other 
post-retirement benefits are charged to the income statement 
as incurred.
For defined benefit pension plans and other retirement benefits,
the cost is calculated annually using the projected unit credit
method and is recognised over the average expected remaining
service lives of participating employees, in accordance with the
recommendations of independent qualified actuaries. The current
service cost of defined benefit plans is recorded within operating
profit, the expected return from pension scheme assets is
recorded within finance revenue and the interest on pension
scheme liabilities is recorded within finance costs. Past service
costs resulting from enhanced benefits are recorded within
operating profit and recognised on a straight-line basis over 
the vesting period, or immediately if the benefits have vested.
Actuarial gains and losses, which represent differences between
the expected and actual returns on the plan assets and the effect
of changes in actuarial assumptions, are recognised in full in the
statement of recognised gains and losses in the period in which
they occur. The defined benefit liability or asset recognised in the
balance sheet comprises the net total for each plan of the present
value of the benefit obligation at the balance sheet date, less any
past service costs not yet recognised, less the fair value of the
plan assets, if any, at the balance sheet date. Where a plan is 
in surplus, the asset recognised is limited to the amount of any
unrecognised past service costs and the present value of any
amount which the Company expects to recover by way of 
refunds or a reduction in future contributions.
Cash at bank and in hand
Cash at bank and in hand includes cash in hand, deposits held 
at call with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments
with original maturities of three months or less. Bank overdrafts
are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the balance
sheet to the extent that there is no right of offset and practice of
net settlement with cash balances.
Share capital
The Company only has one class of shares, ordinary shares,
which are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable
to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a
deduction from the proceeds, net of tax.
Where the Company purchases the Company’s equity share
capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any
directly attributable incremental costs (net of tax), is deducted
from equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders until the
shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed of. Where such shares
are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received, net
of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the
related tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the
Company’s equity holders.
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at the fair value of the
consideration received net of transaction costs incurred. 
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost with 
any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs)
and the redemption value being recognised in the income
statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective
interest method.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Company
has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for 
at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Share-based payments
Share-based incentives are provided to employees under the
Company’s executive share option, long term incentive and share
purchase schemes. The Company recognises a compensation
cost in respect of these schemes that is based on the fair value 
of the awards, measured using Black-Scholes, binomial and
Monte Carlo valuation methodologies. For equity-settled schemes,
the fair value is determined at the date of grant and is not
subsequently remeasured unless the conditions on which the
award was granted are modified. For cash-settled schemes, the
fair value is determined at the date of grant and is remeasured 
at each balance sheet date until the liability is settled. Generally,
the compensation cost is recognised on a straight-line basis 
over the vesting period. Adjustments are made to reflect 
expected and actual forfeitures during the vesting period due 
to the failure to satisfy service conditions or achieve non-market
performance conditions.
Dividends payable
Dividends on ordinary shares are recognised in the Company’s
financial statements in the period in which the dividends are
approved by the shareholders of the Company (generally in the
case of the final dividend) or paid (in the case of interim dividends).

owned subsidiary. All of the above investments are in unlisted shares. Particulars of principal subsidiary undertakings are listed
on pages 117 and 118 of the Annual Report. The Directors believe that the carrying value of the investments is supported by their
underlying net assets.

The Company participates in the Wolseley Group Retirement Benefits Plan. This is a defined benefit multi-employer plan, the assets
and liabilities of which are held independently from the Group. The Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets
and liabilities of the plan and accordingly accounts for the plan as if it were a defined contribution plan. Information in respect of 
the plan is provided in note 29, on pages 94 to 98, to the Wolseley plc consolidated financial statements. The total contribution
to the defined benefit plan in the year was £nil (2007: £1 million).

Interest rate swaps
The Company uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its borrowings. The fair value of interest
rate swaps is estimated on the basis of the market values of equivalent instruments at the balance sheet date.
The Company’s bank borrowings generally attract variable interest rates based on six-month LIBOR. Certain interest rate swaps are
designated and effective as cash flow hedges, and the valuation gains have been deferred in equity until realised.

US$350 million) and basis point swaps with notional principal of US$300 million (2007: US$nil) and a400 million (2007: anil).
The contracts expire between September 2008 and August 2011 (2007: September 2007 and August 2011), and the gains deferred 
in equity will reverse in the income statement over that period. The fixed interest rates vary between 2.488 and 5.415 per cent
(2007: 2.313 and 5.415 per cent).
Currency swaps
The Company uses currency swaps either to obtain the optimum return on its surplus funds or to hedge the spot exchange rate 
risk of its assets and liabilities, principally loans. The fair value of currency swaps has been estimated as the cost of closing out the
contracts using market prices at the balance sheet date.

14. Contingent liabilities
Provision is made for the Directors’ best estimate of known legal claims and legal actions in progress. The Company takes legal
advice as to the likelihood of success of claims and actions, and no provision is made where the Directors consider, based on that
advice, that the action is unlikely to succeed or a sufficiently reliable estimate of the potential obligation cannot be made.
At 31 July 2008 the Company has a quantifiable contingent liability for value added tax of certain subsidiary undertakings of 
£16 million (2007: £13 million) which arose in the ordinary course of business and has not been provided for in these accounts 
since no actual liability is expected to arise.
At 31 July 2008 the Company has counterparty exposure of £408 million (2007: £232 million) in respect of unsettled currency swaps.
In addition, the Company has given its principal UK bank authority to transfer at any time any sum outstanding to its credit against
or towards satisfaction of the liability to the bank of certain subsidiary undertakings.
The Company has given indemnities and warranties to the purchasers of businesses from the Company and certain Group
companies in respect of which no material liabilities are expected to arise. 
15. Employees, employee costs and auditors’ remuneration
The average number of employees (including Directors) of the Company in the year ended 31 July 2008 was 17 (2007: 17). 
Total employee costs of the Company for the year were £5 million (2007: £6 million).
Fees payable to the auditors for the audit of the Company’s financial statements are set out in note 3, on page 74, to the Wolseley
plc consolidated financial statements.
16. Dividends
Details of the Company’s dividends are set out in note 8, on page 77, to the Wolseley plc consolidated financial statements.
17. Related party transactions
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption available under the terms of paragraph 3 (a) of FRS 8 ‘Related Party
Disclosures’ to dispense with the requirement to disclose transactions with subsidiaries, 90 per cent or more whose voting rights
are held within the Group, and which are included in the Wolseley plc consolidated financial statements.
18. Post balance sheet events
Details of significant post balance sheet events are set out in note 42, on page 105, to the Wolseley plc consolidated 
financial statements.
19. Accounting standards, interpretations of and amendments to published standards 
not yet effective
Certain new standards, amendments to and interpretations of existing standards have been published that are mandatory for 
the Company’s accounting periods beginning on or after 1 August 2008 or later periods, but which the Company has not early
adopted. The new standards which are expected to be relevant to the Company’s operations are as follows:
Amendment to FRS 20 Share-based Payment (effective from 1 August 2009)
This amendment clarifies that vesting conditions are service conditions and performance conditions only. Other features of a 
share-based payment are not vesting conditions. It also specifies that all cancellations, whether by the entity or by other parties,
should receive the same accounting treatment. Management is currently assessing the impact of this amendment on the 
Company’s financial statements.

Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008
We have audited the parent company financial statements of
Wolseley plc for the year ended 31 July 2008 which comprise 
the balance sheet and the related notes. These parent company
financial statements have been prepared under the accounting
policies set out therein. We have also audited the information in
the Remuneration report that is described as having been audited.
We have reported separately on the group financial statements 
of Wolseley plc for the year ended 31 July 2008.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, 
the Remuneration report and the parent company financial
statements in accordance with applicable law and United
Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally
Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the Directors’
responsibility statement.
Our responsibility is to audit the parent company financial
statements and the part of the Remuneration report to be 
audited in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory
requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and
Ireland). This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for
and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance
with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other
purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to
whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come 
save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the parent company
financial statements give a true and fair view and whether 
the parent company financial statements and the part of the
Remuneration report to be audited have been properly prepared 
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to
you whether in our opinion the information given in the Report 
of the Directors is consistent with the parent company financial
statements. The information given in the Report of the Directors
includes that specific information presented in the Performance
review that is cross referred from the Business review section 
of the Report of the Directors.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the company 
has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received 
all the information and explanations we require for our audit, 
or if information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration
and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report 
and consider whether it is consistent with the audited parent
company financial statements. The other information comprises
only those sections listed in the contents page under the headings
‘Our business’, ‘Performance review’, ‘Other information’ and 
the Report of the Directors, the Corporate governance statement, 
and the unaudited part of the Remuneration report. We consider
the implications for our report if we become aware of any
apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with 
the parent company financial statements. Our responsibilities 
do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis,
of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the parent
company financial statements and the part of the Remuneration
report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the
significant estimates and judgements made by the Directors 
in the preparation of the parent company financial statements, 
and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to 
the company’s circumstances, consistently applied and
adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary 
in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the parent company financial statements and 
the part of the Remuneration report to be audited are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the
overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the parent
company financial statements and the part of the Remuneration
report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the parent company financial statements give a true and fair
view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice, of the state of the company’s affairs as
at 31 July 2008;
• the parent company financial statements and the part of 
the Remuneration report to be audited have been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
• the information given in the Report of the Directors is
consistent with the parent company financial statements.

Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Shareholder information
Shareview is a service offered by Equiniti, our Registrars, which
allows shareholders online access to a range of shareholder
information. Shareview provides access to details of shareholdings
in the Company and practical help on transferring shares 
or updating personal details. It also allows shareholders to 
choose to receive shareholder communications electronically,
rather than by post. To register, shareholders simply need to 
log on to www.shareview.co.uk with their shareholder reference
number and complete the simple on-screen registration process.
First-time users will need to enter certain information and choose 
a personal identification number before they are able to access
their shareholding details. 
By logging on to www.shareview.co.uk, you will be able to do all
of the following at the click of a mouse: 
• check your shareholding in Wolseley plc 24 hours a day; 
• register your e-mail and mailing preference (post or electronic)
for future shareholder mailings; 
• gain easy access to a variety of shareholder information
including indicative valuations and payment instruction details; 
• access the share dealing facility; and
• use the internet to appoint a proxy for you at general meetings
of the shareholders. 
The Company can, at shareholders’ request, send shareholders
an e-mail notification each time a new shareholder report or other
shareholder communication is put on the website. Shareholders
will then be able to read and/or download the information at 
their leisure, but will still be able to request paper copies of the
documents should they so wish. The next opportunity for us to
notify you electronically will be for the Interim Report for 2009.
Share dealing
UK-based shareholders are also offered a simple and convenient
telephone and internet share sale and purchase service by our
Registrars. Equiniti Shareview dealing is available for telephone
purchases and sales on 0871 384 2020 between 8:30am and
4:30pm, Monday to Friday and for internet purchases and sales
via www.shareview.co.uk/dealing. A postal dealing service is also
available and a form together with terms and conditions can be
obtained from Equiniti by calling 0871 384 2934. Calls to these
numbers are charged at 8 pence per minute from a BT landline.
Other telephony providers’ costs may vary.
Stock Exchange listings 
The ordinary shares of 25 pence each of the Company are listed
on the London Stock Exchange. The Company, following the
delisting of its ordinary shares from the New York Stock Exchange
in January 2008, has retained its American Depositary Receipts
(‘ADR’) as a Level I programme. These ADRs are now listed on
the premier tier of the over-the-counter market ‘OTCQX’. Further
information can be found at www.pinksheets.com or
www.otcqx.com.

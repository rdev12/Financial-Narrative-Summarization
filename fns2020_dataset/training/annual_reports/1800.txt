2013 was a challenging year for Balfour Beatty,  
with a disappointing 37% decline in earnings  
per share as the result
•	 O p e r a t i o n a l 	 i s s u e s 	 w i t h i n 	 t h e 	 U K 	 Co n s t r u c t i o n

US and UK infrastructure markets is the overriding 
priority for 2014. 
Secondly, the profitable Australian 
professional services business had 
to cope with the need to significantly 
downsize its operations, given the rapid 
collapse in local resources and mining 
related investment. Operating costs, 
including headcount, have been 
aggressively reduced. Every effort has 
been made to retain essential capabilities 
to benefit when sector reinvestment 
progressively occurs, albeit this will 
inevitably take some time.
The majority of the Parsons Brinckerhoff 
worldwide business, the US construction 
business and Support Services all 
performed broadly in line with expectations. 
The Infrastructure Investments division 
had an excellent year, successfully 
recycling capital in line with its long term 
strategy, and generating £82 million 
profits on the sale of mature PFI assets 
in the process; this outcome was ahead 
of expectation and £45 million above 
Directors’ valuation. 
 Chief Executive’s Report p4
Year-end net debt was £66 million, albeit 
the operating cash outflow of £162 million 
during the year was disappointing,  
not helped by first half issues within 
Construction Services UK. 
Board
There were a number of Board changes 
during the year, it was announced in 
January 2013 that Ian Tyler would step 
down as Chief Executive at the end of 
March 2013, and that Andrew McNaughton 
would be appointed to succeed him. 
Belinda Richards and Bill Thomas joined 
the Board as non-executive Directors 
with effect from 1 September 2013. 
In combination, they bring to the Board 
top-flight experience in change 
management and a strong business 
to business client focus honed in an 
international environment.
Two non-executive Directors retired 
from the Board during the year: Hubertus 
Krossa, following the decision to divest the 
Group’s Mainland European rail operations; 
and Mike Donovan having served eight 
years on the Board, including as chair of 
the Business Practices Committee. We 
thank both for their valued contributions.
At the end of the year, we also said 
goodbye to Robert van Cleave, CEO 
of Construction Services US and to 
Mike Peasland, previous CEO of our UK 
construction business. I would like to 
wish both all the best for their retirements 
and thank them for all their efforts within 
the business.
employees and safety
Our employees have worked tirelessly 
throughout the year to meet our clients’ 
expectations. The Board thanks them 
for their personal commitment. Despite 
overall measures of accident and injury 
levels continuing to improve, five 
employees of subcontractors lost 
their lives during the year whilst on duty. 
This is a matter of huge regret to everyone 
involved; every incident has been 
exhaustively investigated to determine 
whether changes to our processes  
or procedures can reduce future risk. 
 The way we work p38
o ngoing priorities
Despite short term earnings declines, 
the Board is proposing to hold the final 
dividend of 8.5 pence per share (2012: 
8.5 pence), resulting in an unchanged 
full-year dividend of 14.1 pence. 
It is right that recent challenges allied 
to recovery potential in our two largest 
markets will impact on our operational 
focus in 2014. The main priority is to 
recommence profitable order book growth 
in recovering US and UK infrastructure 
markets, where the Group’s largest 
businesses are based. Expansion into 
new and emerging markets will be limited 
for the immediate future. Although the 
Group’s balance sheet remains strong, 
with sources of funding now well 
diversified, improving underlying  
cash generation is also a key priority. 
Discretionary investment beyond  
the ongoing recycling of PPP capital 
proceeds will be deliberately prioritised  
to ensure that this is achieved.
s teve Marshall
Chairman
Revenue from continuing operations 
including joint ventures and associates 
increased by 2% in the year to 
£10,118 million. Underlying pre-tax profits 
of £187 million were down 32%, most of 
which occurred in the first half of the year. 
The full-year underlying EPS declined 
by 37%. The year-end order book was 
broadly flat at £13.4 billion.
Most parts of the Group delivered 
acceptable operating results in still highly 
competitive infrastructure markets; 
however the year presented two particular 
challenges. In April, it was announced 
that the UK construction business would 
deliver substantially lower profits. This 
arose from a combination of order book 
and margin contraction in both the Major 
Projects and the Regional business; but 
was not helped by a major consolidation 
and reorganisation project being 
implemented at the beginning of  
the year, with an erosion of operating 
management’s focus as a result. Since 
that time, major changes have been 
made to improve operational delivery 
and also ongoing profitable work winning 
capability, including a number of new 
divisional management appointments. 
Second half profitability has improved 
materially as a result.

r EpOr T
In 2013, challenging economic conditions and, 
well flagged, operational issues in the UK led to 
a disappointing financial performance. We have 
taken firm actions to address all these issues. 
investment in major infrastructure projects 
in the UK has resulted in fewer major 
projects being brought to the market. 
Whilst the UK economy is starting to pick 
up and will start to have a positive impact 
on parts of the construction market, we 
anticipate current conditions will continue 
into 2014.

The market in Australia has seen 
significant deterioration, with a large 
number of capital projects cancelled 
over the last 18 months. Our Australian 
Professional Services business has seen 
a corresponding deterioration in both 
volume and pricing through the year. 
In response, we have already taken strong 
and decisive steps to take cost out of the 
business; enabling a return to profitability, 
but we see the constrained market 
conditions as being likely to continue 
in 2014.
These issues have been partially offset by 
positive performance elsewhere. With the 
exception of Australia, the Professional 
Services business performed well, with 
particular strength in US transportation, 
Asia and the Middle East, where our focus 
on the transportation sector has proved 
beneficial with the award of various high 
profile contracts during the year. However, 
order book increases in the US and the 
Middle East were offset by the impact 
of Australia and minor movement in the 
UK business. 
In the US, we are seeing a quicker  
return to growth than in the UK market. 
There are more private and complex 
construction projects coming to the 
market and our order book is looking 
healthy for the future. For the first time in 
2013, the US construction business was 
larger than the UK. In Asia, our Gammon 
JV continues to perform well and we are 
seeing high volumes and a strong order 
book, particularly in Hong Kong.
Support Services has demonstrated 
resilience in the current economic 
environment and strengthened its position 
in the UK highways maintenance and 
power and gas markets with several key 
contract awards during the course of 
the year. 
Our Infrastructure Investments division 
has had an excellent year. Our strategy 
of recycling the capital invested in the 
portfolio has delivered a very favourable 
outcome during the year, and full-year 
underlying profits before tax for the 
division were £132 million. It is becoming 
clear that our investment division is core 
to connecting other areas of the business 
and we will maximise this in the future.
Last year, at our full-year results in March, 
I set out clear objectives for the year, 
aligned to our strategic objectives. In the 
short term, these were to continue with 
our focus on cost efficiencies, dispose 
of our mainland European rail businesses 
(which are underperforming and non-
strategic) and complete the strategic 
review of our UK facilities management 
business – Balfour Beatty WorkPlace. 
We have made significant progress on 
all of these.
In July, we announced the sale of 
WorkPlace to GDF Suez Energy Services 
for £155 million in cash. This sale 
represents an important step in our 
evolution as we intensify our focus 
on the creation and management of 
infrastructure assets. In addition to finding 
a good new home for the business, its 
clients and employees, this transaction 
has achieved good value and will enable 
us to allocate more resources to target 
growth in the future. 
As part of our ongoing programme of 
mainland European rail disposals; in 
March, we announced the sale of the 
Spanish business, and in December the 
sale of the Scandinavian business to 
Strukton Rail B.V. We are currently in 
discussion with a number of potential 
buyers for the German business and have 
started preliminary discussions for the 
Italian business. In Germany trading 
has been very poor which resulted in 
an underlying loss from operations  
of £26 million.

Our cost efficiency programmes remain 
on track and we have made significant 
progress in this area this year. During 
2013, we centralised much of our 
common expenditure and low value UK 
buying. We made ongoing savings of 
£6 million per year in the US by relocating 
many support service staff from Parsons 
Brinckerhoff’s New York headquarters to 
Lancaster, Pennsylvania and we closed 
our UK defined benefit pension scheme 
to current members. 
 Read more on p16
We are committed to becoming 
a leading international 
infrastructure company, acclaimed 
for the quality of service that we 
deliver to our clients. We create 
critical assets which support 
our clients in providing services 
to the communities which 
they serve. 
As I have highlighted over the course 
of the year, market conditions in the 
countries in which we operate have had a 
strong influence on our performance. We 
have seen challenging markets in the UK 
and Australia and some emerging markets 
have been tougher. This combined with 
our own operational issues has led to poor 
performance in those specific markets. 
In 2013, our leadership team has 
responded with decisive actions that have 
reduced the impact of these conditions 
and stabilised the business for the future, 
whilst still remaining focused on our mid 
to long term growth opportunities.
At the end of April, we reported that  
the UK construction business had been 
impacted by a £50 million profit shortfall. 
The UK construction business has 
stabilised in the second half as the 
management team, led by the newly 
appointed Construction Services UK CEO 
– Nick Pollard – has focused on improving 
operational performance which was the 
primary cause. As a result, we have seen 
our Regional business strengthen through 
the same period, but the current lack of 
balfourbeatty.com/ar2013 Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2013
4 n ear term focus
As 2013 demonstrated, our Infrastructure 
Investments business was a key lever 
to connecting our operating divisions. 
When we work in this way we generate 
incremental revenue across the Group  
and this is something we will absolutely 
focus on moving forward.
As we head into 2014, we are seeing 
strong growth in some markets, for 
example the Middle East and Asia. Also 
there are some signs that our largest and 
most mature markets, such as US building 
and parts of the UK, are returning to 
growth. It is here that we will focus 
our efforts and maximise the benefits 
available from the cyclical recovery.
Over the next few years, as the strength 
of the Group continues to grow, we will 
focus on expanding our local presence in 
our mature home markets and also look 
to develop our next generation of home 
markets such as Australia, Canada and  
the Middle East where, and when, market 
trends support our business model. 
 Read more on p12
o ur mid to long term growth plans
My longer term goals for the Group, as 
outlined in March 2013, are to leverage 
three key strengths; local presence, asset 
knowledge and our skills as an investor 
and developer.
As I look to the future, we will continue 
to build on these differentiators. We look 
to the effectiveness and reliability of our 
processes, the lifecycle and technical 
expertise that we have built on years of 
experience operating across the world, 
together with the strength of our people, 
and of course the great relationships we 
have with our clients, to set us apart from 
the competition. We will look to innovate 
and target continuous improvement to 
make a difference to our projects. It is 
in these areas that I expect to place 
significant emphasis over the coming 
years. Creating leading local presence, 
harnessing the knowledge we have of 
the assets we create and manage and 
combining our skills as investor and 
developer are critical in enabling this.
It is clear the near term will remain 
challenging and our focus must remain 
on being poised to benefit from a return 
to growth in our home markets. However, 
we continue to lead the market in creating 
innovative solutions for complex projects 
and I am committed to a highly disciplined 
approach to increasing the value of our 
business and a continued review of the 
structure and capabilities of the Group 
as a whole.
I am equally applying this sense of 
discipline to our key processes. In 2013, 
we set out the next phase of our road 
map to Zero Harm. Despite this, as Steve 
Marshall has noted, five people tragically 
lost their lives during the year. No such 
loss is acceptable and I will remain 
relentless in my drive across the whole 
organisation for the elimination of risk 
to personal harm.
It is not just my commitment but that 
of the whole team at Balfour Beatty. 
Despite the challenges that we have faced 
in 2013 the energy and drive of business 
leaders faced with difficult choices and 
the dedication of the whole Balfour Beatty 
family to serving our clients and 
commitments is inspirational.
Effective infrastructure is the heart of 
any community and everyone at Balfour 
Beatty plays a part. It is a team that is 
growing in strength and capability to 
serve. I therefore have no doubt that with 
this team and the actions taken in 2013, 
I can look to the future with confidence.

Cash generation
World-class processes generate profit and surplus cash flow. 
Construction operations, in particular, create surplus cash flow as 
they grow, accelerated during upswings in the construction cycle.
Investment
Cash flow from construction operations deployed in:
•	 Investment (including acquisitions) in strengthening  
and developing our business
•	 PPP/infrastructure investment projects – which are delivered 
(designed, constructed, managed and maintained) internally.
Virtuous circle enhances returns
•	 The combination of our PPP/infrastructure investment  
and delivery businesses is virtuously self-reinforcing:
 − enhancing the success rate and returns of the 
investment business
 − enhancing the margins and cash flow of the 
delivery operations.
•	 In addition, the combination of our construction and PPP/ 
Infrastructure Investments businesses gives us resilience  
as a Group throughout the cycle: 
 − cash deployed in investments generates further returns

.
projects have been slow to come to 
market. A continued squeeze on margins 
has put pressure on contractors and, 
most notably, the supply chain. The US, 
having gone into the downturn earlier, 
appears to be recovering sooner 
although some uncertainty around 
public spending remains. 
Nevertheless, as these economies return 
to growth, we believe the UK and the US 
will present significant opportunities in 
the short to medium term. In the UK there 
are now clear signs of life. The Markit 
Purchasing Manager’s Index, a leading 
indicator, was up 20% on 2012
2
 in the final 
five months of the year and forecasters 
are now, on average, expecting the 
construction market to grow by 7% pa 
to 2016
3
. We are particularly optimistic 
about sectors such as commercial 
building, student accommodation and 
defence. The infrastructure market has 
been supported in recent years by already 
awarded contracts, such as Crossrail. 
The pipeline of new major projects 
coming to market in 2014 is likely to be 
slow, although this should improve in  
the longer term. Investment for smaller 
infrastructure projects on the other hand 
has been quicker to flow through, which 
supports an improved outlook for our 
regional civil engineering business.
The US recovery appears to be further 
along, albeit from a low base. Forecasters 
are now expecting 6% pa nominal growth 
to 2017. The Dodge Momentum Index,  
a 12 month leading indicator for non-
residential construction, has been 
improving throughout 2013. As confidence 
picks up, we will be seeking to take 
advantage of opportunities in, for example, 
multifamily accommodation, mission 
critical buildings such as data centres, 
green retrofit and student accommodation. 
Investment in infrastructure remains 
steady and there is a continued need for 
new or replacement transport, power and 
water assets in the medium to long term.
emerging markets
Outside of the UK and the US, 
opportunities will increase in emerging 
markets over the long term as their 
proportion of the global construction 
market grows. Populations in these regions 
are becoming more urbanised (from 50% 
in 2013 to 70% by 2050
4
) which increases 
infrastructure requirements. Non-OECD 
markets are forecast to rise from 55% of 
global infrastructure spending in 2013 to 
70% in 2025
5
. GDP growth will certainly 
outperform in the medium term, with 
forecasts expecting +3% pa over mature 
markets to 2018
6
. 
In advanced economies many key  
assets, such as power transmission  
lines, highways and rail networks are 
reaching the age at which they need to  
be upgraded or replaced. Additionally, 
environmental targets are driving the 
creation of new assets and improvement 
of existing assets in sectors such as  
water and power generation. In emerging 
markets, urbanisation and economic 
growth continue apace. As economies 
and cities grow, so does the need for 
efficient transport, reliable power and  
an accessible, safe water supply.  
Almost without exception, infrastructure 
investment is a key priority on  
government agendas worldwide.
o ur core markets
Despite these positive long term drivers, 
our core UK and US construction markets 
have been constrained over the last two 
years. Construction lags behind the market 
cycle, so even as economic growth has 
begun to strengthen, the flow through 
to new orders takes time. Construction 
volumes in the UK and the US remain 
down on the highs achieved before the 
global financial crisis and in both markets, 
margins remain under pressure.
In the UK, overall volumes have been  
low and have taken longer than expected 
to improve. New major infrastructure

We see this particularly in the Middle East 
and South East Asia, where existing 
forecasts are promising. We will access 
this growth via our existing operations 
in these regions.
Resource-rich economies
For resource-rich economies the short 
term outlook is more mixed. Global 
commodity prices have fallen and with 
it so have miners’ capital expenditure 
programmes. In Australia, which had 
benefited from a mining investment boom 
over the last decade, the impact has been 
significant. After an extended period of 
unprecedented growth, mining-related 
construction is now forecast to shrink  
over 2013–2014
7
. The impact of this is felt 
across the economy, as tax receipts and 
consumer spending decline. Growth in 
other infrastructure construction such 
as roads, railways and power, fell by  
50% in nominal terms in 2011–2012
8
.
Despite this, there are initial signals that 
an Australian recovery may not be far 
away. Following the general election, 
public investment has started to pick up 
and the new government has explicitly 
made infrastructure investment a priority 
as a catalyst for economic growth. With 
the AIG Performance of Construction 
Index now positive for the first time since 
2011
9
, as well as the IMF forecasting  
>5% nominal GDP growth to 2018
6
,  
there is reason for cautious optimism.
Canada, another resource-rich economy, 
has fared better. The total applicable 
construction market has grown by an 
annualised rate of 11% from 2009 to 2013, 
driven by resources and infrastructure 
investment. Although future growth is 
unlikely to match these levels, forecasters 
are still expecting annual growth of more 
than 4% by 2018
10
. Confidence is being 
maintained and we anticipate the overall 
economy to continue to show solid, stable 
growth in the medium term.
sector outlook
We define economic infrastructure as 
transport, power and water. In all three 
sectors, the fundamental growth drivers 
remain strong. Transport is dominated  
by road and rail investment. Power will 
continue to be supported by population 
growth, ageing assets and the sustainability 
agenda. Water will be driven by the need 
to harness limited water resources in 
many parts of the world, flood defences 
and other marine programmes.
In mining and resources, commodity price 
reductions have impacted investment in 
the short term, but the long term drivers 
remain. Some sectors, such as shale gas, 
appear to be entering a boom.
Finally, the building sector, which is 
traditionally the hardest hit sector during 
recessionary periods, is now entering 
a cyclical upswing in the US, and we 
expect the UK to follow.
Procurement
In our core markets, and increasingly 
elsewhere, we are continuing to see 
a trend towards more sophisticated 
methods of project procurement and 
alternative delivery contracts becoming 
very much the mainstream for larger  
and more complex projects.
PPP is becoming increasingly popular in 
the US, is returning to favour in Australia 
and remains commonplace in the UK and 
Canada. In the UK, procurement through 
the new private finance framework (PF2) 
is now beginning to take place, particularly 
in education, albeit slowly. There is also 
an increase in other PPP development 
opportunities, such as waste-to-energy 
and offshore transmission owner 
(OFTO) projects. 
We are also seeing the increased use of 
design-build in many sectors, particularly 
infrastructure, and it is now used for 
approximately 40% of non-residential 
projects in the US

s trategic objective 
1
we aim to strengthen our business. We 
have made good progress in four: Canada, 
the Middle East, South Africa and South 
East Asia. Our Australian business has 
been hampered by the mining downturn 
which we have taken prompt measures 
to address. Although it may take time for 
activity in the market to return to historic 
levels, we believe Australia still presents 
good opportunities for the Group in 
the medium term. In the other two 
geographies of India and Brazil, we are 
reducing our efforts as we believe we 
will generate better growth returns in 
other markets in the short to mid term.
t arget sectors
We continue to target key infrastructure 
sectors and are making good progress 
in sectors where we can leverage global 
knowledge into our local businesses, 
such as transport, power and water. Our 
progress in mining has been hampered 
by project delays and cancellations, 
particularly in Australia where growth 
has come to an abrupt halt, but we believe 
the long term drivers remain sound.
Complex building is also likely to feature 
heavily in the UK and US in the next few 
years. We will particularly target niche, 
higher margin areas such as student 
accommodation and defence in the UK 
and US and mission critical installations 
such as data centres in the US.
In both building and infrastructure,  
PPP and other investment procurement 
models, remain a key component of  
our strategy. We will continue to target 
any opportunities where we can  
leverage our combined construction  
and investment capability.
leveraging our world-class processes, 
sector expertise and innovation on a 
national basis. This is allowing all of 
our business to access growth sectors 
such as commercial multifamily housing, 
corporate facilities, mission critical 
installations and student accommodation. 
In infrastructure, where we have a  
strong platform in professional services, 
we have significant headroom to develop 
our downstream construction activities, 
which continue to grow. 
International growth
Outside our core markets, we continue 
to develop the business. Last year, 
we identified seven geographies where 
Our strategy is to develop our 
core UK and US businesses  
and to strengthen our presence 
in other chosen geographies  
and sectors in the longer term. In 
2013, this objective was slowed to 
enable us to focus on addressing 
operational issues in our business 
and capitalise on increasing 
opportunities in the UK and US.
Why is this important?
As the UK and US markets return to 
growth and we begin to benefit from the 
actions we have taken to reshape some 
of our core businesses in these markets, 
we are well placed to capitalise on the 
opportunities they present. In the longer 
term, it remains important to strengthen 
our business outside our current core 
in order to expand our growth horizons 
and position the business for long 
term success.
What are we doing?
Core markets – UK and US
In response to current market conditions 
and some operational issues, our core  
UK construction business has been a key 
focus for management this year. Going 
forward, our position in the UK means  
we are well placed to take advantage of 
the impending recovery. Although it will 
take time to flow through to workload, 
early signs of activity are emerging in the 
regional construction and civil engineering 
business. We are targeting particular 
opportunities in commercial building, 
student accommodation, defence and 
the regional markets, where we draw 
on multiple parts of our UK business to 
satisfy client requirements. In the major 
projects business, significant new projects 
have been slow to come to market and 
we do not expect this trend to improve 
in 2014.
In the US, where the market is 
gradually improving, we see significant 
opportunities for our business over the 
next few years. In complex buildings, 
where we are a top-tier player, we are

During 2013 we had some notable 
successes in highways maintenance, 
power transmission and student housing. 
Student accommodation is an example of 
a growing sector, with around US$1 billion 
of new projects coming to market in the 
US and a pipeline of around £1 billion of 
new projects anticipated in the UK over 
the next few years. We are establishing 
a significant presence in both markets, 
successfully transferring skills from work 
on social infrastructure projects and 
military housing. During the course of 
2013 we announced nine contract awards 
in this market on both sides of the Atlantic.
the process, experts from the UK moved 
to Singapore to support the project on the 
ground and reduce project risk.
Whilst some clients purchase more than 
one service from us, many only use one at 
any given time. We have therefore tailored 
our offer and provide services alone or in 
combination. For those that are looking 
for support in more than one area, we 
have the ability to provide this and share 
knowledge and connect teams to work 
alongside our clients seamlessly.
We have expert knowledge in certain 
sectors including transport, power and 
water. By understanding the specific 
challenges and needs of a defined 
market sector, we are able to create and 
maintain infrastructure that is technically 
sound and delivered with innovative 
and sustainable techniques. 
We engage with our clients to 
gain a better understanding of 
their objectives and then use 
our experience across all areas 
of infrastructure development 
to be able to deliver on these 
objectives better. In 2013, our 
focus in this area has remained.
Why is this important?
Detailed engagement with our clients 
allows us to better understand their 
strategic needs. Clients have their own 
objectives – be it better transport links, 
reliable and sustainable energy supply, 
high quality education or world class 
healthcare. We aim to work in partnership 
with our clients to ensure their strategic 
objectives are met through the 
infrastructure we finance, design, 
construct and maintain. In turn, 
transferring and sharing our knowledge 
and expertise across the business allows 
us to create and maintain infrastructure 
to a higher quality, at a lower price, 
faster and safer, to ensure our clients 
meet their goals.
For example, in May 2013, we commenced 
work to remove a pivotal road/rail crossing 
in Melbourne and lower the existing rail 
line below the road, reducing congestion, 
improving safety and cutting journey 
times for commuters.
The majority of our clients operate on a 
national basis and typically require support 
from us in specific areas of the asset 
lifecycle. For them, we are able to provide 
local, dedicated teams who can draw 
on the expertise of all of our business to 
avoid duplication of effort and mistakes 
and ensure solutions are fit for purpose 
and best in class.
For example, in the later stages of 2013, 
we were awarded a contract with SMRT 
Trains in Singapore to change the sleepers 
from timber to concrete, as part of the 
renewal and upgrade of the existing 
North–South Line. The Asia team worked 
closely with the UK rail team to share 
knowledge and equipment. As part of

system replacement on the North-South Line.
Our collaborative approach and the sharing of the knowledge

scheme for the majority of members 
in August 2013. The closure of the DB 
pension scheme attracted a one-off 
non-cash cost of £53 million; however 
it will reduce our cash contribution and 
profit and loss charge by £12 million pa 
in the future.
Current programmes
In November, we signed a contract with 
Verizon for a single consolidated global 
IT network. This will deliver lower costs 
and improved connectivity, enhancing 
knowledge sharing across the business. 
The service will be rolled out over a period 
of 18 months.
During the year, we also signed a five-year 
contract with Fujitsu for the provision 
of a standardised, centralised and 
commoditised IT service to our UK 
operations. We will complete the rollout 
of this service in 2015. 
We continued the rollout of Oracle R12 
within our UK operations. Its deployment 
in Construction Services UK has been 
delayed by the restructuring of that 
business; however, this work will be 
undertaken during 2014. Support Services 
will follow in 2015.
In this report last year, we confirmed  
our intention to investigate the benefits  
of managing our businesses at a country 
level. Having satisfied ourselves that there 
are advantages in terms of both client 
service and overhead reduction from 
this approach, we are now running our 
businesses under one leadership team in 
Australia/New Zealand, the Middle East 
and South Africa. These are regions 
where Parsons Brinckerhoff and our 
Support Services and Construction 
businesses work together in closest 
proximity and, consequently, the benefits 
to our clients of an integrated approach 
are greatest. However, due to the 
imperative to focus on maximising 
growth opportunities in the short term, 
we are not looking to move to a country 
model in the UK and US.
Other programmes completed in 2013
During 2013, at a one-off cost of 
£10 million, we relocated 170 roles 
in shared service functions (including 
finance, IT, HR and communications) 
from Parsons Brinckerhoff’s New York 
headquarters to Lancaster, Pennsylvania. 
This will deliver ongoing savings of 
£6 million per annum through staff 
rationalisation and lower lease payments. 
Following an extensive consultation with 
employees, we ceased future accrual 
in the UK defined benefit (DB) pension 
Clearly, given the profit issues 
within the UK construction 
business in the first half and 
economic challenges elsewhere, 
this became even more 
important in 2013. Through the 
year, we continued to focus on 
generating efficiencies across 
all operations and back office 
support functions to ensure 
we operate as efficiently and 
as profitably as possible.
Why is operational efficiency important?
Our clients’ budgets are under pressure. 
Their expectation is that our scale will 
allow us to create and share best practice 
across our operating units, have 
consolidated back office functions 
and apply consistent standards to our 
processes. This will allow us to deliver 
services reliably, informed by 
organisational learning and supported  
by a low cost and efficient overhead. 
What progress have we made?
The Shared Service Centre (SSC)
We have improved our cost effectiveness 
in the UK with the creation of the SSC. 
This has enabled us to centralise most 
of our common procurement, HR and 
accounting processes and consolidate 
our supply chain and leverage our buying 
power. We have also completed the 
transfer of much of our UK accounting, 
HR administrative and IT services into 
the SSC.
By the end of 2011, the activity at the SSC 
accounted for 50% of our UK transactions 
and about £300 million of indirect spend 
was procured through specialists at the 
SSC. By the end of 2013, this is nearer 
90% of our UK transactions and about 
£370 million of indirect spend.
The success of this initiative informed our 
thinking on other initiatives including the 
Parsons Brinckerhoff Lancaster relocation.

that the messages are embedded 
throughout the organisation, which we 
do through our extensive programme  
of ethical compliance, and we work with 
the middle tier of employees to ensure 
they too are aware of their responsibilities 
in this area. These programmes focus  
on the importance of building a good 
corporate reputation and on the difference 
between what is lawful and what is right. 
In 2013, we have sought to maintain our 
commitment to development, career 
progression and talent management 
across our workforce. In the current 
economic environment, there has 
inevitably been the need to cut budgets 
and costs which has impacted areas, such 
as training. However, we have maintained 
our focus in many areas including 
supporting graduates and apprentices  
as they enter the workforce. We have 
recently joined other UK companies and 
become members of the 5% Club to 
increase the number of apprentices  
and graduates in our workforce. 
 The way we work – people p40
It is essential that we develop lasting, 
collaborative relationships with our supply 
chain partners. Two thirds of our revenue 
is reinvested in our supply chain and as 
such our own performance is underpinned 
by theirs. In Construction Services UK, 
55% of our spend went directly to SME’s 
and 41% went to suppliers within a 50km 
radius of our project sites, supporting local 
communities. We are a signatory of the 
UK Government’s Prompt Payment 
Code and in September, we launched 
a voluntary finance scheme to enable 
our UK supply chain to receive payment 
faster than before.

everyone involved with the Group. 
 The way we work – health and safety p38
We are acknowledged as leading the  
way from an environmental performance 
perspective and this is providing benefit in 
terms of work winning, client engagement, 
employee engagement and supporting 
the communities we work within.
There is a growing emergence of 
increasingly aggressive enforcement of 
anticorruption legislation and, with our 
global reach, it is vital we continue to 
focus on achieving a high degree of ethical 
rigour in everything we do. Our aim is to 
comply with, if not exceed, the strict legal 
requirements of the countries where 
we operate. 
Our focus is to ensure our business is run 
ethically, not just to comply with the law. 
We achieve this, in part, by ensuring our 
senior leadership are part of ‘Tone at the 
Top’ – a key element of our effective 
compliance programme, where our 
leaders lead by example. We also ensure 
As an international leader in 
infrastructure services and as 
part of our focus on securing 
a sustainable, long term future 
for the Group, we understand 
the need to provide a legacy 
within the communities in which 
we serve. To achieve this, we 
need to improve continuously in 
areas such as safety, business 
ethics, talent management, 
environmental performance 
and community engagement. 
In 2013, we continued our focus 
in these areas, to maintain our 
market position and enhance 
our reputation.
Why is this important?
Our reputation is crucial to winning new 
business, attracting and retaining the 
best people and building effective client 
partnerships. To be seen as a true leader 
in our field, we need to build and protect 
a reputation for leadership in values 
and behaviour. 
In 2013, we launched our Roadmap that 
charts Health and Safety maturity from 
one of minimum expectations in 2013 
to excellence by 2017. Alongside the 
Roadmap we introduced our Global  
Safety Principles, a set of rules that  
define the way we work. Throughout  
the year we have focused on a relentless 
determination to reduce the risk of harm.

Risk description
We work on significant, complex and potentially hazardous 
projects which require continuous monitoring and 
management of health and safety risks.
What impact it might have
Failure to manage these risks could result in harm to, or even 
death of, employees, subcontractor staff and members of the  
public, as well as potential criminal prosecutions, debarment  
and reputational damage.
how the risk may manifest itself
Some common themes where health and safety risks have 
arisen are recognised and communicated, including:
•	 Risk of poor risk identification/assessment
•	 Risk of not having processes that promote risk elimination  
or mitigation
•	 Failure to deliver management leadership/’Tone at the Top’
•	 Management of subcontractors
•	 Not briefing people properly before setting them to work
•	 Failure to follow procedures
•	 Debarment for safety failures.
how it is mitigated
We have detailed health and safety policies and procedures 
to minimise such risks. These are reviewed and monitored by 
management and external verification bodies. Each division has 
experienced health and safety professionals who provide advice 
and support and undertake regular reviews.
A Safety Executive committee meets regularly throughout the year 
to develop a consistent approach to health and safety best practice.
In 2013, in response to an unacceptable level of fatalities, serious 
injuries and near misses, we initiated work on implementing our 
Global Safety Principles.

eCono MIC en VIRon Ment Increased Risk 
Risk description
The continued or residual effects of the global economic 
downturn, or other national or market trends or new 
developments in infrastructure expenditure or procurement, 
may cause our clients to postpone, reduce or change existing 
or future projects, which may impact our strategy, business 
model, revenue or profitability in the short or medium term.
What impact it might have
Any significant changes in the level or timing of client spending 
or investment plans could adversely impact our future order book. 
Such changes could arise from changes in government policy or 
clients’ failure to secure financing for future projects or for future 
stages of existing projects.
Failure of a client, including any government or public sector body, 
could result in non collection of amounts owed.
how the risk may manifest itself
We may fail to anticipate or assess national or market events 
and developments, their potential negative impact, or the 
opportunities they present. Such events or developments, 
whether or not anticipated or correctly assessed, could lead to:
•	 Cash pressures for clients and suppliers
•	 Increased competition (eg in the UK from other  
EU countries)
•	 Supply chain failure risk
•	 Reduced revenue or pressure on margins.
These risks may also be triggered or exacerbated by the need, 
actual or perceived, to pursue work in a declining market.
how it is mitigated
The Group’s strategy to focus on the more resilient and stable 
infrastructure markets will help mitigate this risk. The effect of 
spending changes in any one market is mitigated by our broad 
exposure to infrastructure markets across the globe and the  
continued need for infrastructure spending. We also mitigate the 
effects of such market conditions by continuing to adapt our business 
model, overheads and efficiency.
The financial solvency and strength of counterparties is always 
considered before contracts are signed and is a specific focus in  
the current economic climate. During the life of a contract such 
assessments are updated and reviewed whenever possible. We also 
seek to ensure that we are not over reliant on any one counterparty.
prINCI pal rIS kS
Operating in many different business environments and territories inevitably entails 
risks and uncertainties that are not necessarily within our control. Although we 
cannot eliminate such risks and uncertainties completely, we have established risk 
management and internal control systems and procedures to manage their impact. 
The Board believes that our risk management and internal control systems will  
help us to identify such risks and respond in a timely manner.
The principal risks that could adversely impact our profitability and ability  
to achieve our strategic objectives are set out below. 
balfourbeatty.com/ar2013 Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2013
20 BIDDIn G Increased Risk 
 
Risk description
Through our different divisions we seek to win profitable  
work through a large number of bids. In some cases we bid  
in joint venture with carefully selected partners, often to help 
us manage or spread risks, especially where we want to 
augment our expertise or knowledge of the relevant market.
We also invest in PPP and infrastructure investments,  
where success depends on a number of assumptions made, 
at the time of investment, on future revenues and costs.
Our success depends on our ability to identify, price and 
execute the right volume and quality of bids to maintain a 
profitable, sustainable order book. This in turn requires that 
we have a competitive business model and overheads.
What impact it might have
Failure to estimate accurately the risks, costs, time to complete, 
impact of inflation and contractual terms and how best to manage 
them could diminish profitability of contracts.
In the event of disagreement with, failure of, or poor delivery 
performance by a joint venture partner, we could face financial 
and reputational risks.
If any of the assumptions behind investment decisions prove  
incorrect, the profitability of those investments could be reduced.
how the risk may manifest itself
•	 Unrealistic programme
•	 Incorrect pricing
•	 Overambitious budgets
•	 Bidding at too low a margin
•	 Poor partner selection
•	 Client credit and late payment risks
•	 Partner and subcontractor performance and credit risks
•	 Inability to make profit from non-PPP investments and  
other new work types
•	 Failure to ensure our overhead structure remains competitive.
how it is mitigated
All bids are subject to rigorous estimating and tendering processes 
within a defined framework.
We have defined delegated authority levels for approving all tenders 
and infrastructure investments. All major and significant contracts 
above those authority levels are subject to Group review and approval 
by the Group Tender and Investment Committee (GTIC). 
 Governance p61
We conduct reviews following successful and unsuccessful tenders  
to ensure we learn from them and apply those lessons  
to future tenders.
Before entering into a joint venture agreement we have procedures  
for reviewing the relevant skills, experience, resources and values  
of joint venture partners to understand how they complement ours. 
Investment appraisals are performed and reviewed by experienced 
professionals. We analyse the risks associated with revenues and costs 
and, where appropriate, establish contractual and other risk mitigations.
PRoje Ct eXeCut Ion No change to Risk  
Risk description
We work on complex design, engineering, construction and 
asset management projects. If we fail to deliver them on time, 
to clients’ requirements, and in accordance with our own cost 
assumptions and reporting, we face the risk of financial loss, 
claims and reputational damage.
Successful delivery of many of these projects depends on the 
successful implementation and maintenance of a range of 
operational and commercial procedures and controls, backed  
up by appropriate training, clear accountabilities and oversight, 
accurate, realistic and timely reporting, and regular audit and 
review. It also depends on the combined availability and 
effective management of sub contractors and other service 
providers. Finally, it relies upon many complex, technical and 
commercial judgements and estimates regarding cost, value, 
progress and likely or practicable outcomes.
What impact it might have
Failure to manage or deliver against contracted client requirements  
on time and to an appropriate quality could result in issues such 
as contract disputes, rejected claims, design issues, cost overruns or 
failure to achieve client savings – which in turn harm our profitability 
and reputation.
Execution failure on a high profile project could result in significant 
reputational damage and costs.
how the risk may manifest itself
•	 Unrealistic progress assessments
•	 Overestimating our ability to recover claims within the 
timeframe or in the amounts estimated
•	 Incomplete visibility and appreciation of scale of  
commercial judgements
•	 Inaccurate, incomplete cost and value data or failure to 
analyse and report correctly, which could arise due to poor 
training, lack of supervision, lack of accountability or a 
project manager’s or project team member’s fear of 
reporting bad news
•	 Inadequate experienced, independent challenge from support 
functions such as commercial, operations, finance etc.
how it is mitigated
Each business area has defined operating procedures to address  
the risks inherent in project delivery. In addition, the Group risk 
management framework aids identification and quantification 
of specific risks on projects and the mitigating actions required. 
Projects are subject to management, commercial function and internal 
audit review at all levels to monitor progress and to review steps  
put in place to address specific risks identified on those projects.  
We also have public indemnity cover to provide further safeguards.
We monitor the performance of joint ventures, joint venture partners, 
sub contractors and suppliers throughout the life of a project.

Risk description
We are heavily reliant on our supply chain partners for 
successful operational delivery, which means we are also 
exposed to a variety of risks in the supply chain, including 
financial, technical, quality, safety and ethics.
What impact it might have
Failure of a subcontractor or supplier would result in the Group having 
to find a replacement or undertaking the task itself. This could result 
in delays and additional costs.
We will be commercially as well as reputationally responsible  
for performance shortcomings by suppliers and subcontractors, 
whether in terms of quality, safety, technical or ethical standards.
Mistreatment of suppliers, subcontractors and their staff by us, or 
poor ethical standards in the supply chain, could lead to significant 
reputational harm for us.
how the risk may manifest itself
•	 Supply chain failure risk, exacerbated during, and  
when emerging from, tough economic conditions
•	 A subcontractor’s failure to perform to an appropriate 
standard and quality, which could cause project delays, 
reducing our ability to meet contractual commitments  
and harming our reputation
•	 Supply chain operating to lower standards  
(safety, ethics, quality, timber, child labour, forced labour)
•	 Failure to deliver targeted UK procurement savings
•	 Ethical treatment of the supply chain.
how it is mitigated
We aim to develop long term relationships with key subcontractors, 
working closely with them to understand their operations. We develop 
contingency plans to address subcontractor failure, and also obtain 
project retentions, bonds and/or letters of credit from subcontractors, 
where appropriate to mitigate the impact of any insolvency.
We aim to work as much as possible with preferred suppliers and 
subcontractors who undergo rigorous, risk-based prequalification 
processes and share our values. We aim to avoid becoming over  
reliant on any one supplier or subcontractor.

Risk description
Our inability to recruit and retain the best management  
and employees who have the appropriate competencies  
and also share our values and behaviours may hamper our 
growth prospects.
What impact it might have
Failure to recruit and retain appropriately skilled people could harm  
our ability to win or perform specific contracts and grow our business.
how the risk may manifest itself
•	 Failure to attract and retain skilled staff
•	 Distraction and impact on morale of change programmes
•	 Inability to successfully promote the right people through 
succession planning
•	 Commercial and project management quality/performance
•	 New staff unfamiliar with culture and procedures
•	 Lack of a diverse workforce
•	 Bullying and harassment
•	 Loss of former staff with traditional bidding and  
execution skills
•	 Staff dissatisfaction and loss of loyalty/engagement  
caused by termination of defined benefit pension plan.
how it is mitigated
We measure all potential recruits for key roles in the organisation 
against a competency and leadership framework. Divisions undertake 
organisation and people reviews to review the roles, competencies, 
performance and potential of personnel. We have a well-developed 
succession planning process to identify and develop high potential 
personnel to fill key roles. These plans are reviewed regularly and 
discussed at all levels within the organisation and by the Board.  
We have appropriate remuneration and incentive packages to help  
us attract and retain key employees.

Risk description
We operate in various markets that may present business 
conduct-related risks involving, for example, fraud, bribery or 
corruption, whether by our own staff or via third parties such 
as partners or subcontractors. Those risks are higher in some 
countries and markets than others but cannot be ignored  
or underestimated even in low risk countries.
What impact it might have
Failure by the Group, our employees and third parties acting on our 
behalf or in partnership with us to observe the highest standards of 
integrity and conduct could result in civil and/or criminal penalties, 
debarment and reputational damage.
 The way we work p39
how the risk may manifest itself
•	 Corruption
•	 Bribery
•	 Fraud/false claims
•	 Fair competition
•	 Human rights abuses, such as child and other labour 
standards generally, illegal workers and human trafficking
•	 Unethical treatment of and by the supply chain
•	 Other emerging ethical risks
•	 Risk of ethics and values being compromised when  
times are tough, not just in high risk markets.
how it is mitigated
Throughout the Group we take a rigorous approach to assessing  
and addressing corruption risks. We have a variety of programmes  
to promote compliance with our Code of Conduct published online  
and in areas such as competition and false claims fraud. Each  
business area has a compliance officer responsible for the application 
and monitoring of these programmes.
The risk of business conduct/compliance breaches by third parties 
with whom we work is harder to control, but we have a range of risk 
assessment, due diligence and procurement controls that are designed 
to identify and minimise such risks. We work with very few agents,  
all of whom undergo a rigorous due diligence and approval process.

Risk description
We operate in diverse territories and our businesses are 
subject to a variety of complex, demanding and evolving 
legal, tax and regulatory requirements.
What impact it might have
A breach of local laws and regulations could lead to legal proceedings, 
investigations or disputes resulting in business disruption ranging from 
additional project costs to potential debarment and reputational damage.
Increasingly, businesses are the target of cyber crime, which can  
result in loss of confidential, personal or commercial data, disruption  
to operations and associated costs. Sometimes we may be the target 
of state-sponsored cyber activities because of who our clients are, 
rather than because our business is a particular target.
how the risk may manifest itself
•	 Data protection and privacy
•	 Information security lapse
•	 Cyber crime
•	 Government/regulatory enquiry and enforcement actions
•	 Local procurement laws
•	 Debarment or blacklisting.
how it is mitigated
We monitor and respond to legal and regulatory developments in  
the territories where we operate. We consider the local legal and 
regulatory framework as part of any Group decision to conduct 
business in a new country.
We have data protection and information security programmes across 
the Group, and cyber crime and other information security risks are

Risk description
In pursuit of our strategic objectives, we may seek to enter 
new territories, markets or sectors and continue to make 
acquisitions. Although this results from a careful and 
deliberate balancing of opportunity and risk, it has the 
potential to expose the Group to risks that it may not have 
encountered before or does not fully understand.
What impact it might have
Failure to identify, understand and evaluate the risks of conducting 
business in a new territory, market or sector could lead to significant 
financial loss and reputational damage.
Failure to recognise the expected benefits from acquisitions and to 
integrate acquired businesses successfully into the Group’s processes 
could result in an adverse impact on our strategic objectives, future 
prospects, financial condition and profitability.

•	 Political, security, safety and ethical risks, as well as the  
risk that economic, market and other risks mentioned 
elsewhere and the means of mitigating them are less

•	 Unethical past practice
•	 Unaccounted for liabilities eg tax.
how it is mitigated
New geographies
As part of the decision making process before entering a new territory, 
we undertake a detailed country and sector risk assessment. This  
will consider and assess the prevailing economic, political, regulatory, 
ethical, health, safety and sustainability conditions to ensure that  
we can operate there in line with our own values and standards.
Acquisitions and partnerships
We undertake detailed due diligence on all potential acquisitions and 
partnerships (such as joint ventures and consortia) to ensure that all 
aspects of their business align with ours. In many cases, we have 
worked with these businesses before. In addition, we prepare  
valuation models on all potential acquisitions, drawing on both internal 
and external resources. Due diligence includes an assessment of  
our ability to integrate the acquired businesses successfully into  
the Group. When a business is acquired, we actively work with it  
to ensure the business is successfully assimilated into the Group  
and its internal control framework.
sust AIn ABILIty Increased Risk 
Risk description
Through our activities we can impact either positively  
or adversely the world in which we operate and the 
communities with which we come into contact.
What impact it might have
Failure to address these risks and to execute projects sustainably 
could result in significant potential liabilities, reputational damage  
and inability to win future work.
how the risk may manifest itself
•	 Environmental incident
•	 Inaccurate greenhouse gas data may mean we are 
unaware of our actual impact
•	 Inaccurate carbon reduction commitment data and other 
data in sustainability reporting may leave us exposed to 
unacceptable damage, fines etc
•	 Unethical/unsustainable sourcing  
(eg timber, forced labour, child labour)
•	 Insufficient management support and monitoring  
to achieve our agreed KPIs in this area.
how it is mitigated
Our sustainability strategy covers our operations until 2020 in terms 
of profitable markets, healthy communities and environmental  
limits. Sustainability issues such as climate change adaptation are 
considered in risk management activities at divisional as well as 
project level.
 The way we work p41 to p42
We also face significant risks and uncertainties that are common to many companies – including financial and treasury risks,  
the management of pension liabilities, information security risks, business continuity and crisis management and hazard risks.

Whilst we have made good progress on 
restructuring and focusing our business, 
our overall financial performance for the 
year was disappointing.
Underlying profit from operations 
decreased to £203 million (2012: 
£284 million). Support Services and 
Infrastructure Investments delivered 
strong operating results, including the 
benefit of £82 million (2012: £52 million) 
of gains from PPP disposals after 
recycling £21 million (2012: £48 million)  
of gains from other comprehensive 
income to the income statement. 
However, overall profits reduced as a 
result of a very significant drop in mining 
related capital expenditure in Australia 
impacting our Professional Services 
business, leading to reduced volumes  
and pricing. In addition, the combination  
of a difficult external environment and  
an internal reorganisation in our UK 
construction business also contributed  
to the fall in profits. 
Net finance costs of £16 million increased 
by £9 million on the prior year (2012: 
£7 million) due to increased finance 
charges resulting from the US private 
placement issued in March 2013. The 
application of the revised IAS 19 reporting 
standard increased non-cash interest 
costs compared to the previous standard 
by £21 million in 2013, and the prior year 
restatement increased the 2012 reported 
figure by £10 million, of which £1 million 
relates to discontinued operations.
Underlying pre-tax profit from continuing 
operations decreased to £187 million 
(2012: £277 million).
Detailed information on the financial 
and operating performance of each  
of our segments is included in the 
Performance Review.

n on-underlying items
Non-underlying items from continuing 
operations of £155 million (2012: £130 
million) before tax were charged to the 
income statement. This comprised 
amortisation of acquired intangible assets 
of £30 million (2012: £39 million) and 
other items of £125 million (2012: £91 
million). The amortisation charge declined 
in the year as some intangible assets 
became fully written down. 
Significant items included a £52 million 
non-cash curtailment charge (and 
associated costs) in connection with 
closing the defined benefit section of  
the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund to future 
accrual for the majority of members 
and £52 million (2012: £64 million) of 
restructuring and reorganisation costs. 
These included £26 million (2012: £49 
million) of costs in the UK in relation to 
continued restructuring of Construction 
Services UK, Support Services and other 
UK entities. Within Professional Services, 
£20 million (2012: £2 million) of costs 
were incurred in Australia to significantly 
restructure the cost base as a result of 
the market downturn. There was also 
£7 million (2012: £4 million) of further 
costs in the UK shared service centre  
as it expanded from its initial scope of 
finance and payroll into HR and IT shared 
services. £10 million (2012: £2 million)  
of costs were incurred in the US for  
the creation of a shared service centre  
in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. 
taxation
The underlying tax charge for continuing 
operations for the year of £50 million 
(2012: £61 million), excluding the Group’s 
share of results of joint ventures and 
associates, equates to an effective tax 
rate of 43.1% (2012: 33.0%). The increase 
from the prior year is due to the impact 
of some unrelieved losses and changes 
in tax legislation. This includes a charge 
of £6 million as a result of writing down 
our deferred tax balances following the 
reduction in the UK corporation tax rate 
to 20%. In addition there was a higher 
proportion of profits in higher tax 
territories than in 2012, offset by the 
benefit of a greater amount of profit  
from investment disposals. Adjusting  
to include joint ventures and associates, 
and comparing this to pre-tax profit for  
the continuing Group and joint ventures 
and associates, the effective tax rate  
was 30.1% (2012: 25.5%). 
In 2014 we would expect the  
underlying effective tax rate to fall  
to approximately 40%. 
Discontinued operations
There was an underlying post-tax loss 
from discontinued operations of £15 
million (2012: profit of £15 million) along 
with non-underlying post-tax costs of 
£37 million (2012: £101 million).
Duncan Magrath
Chief Financial Officer
Revenue from continuing 
operations including joint ventures 
and associates increased by  
2% in the year to £10,118 million 
(2012: £9,966 million). Revenue 
was broadly flat across most 
divisions with 10% growth  
in Support Services. 
In Construction Services, a 12% revenue 
improvement in the US and 16% growth 
in the rest of the world was partly  
offset by a 12% reduction in the UK.  
In Professional Services, reductions in 
Australia were mitigated by improvements 
in the US. Excluding the impact of 
currency, revenue from continuing 
operations for the Group including joint 
ventures and associates increased by 1%. 
Our share of underlying post-tax profits 
from continuing joint ventures and 
associates reduced, as anticipated, to 
£71 million from £92 million in 2012, 
principally due to the favourable resolution 
of bad debts and claims in the Middle East 
during 2012.
balfourbeatty.com/ar2013 Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2013
24 Dividends
The Board continues to recognise the 
importance to its shareholders of a good 
dividend and given the strong management 
actions taken, the strategic positioning of 
the Group, and its strong balance sheet, it 
has recommended a final dividend of 8.5p 
in respect of 2013. This is in line with 
2012’s final dividend and results in  
an unchanged full-year dividend of 14.1p.
Goodwill and intangible assets
The goodwill on the Group’s balance 
sheet at 31 December 2013 decreased 
by £112 million to £1,048 million 
(2012: £1,160 million). £64 million of the 
reduction was due to the disposal of 
Balfour Beatty WorkPlace. £38 million 
of the reduction resulted from reviewing 
the likely sales proceeds achievable  
on the German rail business, and as a 
consequence the goodwill was written 
down to £nil in the first half. Other 
intangible assets, after amortisation 
charges of £33 million (2012: £43 million), 
reduced to £204 million (2012: £212 million). 
Impairment reviews have been carried 
out, and none of the carrying values, other 
than as noted above, have been impaired. 
There is however limited headroom in 
our Italian rail business and in Blackpool 
Airport such that a change in assumptions 
could result in an impairment. Details of 
the calculations and assumptions are 
shown in Note 15. 
Provisions
The Group’s provisions comprise contract, 
employee and other provisions.
Contract provisions of £102 million 
(2012: £125 million) include construction 
insurance liabilities, principally in the 
Group’s captive insurance companies, 
and defect and warranty provisions  
on contracts, primarily construction 
contracts, that have reached practical 
completion. Additional provisions were 
£67 million (2012: £74 million, including 
significant provisions in respect of two 
major contracts). Provisions reversed 
unused were £32 million (2012: £49 
million) and provisions utilised £48 million  
(2012: £38 million).  
Employee provisions of £42 million 
(2012: £57 million) are principally liabilities 
relating to employers’ liability insurance 
retained in the Group’s captive insurance 
companies and provisions for employee 
termination liabilities arising from the 
Group’s restructuring programmes.  
Additional provisions were £23 million 
(2012: £43 million, including significant 
provisions in respect of restructuring).  
Provisions reversed unused were 
£14 million (2012: £14 million) and 
provisions utilised £17 million  
(2012: £17 million).
Other provisions of £49 million (2012: 
£46 million) principally comprise: motor 
and other insurance liabilities in the 
Group’s captive insurance companies; 
legal claims and costs; property-related 
provisions, mainly onerous lease 
commitments, some of which arise from 
the Group’s restructuring programmes; 
and environmental provisions.
Pensions – balance sheet movement
The Group’s balance sheet includes 
aggregate deficits of £434 million 
(2012: £333 million) for the Group’s 
pension schemes. 
The Group recorded net actuarial losses 
for 2013 on those schemes totalling 
£117 million (2012: £111 million). There 
were £73 million (2012: £194 million) of 
actuarial losses recorded on the present 
value of the obligations, largely resulting 
from the effects of lower discount rates 
and higher inflation assumptions mitigated 
by an actuarial gain arising following the 
reassessment of the difference between 
RPI and CPI measures. Actuarial losses 
of £44 million (2012: gain of £83 million) 
were recorded against the fair value of 
plan assets resulting from lower than 
expected returns. Movements in the 
pension deficit are illustrated on page 27.
A formal triennial funding valuation of 
the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund (BBPF) 
was carried out as at 31 March 2013 
and showed a funding position of 88%. 
A funding plan was agreed to eliminate 
the deficit over eight years, which 
provides for a reduced level of deficit 
In December we completed the sale of 
the UK facilities management business, 
Balfour Beatty WorkPlace, for a net cash 
consideration of £155 million. After 
transaction costs the disposal resulted  
in a non-underlying gain of £80 million 
before writing off goodwill, or £16 million 
after writing off goodwill. The business 
contributed £19 million (2012: £22 million) 
to underlying profit from operations, up to 
the date of disposal.
There was a very poor performance 
in Mainland European rail, principally due 
to underperformance on three contracts  
in Germany, resulting in an underlying  
loss from operations of £26 million (2012: 
profit of £2 million). Non-underlying costs 
of £51 million included £38 million for 
writing down the goodwill in the German 
rail business to £nil, a loss on disposal  
of the Spanish business of £4 million,  
rail restructuring costs of £6 million and  
a £2 million regulatory fine in Germany. 
earnings per share
Underlying earnings per share for 
continuing operations were 20.0 pence 
(2012: 31.7 pence), which along with 
an underlying loss per share from 
discontinued operations of 2.2 pence 
(2012: earnings per share of 2.1 pence) 
gave an underlying earnings per share 
for total operations of 17.8 pence 
(2012: 33.8 pence).

25 payments of £50 million per annum 
(adjusted by CPI movements) from April 
2013 for the first three years, increasing 
by £5 million per annum to £65 million per 
annum by April 2018 through to May 2020. 
Under this plan the Group is making 
regular monthly payments, which increase 
each April by the growth in CPI up to a 
cap of 5%, plus double any increase in the 
Company’s dividend in excess of capped 
CPI. In the event of the Company making 
any special dividend or capital payment 
to shareholders, an additional contribution 
is payable for one year only, equal to 75% 
of the percentage uplift on the normal 
dividend payment represented by the 
one-off payment to shareholders.
In August the majority of members of the 
BBPF ceased to accrue future defined 
benefits and became deferred members 
resulting in a curtailment charge (and 
an increase in the deficit) and costs 
totalling £54 million, recognised as a 
non-underlying item, of which £2 million 
related to discontinued operations. This 
reduces the future cash payments over 
the life of the scheme by approximately 
£250 million, and reduces the pension 
service charge (net of incremental defined 
contribution payments) by approximately 
£15 million per annum.
The increase in the aggregate deficit 
to £434 million at the end of 2013 will 
increase non-cash pension interest costs 
in the income statement by £6 million 
to £15 million in 2014.
Balance sheet and capital structure
We look to achieve a balance between 
the negative working capital, liquid funds 
and facilities and the PPP investments 
portfolio. Whilst we have seen a 
reduction in net liquid funds during 2013, 
we have also seen a reduction in the 
levels of negative working capital. 
However, despite the disposals in the 
year, the Directors’ valuation of our PPP 
investments portfolio has increased to 
£766 million using constant discount rates 
(2012: £734 million). Overall we have 
maintained good balance sheet strength. 
Cash flow performance
Cash used in operations of £162 million 
(2012: £219 million) was impacted by a 
working capital outflow of £117 million 
(2012: £310 million) and pension 
deficit payments of £59 million  
(2012: £61 million). 
Average net borrowings in the second 
half of the year were £433 million, 
although with the sale of Balfour Beatty 
WorkPlace in December, and a strong 
cash performance at the end of the year, 
the Group’s net debt at 31 December 
2013 was £66 million (2012: net cash 
of £35 million), before taking into account 
the consolidation of £354 million 
(2012: £368 million) of non-recourse net 
borrowings held in wholly owned PPP 
project companies.
Working capital
Working capital comprises receivables 
and payables from construction contract 
customers and other third parties. Where 
receivables exceed payables, this is 
termed positive working capital and  
where payables exceed receivables, this 
is referred to as negative working capital.
Including the impact of exchange, 
negative working capital decreased 
from £665 million at the end of 2012 to 
£550 million at the end of 2013. Of this 
decrease of £115 million, the biggest 
component was £75 million in 
Construction Services. This was largely 
due to changes in the mix of business, 
away from larger more complex projects, 
which have the potential for more 
favourable terms, to smaller projects. 
Total working capital as a percentage of 
annualised revenue (WCPR) at the end of 
the year was (6.3)% (2012: (7.7)%). The 
most significant component of negative 
working capital relates to Construction 
Services, which ended the year with 
WCPR of (10.5)% (2012: (11.6)%). 
 Read more on the individual components  
of working capital on p97
In 2014, we would expect further 
reductions in negative working capital 
in UK construction as a result of the 
continued change in mix from major 
projects to regional work, and the greater 
proportion of smaller contracts. As the 
market recovery takes hold in the US 
we expect negative working capital in 
our US construction business to increase. 
We expect working capital in Professional 
Services to be positive (ie net receivable), 
but broadly stable with 2013, and in

modest increase in the level of positive 
working capital. 
Banking facilities
The Group’s principal committed bank 
facilities total £950 million and extend 
through to 2016. The purpose of these 
facilities, and other small facilities, is to 
provide liquidity from a group of core 
relationship banks to support Balfour 
Beatty in its current and future activities. 
Over time, as the Group’s business has 
evolved, we have explored ways of 
diversifying our sources of funds away 
from the pure bank market. 
As part of that process, and taking 
advantage of historically low interest 
rates, in March 2013 we issued US$350 
million notes by way of a US private 
placement with an average coupon of 
4.94% per annum over 9.3 years. The 
incremental cost of this funding on an 
annual basis is approximately £9 million. 
Furthermore, in November we took 
advantage of favourable bond market 
conditions and issued approximately 
£253 million of unsecured convertible 
bonds due 2018 at a coupon of 1.875% 
per annum. Proceeds from the bond issue 
have been used to repay short term 
borrowings under our principal committed 
bank facilities and for general corporate 
purposes. The annual incremental cost  
of the bonds is £3 million from a cash 
perspective, or £8 million in income 
statement terms.
At the end of 2013 we had no  
drawings against our £950 million  
of committed facilities. 
Foreign currency risk
The Group is exposed to foreign currency 
risk primarily in the US, Asia-Pacific,  
and the Middle East. Based on the 
geographical split of the Group a one cent 
movement in the US$:£ exchange rate 
would impact profit from operations by 
approximately £0.8 million. The average 
exchange rate for 2013 was $1.57: £1. 
So far in 2014 the average rate has been 
$1.66, and consequently if this rate 
persists for the remainder of 2014,  
the impact of foreign exchange would  
be to reduce profit from operations  
by approximately £7 million.
Financial risk factors  
and going concern
The key financial risk factors for the Group 
remain largely unchanged. Some of our 
markets are showing signs of starting to 
recover. This can lead to increased risk of 
subcontractor failures due to their cash 
requirements for increased working 
capital, and also potential inflationary 
pressures in some areas.

Financial Reporting Council in October 
2009. In reviewing the future prospects 
of the Group, the following factors 
are relevant:
•	 the Group has a strong order backlog 
•	 there continues to be underlying 
demand in infrastructure markets in the 
countries in which the Group operates
•	 the Group has an increasingly 
diversified business model that gives 
resilience to the business
•	 excluding the non-recourse net 
borrowings of PPP subsidiaries, the 
Group has committed bank facilities 
of £950 million for at least the next 
two years, which were undrawn at 
31 December 2013.
Based on the above, and having made 
appropriate enquiries and reviewed 
medium term cash forecasts, the Directors 
consider it reasonable to assume that the 
Group and the Company have adequate 
resources to continue for the foreseeable 
future and, for this reason, have continued 
to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the financial statements.

The Professional Services order book 
ended the year at £1.5 billion, in line with 
the previous year. The order book 
increased in the Americas and the Middle 
East but saw a small reduction in the UK 
and a more notable decline in Australia, 
resulting from the significant market 
deterioration experienced throughout 
2013. Revenue remained stable at £1.7 
billion (2012: £1.7 billion), with increases  
in the Americas and the Middle East 
offsetting lower volumes in Australia. We 
indicated that profitability would be lower 
in Australia in 2013 due to 2012 benefiting 
from good final settlements on some 
profitable alliance and at-risk contracts; 
however this was compounded by the 
significantly deteriorating trading 
conditions. Despite taking swift cost 
reduction measures in Australia and 
operating at or above expected levels  
in other regions, this led to a substantial

In the US, where approximately 75% 
of activity is in the transportation sector, 
funding of projects by both the federal and 
state departments of transportation is 
crucial to our business. The authorisation 
of the Transportation Bill in July 2012 for 
a period of two years (effective from 
September 2012) helped the transportation 
business deliver a good performance in 
2013. In addition to good performance 
on major design-build projects, there was 
also an increase in traditional design work. 
Furthermore, the short term US Federal 
Government shutdown in Autumn 2013 
does not appear to have had a lasting 
impact on existing work or the pipeline of 
opportunities. As a result, we saw a good 
performance in US transportation with 
revenue up 7% year-on-year, whilst the 
order book remained at 2012 levels. 
New awards and extensions on existing 
projects – including the two-year contract 
extension for programme management 
services on the California High-Speed Rail 
project – remained at a healthy level.
We are currently at various stages on 
numerous US transportation design-build 
project opportunities. During the year  
we created a core team of senior 
transportation executives to focus on the 
pursuit, management and performance  
of major design-build projects.
Other ongoing major projects – the Dallas 
Horseshoe project; the Illiana Expressway 
which runs between Illinois and Indiana; 
the Midtown Tunnel project in Norfolk, 
Virginia; the Westside Subway Extension 
in Los Angeles; and the Second Avenue 
Subway in New York City – are all 
progressing well. 
During 2013, our Federal business was 
successful on the re-bid of the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) 
contract for disaster inspections, which 
is contracted through to January 2019. 
This is the fourth consecutive multi-year 
contract awarded to the business dating 
back to 1995. 
Performance of our US power business 
was lower relative to 2012 due to lower 
than planned volumes as a number of 
projects were delayed into 2014. There was 
good progress on the joint venture EPC 
contract we won in January 2013 to design 
and build the Garrison Energy Center, a 
309MW combined cycle gas-fired power 
plant in Delaware. We have completed the 
integration of Subsurface Group, which 
we acquired at the end of 2012, although 
its performance was somewhat below 
expectations in a subdued market.
Our architectural and buildings business 
performed below our expectations 
following the settlement of a long running 
legal dispute for US$8 million.
In Canada, our largest sector – structural 
work for buildings – has remained flat. 
However, we have seen some success in 
our strategic objective of expanding into 
the transportation sector. We have made 
good progress on transit programmes in 
the City of Toronto and for the Regional 
Municipality of Waterloo. In addition, 
we are pursuing several other major 
opportunities in the province of Ontario. 
We have also been aiming to grow in the 
power market, but as in the US, we saw 
a delay in the award of new projects in 
the power market in 2013; however, 
we continue to see future opportunities 
in areas such as storage caverns and 
injection well projects related to new  
work in oil sands. 
In 2012 we launched a cost efficiency 
programme, when we announced the 
transfer of many of our support functions 
from New York City to Lancaster, 
Pennsylvania. The shared service centre 
commenced operations in March 2013 
and is now in full operation and performing 
well. Building on that success, a number 
of other support functions, such as billing 
and certain human resource operations, 
were also moved to the shared service 
centre, from elsewhere in the US. 
We continue to progress the settlement 
of the previously highlighted longstanding 
contract dispute. A negotiated settlement 
now seems unlikely, but the arbitration 
process is well advanced and we expect 
it to achieve a positive outcome in 2014.
Good performance in  
US transportation  
with revenue up 7%  
year-on-year.

The UK remains an extremely competitive 
market with margins remaining under 
pressure despite volumes improving in the 
highways and rail sectors. Our operations 
in highways and rail have been successful 
in securing improved levels of workload 
and have improved billability levels. 
We are currently delivering aspects of the 
preliminary design of the railway systems 
packages for the UK’s High Speed 
project as well as all three packages 
for Transport for London’s structures 
and tunnels portfolio. 
The UK power business remains 
challenged for domestic workload as 
new projects continue to be delayed. 
Expanding export services to other 
geographies has been a key focus for 
this operation in order to supplement 
the low level of domestic opportunities. 
We had excellent growth in the order 
book and revenue from the Middle East, 
particularly in Qatar and Saudi Arabia. In 
June we won an $87 million contract with 
Ashghal to provide consulting services 
for the Qatar Expressway Programme, 
supplementing the significant programme 
we are already working on for the Local 
Roads and Drainage and Qatar Rail 
projects. In July we were awarded the 
role of Programme Management Office 
Consultant on the prestigious Makkah 
Public Transport Programme in Saudi 
Arabia by the Development Commission 
of Makkah and Mashaaer.

Our business in Australia has been 
significantly impacted by the sudden 
cancellation of capital projects across the 
resources sector, which has also had a 
subsequent impact on public revenues 
and spending plans of Australian states 
and municipalities. We have taken swift 
action in response to this by significantly 
restructuring the business, including 
appropriate reduction of the Australian 
workforce. However despite this, cost 
reductions inevitably lagged revenue 
declines. Whilst the run rate at the end 
of the year was broadly break even, the 
business was loss making for 2013 as 
a whole and £40 million below the level 
achieved in 2012. We continue to perform 
work on the Roy Hill iron ore mining 
project for which we were appointed 
programme manager in March 2013. 
The project is expected to secure the 
remaining elements of financing during 
2014. The transportation sector has also 
experienced delays in new awards due 
to ongoing funding uncertainty although 
there are some signs that this may 
improve in 2014. Despite this market 
turmoil we were successful in securing 
a key rail contract in Melbourne with 
Victoria’s Road Authority.

A rail tunnel under the Bosphorus Strait in Istanbul opened in 2013, the 
culmination of more than two decades of planning and design work by Parsons 
Brinckerhoff – a 150 year dream to link Asia and Europe via an underwater 
crossing. Known as the Marmaray Project, it involved an upgrade of a 47 mile 
commuter rail line from Gebze on the Asian side of the Bosphorus to Halkali on 
the European side. The tunnel can accommodate 75,000 passengers per hour or 
an estimated 1.5 million people daily, reducing traffic congestion and travel time.

Our operations in Asia, notably Singapore 
and Greater China, have continued to 
increase their workload and perform well. 
In Singapore, we secured £21 million

Land Transport Authority for the Eastern 
Regional Line Depot and Stations. 
Development of our structural capabilities 
in China is expected to provide avenues 
for additional growth in that market. 
As in 2012, activities in South Africa 
continued to show positive results during 
2013. Our programme management role

Africa continues to progress as we also 
look to pursue further opportunities in 
the region.

We expect to see ongoing strength in 
our core US transportation market, new 
opportunities in a number of our other 
key markets including the Middle East, 
UK and Canada, and increasing power 
opportunities in the US and South Africa. 
In Australia we have worked diligently to 
right size the business in line with current 
and projected market conditions. Whilst 
volume and pricing risks remain, we 
expect the business to improve on its 
2013 performance and deliver a broadly 
breakeven result in 2014. 
Overall therefore, excluding any benefit 
of the longstanding contract dispute, 
we expect to make progress in 2014 
across the business, with margins 
improving progressively as the losses  
in Australia are eliminated.

The Construction Services order book 
from continuing operations improved in the 
year to £7.7 billion, up 5% from a year ago. 
Following a year of very strong order intake 
in the US, our US order book increased by 
10% despite significant revenue growth.  
It is now over 20% larger than our UK 
order book, which itself decreased by  
3% in 2013 with growth in the regional 
business not completely offsetting 
reductions in major projects and 
mechanical & engineering services.  
We also saw strong growth in the rest 
of the world order book which increased 
by 10%, driven by wins in Hong Kong.
Revenue from continuing operations 
increased by 1% during the year to 
£6,573 million. US revenues were up 
12% for the year, driven by a 20% 
increase in the second half versus the 
prior year. In addition, revenue in the rest 
of the world increased by 16%, partially 
offset by a 12% reduction in the UK.

Underlying profit from continuing 
operations reduced to £21 million from 
£119 million in 2012, with the decline 
mostly due to the performance of the UK 
business. Whilst there was an expectation 
of reduced profitability at the start of 
the year, in light of a declining market, 
we announced a shortfall of approximately 
£50 million in April, resulting from further 
deterioration in the external environment 
combined with the impact of an ongoing 
internal reorganisation. Whilst the UK 
business broadly performed in line with 
these reduced expectations, a further 
deterioration at the end of the year 
resulted in an actual profit shortfall  
of £60 million.

The UK construction market has been a 
challenging environment in which to win 
and execute work, allowing clients to 
impose increasingly stringent conditions 
onto contractors, and as a result, placing 
subcontractors under significant financial 
pressure. In addition, the business 
underwent a major reorganisation during 
2012 and 2013. In January 2013, the 
operations were streamlined into three 
business units consisting of:
•	 Major projects: focused on complex 
projects in key market sectors  
such as energy, transportation  
and heavy infrastructure
•	 Regional: civil engineering and building, 
private and public, including work in 
partnerships and frameworks to provide 
customers with locally delivered, 
flexible and fully integrated civil and 
building services
•	 Mechanical and electrical engineering: 
covering all market sectors.
Following the identification of the profits 
shortfall highlighted above we re-focused 
attention on operational improvements 
and tighter governance. At the end of April 
we made changes to the leadership of the 
business, appointing Nicholas Pollard as 
CEO of Construction Services UK. We 
also undertook a review of the regional 
business and closed regional delivery 
units with weak future prospects.  
The management team reviewed all 
operational contracts, and have 
subsequently taken steps to improve  
key disciplines such as tendering, 
estimating and commercial governance. 
The actions we have put in place to 
strengthen the leadership and performance 
of the UK construction business are taking 
effect, and contributed to a stronger 
second half performance. Whilst we have 
seen a better than anticipated turnaround 
in the regional business, there was 
weaker financial performance on selected 
major projects in the building sector. In 
our mechanical and electrical engineering 
business, where we predominantly act as 
a subcontractor, financial performance in 
the final quarter was adversely impacted 
by increasingly difficult market conditions. 
The impact of these further deteriorations 
resulted in an overall £60 million reduction 
in profitability versus expectations at the 
start of the year.
The UK order book has remained stable, 
albeit there continues to be a shift in the 
mix of work from the major projects 
business to regional construction due  
to the impact of the strengthening of the 
UK residential market and fewer major 
projects being brought to the market. We 
won a number of contracts in the student 
accommodation sector including the 
University of Aberystwyth, University of 
Birmingham and an £80 million project for 
Urbanest in central London. In the London 
commercial sector we were successful  
in securing some substantial awards, 
including the £110 million Providence 
Tower and a £121 million hotel contract for 
Grove Developments. Whilst there were 
fewer major infrastructure projects up  
for award, important wins included the 
£321 million design and construction joint 
venture contract to upgrade sections of 
the M25 London orbital motorway for the 
Highways Agency. We also announced 
the £154 million contract to carry out  
the full transformation works to the 
London 2012 Olympic Stadium, which 
incorporates enhancements to the stadium 
roof contract we were awarded in 2013.
The performance of our UK Rail business 
was impacted by operational issues on a 
small number of projects. However, we 
continue to believe that the UK rail sector 
will generate major programmes which 
we are well placed to address with our 
range of capabilities.

30 recovery in the building sector. Focusing 
our acquisition strategy on particular 
sectors and geographies has enabled us 
to broaden our footprint and harness new 
relationships. Streamlining the business 
from five to three regions, and the 
establishment of a national capability 
centre, has ensured that we drive 
innovation, develop best practice, share 
knowledge and deploy talent across the 
business nationally. This drove a 54% 
increase in order intake in 2013 versus 
2012, gaining market share.
Building market segments where we 
have seen significant opportunities and 
those offering further potential into 2014 
include mission critical (data centres), 
commercial/corporate facilities, student 
accommodation, multifamily housing 
and healthcare. 
Our buildings business continues  
to benefit from working with our 
Investments business, not only in the 
military housing area, but increasingly 
in other markets. Examples of projects 
brought to our construction business  
from our investments business include 
the Air Force Northern Group project –  
a six-year project for the design, 
construction and/or renovation of 4,500 
homes, valued at approximately $442 
million and new graduate and family 
student housing project at the University 
of Nevada, Reno. Preferred bidder status 
was achieved on a number of other 
schemes including the $500 million 
University of West Florida student 
accommodation project.
In civil infrastructure we are seeing 
opportunities although competition 
remains strong.
Following the approval of the 
Transportation Bill in 2012, a number of 
civil infrastructure projects have moved 
to tender stage. An increasing proportion 
of civil and rail projects are being let on a 
PPP or design build basis, which allows us 
to demonstrate our experience, expertise 
and innovation in this area. In December, 
we announced the award of a $343 million 
joint venture contract for the Regional 
Transportation District in Denver to initiate 
the first phase of design and construction 
on the North Metro Rail Line project. 
International
In Hong Kong, 2013 was a busy tendering 
period for our joint venture, Gammon 
Construction, which ended the period 
with a strong order book. The market 
has experienced a strong programme 
of government spending on both 
transportation infrastructure and public 
buildings. In June, Gammon was awarded 
a contract worth £720 million (HK$8.66 
billion) to design and build a major strategic 
road. The HKSAR Highways contract to 
construct the Southern Connection 
Viaduct section of Tuen Mun – Chek Lap 
Kok Link in Hong Kong is the largest solo 
civil engineering contract ever awarded 
to Gammon. In November Gammon 
won two significant rail contracts for 
a combined value of approximately 
£150 million (S$315 million) in Singapore: 
the design and construction of the 
Mayflower Station on the Thomson Line, 
and a sleeper replacement programme 
on the existing North-South Line.
Our joint venture in Dubai performed in 
line with our expectations with stable 
revenues in 2013. However, profitability 
was down on 2012 as a result of 
favourable bad debt and claim settlements 
in 2012. Looking into 2014, the business 
environment is improving, and we would 
expect a return to somewhat modest 
volume growth for our main contracting 
business, whereas our subcontract 
mechanical and electrical engineering 
business is currently operating in 
more difficult market conditions,  
much like the UK.
Discontinued operations 
Following the completion of the 
operational and strategic review of our 
mainland European rail businesses we 
concluded that maintaining a rail presence 
in Mainland Europe was not consistent 
with our strategy of building a strong local 
presence in a number of market sectors. 
In Mainland Europe we essentially only 
operate in rail, and therefore in March 
2013 we announced our intention to 
divest these operations. In March 2013 
we sold the Spanish business to its 
management, and in December we 
announced the sale of the Scandinavian 
business to Strukton Rail BV, with the 
disposal completing in January 2014.
In Germany, trading has been very 
disappointing which resulted in an 
underlying loss from operations of 
£26 million mainly due to three complex 
joint venture projects with operational and 
stakeholder issues, and continued low 
levels of activity. We have made progress 
to divest our interests in the business, 
completing a management buyout of the 
small signalling manufacturing capability 
and closing down the switches and 
crossing manufacturing capability. 
Discussions with a number of potential 
buyers for the remaining parts of the 
German operation are ongoing. At the 
half year, having reviewed the likely sales 
proceeds achievable on disposal, we 
wrote down the £38 million of goodwill 
within our German business to £nil.

Whilst the environment is still challenging 
in the UK, we have taken steps to improve 
operational delivery. We continue to 
expect the mix of our order book to shift 
towards the regional business, as the 
ongoing recovery in the housing market 
stimulates work for the regional business. 
The number of new major infrastructure 
projects to be awarded in the short term is 
expected to be low, with a small number 
of significant opportunities expected to 
arise. Our overall UK strategy remains to 
exploit our market leading position, and to 
continue to drive efficiency and build our 
skills and depth of capability in construction 
to capitalise on a gradual recovery.
In the US building market we expect 
to see a continued steady improvement 
in market conditions and tender 
opportunities. We expect the strong 
order intake we have achieved in 2013 
to lead to volume improvements in 2014, 
and we anticipate that a broader market 
growth will lead to improving bid margins 
on work for execution in 2015 and beyond. 
Our strategy in US building is to leverage 
our world class processes, sector 
expertise and innovation on a national 
basis, targeting growth sectors. In US 
infrastructure we have significant 
headroom to grow, especially as the 
market moves towards greater private 
investment and design and build projects.
Overall, whilst margins are expected to 
remain under pressure, we anticipate 
improved profitability in 2014, with partial 
recovery in margins.

The Support Services order book for 
continuing operations finished the year  
at £4.1 billion, down 11% from a year ago 
(2012: £4.6 billion). As expected, the order 
book has declined in the power sector as 
we have completed the first year of the 
£1.1 billion contract with National Grid to 
upgrade the UK’s gas distribution network. 
The order book has reduced in the water 
sector as the AMP5 regulatory water cycle 
nears completion in 2015. Revenue for the 
year was up 10% at £1,265 million, as a 
result of strong performance in the power 
sector – up 18% on 2012.
Underlying profit from continuing 
operations increased to £55 million

The power sector, a key growth sector  
for the Group, now accounts for over a 
third of our support services activities.  
We continue to develop our power 
business in both overhead line and cabling 
capabilities, whilst helping clients maintain 
their significant asset base. On overhead 
lines we made excellent progress on the 
Beauly-Denny replacement electricity 
transmission line contract for Scottish and 
Southern Energy. This contract involves 
the development, design and construction 
of a 200km overhead line and associated 
civil works. In cabling we continued to 
make progress on the delivery of the 
Humber Gateway offshore cabling 
contract for E.ON. In the US there was 
good performance on our New Energy 
Alliance with National Grid.
The Gas Distribution Strategic Partnership 
contracts with National Grid to replace 
ageing networks in the Northwest and 
West Midlands are fully mobilised and are 
performing well. We also made progress 
on our joint venture contract in the 
Republic of Ireland to replace and extend 
the gas network on behalf of state 
operator Bord Gais.
In the water market, we continued to 
perform well on our AMP5 water 
contracts. As the AMP5 regulatory water 
cycle draws to a close, we are working 
with a number of water companies to 
manage a smooth transition to the AMP6 
cycle without unnecessary changeover 
disruption. As water companies choose 
their partners for the next cycle, we have 
already won a three-way joint venture 
contract worth a potential £1.5 billion with 
Thames Water. While the 23-month early 
contractor involvement is in our order 
book (£10 million), the vast majority of 
this work is yet to be booked. Also under 
AMP6, Yorkshire Water extended our 
existing contract to 2020 which is worth 
£70 million. 
In transportation, we were successful in 
winning important highways work for local 
authorities. At the start of 2013 we added 
the £150 million Wiltshire Highways 
contract to our order book. The contract 
commenced work in May 2013 and since 
then we have been working progressively 
with the client to resolve a number of 
start-up issues. We won a £200 million 
contract with Herefordshire Council in July 
and this project has mobilised in line with 
our expectations. Other contracts in our 
portfolio, including West Sussex and the 
street lighting portfolio, performed well. 
For the Highways Agency, the Area 10 
contract to operate, maintain and improve 
over 500km of motorway and trunk roads 
in the Northwest fully mobilised during 
the year and there was excellent 
performance on the M25 contract.

venture we manage the operation and 
maintenance of 250 miles of road critical 
to the UK’s transport network.

to manage financial pressures, whilst 
improving the quality of the infrastructure 
that facilitates our daily lives. This will 
continue to provide opportunities for us, 
as clients look to outsource work, and 
seek innovative solutions in the provision 
of that work, but also presents challenges 
in an increasingly competitive environment.
In the near term, we see growth coming

In the water sector, we are actively 
bidding for AMP6 contracts with a 
number of the major water companies

establishing a strong presence in new 
markets and generating a significant 
increase in underlying pre-tax profits to 
£132 million (2012: £97 million), whilst 
growing the value of the portfolio. The 
pre-disposals operating profit of £20 million 
was up £3 million on the previous year  
as strong growth in US military housing 
income and the favourable impact of cost 
savings throughout the division more than 
outweighed the decline in UK income as  
a result of disposals. Net interest income, 
a significant element of total income, also 
increased by £2 million to £30 million. 
Following another strong year, the 
disposals programme delivered an 
increase in gains from £52 million in  
2012 to £82 million in 2013, after  
recycling £21 million (2012: £48 million)  
of revaluation reserves from other 
comprehensive income to the income 
statement. The disposals realised value 
INfra STr UCTUr E 
INvESTMENTS
significantly above both the Directors’ 
valuation and our own expectations. 
Despite the disposals, the PPP 
investments portfolio remains substantial 
and diverse, and the Directors’ valuation 
increased to £766 million using constant 
discount rates at the end of 2013 (2012: 
£734 million) including the benefit of  
£76 million of inflation and operational 
performance gains.
oP eRAt Ion AL ReVIeW
We continued to perform well in 2013, 
reaching financial close on eight projects, 
with another three advancing to preferred 
bidder stage. The student accommodation 
market remained a key growth area for us 
in the US and UK in 2013, as we secured 
four new projects with a construction 
value of over £500 million.
Our strategy to diversify further our 
economic infrastructure capabilities 
delivered successes with preferred bidder 
appointment on the £346 million Gwynt 
y Môr Offshore Transmission Owners 
(OFTO) project and financial close on 
the Birmingham Bio Power waste wood 
gasifier project. These projects represent 
significant progress for our business and 
the continued evolution of our portfolio.
In addition to growing the business in new 
end markets we have continued to expand 
our Investments business geographically. 
At the start of 2014 we achieved a 
significant milestone as we secured 
our first win in Canada, with a preferred 
bidder appointment on the £196 million 
(C$350 million) BC Children’s and 
Women’s hospital redevelopment project 
in Vancouver. The Canadian pipeline 
remains strong and we are actively 
pursuing a number of other social and 
economic infrastructure opportunities. 
In Australia we are working on a 
number of waste, transportation 
and accommodation projects. 
uK
In the UK our most active markets were 
predominantly student accommodation, 
power and waste. 
We reached financial close on two projects 
in the student accommodation market 
during the year: the £63 million Holyrood 
Postgraduate Student Accommodation 
and Outreach Centre project for the 
University of Edinburgh and the £45 
million Penglais Farm New Residences 
Project for Aberystwyth University. 
Notably these projects were financed 
with long term debt from institutional 
investors, supporting the UK Government’s 
drive to encourage low cost pension fund 
investment in infrastructure. Building at 
both sites has commenced with the first 
phases of both projects contracted to 
be delivered in the autumn, although 
Aberystwyth has incurred programme 
delays at the beginning of 2014 with the 
extreme weather conditions. We continue 
to see further bidding opportunities in  
the sector in 2014.
In the UK power sector, the preferred 
bidder appointment for the Gwynt y Môr 
project strengthened our position in the 
OFTO market. Greater Gabbard OFTO 
(£317 million) achieved financial close 
in November, with the Thanet OFTO 
(£163 million) expected to reach financial 
close during 2014. Through these project 
successes we have developed a leading 
investor position in this growing market  
and supported the Group’s wider strategy 
for developing our delivery capability 
in offshore transmission. 
We continue to see opportunities for 
development in the waste market, 
achieving financial close on two waste 
projects in 2013, although these projects

We achieved financial close on the 
Gloucestershire waste project, but this 
is currently subject to a planning appeal  
on which we anticipate the outcome  
will be announced later in 2014. We 
continue to work on a pipeline of biomass 
opportunities. We are making good 
progress with our Essex waste treatment 
facility; construction is now well underway 
and it is on schedule to open in 2017. 
n orth America
In the US, military housing remains a key 
aspect of our portfolio with 21 operational 
projects. In August 2013 we reached 
financial close on the $442 million 
Northern Group project for the US Air 
Force, which consists of six bases. 
This project requires managing all 
development, operations and 
maintenance, property management, 
construction, renovation and demolition 
services for 4,540 homes. We again 
demonstrated our ability to launch 
innovative funding structures, with the 
project being financed by institutional 
investors through a bond issue in the US. 
In addition we also assumed property 
management services for the ACC III 
military housing privatisation project. 
We have continued to make significant 
progress in the student accommodation 
market, as we share learning and best 
practice across geographies for the 
benefit of our clients. We completed the 
building of a 233-bed facility for Lake 
Forest College, Illinois. We successfully 
reached financial close on the University 
of Iowa and University of Nevada projects 
in 2013. In the third quarter of 2013,  
we announced two significant preferred 
bidder positions in this market with the 
$500 million University of West Florida 
project followed by our second preferred 
bidder appointment with Texas A&M 
University for the $200 million College 
Station project. We anticipate further 
growth opportunities in this sector in 2014. 
We are also progressing on our strategy to 
utilise our developer capabilities in North 
America. Through our involvement in the 
Lake Forest College project and Tarleton 
State University (Phase 1) project, we 
have created an opportunity to earn 
development fees, while also generating 
income for the Construction Services 
division without investing Group capital. 
This is further demonstration of how the 
investments business is able to deliver 
additional value to the wider Group 
beyond simply earning a return on 
invested capital. Diversification is also 
taking place in our military housing 
business as we explore opportunities for 
third party management, leveraging our 
management service capabilities. We 
secured our first win in this market in 
January 2013 with the Carriage House 
Townhomes project. 
We were delighted to secure our first 
project success in Canada with the 
preferred bidder appointment in January 
2014 on the BC Children’s and Women’s 
hospital redevelopment project 
representing a significant win for the 
Group. Construction is expected to 
commence in April 2014 and the new 
facility will be completed in June 2017.
Disposals programme
We had considerable success during 2013 
as we continued our disposal strategy 
through the full or partial disposal of a 
number of our mature UK PFI assets 
generating an accounting gain of £82 
million, and at a value of £45 million in 
excess of their Directors’ valuation.  
These included our 50% interests in  
four PFI schools projects in Birmingham, 
Bassetlaw, Stoke and Rotherham; our 
50% interests in two PFI hospital projects 
in Salford and Tameside; and partial  
equity disposals in the Carlisle Northern 
Development Route (CNDR) and A30/A35 
road, where we have retained strategic 
interests of 25% and 20% respectively. 
We continue to see strong demand for 
these assets in the secondary market.

Infrastructure Partners (BBIP). Alongside 
external investors we have a total 
commitment of $110 million, which we 
expect to be drawn down and invested 
over the next three to four years.  
The fund has so far raised approximately 
$500 million and made a number of 
investments and commitments, acquiring 
10 operational UK solar projects in the UK, 
and entering into a definitive agreement 
(subject to regulatory approval) to acquire 
a regulated electric utility business in 
Michigan. We anticipate subsequent 
closes to the fund during 2014. 
Loo KIn G Fo RWARD
Our primary objective continues to be 
the investment in projects where we can 
use our investment skills and expertise 
to maximise the broader benefit to  
the Group’s growth and development.  
We will continue to evolve our developer 
capabilities to realise new opportunities  
for the Investments business and the 
broader Group. We have a significant 
pipeline of work globally as we  
continue to pursue a variety of PPP and 
non-PPP opportunities. We anticipate a 
continuation of our disposals programme 
as a means of realising the value in mature 
assets, but expect the gains to revert to  
a more sustainable level of approximately 
£40 million in 2014.

35 The size and composition of our 
investment portfolio continues 
to develop and reflects the 
successful implementation of our 
investment recycling programme 
as well as further investments 
in new and existing markets. 
We continue to achieve value through 
the disposal, either in whole or in part, 
of mature assets while continuing to 
hold strategic investments in individual 
projects, or market sectors, which offer 
downstream supply chain opportunities 
for the Group or potential areas for market 
growth. We remain active in using our 
investment capability to develop new 
markets and have successfully transferred 
our capability and experience to invest in a 
number of new sectors with eight projects 
in the UK in student accommodation,  
off shore transmission and waste and 
three student accommodation projects

75% of our 100% shareholding in Carlisle 
Northern Development Route and 65% 
of our 85% shareholding in the A30/A35 
concession. In each case the value 
realised was substantially above the 
Directors’ valuation.
During the year Balfour Beatty achieved 
preferred bidder status on a student 
accommodation project for Aberystwyth 
University and on the Gwynt y Môr 
Offshore Transmission Owners (OFTO) 
project. We successfully closed the 
Birmingham Bio Power project and two 
US student accommodation projects  
for the universities of Iowa and Nevada.  
In addition, shortly after year end  
Balfour Beatty won its first Canadian  
PPP hospital project in British Columbia. 
This project is not included in the 
Directors’ valuation as it had not  
achieved preferred bidder status  
at 31 December 2013.
We were also appointed preferred bidder 
on two student accommodation projects 
in the US but these have not been

dIr ECTOr S’ v al UaTION 
Of ppp CONCESSIONS
The Directors’ valuation is intended to 
provide an indicator of the value intrinsic  
in our PPP investment portfolio and 
illustrate movements in underlying  
values between periods, highlighting  
the impact of intervening transactions, 
through the application of a consistent 
methodology. It does not set out to 
estimate the market value of the 
investments in the portfolio.
The valuation is based on the forecast 
investments and returns of the projects 
based on current projections, and may 
differ significantly from the book value of 
the investments shown in the accounts.
The values are calculated using a 
discounted cash flow methodology, 
discounting all future cash flows to 
Balfour Beatty at a fixed rate. This rate 
is 9.5% pre shareholder tax for the UK 
portfolio and 12% pre shareholder tax 
for the US portfolio.

36 as the clients are yet to determine the 
financial structure of the projects.  
The table above shows the changes  
in the value of our portfolio over the past 
year, based on:
•	 the 2012 valuation
•	 PLUS equity invested during the year
•	 LESS distributions received during 
the year
•	 LESS the sale value of disposals during 
the year
•	 PLUS the gains we made from 
disposals in the year over and above the 
Directors’ valuation of those interests
•	 PLUS the ‘discount unwind’ – the 
increase in value as time passes, 
bringing future distributions closer
Together, these changes give us the 
‘rebased’ figure. The rebased figure is 
the roll forward of the prior year valuation, 
adjusted for known movements 
before new wins or changes in  
operational performance.
•	 PLUS new project wins during the year 
•	 PLUS inflation and operational 
performance gains, which reflect 
improvements or reductions in the 
performance of the investments – these 
may be due to changes in inflation, 
changes in demand, revisions to costs 
and other factors. The UK portfolio is 
showing a large gain in performance 
this year, primarily due to the 
recognition of higher inflation to date 
on the M25 concession upon leaving 
construction stage, and more generally 
improvements in forecast inflation 
and costs across the portfolio. The US 
portfolio also shows a large increase 
which is primarily due to higher than 
expected increases in rental allowances 
in US military housing projects
•	 LESS the effect of foreign exchange 
movements on our portfolio value.
Together, these give us the valuation of 
the 61 PPP projects in our portfolio at the 
end of 2013, which includes three projects 
at preferred bidder stage (two in the  
UK portfolio and one in the US).

37 THE Way 
WE WOrk 
The reach of Balfour Beatty  
spans many countries, cultures 
and operating environments.  
It is therefore key that we operate  
to high ethical and professional 
standards regardless of location. 
Our approach to sustainability 
is broad and reflects a 
conviction that sustainability 
strategy should be central  
to how we run the business.
to measure progress against the Zero  
Harm Roadmap and GSPs gap analysis 
performed early in the year. They also 
served as a discussion forum for concerns 
around meeting specific requirements  
and established a process to review  
H&S annual action plans by which each 
successive level of H&S performance  
will be achieved.
In 2014 and beyond, our Zero Harm goals 
of zero fatalities, zero disabling injuries, 
zero injuries to members of the public  
and zero new cases of long term harm  
to health, will remain. As we head into 
2014, we are renewing our focus on the 
elimination of fatal risks and increasing the 
level of personal accountability for safety.
Our overall Group performance once again 
improved in 2013. 
t he Group Accident

In 2013, we set new and 
challenging requirements  
for our business. 
We launched our Zero Harm Roadmap 
that charts the Health and Safety (H&S) 
maturity from a level of minimum 
expectation in 2013 to one of Health and 
Safety excellence by 2017. Alongside the 
Roadmap we introduced our Global Safety 
Principles (GSPs), a set of rules that 
define the way we work, developed as  
a result of investigations into serious 
incidents across the business. Each of  
our business areas has developed plans  
to improve safety in these key areas. 
 Read more about our GSPs online
Despite the overall improvement, there 
were, unfortunately, five work related 
fatalities during 2013 across our Group 
– two in the UK, two in Germany and one 
in our joint venture business in Hong 
Kong. (2012: 8, 2011: 5). All the individuals 
killed were employed by sub contractors. 
In 2013, there were also three non-work 
related fatalities.
Every fatal accident is subject to a thorough 
investigation and a detailed review by the 
Chief Executive and his executive team. 
Lessons learned are shared across the 
Group to help improve future performance 
and prevent it happening again.
As a result of workplace injuries, our 
workers lost 5,996 days during 2013. This 
is an improvement on 2012 (6,342) and a 
significant 35% reduction on 2011 (9,218). 
According to incident data collated and 
prepared by ENCORD (European Network 
of Construction Companies), these  
figures represent some of the lowest 
levels of absence due to workplace 
injuries compared to our competitors 
across Europe. 3,273 total injuries were 
sustained by our workforce in 2013  
which is 15% less than 2012 (3,845). 
From 2014, we have replaced Accident 
Frequency Rate (AFR) with Lost Time 
Injury Rate (LTIR) as our primary lagging 
indicator of H&S performance. LTIR 
includes all lost time injuries and injuries 
resulting in restricted duty and transfers. 
As such, this universally recognised 
measure, is a better indicator towards our 
goal of Zero Harm. For future comparison 
our LTIR in 2013 was 0.23 compared to 
0.26 in 2012 and 0.29 in 2011.
During 2013, 12 Chief Executive reviews 
were held covering each business area  
and joint venture business. These intensive 
reviews allowed Andrew McNaughton

38 ETHICS aNd v alUES
As ever, we continue to emphasise the 
importance of promoting our Ethics 
Helpline and other channels by which 
employees, sub contractors and suppliers, 
and others can raise concerns about 
possible unethical conduct. We have 
witnessed a stabilisation in the number  
of such cases over the last two years,  
but we still receive what we consider  
to be a healthy number, indicating that 
people continue to share our commitment 
to upholding our Code of Conduct.  
We treat each case sensitively and 
investigate it thoroughly.
Since we launched the Code of Conduct 
training, 90% of our office based 
employees have completed module 1  
and 84% have completed module 2.
Unfortunately we do not always get this 
right. We have previously acknowledged 
using the services of the Consulting 
Association up until 2009 to carry out 
reference checks (blacklisting) on 
employees in the construction industry. 
It should not have happened and we have 
apologised to the workers and families 
who may have been adversely affected 
over the years by this.
For Balfour Beatty, this is an historic issue. 
Following the receipt of the Information 
Commissioner’s Enforcement Notice 
in 2009, we took steps to address the 
shortcomings revealed in our data 
protection practices, which included 
the introduction of a Group wide data 
protection policy and a revised ethical 
Code of Conduct, both introduced in 2009.
Balfour Beatty is one of eight UK 
construction companies which have joined 
together to establish The Construction 
Workers Compensation Scheme to 
compensate workers whose names were 
on the Consulting Association database. 
The scheme is expected to launch in 2014.
We have continued to  
embed our ethics, values and 
compliance programme across 
the business, building on the 
sound foundations developed 
over the previous three years 
and focusing in areas where  
we believe we are most at risk.
Through our ongoing cycle of corruption 
risk assessments, training, reviews of 
financial and commercial activities and 
audits of our anti corruption procedures 
we have focused on assessing how well 
embedded our programmes are. 
Human rights have rapidly increased in 
prevalence and are emerging as a new 
ethical risk priority. We view human 
rights primarily as an extension of our 
determination not only to treat our 
employees with respect but also to obtain 
assurance about ethics in our supply 
chain. Wherever we work in the world  
we ensure we do not exploit anyone and 
we will refuse to work with any individual 
or organisation that fails to uphold these 
standards. Intrinsic to our values is our 
belief in upholding the fundamental rights 
and freedoms of individuals set out in  
the United Nations Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights. 
One of the features of 2013 has been  
the gradual increase in the number and 
rigour of questions from clients seeking 
assurance about our ethics and values 
and, specifically, our anti bribery 
compliance programme. Similarly, we 
continue to work with our own supply 
chain to embed a shared commitment to 
ethical business conduct, helped by our 
Code of Conduct for our sub contractors, 
suppliers and partners. 
It is important to do more than just have a 
Code of Conduct. We also need to ensure 
it is properly embedded throughout the 
organisation and that we work with 
partners and suppliers who have similar 
values. We have an extensive programme 
of compliance internally and it is pleasing 
to note that during the year, the Red Flag 
Group awarded us ‘Best Supplier Code of 
Conduct’, describing our Code as “one of 
the most cutting edge, innovative and 
complete codes out there today.”

employee population. However, within 
senior management, this figure is 12.9% 
(2012: 12.3%, 2011: 12.6%). Whilst there 
are many commendable actions taking 
place across the Group in this area, there 
remains considerable work to be done  
to achieve our aspirational ‘best in class’ 
state. We have developed a Diversity 
Action Plan, integrated into our 
Sustainability Roadmap, which includes 
multiple activities to improve the mix  
of our workforce at all levels, including 
proactive recruitment measures, 
unconscious bias training, leadership 
development participation and the 
establishment of affinity networks  
across the business.

being the EMEA based Company with  
the ‘Best Global Mobility Programme

Company also won the silver award  
with the ‘Most Effective Relocation

Beatty had 136 international assignees  
at the start of 2013, with a further 120 
expatriate assignees during the course  
of the year and a further 70 employees 
who either redeployed internationally  
on an immediate local basis or were 
localised during the year. 
We also joined other UK employers in  
the 5% Club to create momentum for 
graduate and apprentice recruitment  
and development, by committing to 5%  
of our workforce to structured training 
schemes in the next five years. To meet 
this commitment, we will be reporting 
progress towards this goal in future

The Group has improved in its 
commitment to diversity and inclusion, 
maintaining our Bronze rating in the UK 
‘Opportunity Now’ and ‘Race for 
Opportunity’ gender and racial diversity 
assessment ratings. We were also 
commended for our leadership 
commitment to diversity and the content 
of our Group diversity strategy and action 
plans. In 2013, of the 125 graduates 
recruited in the UK, 22% were women 
and 18% from an ethnic minority 
background, compared with 101 recruited 
in 2012 of whom 21% were women and 
15% from an ethnic minority background.
In 2013, the Group has sought 
to maintain its commitment to 
development, career progression 
and active talent management 
across its global workforce of 
approximately 40,000 employees. 
The reduction in workforce numbers  
from approximately 50,000 employees 
reported in 2012 is largely related to the 
divestment of WorkPlace in December 
2013. By continuing to invest in the 
capabilities and leadership of our people, 
we continue to both enhance the quality 
of services we deliver to our clients and 
communities and promote the Group as 
an ‘employer of choice’ so we attract  
and retain the best people in our sectors.
Comprehensive training and people 
development programmes are embedded 
within each business area and country,  
as appropriate, to ensure close and timely 
alignment to the specific demands and 
challenges of our respective global 
markets. These are also conducted within 
the context of a Groupwide Organisation 
and People Review (OPR) to ensure 
consistency of methodology and visibility 
to talent, succession planning and career 
opportunity across the Group. The OPR 
also enables the centralised and focused 
development of key leadership talent. 
During 2013, we continued to run a  
small number of centrally sponsored 
development programmes. One 
programme, the Advanced Management 
Programme, is designed to support the 
transition of participants to leadership 
positions and to enable them to network 
and share knowledge with others  
from across the business and different 
functional activities. This was expanded in 
2013 to include ‘unconscious bias’ training 
to enhance our commitment to diversity 
and inclusion amongst our leaders. 
Our agility in deploying talent and 
experience to develop infrastructure 
opportunities across multiple geographies 
is a key differentiator and Balfour Beatty

for Expat Management in recognition of

40 At the beginning of the year  
we revisited our sustainability 
strategy and aligned it more 
closely with the long term goals 
of the business, namely to be 
client focused, embedded in  
the local community, efficient, 
innovative and responsible.
The leading position we now occupy in 
sustainability strategy and performance 
is a consequence of a concerted effort 
to develop knowledge and practice in all 
our businesses over the past seven years. 
In most markets we are a recognised 
sustainability leader and valued adviser 
to our clients.
This position is reflected in our Carbon 
Disclosure project (CDP) score of 87/100, 
which places us second in our sector. 
We were also rated Gold in the BitC  
index. The quality of our reporting was 
once again recognised by the Building 
Public Trust Awards FTSE 250 
Sustainability Report Award where  
we were ‘Highly Commended.’
More importantly, this leading position  
is reflected in the performance we have 
delivered along key dimensions of 
sustainability – such as carbon, waste 
and local employment – for our clients.
standards
Sustainability is an integral part of modern 
infrastructure projects: our public sector 
clients require conformance to standards 
such as BREEAM, LEED and CEEQUAL 
and these are also a key consideration  
for planning authorities. Sustainability  
is allowing us to enrich the dialogue we  
have with our clients. Our knowledge 
allows us to help them achieve the 
required standards efficiently and to 
incorporate features that enhance the 
whole life performance of their projects.
Sustainability advisory services enhance 
our programme management offering. 
For example the Parsons Brinckerhoff 
team secured a renewed commission  
for sustainability advisory services to the 
California High Speed Rail Programme 
this year.

have come down from 264,343 tonnes  
of CO

Our 2015 goal is to achieve a minimum 
reduction of 20% of our Scope 1 and 2 
emissions (against a 2010 baseline). 
These targets will mean reduced 
operating costs for our businesses and 
therefore improved value to our clients 
and shareholders.
Additionally, a number of our clients have 
expressed an intention to prequalify 
contractors on the basis of their carbon 
performance in the future.
Gammon, our joint venture in Hong Kong 
accounts for approximately 22% of our 
Scope 1 and 2 emissions. In 2013, it 
became the first construction company  
in Hong Kong to implement ISO 14064-1, 
the international standard for quantifying 
and reporting greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions, and to have its Scope 1 and 2 
GHGs independently verified. This 
verification was carried out by SGS.

41 Our tax strategy, approved by the 
Board, is to sustainably minimise 
our tax cost whilst complying 
with the law. In doing so, we 
ensure we act in accordance  
with our ethics, values and 
compliance programme. We 
always consider the financial  
and reputational risk arising from 
our management of tax issues, 
with the aim of maximising long 
term shareholder value.
We have an open, honest and positive 
working relationship with HMRC and are 
committed to prompt disclosure and 
transparency in all tax matters. Where 
disputes arise with tax authorities with 
regard to the interpretation and application 
of tax law, we are committed to 
addressing the matter promptly and 
resolving it with the tax authority in an 
open and constructive manner.
The Group makes a major contribution 
to the tax revenues of governments from 
its activities in over 80 countries in which 
we operate. For example, the Group’s 
UK tax contribution extends significantly 
beyond corporate tax, where the size of 
our workforce means we not only collect 
very large amounts of income tax, but 
also pay over £100 million in employer’s 
national insurance contributions in a 
typical year.

GhG reporting and assurance
Our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 
are reported in accordance with the 
UK Government’s GHG reporting 
requirements covering all six Kyoto gases. 
We use the operational control approach 
under the GHG Protocol Corporate 
Accounting and Reporting Standard 
(revised edition) to report emissions from 
our operations around the world. This 
includes assets that are otherwise not 
referred to across the rest of the financial 
statements. We developed reporting 
guidance specific to our business for the 
calculation of GHG emissions which can 
be found online. We have determined  
and reported the emissions we are 
responsible for within this boundary 
and do not believe there are any material 
omissions. We use the UK Government’s 
carbon conversion factors that were 
updated in 2013 to calculate our 
emissions into equivalent tonnes  
of carbon dioxide (CO
2
e). 
We have incorporated landlord  
emissions data for the properties we  
rent or lease (where we are not the  
utility bill payer) to meet the new GHG 
reporting requirements. We have also 
incorporated emissions data for Parsons 
Brinckerhoff North America and Indonesia 
in the 2013 data set; these were not 
reported previously.
We have restated our Scope 2 emissions 
to account for the Government’s changes 
to electricity conversion factors (ie the 
removal of the grid rolling average) and 
updated our emissions data for 2010, 
2011, and 2012 as a result.
We engaged KPMG LLP to undertake  
a limited assurance engagement, 
reporting to Balfour Beatty only, using  
the International Standard on Assurance 
Engagements (‘ISAE’) 3410: ‘Assurance 
Engagements on Greenhouse Gas 
Statements’ and ISAE 3000: ‘Assurance 
Engagements Other Than Audits  
or Reviews of Historical Financial 
Information’ over the selected greenhouse 
gas (GHG) performance data that have 
been marked in this report with the 
symbol ∆ (see table on page 41).
KPMG LLP has provided an unqualified 
opinion in relation to the selected GHG 
performance data and their full assurance 
opinion is available in the sustainability 
section of our website.

The level of assurance provided for  
a limited assurance engagement is 
substantially lower than a reasonable 
assurance engagement. In order to reach 
their opinion, KPMG LLP performed a 
range of procedures which included 
interviews with management, examination 
of reporting processes and documentation, 
as well as selected data testing at an 
operating company and Head Office level. 
A summary of the work they performed is 
included within their assurance opinion.
Non financial performance information, 
GHG quantification in particular, is subject 
to more inherent limitations than financial 
information. It is important to read the 
selected GHG performance information 
contained within the Annual Report and 
Accounts 2013 in the context of KPMG 
LLP’s full limited assurance opinion.

42 Our business helps build healthy 
communities and we strive to 
achieve this as well through  
the community engagement 
programmes we support. 
Through the Balfour Beatty Charitable 
Trust, we work in partnership with 
charitable partners in the UK and support, 
through funding and volunteering effort, 
specific projects which are targeted at 
improving the employability and 
employment opportunities of young 
disadvantaged people. We also believe 
that participation in sport has an important 
role to play in helping build self-confidence, 
team skills and healthy lifestyles.
With unemployment amongst young 
people at such high levels in many of our 
markets, this theme particularly resonates 
with us and with our employees. We have 
the opportunity to help nurture the next 
generation of workers, not only for their 
own health and well-being, but also more 
broadly, for the wider economy and our 
sectors, in particular. 
In the UK, through our charitable trust, we 
have built strong relationships with Action 
for Children, the Coram Foundation and 
the Prince’s Trust and, in addition from 
2013, with a new partner, Barnardo’s. 
Since 2009, via a mix of employee 
fundraising and core financial support 
CONNECTING WITH OUr COMMUNITIES
provided by the Company, our Trust has 
contributed over £2 million, as well as 
having been instrumental in organising 
in-kind support, including employee 
volunteering. 
Outside the UK, our businesses and 
employees participate in a wide range of 
community-led activities, contributing 
both financially and through volunteering.
In the US, we have developed our 
Community Involvement Challenge, which 
provides employees of Parsons 
Brinckerhoff with the opportunity to take 
part in a friendly but competitive challenge 
to create community engagement events 
outside the workplace. Not only does this 
help teamwork but, in 2013, over 7,000 
hours of volunteering effort and over 220 
pints of blood have been donated by staff. 
Our US construction business, has 
adopted the Balfour Beatty Spirit 
programme which has contributed over 
US$1.4 million to a variety of charitable 
causes. Examples of our charitable 
projects include:
•	 building or refurbishing more than 65 
houses for elderly low income residents 
of Dallas through the Hearts & Hammers 
programme – an 18 year commitment
•	 donating pro bono construction services 
to build the Castle of Miracles and other 
facilities at Give Kids the World Village in 
Orlando, Florida, this provides seriously 
ill children and their families with a well 
deserved escape and a week of fun  
in Disney theme parks
•	 building school playgrounds for disabled 
children in Charlotte, North Carolina.
In South Africa, we have been examining 
how we can work more strategically and 
long term with social enterprises, charities 
and schools and have provided financial 
support to help with food and shelter for 
poor, homeless and unemployed mothers 
and their children. In Australia, we have 
been helping to maintain essential 
infrastructure in remote aboriginal 
communities and have provided essential 
training in carrying out day-to-day tasks 
like cleaning solar panels and checking 
fuel levels. 
Balfour Beatty has been the lead sponsor 
of the London Youth Games since 2008. 
During this period, participation in the 
Games has multiplied fourfold. For our 
business it brings multiple benefits 
including engaging our employees who 
volunteer at the Games, supporting 
government relations, helping client 
relationships and supporting the 
communities around London where 
we operate.
Despite the adverse economic conditions 
which have existed over recent years 
and which inevitably has led to variable 
contribution levels, we are enormously 
proud of the way our employees have 
continued to engage with and support 
our core charitable programmes. 
GET INTO & THE pr INCE’S Tr UST
In 2013, we provided 11 young unemployed Londoners with a step  
up on the career ladder through the Prince’s Trust’s ‘Get into’  
construction programme. ‘Get into’ provides young disadvantaged  
people with the skills and confidence they need to find a job. 
Since 2009, we have supported more than 200 young people across the UK 
through work placements on ‘Get into’. This is the fourth of 18 courses 
planned and we remain committed to sharing our knowledge and expertise 
with young people to help them get into work and develop their careers.

INTrO dUCTION
Balfour Beatty is committed to applying the 
very highest standards of corporate governance 
wherever it operates.
We have continued to apply the 
UK Corporate Governance Code 
and, in respect to its main 
principles, I would like to draw 
your attention to the following:
Leadership and effectiveness
Our areas of focus for the Board in 2013 
and 2014 are summarised in the adjacent 
column. In the pages which follow, I have 
set out how we have been addressing 
these items as a Board; whether through 
the Directors collectively, or via the Board 
Committee structure.
The transition from Ian Tyler to 
Andrew McNaughton as Chief Executive, 
went smoothly.
During 2013, two of our non-executive 
Directors, Mike Donovan and Hubertus 
Krossa, retired after several years of 
successful service on the Board. Both 
have been replaced, as referred to in 
my Chairman’s Review on page 1, with 
Directors who bring with them, amongst 
other things, a wealth of experience of 
related sectors and a sound knowledge 
of building businesses in an international 
and professional services environment. 
Although Belinda Richards and Bill 
Thomas only joined us in September 
2013, they have already attended several 
Board and Committee meetings as well 
as strategy working group meetings. 
They have also given significant time to 
participating in a comprehensive induction 
programme which has enabled them to 
meet with senior leaders in each part 
of our business.
Diversity
We have reported elsewhere in this report 
on our diversity and inclusion programme, 
which extends over a three-year 
timeframe to 2015. Belinda Richards was 
appointed as our second female Director 
increasing the female composition of our 
Board to 20%. Although, as a policy, we 
strongly support greater diversity in all its 
forms, not least gender diversity, as an 
important objective for the Group, we  
do not believe in the concept of gender 
quotas, our preferred approach being 
Areas of focus in 2013
•	 Transition to new Chief Executive
•	 Appointment of two non-executive 
Directors
•	 Operational delivery – focus on 
Construction Services UK and 
implementation of its recovery plan
•	 Implementation of business strategy 
– concentrated focus on key 
recovery markets, UK and US
•	 Remuneration policy review – 
dialogue with shareholders 
completed in Q1 2013. No 
fundamental changes to the policy 
proposed for 2014.
Areas of focus in 2014
•	 Operational delivery
•	 Financial performance including 
cash generation.
much more directed at merit, experience 
and skills. More information on our 
diversity programme across the 
organisation is set out on page 40.
Accountability
We continue to believe that the 
Company’s policies and procedures 
enable the Board to present a fair, 
balanced and understandable assessment 
of the Group’s trading position and its 
prospects. We continue to keep under 
review the terms of reference of the 
Board and its Committees and will make 
adjustments as considered necessary. 
Any changes to the terms of reference 
are published on our corporate website. 
Towards the end of 2013, the Audit 
Committee carried out a comprehensive 
review of its terms of reference in light 
of best practice, which culminated in a 
proposal coming forward to the Board in 
January 2014. The proposal was accepted 
and the Audit Committee has now been 
renamed the Audit, Risk & Assurance 
Committee to reflect this increased 
level of focus on risk more generally. 
The Committee will, in future, meet 
five times each year with a separate 
meeting concentrated entirely on risk 
related matters.

Remuneration
In Q1 2013, the Remuneration Committee 
carried out a limited consultation exercise 
with major shareholders on the structure 
and targets of the annual incentive plan 
and the long term performance share 
plan. These proposals were broadly 
accepted by those shareholders and the 
proposals were subsequently included 
in our Remuneration Report, which was 
submitted to shareholders for approval, 
at the Annual General Meeting in 
May 2013. Although the resolution had 
an overwhelming majority, we were 
disappointed that there was a 25% vote 
against the Remuneration Report. We had 
not received any notification ahead of the 
AGM that there was any disquiet with the 
content of the report and, in the absence 
of any information to the contrary, believe 
balfourbeatty.com/ar2013 Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2013
44 this understandably reflected shareholder 
concerns following the publication of our 
trading update in April which signalled 
a poor performance in Construction 
Services UK. We will continue to maintain 
our close dialogue with shareholders on 
remuneration matters. The remuneration 
policy will be subject to a binding vote for 
the first time at our AGM in May 2014.
Relations with shareholders
Our investor relations programme remains 
of critical importance to the Board and 
this is why, at each of our meetings, 
we receive a comprehensive report from 
our investor relations team, as well as 
receiving, at regular intervals, updates 
from analysts and the feedback from any 
meetings which the Directors, including 
myself, may have held with shareholders. 
Further information on our investor 
programme is set out on page 65. Our 
continued commitment of resources and 
time to investor communication in our 
major home market of the US continues 
to derive benefits and around 16% of our 
share capital continues to be held by US 
investors. We will continue to seek out 
ways how this proportion might grow 
over time.

47 Compliance with the Code
The UK Corporate Governance Code 2012 
(the Code) is the standard applying to 
good corporate governance practice in the 
UK and the Financial Conduct Authority 
requires listed companies to disclose 
whether they have complied with the 
provisions of the Code throughout the 
financial year.
The Company has complied with the 
requirements of the Code throughout the 
accounting period, other than in respect 
of the effectiveness of the Group’s 
whistleblowing procedures which is kept 
under review by the Business Practices 
Committee and not by the Audit, Risk & 
Assurance Committee. The principal reason 
for this is that the Business Practices 
Committee, in particular, focuses on the 
Company’s business conduct, its ethics and 
values, ensuring that procedures exist for 
employees to raise concerns in confidence 
and is an integral element in its overall 
remit. However, the Audit, Risk & 
Assurance Committee is kept informed 
of any allegations of fraud or poor financial 
controls and internal audit participates in 
investigations into such claims and reports 
to that Committee on the outcome.
Directors’ independence
At its Board meeting in March 2014, 
as part of its annual audit of corporate 
governance, the Board considered the 
independence of the non-executive 
Directors against the criteria specified 
in the Code and determined that each 
of them continues to be independent.
t he Board
The Board currently comprises 10 
Directors, of whom seven, including 
the Chairman, are non-executive. 
Details of the changes during the year 
can be found under the heading 
“Board composition” below.
Board composition
The names of the Directors at the year 
end are shown on pages 46 and 47 
together with brief biographical details. 
Full details of Directors’ service 
agreements, emoluments and share 
interests are shown in the Remuneration 
Report starting on page 68.
Belinda Richards and Bill Thomas were 
appointed as non-executive Directors on 
1 September 2013. Ian Tyler, Hubertus 
Krossa and Mike Donovan retired from 
the Board on 31 March, 16 May and 
1 October respectively. Mr Tyler remained 
as an employee until 30 April 2013.

48 Each of the Directors brings skills and 
experience which enhance the quality of 
debate in the boardroom and provides 
guidance. The Directors believe that the 
Board continues to include an appropriate 
balance of skills and retains the ability to 
provide effective leadership. Having said 
this, there is a need to introduce further 
sector specific experience amongst the 
non-executive Directors and the Board 
will be considering how it might best 
address this over the coming months. 
There are, however, areas where the 
non-executive Directors, in particular, 
bring with them a wealth of insight and, 
although not exhaustive, some of 
their most significant strengths are 
highlighted below.
Matters reserved for the Board
The Board is collectively responsible for 
the success of the Company and has a 
formal schedule of matters reserved for 
its decision which includes the matters 
summarised below:
•	 determining the Group’s strategic 
direction
•	 approving annual budgets and financial 
reporting, including the annual and 
half-year results and interim 
management statements
•	 approving interim, and recommending 
final, dividends
•	 approving major acquisitions, disposals 
and capital expenditure
•	 ensuring the necessary financial and 
human resources are in place to achieve 
objectives and review management 
performance
•	 setting the Company’s values and 
ethical standards
•	 approving policies and systems for 
risk management and assurance.
The Board reviewed its list of reserved 
matters, most recently, at its meeting in 
March 2014. The terms of reference of 
the Board and the Board Committees are 
available on request from the Company 
Secretary and are also displayed on the 
Company’s website. Descriptions of the 
specific responsibilities which have been 
delegated to the Chief Executive and to 
the principal Board Committees are also 
provided on page 50 and pages 55 to 61.

49 Chairman and Chief Executive
The two roles are complementary. 
The Chairman is responsible for managing 
the business of the Board, whilst the 
Chief Executive actually runs the 
business. As the senior executive officer 
of the Company, the Chief Executive is 
responsible to the Chairman and Board 
for directing and prioritising the profitable 
operation and development of the Group. 
The Chairman and Chief Executive keep 
each other appropriately informed on the 
other’s current activities.
Specifically, their roles comprise 
the principal responsibilities in the 
sections following:
Chairman’s responsibilities
•	 Ensuring effective strategic planning is 
undertaken by the executive Directors
•	 Ensuring corporate governance is 
properly maintained
•	 Formally appraising the performance 
of the Chief Executive and reviewing 
with the Chief Executive his views 
on the performance of the other 
executive Directors
•	 Providing leadership to the Board
•	 Acting as senior ambassador for 
the Company
•	 Considering Board balance, composition 
and succession
•	 Ensuring the smooth operation of the 
Board and its Committees
•	 Providing effective communication 
between the Board and its shareholders.
Steve Marshall spends an average of 
two days a week on Company business. 
The Board is satisfied that his role as 
non-executive chairman of two other 
companies, and his other business and 
charitable commitments, can be 
accommodated without hindering his 
ability to carry out his duties as Chairman. 
Chief Executive’s responsibilities
•	 Strategy development and the 
stewardship of physical, financial and 
human resources
•	 Group operational and financial 
performance
•	 Executive leadership
•	 Health, safety and environmental 
performance
•	 Corporate values and ethics
•	 Objective setting for the senior 
management team
•	 Organisational structure, succession 
and talent management
•	 Major capital expenditure prioritisation 
and allocation of resources
•	 Consideration of acquisitions, disposals 
and financing
•	 Stakeholder management.
Senior Independent Director
As Senior Independent Director, 
Iain Ferguson’s principal responsibilities 
are to ensure that the views of the other 
non-executive Directors are properly 
considered and to provide an additional 
communication channel between the 
non-executive Directors and the 
shareholders and other stakeholders, 
as required. Mr Ferguson meets with the 
other non-executive Directors without the 
Chairman or executive Directors being 
present at least once a year.
Directors’ interests
No Director had any material interest in 
any contract of significance with the 
Group during the period under review. 
The Directors have put in place 
procedures to ensure the Board 
collectively, and the Directors individually, 
comply with the disclosure requirements 
on conflicts of interest set out in the 
Companies Act 2006. At its meeting each 
January, a formal declaration of interests 
is reviewed by the Board.
The interests of Directors in the share 
capital of the Company and its subsidiary 
undertakings and their interests under 
the long term incentive scheme (the 
Performance Share Plan), the Deferred 
Bonus Plan, the Share Incentive Plan and 
share options are set out in the tables in 
the Remuneration Report commencing 
on page 68.
Directors’ indemnities
The Company grants an indemnity to all 
of its Directors to the extent permitted 
by law. These indemnities are uncapped 
in relation to losses and liabilities which 
Directors may incur to third parties in 
the course of acting as a Director of the 
Company, or in any office where such 
duties are performed at the request of the 
Board, or as a result of their appointment 
as Directors.
Board meetings
Procedures for Board meetings remain 
largely unchanged from previous years. 
The Company Secretary is responsible 
for advising the Board on appropriate 
governance matters and for ensuring 
good information flow and that Board 
procedures are properly followed. He also 
provides updates on legal matters of 
relevance to the Group and is available 
to individual Directors for advice on 
Board procedures.
2013 meeting programme
In 2013, in part due to the difficult trading 
conditions encountered in the early part of 
the year, the Board met on 13 occasions. 
All these meetings, except one, were held 
at the Company’s head office in London. 
The Board also visited the headquarters 
of Infrastructure Investments and 
participated in a comprehensive briefing 
on the case for disposal of hospital and 
school PPP investments in 2013 and a 
detailed consideration of the division’s 
wider portfolio.
Each Board meeting normally lasts four 
to five hours but can be longer.
On the evening preceding a Board 
meeting, the Directors generally meet for 
dinner and sometimes take the opportunity 
to discuss predetermined developmental 
themes, led by one of the executive 
Directors, other senior managers or a 
specialist external speaker. For example, 
in 2013, one of the themes focused on 
investor relations. One of the dinners each 
year is attended by the Chairman and the 
non-executive Directors only, whilst a 
second includes the Chief Executive, but 
none of the other executive Directors.
Each Board meeting addresses key 
strategic topics for the Group which 
enable the Directors to engage in detailed 
reviews. The Board also considers at each 
of its meetings monthly updates from the 
Chief Executive and the Chief Financial 
Officer. Regular reports are also provided 
on health, safety and environment, 
operational performance, corporate 
communications, risk management and 
assurance, investor relations and any legal 
issues. At each meeting, the chairs of the 
various Board Committees provide a 
summary of the discussions held at the 
preceding Committee meeting and the 
key actions arising.

50 2013 Board topics
The following topics were also addressed 
by the Board during 2013 under each of 
the themes shown. For clarity, a synopsis 
of certain of the topics has been included 
as well.
The Board specifically addressed the 
Chief Executive’s objectives for 2013 
which identified those key tasks over and 
above his normal responsibilities, which 
include ensuring that the Group achieves 
its overall budget performance. This was 
of particular relevance in light of Andrew 
McNaughton’s promotion. Where 
appropriate, each of the objectives had 
identified milestones and each one was 
integral in moving the organisation 
forward along its stated path. Specific 
objectives included the development of 
the market sector structure and market 
entry strategies, the pursuit of the four 
principal efficiency projects across the 
Group, the disposal of the Mainland 
European rail business and the continued 
development and progress of the Zero 
Harm safety programme.
As mentioned above, the Board met an 
unprecedented 13 times during 2013 
driven by:
•	 the operational delivery and financial 
performance issues which had emerged 
and culminated in the trading update 
in April
•	 the disposal of Balfour Beatty 
WorkPlace.
After ensuring that suitable stabilisation 
measures had been put in place in 
Construction Services UK where the 
issues had arisen, the Directors 
concentrated on monitoring progress 
against the performance improvement 
plan which had been drawn up by the 
divisional management team.
Finance
•	 Budgets 2013 and 2014
•	 Annual and half-year results including 
pre-close statements
•	 Dividend strategy
•	 Financing capacity and options – future 
cash needs of the Group and approval 
of both a US private placement and an 
issue of convertible bonds in 2013
•	 Trading updates.
Operational performance
•	 Health and safety – performance across 
the Group and the status of the Zero 
Harm programme
•	 Efficiency programme – reviews of each 
of the four principal cost reduction and 
efficiency programmes and monitoring 
their progress against predetermined 
measures and milestones
•	 Business reviews – operating 
performance against budget and 
strategic plan, risks and opportunities 
and matters such as health and 
safety, people development and 
sustainability, including:
 − International (Middle East, India, 
Brazil, Australia)
 − Construction Services UK – 
performance and plan of action
 − Construction Services US
 − Professional Services
 − Rail
 − Infrastructure Investments
•	 Infrastructure fund – the infrastructure 
fund enables the Group to utilise a 
combination of infrastructure asset 
knowledge, skills and experience to 
earn a superior return on capital, as well 
as advisory fees. The Board received 
progress updates on how this business 
was progressing including information 
on investments made in the year.
HR
•	 Transition to new Chief Executive
•	 People planning, talent and succession 
management – review of detailed 
divisional management succession 
plans, the encouragement of cross-
divisional and cross-geographical moves 
and diversity and inclusion policies and 
practices across the Group, including 
associated action plans
•	 Organisational structure
•	 Pensions.

The number shown in brackets is the total number of meetings the Director could attend during the year (including as a result of 
changes to Committee memberships). 
Non-attendance at meetings was due to illness or prior business commitments. In each case, where the Directors have not been able 
to attend a Board or Committee meeting, they have reviewed the papers circulated for that meeting and provided their comments 
directly to the Chairman, or the Committee chair, as appropriate.
Any Director who is not a Committee member has an open invitation to attend any Committee meeting and a number of the Directors 
took this opportunity during the year. For example, Messrs Marshall, Magrath and McNaughton each attended all the Audit, Risk & 
Assurance Committee meetings in 2013, including Sub-Committee meetings, whilst Mr Ferguson attended three Sub-Committee 
meetings. The Business Practices Committee was also attended on each occasion by Mr McNaughton.
Further information about the work of each of the Board’s Committees may be found on pages 55 to 61.
Strategy
•	 Group strategy development and 
structuring options – development of 
the business model to help differentiate 
and enable the organisation to operate 
as a connected services group as the 
most effective way to deliver greater 
value to our clients, to improve 
operating performance and cost 
effectiveness and enhance shareholder 
value. Consideration was given to the 
shape of the operating model and how 
the Group might best develop the core 
UK and US markets and strengthen the 
business in other specific geographies
•	 Rail strategy and business review.
Mergers, acquisitions and divestments
•	 Acquisition reviews covering the period 
from 2000 to 2012. This incorporated a 
detailed analysis of the Parsons 
Brinckerhoff acquisition in 2009 and 
crucially, the lessons learned from each 
of these acquisitions
•	 Disposal of Balfour Beatty WorkPlace
•	 Approval of Infrastructure Investment 
asset disposals in 2013:
 − Tameside and Salford Hospitals
 − Four Midlands-based schools projects 
 − Carlisle Northern Development 
Route and A30/A35 roads (partial 
equity disposal)
 − Exeter Airport.
Risk
•	 Risk management review – Australia 
and New Zealand.
For 2014, the Board is scheduled to meet 
eight times. One meeting will focus on 
the development of the strategic plan. 
At least one meeting will be held outside 
London at one of the Group’s business 
units and one meeting will be held 
overseas, most likely in the US, to link 
with our businesses in this geography.

52 During 2013, the non-executive Directors 
visited three projects in the UK where they 
received detailed briefings and met with 
senior management and project personnel:
•	 power transmission project in Kent 
(Canterbury–Sellinge overhead line 
refurbishment scheme)
•	 student accommodation  
(King’s Cross, London)
•	 Crossrail (Whitechapel, London).
Owing to the increased Board meeting 
commitment in 2013, as well as additional 
meetings of the Audit, Risk & Assurance 
Committee and separate business 
strategy working group sessions, the 
number of visits organised for the 
non-executive Directors was reduced. 
In 2014, three visits are planned for 
the non-executive Directors which will 
concentrate, as in previous years, on key 
strategic topics. The first visit has been 
organised and will focus on Construction 
Services UK. One of the three visits 
in 2014 will be to the US.
Board development
Induction
Directors undertake a thorough induction 
programme and receive a range of 
information about the Company when 
they join the Board, including access to 
the Board portal, which includes Balfour 
Beatty’s Code of Conduct, processes 
for dealing in Balfour Beatty shares and 
Board procedures, as well as the minutes 
and papers of past Board and Board 
Committee meetings. In addition, they 
also take part in a series of one-to-one 
meetings with other members of the 
Board and senior executives which include 
briefings on the Company’s business 
strategy, financial procedures, business 
development, legal and other key issues.
In the case of Ms Richards and Mr Thomas, 
this process commenced immediately on 
their appointment on 1 September 2013 
and was substantially completed by the 
end of the year. In addition to meeting 
the UK-based divisional CEOs, both 
non-executive Directors have met with 
the CEOs of Professional Services and 
Construction Services US in the UK. 
It is our intention to organise visits for 
both Ms Richards and Mr Thomas to 
the US in 2014, when any remaining 
segments of their induction programme 
will be completed.
Professional development
In discussion with the Directors and 
Company Secretary, each year the 
Chairman determines whether there are 
any specific training needs identified by 
the Directors, which can be addressed 
either by the topic being included at a 
future Board meeting or on a one-to-one 
basis. Directors are also enrolled in 
the Deloitte Academy, a seminar-led 
programme for directors of UK listed 
companies, which provides regular 
updates throughout the year on the 
principal governance and other matters 
of which directors of a listed company 
should be fully aware.
The Directors’ induction programme also 
provides the foundation for continuing 
professional development. This takes 
place throughout the year by way of a 
series of internal and external updates, 
including visits to operating companies 
to meet local management and visits to 
Balfour Beatty projects, both in the UK 
and overseas.

evolution of 
Board culture 
and future 
composition
The Board has been refreshed in 2013 with the recruitment of two new non-executive Directors, including 
a second female Director. Both the new non-executive Directors bring with them a proven track record in 
professional services, which will boost the Board’s overall sector specific experience. Further strengthening  
of the sector specific experience will be addressed during 2014.
The appointment of the new Chief Executive in 2013 afforded a valuable opportunity to effect structural and 
cultural changes within the organisation. A strong relationship exists between the Chairman and the Chief 
Executive and there is a constructive level of non-executive Director oversight.
Development 
of competitive 
benchmarking
In response to today’s rapidly changing environment and new business model, more time has and will be spent on 
competitors and clients. A re-definition of the Group’s value proposition has been included as part of the strategy 
review. There has been greater challenge on the divisional landscape, market trends and expectations. The identification 
of better benchmarking processes and evolving client needs are both areas being pursued through 2014.
Improvements 
to forecasting, 
the oversight 
of risk and the 
internal audit 
function
The Chief Financial Officer and the Audit, Risk & Assurance Committee have worked hard to provide reliable 
historical financial reporting and the development of KPIs has been helpful. Through the work which has been 
undertaken in Construction Services UK, with management’s focus on both leading and lagging indicators, 
forecasting has been high on the Board’s agenda and will continue to be so through 2014.
The Audit, Risk & Assurance Committee has conducted a series of risk management “deep dives” across a 
number of the divisions. There will be a continuing focus on developing robust processes that capture critical risks 
and provide perspectives from divisional executives on key and emerging risks, potential options and responses. 
The Committee has also undertaken a review of the long term development of the internal audit function, 
the conclusions of which are being implemented during 2014.
 
Board evaluation
Introduction
In keeping with the Code, the Board 
receives external evaluations, normally 
every three years, with internal 
evaluations in the intervening two years. 
Prior to 2013, the last external evaluation 
was carried out in 2010.
For 2014, the evaluation will be conducted 
using internal resources, the output from 
which will be reported in 2015.
2013 evaluation
The Board appointed Boardroom Review

During the review, evidence was garnered 
from in depth interviews with each of the 
Directors and other senior management 
personnel and from the observation of the

•	 assess the independence, objectivity 
and effectiveness of the external auditor 
and develop and implement policy on 
the engagement of the external auditor 
to supply non-audit services
•	 review the integrity of the statement 
in the Annual Report on ‘fair, balanced 
and understandable’ required under the 
Companies Act 2006.
Graham Roberts, a Fellow of the Institute 
of Chartered Accountants and a former 
partner at Andersen and finance director 
of The British Land Company, has been 
identified by the Board as having recent 
and relevant financial experience. Minutes 
of Committee meetings are circulated 
to all Board members.
Partners from the external auditor, 
the Heads of Group Risk Management 
and Assurance and Internal Audit, and 
the Chief Financial Officer regularly 
attend each meeting. In addition, any 
independent non-executive Director 
who is not a Committee member has an 
open invitation to attend meetings. The 
Committee also invites other executives 
from within the Group to participate 
in Committee discussions.
s ummary of activities in 2013
In 2013, the Committee’s work 
programme focused on a number of 
significant issues and other accounting 
judgements where the Committee 
believed the highest level of judgement 
was required and with the highest 
potential impact on the Group’s financial 
statements. Further information is set out 
on page 56. The Committee’s standing 
agenda items comprised reports on:
•	 accounting, financial and regulatory 
issues
•	 review of non-audit work carried out 
by the external auditors, and their fees
•	 risk management activities 
and compliance
•	 implementation of and progress against 
the Group assurance plan.
The Committee thoroughly reviews these 
reports at each of its meetings and is able 
to question management at both Group 
and divisional levels to gain any further 
insight into the issues addressed in these 
reports. As well as the standing agenda 
items, the Committee also reviewed 
comprehensive papers on major litigation 
and tax, in the latter case, approving how 
the Group’s tax strategy should evolve. 
The Committee also received a 
presentation from the UK governmental 
department responsible on the threats 
of cyber security and considered the 
proposals which had been made to 
mitigate against these risks. Messrs 
Marshall and Roberts also participated  
in a survey on cyber security issued by  
the UK Government.
Response to Csu K operational issues
The Committee established a Sub-
Committee in May, chaired by Mr Roberts 
and comprising non-executive Directors, 
to monitor and oversee the performance 
of Construction Services UK and the plan 
of action which the divisional management 
team had devised to deliver the required 
operational and financial performance in 
2013. In addition, the Sub-Committee also 
reviewed the remit and structure of the 
internal audit function including its annual 
plan. The Sub-Committee met on four 
separate occasions and received detailed 
briefings on each occasion from senior 
management in Construction Services UK.
Fair, balanced and understandable
With the introduction of the Companies 
Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’ 
Report) Regulations 2013, the Board has 
been particularly mindful of the need to 
provide a balanced and comprehensive 
analysis of the Company’s development 
and performance during the year and the 
position at the year end. The Audit, Risk  
& Assurance Committee has assisted 
in achieving this objective by reviewing 
proposals for the internal procedures to 
be applied in preparing the Annual Report 
and the verification process. The 
Committee received a briefing on the 
approach proposed by management and 
members received drafts of the Annual 
Report for comment earlier than had been 
the case in previous years, as have all the 
Directors more generally. The content has 
also been shared at an earlier stage with 
external auditors and other external 
advisers in order that they can help 
identify whether there are any material 
inconsistencies between the strategic 
report, the other narrative sections and 
the financial statements.

55 s ignificant issues and other accounting judgements
In forming its view of the significant issues and accounting judgements for the year ended 31 December 2013, the Committee 
took into consideration the views of management and the external auditor through a combination of written reports and discussion. 
On page 55 attention is drawn to the action taken by the Committee following the trading update in April 2013 and the focus on 
Construction Services UK. In addition, the following significant issues and judgements were carefully considered:
Revenue and 
margin 
recognition
Given the nature of the Group’s operations these elements are central to how the Group values the work it has 
carried out. Having reviewed detailed reports and met with management, the Committee considered those 
contract and commercial issues where there was exposure to both revenue and margin recognition risks. The 
Committee received a report from management showing the outcomes of earlier projects which enabled the 
Committee to gain an overall impression on whether management was being overly optimistic or pessimistic 
in its conclusions. As a key area of audit focus the Committee also received a detailed written report from the 
external auditor setting out the results of its work in relation to key contract judgements.
Carrying value 
of goodwill 
and other 
intangibles
The judgement largely relates to the assumptions underlying the value in use of the cash generating units, 
primarily the achievement of the three year strategic plan and the macro economic assumptions (such as 
discount rates) underpinning the valuation process. The Committee received reports from management 
outlining the basis of the assumptions used. The strategic plan was approved by the Board. In addition, 
the external auditor provided detailed written reports to the Committee in this area. During the year, the 
Committee reviewed the impairment assessment of the European Rail businesses carried out by management 
and concluded that an impairment charge of £38m should be recorded in relation to Rail Germany.
Accounting for 
acquisitions 
and disposals
For a disposal, the Committee considers the judgement around whether a business should be treated as held 
for sale and classified as a discontinued operation. In doing so it reviews management’s position and the Group 
strategy and evaluates the likelihood that the business will be disposed of within a 12 month period and whether 
it constitutes a separate major line of business. There were no acquisitions in 2013.
Going concern In order to satisfy itself that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable 
future and that there are no material uncertainties that could lead to significant doubt as to the Group’s ability to 
continue as a going concern, the Committee considered the Group’s cash position (both existing and projected), 
bank facilities and covenants (including bonding lines) and the borrowing powers allowed under the Company’s 
Articles of Association. The Committee subsequently recommended to the Board the adoption of the going 
concern statement for inclusion in the Annual Report.
n on-
underlying 
items
The key judgement is whether the items being considered relate to the underlying trading or not and whether 
they have been presented in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy in this area. The Committee 
conducted an in-depth review of each of the non-underlying items receiving written reports from management 
and the external auditor as to their quantum and nature. Specifically, the Committee reviewed the curtailment 
charge arising in the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund, the restructuring of a number of the Group’s businesses 
and the European Rail and Balfour Beatty WorkPlace disposals.
Provisions The Committee reviewed the significant judgements relating to provisions, including litigation and other risks. 
The Committee received detailed reports, including relevant legal advice.
Retirement 
benefits
The key judgement relates to the assumptions underlying the valuation of the retirement benefit obligation. 
The Committee received reports from management outlining the assumptions used, including input from the 
Group’s actuaries, in particular in relation to discount rates, inflation and mortality which were evaluated against 
external benchmarks and, in relation to which, the external auditor also provided reports.
Deferred tax 
assets
The Group’s strategic plan is reviewed together with considerations on future profitability to evaluate the 
judgement that it is probable the deferred tax assets are recoverable. Taking into account the past, the 
Committee has to assess how credible the future view of the business is through its strategic plan.
Directors’ 
valuation of PPP 
concessions
The Committee assessed the methodology used to value the assets in terms of the discount rate applied.  
It also critically appraised the output of the Directors’ valuation exercise.
Areas of focus in 2014
In 2014, the Committee will continue to address the topics on its standing agenda and will also continue to undertake reviews of the 
risk management and assurance practices across the Group on a rolling programme. A fifth meeting will be organised specifically to 
focus on the risk management agenda itself. The Committee will also continue to receive training in order to broaden and refresh the 
skills and knowledge of its members.

56 and level of authority required before 
the external auditor can be considered 
to undertake such services. Included 
within such analysis is consideration of 
the cost and efficiency benefits as well 
as the real or perceived threats to 
auditor independence.
There is no inconsistency between the 
Financial Reporting Council’s ethical 
standards and the Company’s policy. 
In 2013, the external auditor was 
appointed to carry out various non-audit 
related work, including corporate finance 
services for reasons of commercial 
confidentiality and efficiency as well as 
tax advice and compliance services in 
Australia, Europe, South Africa and the US.
The Committee considers that the 
Company receives particular benefits, 
including those relating to cost, quality and 
consistency, from the advice provided by 
its external auditor, given its wide and 
detailed knowledge of the Group and its 
international operations. There can also 
be savings in management time and 
accelerated delivery of work in situations 
where rapid turnaround is required. The 
majority of non-audit related work (71% by 
value) was carried out using the services 
of major international audit firms other 
than Deloitte.
Annual assessment of the  
audit processes
In addition to receiving written reports 
from the auditors (both internal and 
external) and management, the 
Committee also conducted separate 
private meetings with the auditors and 
with management. These provide the 
opportunity for open dialogue and 
feedback on the audit process, the 
responsiveness of management and the 
effectiveness of individual internal and 
external audit teams.
A detailed assessment of the external 
audit process and the effectiveness of 
the external auditor, together with any 
identified improvement recommendations 
is prepared each year. Each division and 
operating company within the Group is 
required to evaluate the performance of 
the assigned external audit team and to 
compare that performance against the 
previous year.
The external auditor’s annual transparency 
report for the year ended 31 May 2013 
was reviewed. This was prepared in 
accordance with the provisions of the 
Statutory Auditors (Transparency) 
Instrument 2008 made by the 
Professional Oversight Board of the 
Financial Reporting Council.
External auditor rotation
Audit partners have been rotated every 
five years. The advisory partner changed 
in 2010 and the audit engagement 
partner changed in 2011. Deloitte’s 
first audit report for the Company was 
completed in 2003 and there has not been 
a tender for external audit services in the 
intervening period.
A number of circumstances would lead 
to consideration being given to carrying 
out an audit tender review. For example:
•	 in circumstances where the external 
auditor’s performance had been called 
into question, or where, through the 
audit partner rotation process, no 
suitable replacement had been identified
•	 where value for money considerations 
had arisen
•	 where there was a real or perceived 
threat to independence
•	 where conflict of interests had 
been identified
•	 where issues had been raised about 
audit quality by a regulator.
The UK Competition Commission’s 
decision following its enquiry into the 
statutory audit market was published in 
October 2013. This will lead to FTSE 350 
companies having to put their statutory 
audit engagement out to tender not less 
frequently than every 10 years. The UK 
Corporate Governance Code is also 
expected to be amended to reflect this 
decision by the Commission. With this 
in mind, the existing lead engagement 
partner’s final year of engagement, which 
commenced in 2011, will be for the year 
ending 31 December 2015. For audit 
relationships, where the last tender was 
before 1 January 2005, the audit should 
be put out to tender within two years 
of the end of the current audit partner’s 
five-year engagement period. On this 
basis, the Group audit would need to 
be put out to tender by the end of 2017.
However, the Committee’s current 
intention is to tender the audit earlier than 
formally required so as to coincide with 
the last year of the current audit partner’s 
engagement. The tender process itself 
would then take place during the second 
half of 2015 for approval at the 2016 AGM 
and would be effective for the year ending 
31 December 2016.
Risk management and internal control
The Group’s risk management and internal 
control systems and processes were 
subjected to close scrutiny following the 
discovery of the operational delivery 
issues in Construction Services UK in 
2013. Further details on the review of 
the effectiveness of the system of risk 
management and internal control are 
provided on pages 62 to 64.
Internal auditor effectiveness
The Committee reviews the 
effectiveness of internal audit on an 
ongoing basis. This is achieved, in part, 
by reviewing and discussing the reports 
presented to it at each meeting setting 
out the department’s work and findings, 
but also through a formal annual 
assessment. An independent periodic 
review of internal audit, as well as a 
thorough self-assessment scorecard 
drawn up in accordance with best practice 
guidelines, also helps contribute to the 
Committee’s evaluation.
external auditor independence 
and effectiveness
The Committee carries out a formal 
review each year to assess the 
independence and effectiveness of the 
external auditor, Deloitte LLP. The 
Committee has recommended that the 
Board proposes to shareholders that 
Deloitte LLP continues as the Company’s 
external auditor, having satisfied itself 
of Deloitte’s independence. In reaching 
its conclusion, the Committee took into 
consideration the following matters:
Non-audit work
The objective set out in the Company’s 
policy is to ensure that the external auditor 
is not placed in a position where its 
independence is, or might be seen to be, 
compromised. Under no circumstances 
will any assignment be given to the 
external auditor, when the result is that:
•	 as part of the statutory audit, it 
is required to report directly on  
non-audit work
•	 it makes management decisions 
on behalf of the Group
•	 it acts as advocate for the Group
•	 the level of non-audit fees is such, 
relative to audit fees, as to raise 
concerns about its ability to form 
objective judgements.
The Company’s policy identifies the 
various types of non-audit services and 
determines the analysis to be undertaken

s ummary of activities in 2013
In 2013, the Committee’s work 
programme entailed recommending to 
the Board the appointment of two new 
non-executive Directors in place of the 
retiring Hubertus Krossa and Mike 
Donovan as non-executive Directors.
In seeking suitable candidates for the 
non-executive Director vacancies, 
Korn Ferry, an external executive search 
agency, was engaged. The Committee 
identified the competences sought and 
the required experience, and the agency 
prepared a shortlist of potential candidates 
who were interviewed by members of the 
Committee and by the executive Directors.
Key determinants in the selection of 
Belinda Richards and Bill Thomas were 
the enormous strengths they would bring 
in change management and B2B client 
focus whilst also having significant 
experience in building businesses 
in an international and professional 
services environment.
The executive search agency appointed 
for the recruitment of the non-executive 
Directors has no other connections with 
Balfour Beatty.
Areas of focus in 2014
In 2014, the Committee will monitor the 
appropriateness of the composition of 
the Board and make recommendations 
concerning the need for the introduction 
of non-executive Directors to refresh the 
Board. It is accepted that enhancing 
the sector specific experience of the 
non-executive Directors, which 
commenced in 2013, should be continued. 
The implications of the business strategy 
on senior executive recruitment and 
the impact on the Group’s succession 
planning are also areas which the 
Committee will keep under review 
during the year.

58 A consultation exercise was undertaken 
with major shareholders which culminated 
with their broad agreement of the 
proposals, further details of which are 
included in the Remuneration Report  
on pages 68 to 84.
The Committee also reflected on the 
“cap and collar” restriction applied to PPP 
asset disposals (+/-20% of budgeted sales 
value) and agreed to include an additional 
allowance which could be attributed for 
bonus calculation purposes.
The Committee approved, after 
consultation with major shareholders, 
a special incentive for the Chief Financial 
Officer (CFO) under the PSP, details of 
which are included in the Remuneration 
Report on page 79. Performance 
conditions were set. The reason for the 
special incentive award was to recognise 
the work which the CFO would undertake 
in 2013 in relation to cost control, asset 
disposals and the change to the business 
mix, whilst working alongside the new 
Chief Executive.
Executive Directors’ salary review
The Committee did not sanction any 
salary increases in 2013 for the executive 
Directors, other than in relation to 
Mr McNaughton, who was appointed 
Chief Executive on 31 March.
Remuneration policy and long term 
incentive plan review
The Committee decided not to embark 
on a remuneration policy and long term 
incentive review in 2013, preferring 
instead to maintain for the executive 
Directors the two TSR measures for  
the PSP in 2014.
2013 AGM and BIS reporting 
requirements
The Committee had reflected on the 
significantly lower vote in favour of the 
Remuneration Report at the AGM in 2013, 
which it concluded could be attributed 
largely to investors’ concerns around the 
financial performance of the Group 
following the operational issues in 
Construction Services UK, rather than 
specific issues with the remuneration 
policy, which had only recently been 
reviewed by major shareholders. As part 
of the new UK Department for Business, 
Innovation & Skills (BIS) reporting 
requirements, the Committee also 
undertook a detailed analysis of the 
structure and content of the 2012 
Remuneration Report to understand the 
scale of any changes required in 2013 to 
satisfy the new BIS reporting requirements.
Further information about the work of the 
Committee during the financial year is set 
out in the Remuneration Report starting 
on page 68.
Areas of focus in 2014
In 2014, the Remuneration Committee 
will undertake a formal review of the 
existing remuneration policy and the 
appropriateness of the short and long 
term incentive arrangements to properly 
meet the needs of the Company, as it 
implements the next phase of its business 
strategy. If changes are considered 
necessary, the Committee will consult 
with shareholders ahead of the AGM 
in 2015.
 Remuneration Report p68
s ummary of activities in 2013
In 2013, the Committee’s work 
programme comprised the following 
principal topics:
Bonus payments 
In common with previous years, the 
Committee determined that it would be 
appropriate to take into account certain 
other matters in assessing profit before 
tax (PBT), namely: (i) the impact of 
acquisitions and disposals (ii) the 
application of a constant exchange rate 
and (iii) the impact of PPP asset disposals.
2012 annual bonus payment date
The Committee sought views on the 
practices of other companies in response 
to the reduction in the top rate of income 
tax from 6 April 2013. The Committee 
concluded that no deferral of the 2012 
annual bonus was justified. The release 
date of maturing share awards under the 
Deferred Bonus Plan was maintained 
at the normal maturity date.
2010 PSP performance conditions
The EPS growth calculation was below 
the minimum level of achievement and 
the TSR measure showed Balfour Beatty 
at a position between 11 and 12 when 
compared against the remaining 21 peer 
companies, which meant there would be 
no vesting of the 2010 Performance Share 
Plan (PSP) awards. The Committee 
required a consistent approach to be 
applied when calculating TSR and, 
because of the proximity to the median 
level, commissioned an external review by 
the Committee’s remuneration advisers, 
to ensure the components of the TSR 
calculation were appropriate and being 
applied correctly.
2013 annual bonus and PSP structure 
and targets
The Committee considered the proposals 
which had emerged following discussions 
between the Committee chair and the 
Committee’s remuneration advisers 
concerning possible changes to the 
structure of the annual bonus and long 
term incentive plan (PSP), whilst the 
organisation was in transition, and as 
management moved forward with the 
implementation of the new business 
strategy. Minor changes to the 
remuneration policy emerged as a 
consequence of applying certain 
adjustments to the performance metrics 
for the annual bonus and the PSP, 
including the adoption of TSR only 
measures for PSP awards made in 2013.

ethics and compliance and sustainability. 
The Committee also addresses the 
Group’s Code of Conduct and the training 
which ensures that the Group’s business 
principles are properly embedded 
throughout the business. The Committee 
also has responsibility for reviewing 
contract commission arrangements.
In addition to the standing agenda items, 
the following principal topics were 
considered at Committee meetings during 
the year.
Health and safety
The Committee reviewed the annual 
independent audit regime comparing 
Balfour Beatty against its industry  
peers. This focuses on health and safety 
performance by sector and by geography 
and provides a truer comparator 
of performance than a broad 
benchmarking index.
On the Zero Harm programme, the 
emphasis has moved away from risk 
mitigation to one of prevention. The 
Committee did not focus on lagging 
indicators but on a series of leading 
indicators aimed at driving cultural change 
throughout the organisation. The 
Committee acknowledged that difficulties 
arose because of the temporary nature of 
many of the work sites with contractors 
on site for short periods and with high 
turnover rates. The Committee monitored 
the programme and milestones which  
had been set.
The Committee considered fatality 
reviews, discussing in detail the emerging 
themes around supervision, 
communications and remote working.
The Global Safety Principles were 
reviewed by the Committee in conjunction 
with management. Gap analyses had 
been conducted for each business unit 
and a heat map prepared. Action plans will 
continue to be reviewed by the Committee.
The Zero Harm Roadmap will be kept 
under review during 2014 so that the 
Committee can monitor progress against 
the plan and a mid-year assessment will 
be conducted.
Ethics, values and compliance
The Committee conducted a review of 
the compliance officer function across 
the Group and risk assessment and 
enforcement regimes. Although the Code 
of Conduct and the accompanying ethics 
and compliance programme had become 
well embedded across the organisation, 
the Committee emphasised that work 
would still need to be done to similarly 
embed the Code and processes in joint 
ventures. Progress would be monitored 
through 2014.
A series of investigations into 
whistleblowing claims had been carried 
out through 2013 which were reviewed 
by the Committee. The external monitor’s 
report on Parsons Brinckerhoff’s own 
compliance programme was thoroughly 
reviewed and the Committee noted 
the aim to continue to strengthen this 
programme. The Committee will keep 
progress under observation.
The self-assessment ethics and 
compliance dashboard, which would 
form an integral element of the year-end 
compliance reports, was reviewed.
The 2013 action plan was monitored. 
The strengthening of the ethics and 
compliance programme in emerging 
territories will feature on the Committee’s 
agenda in 2014. This will be carried out in 
conjunction with the values programme 
with the intention of embedding the 
Code of Conduct requirements within 
each of the businesses in these 
emerging territories.
People
The Committee completed a review of 
the Group diversity strategy and action 
plans and the current positioning in 
relation to gender diversity across the 
workforce. The Committee will continue 
to monitor progress in 2014 against the 
measurements which have been identified 
and formally incorporated into the 
Sustainability Roadmap. The Committee 
will also be keen to see how the diversity 
and inclusion programme is being 
expanded in 2014 to incorporate wider 
diversity including race, disability and age.
Areas of focus in 2014
In 2014, the Committee will continue 
to focus on the key reputational risk 
areas of health and safety, ethics and 
compliance, and sustainability and will 
monitor progress against the various 
action plans under each category 
referenced above. The Committee will 
also work with management on other 
business practice areas which have a 
meaningful impact on the future success 
of the Group, including supply chain and 
client relationship management.
This Committee is 
evolving. As well as its 
reputational risk 
responsibilities, 2014 will 
also see its scope widen 
to include other business 
practice areas.

balfourbeatty.com/ar2013 Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2013
60 The Committee is chaired by the Chief 
Executive, or in his absence by the Chief 
Financial Officer. Its main purpose is to 
review all major proposed tenders with 
projected values above specified levels. 
The Committee also has authority to 
approve capital expenditure applications 
and any proposed acquisitions or 
disposals up to certain specified limits 
determined by the Board. For example, 
currently the Committee’s terms of 
reference require contracts for 
construction or services in the UK of 
a value exceeding £100 million to be 
submitted for review, whilst other limits 
vary according to geography and nature 
of the contract. Any Director may convene 
a meeting of the Committee to discuss 
any of the tender reviews in more detail.
An audit was carried out this year on how 
robustly the appraisal processes were 
being applied within selected divisions on 
projects which did not normally require 
prior Committee approval. Whilst minor 
adjustments were recommended 
following the reviews, the overall appraisal 
processes undertaken by those divisions 
were judged by management to be both 
comprehensive and robust. 
Minutes of Committee meetings are 
made available to all Directors.
The Committee will 
continue to ensure 
internal approval 
processes are 
appropriate for major 
projects and capital 
expenditure.

61 Risk management and internal control
Risk management
Effective risk management underpins the delivery of our objectives. It is essential to protecting our reputation and generating 
sustainable shareholder value. We aim to identify key risks at an early stage and develop actions to eliminate them or mitigate their 
impact and likelihood to an acceptable level. For more information refer to pages 20 to 23.
Risk management processes are embedded throughout the Group at all levels and form an integral part of day-to-day business activity. 
They help management to identify and understand the risks they face in delivering business objectives and the status of the key 
controls in place for managing those risks.
Roles and responsibilities
The Board is responsible for our system of risk management and internal control. It sets the Group’s appetite for risk in pursuit of its 
strategic objectives, and the level of risk that can be taken by Group, divisional and business unit management without specific Board 
approval. Group policies and delegated authority levels set by the Board provide the means by which risks are reviewed and escalated 
to the appropriate level within the Group, up to and including the Board, for consideration and approval.
The roles and responsibilities of the Board, its Committees, and divisional and business unit management are set out below.

62 Risk management process
Our risk management policy requires that 
all divisions and those business units 
within them identify and assess the risks 
to which they are exposed and which 
could impact their ability to deliver their, 
and the Group’s, objectives.
Identified risk events, their causes and 
possible consequences are recorded in 
risk registers. Their likelihood and potential 
business impact and the control systems 
that are in place to manage them are 
analysed and, if required, additional 
actions are developed and put in place to 
mitigate or eliminate unwanted exposures. 
Individuals are allocated responsibility for 
evaluating and managing these risks to 
an agreed timescale.
Risk registers and relevant action plans 
are regularly reviewed, at various levels 
throughout the business, to identify 
emerging risks, remove expired risks 
and update mitigation plans.
The Group sets its risk appetite by 
calibrating its delegations of authority and 
the triggers for matters requiring Group 
senior management or Board approval. 
In relation to bidding, this means that 
projects above a certain value, with 
certain features or that import certain 
risks, or a move into new markets or 
work types, require approval by the 
Group Tender and Investment Committee. 
Divisions have a delegated level of 
authority as well as their own approval 
and risk management committees 
and triggers.
In addition to the delegation of authority 
and approval controls mentioned above, 
and the mitigations listed in the table of 
Principal Risks on pages 20 to 23, where 
possible we take a programmatic or 
management system approach to risks, 
which typically involves the following 
elements (or equivalent):
•	 strong leadership and accountabilities
•	 risk assessment
•	 clear policies
•	 education, training and communications
•	 appropriate procedures and controls
•	 monitoring, auditing and continual 
improvement.
Such an approach is underpinned by 
our Group values and carefully balanced 
incentives. Examples of this approach 
are our health and safety, commercial 
management, procurement, 
financial control and ethics and 
compliance programmes.
Reporting structures ensure that risks are 
monitored continually, mitigation plans are 
reviewed and significant exposures are 
escalated – from project level to business 
unit management to divisional and Group 
senior management.
All divisions and business units must  
have assurance mechanisms to ensure 
that their internal controls and actions 
designed to mitigate and eliminate risks 
are operating effectively. A range of 
procedures is used to monitor the 
effectiveness of internal controls, 
including management assurance, risk 
management processes and independent 
assurance provided by internal audit 
and other specialist third party reviews.
Internal control
The Group’s systems and controls are 
designed to ensure that the Group’s 
exposure to significant risk is managed 
properly, but the Board recognises that 
any system of internal control is designed 
to manage rather than eliminate the risk 
of failure to achieve business objectives 
and can only provide reasonable and 
not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. In addition, not all 
the material joint ventures in which the 
Group is involved are treated, for these 
purposes, as part of the Group. Where 
they are not, systems of internal control 
and risk management are applied as 
agreed between the partners to the 
joint venture.
The Board continued to assess the 
effectiveness of the risk management 
processes and internal controls during 
2013 and to the date of this report. Such 
assessment is based on reports made to 
the Board, the Audit, Risk & Assurance 
Committee and the Business Practices 
Committee, including:
•	 the results of internal audit’s reviews 
of internal financial controls
•	 a Group wide certification that 
effective internal controls had been 
maintained or, where any significant 
non-compliance or breakdown had 
occurred with or without loss, that 
appropriate remedial action has been 
or is being taken
•	 a paper prepared by management on 
the nature, extent and mitigation of 
significant risks and on the systems 
of internal controls.
Central to the Group’s systems of internal 
control are its processes and framework 
for risk management. These align with  
the Turnbull Guidance on internal controls 
and were in place throughout 2013 and  
up to the date of signing this report.
The Group’s systems of internal control 
operate through a number of different 
processes, some of which are interlinked. 
These include:
•	 a clear system of delegated authorities 
from the Board to management with 
certain matters reserved by the Board
•	 the annual review of the strategy and 
plans of each division and of the Group 
as a whole in order to identify the risks 
to the Group’s achievement of its overall 
objectives and, where appropriate, any 
relevant mitigating actions
•	 monthly financial reporting against 
budgets and the review of results and 
forecasts by executive Directors and 
management, including particular areas 
of business or project risk. This is used 
to update management’s understanding 
of the environment in which the Group 
operates and the methods used to 
mitigate and control the risks identified
•	 individual tender and project review 
procedures starting at the business unit 
and progressing to divisional and Board 
Committee levels if value, or perceived 
exposure, exceeds certain thresholds
•	 regular reporting, monitoring and review 
of the effectiveness of health, safety 
and environmental processes. These 
processes are subject to independent 
audit and certification to internationally 
recognised standards
•	 the review and authorisation of 
proposed investment, divestment and 
capital expenditure through the Board’s 
Committees and the Board itself
•	 specific policies set out in the Group 
Finance Manual covering the financial 
management of the Group, including 
arrangements with the Group’s bankers 
and bond providers, controls on foreign 
exchange dealings and management 
of currency and interest rate exposures, 
insurance, capital expenditure 
procedures, application of accounting 
policies and financial controls
balfourbeatty.com/ar2013 Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2013
63 •	 legal compliance risks which are 
addressed through specific policies 
and training on such matters as ethics, 
competition and data protection laws
•	 a Group wide risk management 
framework which is embedded 
throughout the Group. Under it, key 
risks are identified and assessed and 
action plans are developed to mitigate 
or eliminate unwanted exposures.  
The results of these reviews are placed 
on risk registers and are subject to 
regular review, with material risks  
being escalated as appropriate
•	 reviews and tests by the internal audit 
function of critical business financial 
processes and controls and specific 
reviews in areas of perceived high 
business risk
•	 the Group’s ethics helpline and other 
channels by which staff are encouraged 
to raise concerns, in confidence, about 
possible breaches of the Code of 
Conduct, improprieties on matters of 
financial reporting and other issues.
These systems are extended, as soon  
as possible and as appropriate, to all 
businesses joining the Group.
Each of the divisional CEOs is responsible 
for ensuring that a comprehensive 
framework of assurance (including internal 
audit) exists within their division and 
business units which is in accordance 
with Group requirements.
During the year, a difficult external 
environment combined with internal 
reorganisation resulted in poor operational 
delivery in the UK regional construction 
business and, to a lesser extent, the 
building part of the UK major projects 
business. These factors led to a trading 
update being issued on 29 April, which 
disclosed that Construction Services UK 
was expected to deliver significantly  
lower profits from operations than 
management’s expectations at the time  
of the full-year results announcement  
in March 2013.
As part of its review of the effectiveness 
of the system of risk management and 
internal control, the Board has taken 
into account the events reported in the 
trading update of 29 April and the control 
enhancements that were adjudged to 
be necessary as a result.
Actions taken to address these  
issues included: 
•	 the appointment of a new CEO of 
Construction Services UK
•	 an action plan to improve standards in 
key disciplines such as planning, cost 
estimating and commercial governance
•	 the enhancement of risk management 
processes to provide greater assurance 
that risks such as those which had 
materialised in Construction Services UK 
are better understood and addressed.
In May 2013, a Sub-Committee of the 
Audit, Risk & Assurance Committee was 
appointed to monitor the progress of 
these actions and the wider performance 
of the UK construction services business. 
This Sub-Committee met four times 
during the year. 
The Board has considered the progress 
that has been made in implementing 
the control enhancements considered 
necessary in the UK construction services 
business, and confirms that it is satisfied 
that the necessary actions have been 
taken or are being taken to rectify any 
control weaknesses or failures.
Principal risks
The principal risks that could adversely 
impact our profitability and ability to 
achieve strategic objectives are set out

Chief Financial Officer’s Review on 
pages 24 to 27, the Performance Review 
on pages 28 to 35, and The Way We Work

Results and dividends
The results for the year are shown in the 
audited financial statements presented  
on pages 85 to 157 and are explained 
more fully in the Chief Executive’s Report, 
the Chief Financial Officer’s Review and 
the Performance Review. An interim 
dividend payment of 5.6p (net) per 
ordinary share was approved by the 
Board on 13 August 2013 and a final 
dividend of 8.5p (net) per ordinary share 
will be recommended at the Annual 
General Meeting, giving a total of 14.1p 
(net) per ordinary share, which compares 
with a total dividend per ordinary share of 
14.1p (net) for 2012. Preference dividends 
totalling 10.75p (gross) per preference 
share were paid in 2013 (2012: 10.75p 
(gross) per preference share).
The Directors continued to offer the 
dividend reinvestment plan, which allows 
holders of ordinary shares to reinvest their 
cash dividends in the Company’s shares 
through a specially arranged share 
dealing service.
Innovation, research and development
Increasingly we are working in long term 
relationships with our clients and innovation 
plays an important role in building those 
relationships and creating additional value 
for our clients. Our ability to innovate is 
therefore essential to our sustainability.
Most of that innovation emanates from 
collaboration, with our clients, supply 
chain and by means of internal 
collaboration across our businesses. For 
example, we have developed a pipeline 
inspection camera for use in live water 
and gas mains with technology specialist 
JD7. We participated in the development 
of a new sleeper system for London 
Underground with the client and two 
manufacturers with the result that track 
renewal productivity has more than 
doubled. A collaboration on the M25 
widening scheme involving some 10 
partner organisations has resulted in the 
development of a rapid cure concrete that 
has reduced lane occupation times during 
maintenance by 80%.
Our innovations are informed by research 
work at several academic partner 
organisations, including Salford University 
(BIM), Bristol University (systems 
engineering) and Pennsylvania State 
University (building energy performance). 
We sponsor three engineering doctorate 
students at Bristol in conjunction with the 
Engineering and Physical Sciences 
Research Council (EPSRC).

enhanced by the growth in communities 
of practice, particularly those that involve 
participation from both our construction 
and professional services businesses, by 
the deployment of training in collaborative 
working practices and through our 
ongoing Group wide accreditation to 
the standard BS11000 Collaborative 
Business Relationships.
Share capital and shareholders
Details of the share capital of the Company 
as at 31 December 2013, including the 
rights attaching to each class of share, are 
set out in Note 29 on pages 135 and 136. 
During the year ended 31 December 2013 
no ordinary or preference shares were 
repurchased for cancellation. 386,386 
ordinary shares were issued following 
the exercise of options held under the 
Company’s savings-related share option 
scheme and 270,895 ordinary shares 
were issued following the exercise of 
options held under the Company’s 
executive share option scheme.
At 31 December 2013, the Directors had 
authority under shareholders’ resolutions 
approved at the AGM and at the Class 
Meeting of preference shareholders held 
in May 2013 to purchase through the 
market 68,848,254 ordinary shares and 
16,775,968 preference shares at prices 
set out in those resolutions. This authority 
expires at the earlier of the conclusion 
of the Class Meeting of preference 
shareholders which will follow the 2014 
AGM or on 1 July 2014.
Throughout the year, all the Company’s 
issued share capital was publicly listed on 
the London Stock Exchange and it remains 
so as at the date of this report. There are 
no specific restrictions on the size of a 
shareholding nor on the transfer of shares, 
which are both governed by the Articles  
of Association and the prevailing law. The 
Directors are not aware of any agreements 
between holders of the Company’s 
shares that may result in restrictions on 
the transfer of shares or on voting rights.
No person has special rights of control 
over the Company’s share capital and all 
issued shares are fully paid.
As at 31 December 2013, the Company 
had been notified in accordance with the 
Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the 
Financial Conduct Authority of the following 
interests in its ordinary share capital:
Number
of ordinary
shares held
Percentage

Prudential plc 35,103,707 5.10
Standard Life 
Investments 
Limited 25,104,162 3.65
Since 1 January 2014, the Company has 
received a further notification advising 
that Causeway Capital Management 
LLC’s interest is now 4.87% and that 
Newton Investment Management Ltd 
has an interest of 5.16%.
Auditor
Deloitte LLP has indicated its willingness 
to continue as auditor to the Company and 
a resolution for its reappointment will be 
proposed at the AGM.
Relations with shareholders
The Board attaches great importance 
to maintaining good relationships with 
all shareholders and ensures that 
shareholders are kept informed of 
significant Company developments.
The Company continued its programme of 
communication with institutional investors 
and sell side analysts throughout 2013. 
Presentations of the half-year and full-year 
results were made in accordance with 
the practice of previous years, and 
teleconferences have been held for 
Interim Management Statements.
Through the year, 172 one-on-one and 
group meetings were held at regular 
intervals with institutional shareholders 
(2012: approximately 185). Current and 
prospective shareholders, brokers and 
analysts were also given the opportunity 
to engage with Balfour Beatty during 
hosted roadshows in London, Scotland, 
North America and Europe. Balfour Beatty 
also presented at an investor conference. 
In addition, our international management 
teams met with some of our largest 
shareholders, with meetings taking 
place during the year in Australia,  
Asia and the US.
Separately, the Chairman held three 
meetings with major investors and five 
further meetings were held with major 
shareholders by senior executives as part 
of our ongoing engagement.
We will maintain this communication 
programme and expand it where 
appropriate, subject to the constraints of 
regulation and practice. The 2014 investor 
programme will focus on ensuring our 
investors and the analyst community 
understand the Group, its operations and 
strategy, and that international institutions 
continue to be given the opportunity  
to meet with management.
Care is exercised to ensure that any 
price sensitive information is released 
to all shareholders at the same time 
in accordance with UK Listing 
Authority requirements.
Executive Directors report regularly to the 
Board on meetings or other contact with 
shareholders or their representatives. 
The non-executive Directors continue to 
believe that, through their direct and ready 
access to, and contact with, the Chairman 
and the Senior Independent Director and 
through the regular reports to the Board, 
they are kept fully aware of the views of 
the larger shareholders in the Company 
and the investment community generally.
The Board continues to retain the services 
of independent external corporate and 
investor relations consultants who provide 
advice on the relationship between the 
Company and its institutional investors.
The Board regards the Company’s 
general meetings as an opportunity 
to communicate directly with private 
investors and actively encourages 
participative dialogue with all the 
Company’s shareholders. The chairs of 
the Board Committees attend the AGM 
each year along with the other Directors 
and are available to answer questions 
from shareholders.
The website is regarded by the Company 
as an important source of information 
on the Group, including financial press 
releases, shareholder documentation, 
annual and half-year results presentations 
and the terms of reference of the principal 
Board Committees. We continue to 
develop the Company’s website to ensure 
it remains a principal source of information 
on the Group and its activities.

65 Political donations
At the AGM held on 16 May 2013, 
shareholders gave authority for the 
Company and its UK subsidiaries to make 
donations to political organisations up to a 
maximum aggregate amount of £25,000 
in the European Union. This approval is 
a precautionary measure in view of the 
broad definition of these terms in the 
Companies Act. No such expenditure or 
donations were made during the year and 
shareholder authority will be sought again 
at the 2014 AGM.
In the US and Canada, donations totalling 
£165,692 were made by business units 
during 2013 (2012: £371,000). Most of 
these donations were made by Parsons 
Brinckerhoff; they were small and all were 
permitted by law. They are non-partisan 
and, in the main, they relate to support 
given for local campaigns, public bond or 
similar referenda to promote investment  
in infrastructure. Any political contributions 
or donations are tightly controlled and 
must be approved in advance in 
accordance with the Company’s internal 
procedures and must also adhere strictly 
to the Company’s policies on probity set 
out in its Code of Conduct. A review of 
existing practices was undertaken during 
2013 and no changes to these practices 
were considered necessary.
Parsons Brinckerhoff Group Inc sponsors 
a Political Action Committee (PAC).  
A PAC is an independently administered 
committee which receives small voluntary 
contributions from Parsons Brinckerhoff’s 
US employees and allocates the funds 
received to US political candidates and 
other eligible stakeholders who support 
investment in infrastructure markets 
generally. Contributions are entirely 
voluntary from employees and are kept 
completely separate from company 
funds. Decisions taken by the PAC are 
independent of influence by Balfour 
Beatty. Total PAC contributions in 2013 
were £83,981 (2012: £88,019).

employment
The Balfour Beatty Group operates across 
a broad spectrum of geographies and end 
markets. In order that we can best serve 
our customers across such a complex 
and diverse business environment and 
remain agile to its ever-changing demands 
and challenges, we actively promote a 
decentralised management structure to 
ensure client centricity, speed of decision 
making and consistent operational 
excellence. However, parallel with this 
decentralised approach, there are key 
principles in the design and practice of 
employment policy that are applicable 
across the Group. These are:
•	 to provide a safe, open, inclusive and 
challenging environment that attracts 
and retains the best people
•	 to enable all employees to perform at 
their best and realise their full potential, 
assisted by the appropriate training and 
career development
•	 to communicate the strategy of the 
Group, the objectives of each respective 
business and the role and objectives  
of each employee within that business
•	 to actively consult with all employees 
and engage in a participating 
environment that fosters the exchange 
of best practice, collaboration and 
Group cohesion of purpose
•	 to provide market competitive pay  
and benefits that reward both individual 
and collective performance
•	 to ensure that all job applicants receive 
fair treatment, regardless of age, origin, 
gender, disability, sexual orientation, 
marital status, religion or belief
•	 to ensure that all employees similarly 
receive fair treatment throughout 
their career
•	 to provide a working environment of 
respect and free from harassment.
Balfour Beatty strives to provide 
employment, training and development 
opportunities for disabled people 
wherever possible. We are committed 
to supporting employees who become 
disabled during employment and helping 
disabled employees make the best use 
of their skills and potential, consistent 
with all other employees.
The Company also operates all employee 
and executive share schemes in the UK, 
further details of which are included in 
the Remuneration Report.
In the case of the Share Incentive Plan 
(SIP), participants are invited by the SIP 
Trustee to indicate their voting preferences 
on resolutions submitted to shareholder 
meetings and the SIP Trustee will vote  
its holding in accordance with those 
instructions. Shares held by the Balfour 
Beatty Employee Share Ownership Trust 
are not voted.
Information concerning the performance 
of the Group and the Company’s share 
price is provided to all employees via the 
Group intranet, 360, and through the 
corporate website.

Change of control provisions
The Group’s bank facility agreements 
contain provisions that, on 30 days’  
notice being given to the Group, the 
lender may exercise its discretion to 
require prepayment of the loans on a 
change of control of the Company and 
cancel all commitments under the 
agreement concerned.

66 A number of significant joint venture 
and contract bond agreements include 
provisions which become exercisable by  
a counterparty on a change of control  
of the Company. These include the right 
of a counterparty to request additional 
security and to terminate an agreement.
The Group’s US private placement 
arrangements require the Company, 
promptly upon becoming aware that a 
change of control of the Company has 
occurred (and in any event within 10 
business days), to give written notice of 
such fact to all holders of the notes and 
make an offer to prepay the entire unpaid 
principal amount of the notes, together 
with accrued interest.
The Group’s convertible bond 
arrangements provide that the holder  
of bonds can require the Company to 
redeem its bonds following a change of 
control of the Company at their principal 
amount, together with accrued interest. 
The Company is required to notify the 
bond holder within 14 days of a change  
of control.
Some other commercial agreements, 
entered into in the normal course  
of business, include change of  
control provisions.
The Group’s share and incentive plans 
include usual provisions relating to 
change of control, as do the terms of 
the Company’s cumulative convertible 
redeemable preference shares.
There are no agreements providing  
for compensation for the Directors  
or employees on a change of control.
Financial instruments
The Group’s financial risk management 
objectives and policies and its exposure 
to the following risks – foreign exchange, 
interest rate, price and credit – are detailed 
in Note 39 on pages 146 to 150.
s tatement of Directors’ 
responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for 
preparing the Annual Report and the 
financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to 
prepare financial statements for each 
financial year. Under that law, the 
Directors are required to prepare the 
Group financial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the 
European Union (EU) and Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation and they have also chosen 
to prepare the parent company financial 
statements under IFRS as adopted by the 
EU. Under company law, the Directors 
must not approve the financial statements 
unless they are satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view of the state of affairs 
of the Company and of the profit or 
loss of the Company for that period. 
In preparing these financial statements, 
International Accounting Standard 1 
requires that Directors:
•	 properly select and apply  
accounting policies
•	 present information, including 
accounting policies, in a manner that 
provides relevant, reliable, comparable 
and understandable information
•	 provide additional disclosures when 
compliance with the specific 
requirements in IFRS are insufficient to 
enable users to understand the impact 
of particular transactions, other events 
and conditions on the Company’s and 
the Group’s financial position and 
financial performance
•	 make an assessment of the Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the 
Company’s transactions and disclose 
with reasonable accuracy, at any time, 
the financial position of the Company 
and enable them to ensure that the 
financial statements comply with the 
Companies Act 2006. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets 
of the Company and for taking reasonable 
steps for preventing and detecting fraud 
and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the corporate 
and financial information included on 
the Company’s website. Legislation in 
the UK governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
The Directors confirm that to the best 
of their knowledge:
•	 the financial statements, prepared in 
accordance with IFRS as adopted by the 
EU and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation, 
give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit 
or loss of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole
•	 the Strategic Report includes a fair 
review of the development and 
performance of the business and  
the position of the Company and  
the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole,  
together with a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties  
they face.
In light of the work undertaken by the 
Audit, Risk & Assurance Committee 
reported in greater details on pages 55 
to 57 and the internal verification and 
approval process which has been followed 
this year, the Directors are able to state 
that the Annual Report and Accounts, 
taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Company’s performance, 
business model and strategy.
s tatements of Directors as to 
disclosure of information to auditors
Each of the Directors at the date of 
approval of this report confirms that:
•	 so far as the Director is aware, there is 
no relevant audit information of which 
the Company’s auditors are unaware
•	 the Director has taken all the steps 
that he or she ought to have taken as 
a Director to make himself or herself 
aware of any relevant audit information 
and to establish that the Company’s 
auditors are aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should  
be interpreted in accordance with  
the provisions of Section 418 of the 
Companies Act 2006.

balfourbeatty.com/ar2013 Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2013
67 I am pleased to present the 
Remuneration Committee’s 
report for 2013 on Directors’ 
remuneration.
This report will be subject to two 
shareholder votes at the forthcoming AGM:
•	 the Directors’ Remuneration Policy 
Report sets out the forward looking 
Directors’ remuneration policy for 
the Company which will, subject to 
shareholder approval, become formally 
effective from the 2014 AGM
•	 the Annual Report on Remuneration 
provides details of how the policy 
for 2014 will be operated and the 
remuneration earned by Directors  
in the year ended 31 December 2013.
s ummary of major decisions made 
in 2013
Following consultation with major 
shareholders and representative bodies, 
the remuneration policy for 2013 was 
adjusted to take account of a number 
of factors, notably the appointment of 
Andrew McNaughton replacing Ian Tyler 
as Chief Executive in March 2013 and the 
challenges in a number of our markets, 
especially in UK construction, which have 
required, in the immediate term, an urgent 
drive and focus on operational efficiency 
and rigorous cost control measures. While 
not reflecting a significant divergence 
from the Company’s existing policy, 
the following changes were considered 
to be important: 
•	 instead of basing the entire Annual 
Incentive Plan (AIP) on profit before tax 
and non-underlying items (PBT), in view 
of the strategic challenges facing the 
business, strategic measures linked  
to the repositioning of the business  
for future growth were introduced. 
Accordingly, for 2013, PBT was retained 
for 70% of the bonus opportunity (albeit 
the payout range was toughened) with 
the remaining 30% determined by 
strategic targets based around the 
strength of the order intake, a cost 
reduction programme and the 
development of the organisational 
structure
•	 instead of the Company’s traditional 
approach of measuring 50% of any 
Performance Share Plan (PSP) award 
based on EPS growth targets and 
50% based on relative TSR against 
the FTSE 51-150, recognising the 
difficulties in determining meaningful 
EPS targets in a period of transition and 
structural change, the 2013 PSP awards 
were based solely on relative TSR 
performance. 50% of an award is based 
on the current FTSE 51-150 companies 
and 50% is based on a construction and 
professional services based group of 
companies, including international peers
•	 in addition to the normal 150% of salary 
PSP award level, Duncan Magrath 
received a 50% of salary PSP award  
in April 2013. While his normal award  
of 150% of salary is based on the  
same performance targets as the 
awards granted to the other executive 
Directors, the additional award is based 
on personally tailored targets covering 
Group capital structure and the 
execution of the strategic planning 
(Strategic Roadmap) process, measured 
over a 15 month period to June 2014. 
The additional award will vest, subject 
to the achievement of the performance 
targets and continued service, on 
31 December 2014 although these 
shares must be retained by Mr Magrath 
until the vesting date of the normal  
PSP awards (ie April 2016). 
Performance and reward for 2013
The Group has continued to face 
challenging trading conditions in many 
of its traditional construction markets  
and is taking action to improve operational 
performance and effectiveness. Underlying 
PBT from continuing operations, which  
is the measure on which we based 
performance for 70% of AIP, was below 
threshold, meaning that no bonus was 
payable under the PBT element. The 
Group however made progress against 
strategic initiatives in 2013, resulting in a 
21.0% payout against the 30% strategic 
element. In the light of disappointing 
financial performance the Executive 
Directors decided that all of their cash 
bonus entitlement, which was earned  
for achievement of strategic initiatives, 
should be deferred in shares for three 
years. The EPS and TSR performance 
conditions relating to the 2011 
Performance Share Plan were not 
achieved and so those awards will lapse 
in full in April 2014. 
Remuneration policy for 2014
We remain committed to ensuring that 
rewards for executives are closely aligned 
to the interests of shareholders through 
having all of our incentive arrangements 
linked to the achievement of challenging 
business performance targets and 
generation of strong levels of shareholder 
return. We remain comfortable that this 
is the case. As such, we feel that the 
existing remuneration policy remains 
fit for purpose and are not proposing 
to make any significant changes to the 
policy for 2014. Specifically:
•	 base salary remains appropriately 
positioned against the market. Base 
salaries were not increased with  
effect from 1 July 2013
•	 the structure of the annual bonus 
remains appropriate to incentivise  
the delivery of annual objectives. The 
maximum bonus opportunity remains  
at 120% of salary for all executive 
Directors and will be subject to a range 
of challenging PBT and strategic targets
•	 the long term incentive awards under 
the PSP will again be based on TSR 
versus the FTSE 51-150 and a group 
of construction and professional 
services companies, providing 
strong alignment of interest between 
executives and shareholders.
The Committee encourages dialogue 
with the Company’s shareholders and 
will consult with major shareholders 
ahead of any significant future changes 
to remuneration policy, although it is 
intended that the policy for which 
shareholder approval will be sought at 
the 2014 AGM will remain in operation 
for the forthcoming three financial years. 
I hope that you will be supportive of the 
two resolutions to approve the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report at the 2014 AGM.

This part of the Remuneration Report sets out the remuneration policy for the Company which will become formally effective following 
approval from shareholders through a binding vote at the 2014 AGM.
Policy overview
The Committee, on behalf of the Board, determines the Company’s remuneration policy and the remuneration packages of the 
executive Directors of the Company and the Chairman. In setting the remuneration policy, the Committee takes into account a  
number of factors, including:
•	 general trends in pay and conditions throughout the Group
•	 the positioning of remuneration levels against the external market – the Committee is, however, aware of the risk of an upward 
ratchet in remuneration levels through overreliance on comparative survey data
•	 the balance between fixed and variable pay – more specifically, variable pay should form a significant but not disproportionately  
high level of remuneration
•	 the strategy of the business.
In setting the overall remuneration policy, general trends and average increases throughout the Group are taken into account  
when setting executive Directors’ reward packages. A key feature for the executive Directors is that a higher proportion of their  
remuneration package is delivered through performance related pay, which has a greater linkage to the results of the Group.  
The areas covered in this Policy Report comprise:
 Consideration of shareholders’ views p69
 Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group p69
 Summary Directors’ remuneration policy from the 2014 AGM onwards p70 and p71
 Remuneration scenarios for executive Directors p72 
 Recruitment and promotion policy for executive Directors p72 
 Service agreements and payments for loss of office for executive Directors p73
 External appointments of executive Directors p73
 Appointment of non-executive Directors p73
 
Consideration of shareholders’ views
The Remuneration Committee considers feedback from shareholders received at each AGM and any feedback from additional 
meetings, as part of any review of executive remuneration. In addition, the Remuneration Committee engages pro-actively with 
shareholders and will ensure that shareholders are consulted in advance, where any material changes to the remuneration policy  
are proposed.
Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group
In determining the remuneration of the Group’s Directors, the Committee takes into account the general trends in pay and conditions 
across the Group as a whole. Whilst employees have not been consulted formally on executive pay, due in part to the diverse 
geographic nature of the Company, the Committee seeks to ensure that the underlying principles which form the basis for decisions 
on Directors’ pay are consistent with those on which pay decisions for the rest of the workforce are taken. These are focused for  
the most part on market competitiveness, business performance and personal performance.
In practice, the remuneration policy for executive Directors is more heavily weighted towards variable pay than for other employees,  
so that a significant proportion of their remuneration is dependent on Company performance. For employees below Board level 
variable pay represents a lower proportion of their total remuneration, which is driven by market comparators and general performance.

Base salary To attract and retain high calibre individuals.
To provide a competitive salary relative to comparable 
companies in terms of size and complexity.
Salaries are normally reviewed and set annually in July. 
The Committee considers remuneration levels in 
companies of comparable market capitalisations,  
revenue and industry sector.
In addition, a key reference point for salary increases 
is the average increase across the general workforce 
(with the exception of promotions or significant changes 
in responsibility). 
Salaries are paid monthly in cash.
There is no prescribed maximum annual increase. The Committee is 
guided by the general increase for the broader employee population 
but on occasion may need to recognise, for example, an increase 
in the scale, scope or responsibility of the role.
Current salary levels are disclosed on page 75. 
A number of factors are considered, notably market competitiveness, 
business and personal performance.
Benefits To aid retention and to remain competitive in the 
marketplace. In addition, medical benefits are 
provided to minimise disruption due to absence.
Private medical and life assurance may be provided. 
A car and fuel card or car allowance are offered.
Other benefits may be provided as appropriate.
The maximum opportunity for medical benefits is cover for the 
executive Director and his family. Life assurance cover and any car 
or car allowance are based on market norms.
None
Pension To remain competitive in the marketplace. Executive Directors can elect to either: 
•	 participate in the defined contribution (DC) section of 
the Group’s pension fund. Executive Directors must 
make contributions of 5% of base salary (up to an 
earnings cap), with the Company contributing 20% of 
base salary (up to the cap). On earnings above the cap, 
executive Directors receive a salary supplement; or
•	 receive a salary supplement. 
Executive Directors who participate in the Group’s pension fund 
benefit from a pension contribution of 20% of base salary up to the 
earnings cap and a salary supplement of 20% of base salary in 
excess of the cap. 
If a salary supplement alone is taken, this is equivalent to 20% 
of base salary.
None
Annual Incentive Plan 
(AIP) and Deferred 
Bonus Plan (DBP)
To motivate executives and incentivise the 
achievement of key business performance targets 
over the financial year without encouraging excessive 
risk taking. Managing risk is critical, particularly given 
the nature of the Company’s business.
To facilitate share ownership and provide further 
alignment with shareholders.
50% of any payment is normally deferred into shares  
for three years.
Clawback may apply in the event of material misconduct 
and/or material misstatement or error of financial results.
Participants may also receive an award of cash or shares 
in lieu of the value of dividends on vested shares.
Maximum annual incentive opportunity is 120% of base salary. A majority (if not all) of the bonus will be based on profit and a minority 
of the bonus may be based on other performance metrics linked to the 
business strategy, measured over a one year performance period.
Measures are reviewed each year and varied as appropriate to reflect 
the strategy.
Performance s hare Plan 
(Ps P)
To incentivise and reward delivery of long term 
performance linked to the business strategy.
To facilitate share ownership and provide further 
alignment with shareholders.
To aid retention.
PSP awards are granted annually so that no undue 
emphasis is placed on performance in any one particular 
financial year. 
Awards normally vest on the third anniversary subject 
to performance. 
Participants may also receive an award of cash or shares 
in lieu of the value of dividends on vested shares.
Clawback may apply in the event of material misconduct 
and/or material misstatement or error of financial results.
The limit in the rules of the PSP is 200% of base salary. Other  
than in exceptional circumstances, the normal limit will be 175%  
of base salary.
Performance measures will normally be based on relative total 
shareholder return (TSR) and/or earnings per share metrics although 
strategic measures may be used in exceptional circumstances. Targets 
will normally be measured over a three year performance period.
There is 25% vesting for threshold performance, rising to 100% vesting 
for maximum performance.
s hareholding guidelines To align the interests of executive Directors with 
those of shareholders.
Executive Directors are expected to accumulate a 
shareholding in the Company’s shares to the value  
of 100% of their base salary. Executive Directors are 
expected to retain at least 50% of shares (net of tax)  
which vest from awards made under the PSP and DBP 
until the target shareholding is attained.
– None
Notes: 
1. Directors may also participate in the all-employee share schemes up to prevailing HMRC Limits.
2.   The AIP is primarily, if not solely, based on PBT although other Group-based measures which are set to reflect the business strategy may be included. The Remuneration 
Committee reviews these measures each year and varies them as appropriate to reflect the strategy for the year ahead.
3.  Relative TSR performance was considered to be the most appropriate long term incentive performance condition for awards granted in 2013, although earnings per share 
targets determined half of previous awards and may be operated going forward. Executive Directors should be incentivised to achieve strong stock market performance 
and grow earnings, to align their interests with those of shareholders. The Committee reserves the discretion to introduce additional internal financial or strategic measures 
for future awards which will be set to reflect the prevailing strategy although investors will be consulted in advance where there is a material change.
4.  The Committee operates share plans in accordance with the respective rules and in accordance with the Listing Rules and HMRC where relevant. The Committee, 
consistent with market practice, retains discretion over a number of areas relating to the operation and administration of certain plans.
5.  For avoidance of doubt, in approving this Directors’ Remuneration Policy Report, authority is given to the Company to honour any commitments entered into with current 
or former Directors (such as the vesting of past share awards).

shareholding in the Company’s shares to the value  
of 100% of their base salary. Executive Directors are 
expected to retain at least 50% of shares (net of tax)  
which vest from awards made under the PSP and DBP 
until the target shareholding is attained.
– None
Notes: 
1. Directors may also participate in the all-employee share schemes up to prevailing HMRC Limits.
2.   The AIP is primarily, if not solely, based on PBT although other Group-based measures which are set to reflect the business strategy may be included. The Remuneration 
Committee reviews these measures each year and varies them as appropriate to reflect the strategy for the year ahead.
3.  Relative TSR performance was considered to be the most appropriate long term incentive performance condition for awards granted in 2013, although earnings per share 
targets determined half of previous awards and may be operated going forward. Executive Directors should be incentivised to achieve strong stock market performance 
and grow earnings, to align their interests with those of shareholders. The Committee reserves the discretion to introduce additional internal financial or strategic measures 
for future awards which will be set to reflect the prevailing strategy although investors will be consulted in advance where there is a material change.
4.  The Committee operates share plans in accordance with the respective rules and in accordance with the Listing Rules and HMRC where relevant. The Committee, 
consistent with market practice, retains discretion over a number of areas relating to the operation and administration of certain plans.
5.  For avoidance of doubt, in approving this Directors’ Remuneration Policy Report, authority is given to the Company to honour any commitments entered into with current 
or former Directors (such as the vesting of past share awards).

Annual Incentive Plan (cash and deferred) Performance Share Plan
Notes:
1. Salary levels are based on those applying from 1 July 2013.
2.  The value of benefits receivable in 2014 is taken to be the value of benefits received in 2013 (as shown in the Directors Remuneration table, set out on page 76)  
and pension has been assumed to be worth 20% of salary.
3.  The on-target level of AIP is taken to be 50% of the maximum AIP opportunity (120% of salary for all executive Directors), of which 50% is paid in cash and 50% is 
deferred in shares under the DBP. 
4.  The on-target level of vesting under the PSP is taken to be 50% of the face value of the award at grant (under normal circumstances, 175% of salary for the Chief Executive 
and 150% of salary for the other executive Directors).
5.  The maximum level of AIP and vesting under the PSP is taken to be 100% of the AIP opportunity and 100% of the face value of the award at grant respectively.
6.  No share price appreciation or dividend awards have been assumed for the DBP shares and PSP awards.
Recruitment and promotion policy for executive Directors
To ensure the ongoing leadership continuity of the Group, the appointment of high calibre executives may be necessary, either by 
external appointment or internal promotion. The remuneration package for a new executive Director would be set in accordance with 
the terms of the Company’s remuneration policy at the time of appointment and take into account the scope and complexity of the 
role, the experience of the individual, the prevailing market rate for that experience and the importance and immediacy of securing  
that candidate.
The salary would be provided at such a level as required to attract the most appropriate candidate. The AIP potential would be limited 
to 120% of salary and grants under the PSP may be up to the plan maximum of 200% of salary. In addition, the Committee may offer 
additional cash and/or share-based elements to replace deferred or incentive pay forfeited by an executive leaving a previous employer. 
It would seek to ensure, where possible, that these awards would be consistent with awards forfeited in terms of vesting periods, 
expected value and performance conditions. 
For an internal executive Director appointment, any remuneration awarded in respect of the prior role may be allowed to pay out 
according to its terms, adjusted as relevant to take into account the appointment. In addition, any other ongoing remuneration 
obligations existing prior to appointment may continue. 
For external and internal appointments, the Committee may agree that the Company will meet certain relocation and/or incidental 
expenses as appropriate.

72 s ervice agreements and payments for loss of office for executive Directors
It is the Company’s policy that executive Directors should have contracts with an indefinite term, which are subject to one year’s notice 
by the Company and six months’ notice by the Director. In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, all executive Directors 
submit themselves for re-election at the AGM. In the event of early termination, the Directors’ contracts provide for compensation  
in line with their contractual notice period. In summary, the contractual provisions are to provide the following: 
Provision Detailed terms
Notice period 12 months by the Company, six months by the Director.
There are no contractual compensation provisions for termination of employment. However, other non-contractual considerations  
are as follows:
Notice payments If any existing contract is breached by the Company, it would be liable to pay an 
amount approximating to the net loss of salary and contractual benefits for the 
unexpired notice period, subject to mitigation and phased payments where 
appropriate.
Remuneration entitlements Pro rata bonus may also become payable for the period of active service along with 
vesting for outstanding share awards (in certain circumstances – see below).
In all cases performance targets would apply.
Change of control No executive Director’s contract contains additional provisions in respect of change  
of control.
Any share-based entitlements granted to an executive Director under the Company’s share plans will be determined based on the 
relevant plan rules. The default treatment under the PSP is that any outstanding awards lapse on cessation of employment. However, 
in certain prescribed circumstances, such as death, ill-health, disability, retirement or other circumstances at the discretion of the 
Committee, good leaver status may be applied. For good leavers, awards will not be forfeited on cessation of employment and subject 
to the satisfaction of the relevant performance conditions, will vest under the normal vesting schedule, being reduced pro rata to 
reflect the proportion of the performance period actually served. However, the Remuneration Committee has discretion to determine 
that PSP awards vest at cessation and/or to amend time pro rating. Outstanding DBP awards will lapse on cessation of employment. 
However, in certain good leaver circumstances, DBP awards will vest in full on the date of cessation.
external appointments of executive Directors
The Committee recognises that benefits can arise from allowing executive Directors to take a non-executive directorship elsewhere. 
Executive Directors are permitted to have one external appointment, from which fees may be retained with the approval of the Board.
Appointment of non-executive Directors
Non-executive Directors are appointed by the full Board following recommendations from the Nomination Committee. All non-executive 
Directors are appointed for a term of three years. In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, all non-executive Directors 
submit themselves for re-election at the AGM.

Non-executive  
Director fees
To attract and retain high 
quality and experienced 
non-executive Directors.
The Chairman is paid an annual fee and the 
non-executive Directors are paid an annual base 
fee and additional responsibility fees for the role 
of Senior Independent Director or for chairing  
a Board Committee.
Non-executive Directors based outside Europe 
receive an additional allowance for each visit 
made on Company business to the UK, or to any 
other country (excluding their home country). 
Fee levels are normally reviewed annually in July.
The non-executive Directors are not eligible to join 
any pension scheme operated by the Company 
and cannot participate in any of the Company’s 
share plans or annual incentive schemes. 
As per executive Directors, there  
is no prescribed maximum annual 
increase. The Committee is guided 
by the general increase in the 
non-executive director market  
and for the broader employee 
population, but on occasions may 
need to recognise, for example,  
an increase in the scale, scope  
or responsibility of the role.
None of the appointment letters for non-executive Directors contain provision for specific payment in the event of termination for 
whatever cause and may be terminated at will by either party.

Andrew McNaughton’s base salary was increased effective from 31 March 2013 on his promotion to Chief Executive.
The annual base salary review date is 1 July for executive Directors.
Performance targets for the AIP in 2014 
For 2014, the AIP will continue to be based on PBT (70% of the AIP potential) and Group-based measures linked to the business 
strategy (30% of the AIP potential). The Committee has chosen not to disclose, in advance, the performance targets for the 
forthcoming year as these include items which the Committee considers commercially sensitive. Retrospective disclosure of the 
targets and performance against them will be seen in next year’s Annual Report on Remuneration. 
The maximum AIP potential will continue to be 120% of base salary for executive Directors and 50% of any payment will be deferred 
in shares for three years.
Performance targets for PSP awards granted in 2014 
The PSP awards to be granted in 2014 will be subject to the following targets:
•	 relative TSR (50%) – the Company’s TSR measured against a comparator group of UK listed companies ranked 51-150 by market 
capitalisation in the FTSE All Share Index (excluding investment trusts) as at 1 January 2014, the start of the performance period
•	 relative TSR (50%) – the Company’s TSR measured against a comparator group of construction and professional services 
companies, including international peers
•	 for both parts there is no vesting below median, with 25% vesting at median ranking, rising to 100% vesting at upper quartile or 
higher. Opening and closing values used to calculate TSR for all companies are based on three month averages.
Non-executive Directors
As detailed in the Policy Report, the Company’s approach to setting non-executive Directors’ fees is by reference to fees paid at similar 
companies and reflects the time commitment and responsibilities of each role. A summary of current fees is as follows:
1 July 2012
£
1 j uly 2013
£ % increase
Chairman 265,750 265,750 0%
Base fee 56,000 56,000 0%
Senior Independent Director fee 10,000 10,000 0%
Committee chair fee 10,000 10,000 0%
For non-executive Directors based outside Europe the additional allowance for each overseas visit made on Company business 
remains at £2,500.
Where the Chairman or Senior Independent Director is also the Committee chair, only the Chairman or Senior Independent Director  
fee is due.

  Base salary and fees were those paid in respect of the period of the year during which the individuals were Directors.
2
  In practice the base salaries paid to Duncan Magrath, Andrew McNaughton and Peter Zinkin have been reduced due to their participation in the Company’s Share Incentive 
Plan. The salary reductions in 2013 were £1,500 for all three executive Directors. In practice the base salary paid to Peter Zinkin has been further reduced due to his 
participation in the Company’s SMART Pensions salary sacrifice arrangement. The salary reduction in 2013 was £7,005. This corresponds to his contributions to the 
Balfour Beatty Pension Fund, which were met directly by the Company as part of this arrangement. The base salary for Peter Zinkin has also been reduced in practice  
by £24,000 in 2013 to meet additional travelling costs incurred by him in order to fulfil his role.
3
  Taxable benefits are calculated in terms of UK taxable values. Duncan Magrath, Andrew McNaughton and Ian Tyler received private medical insurance for the Director and 
his immediate family. Peter Zinkin received private medical insurance for the Director and his spouse. Duncan Magrath received a car allowance of £14,000 pa. Andrew 
McNaughton received a car allowance of £14,000 pa prior to 31 March 2013 and £16,000 pa from 31 March 2013. Peter Zinkin received a fully expensed car with taxable 
benefit value of £8,800 pa. Ian Tyler received a fully expensed car and a fuel card up to 31 March 2013 with taxable benefit value of £26,300 pa.

  For periods of membership of the DC section of the Group’s pension fund this comprises the amount of Company contributions plus any cash allowances in lieu of pension 
on earnings that are above the earnings cap. For periods of membership of the defined benefit (DB section of the Group’s pension fund this comprises the value of any 
ongoing accrual as determined by the scheme actuaries plus any cash allowances in lieu of pension on earnings that are above the earnings cap. For any periods of 
non-membership of the Group’s pension fund this comprises any cash allowances in lieu of pension contributions. For periods of deferred membership of the DB section 
of the Group’s pension fund there may also be included the value of any increase in DB benefits as determined by the scheme actuaries. Further details are set out in the 
section on Directors’ pensions on pages 82 and 83. The figures for 2012 have been restated to comply with new regulations.
6
 The Executive Directors decided to defer 100% of their AIP for three years for the year ended 31 December 2013, rather than the usual 50% deferment of award.

appropriate, and (ii) to lead the strategic planning (Strategic Roadmap) process in 2013 and implement improvements in 2014.
Payments for loss of office
In line with contractual entitlements, Ian Tyler worked four months of his 12 months’ notice period, up to 30 April 2013 (after retiring 
from the Board on 31 March 2013), to ensure a smooth handover to Andrew McNaughton. In April 2013 Ian Tyler received his base 
salary of £57,333 and continued to receive his taxable benefits. He also accrued an additional month’s entitlement under the PSP.  
In lieu of the remainder of the notice period, he received a payment of £265,360 from the Company equivalent to four months’ base 
salary and benefits (for pension treatment see page 82) and phased monthly payments of £66,340 for each of the four months from 
September to December 2013, which would have been subject to an offset against any remuneration earned in a comparable role 
during this period. He also continued to receive private medical insurance for himself and his immediate family until 31 December 2013. 
As disclosed in the 2012 Remuneration Report, Ian Tyler has been treated as a good leaver under the relevant share plans.  
On 30 April 2013, his outstanding DBP awards vested in full and a proportion of his PSP awards lapsed reflecting the proportion  
of the performance period for each award which had not been completed at that date. The remainder of his PSP awards will vest 
subject to performance in the same proportion, and at the same time, as the awards made to the other participants.
Payments to past Directors
There were no payments to past Directors other than the payments disclosed in this report for Ian Tyler.

Performance graph 
As in previous reports, the Remuneration Committee has chosen to compare the TSR on the Company’s ordinary shares against the 
FTSE 250 Index (excluding investment trusts) principally because this is a broad index of which the Company is a constituent member. 
The values indicated in the graph show the share price growth plus reinvested dividends from a £100 hypothetical holding of ordinary 
shares in Balfour Beatty plc and in the index, and have been calculated using 30 trading day average values.

The Fund operates a Fund-specific earnings cap for pension purposes. The pensionable earnings of each participating Director were 
subject to the Fund-specific earnings cap. The Company paid allowances to Peter Zinkin and Ian Tyler in lieu of pension contributions 
on earnings above the Fund-specific earnings cap, which are included in the Directors’ remuneration table on page 76. 
Duncan Magrath opted out of the DB section of the Fund on 5 April 2012 and became a deferred pensioner. In accordance with the 
Fund rules his deferred pension was revalued in the year in line with price inflation (measured by the Retail Prices Index). He chose

Consumer Prices Index) less contributions paid by the Director, over the year ended 31 December 2013. The Pension amount for 
Peter Zinkin is the amount of the Company’s contributions paid to the DC section of the Fund excluding any SMART Pensions salary

  These amounts represent each Director’s accrued DB deferred pension at the relevant date. In accordance with the Fund Rules accrued DB deferred pension in excess of 
Guaranteed Minimum Pension has been increased in line with the Retail Prices Index between each Director’s date of becoming a deferred pensioner of the Fund and the 
relevant date.
2
   These amounts represent the value of the increase in excess of inflation (where inflation is measured as the annual increase in the Consumer Prices Index to the 
September before the relevant date) of the accrued DB deferred pension over the period, less Director contributions. The increase in benefits has been calculated using 
HMRC methodology and then multiplied by a factor of 20. The figures for Peter Zinkin represent the contributions paid over the period by the Company into the DC section 
of the Fund excluding any SMART Pensions salary sacrifice amounts.
3
  The accrued DB deferred pension figures shown for Duncan Magrath include his DB benefits in the Fund purchased with Additional Voluntary Contributions (AVCs).  
In May 2013 the Fund paid an Annual Allowance tax charge of £27,249 to HMRC on Duncan Magrath’s behalf in a ‘Scheme Pays’ arrangement. The value of this tax charge 
has been recorded as a negative DC contribution in respect of Duncan Magrath and will be rolled up to the Director’s retirement date, at which point it will be used to 
reduce the level of DB pension to which he is entitled from the Fund. The pensions table above makes no allowance for Duncan Magrath’s Scheme Pays arrangement.
 
4
  Peter Zinkin has not accrued any DB benefits in the Fund since 31 December 2010. Peter Zinkin has participated in the DC section since 1 January 2011, and the Company 
paid £28,020 into this arrangement during 2013, in addition to his SMART Pensions salary sacrifice of £7,005.
5
  Ian Tyler has not accrued any benefits in the Fund since 30 April 2013. Immediately prior to him becoming a deferred pensioner of the Fund, the Company contributed 
£40,420 towards augmenting his accrued deferred pension. Ian Tyler’s accrued DB deferred pension at 30 April 2013 included this augmentation of £2,391 pa.  
In May 2013 the Fund paid an Annual Allowance tax charge of £3,950 to HMRC on Ian Tyler’s behalf in a ‘Scheme Pays’ arrangement. The value of this tax charge 
has been recorded as a negative DC contribution in respect of Ian Tyler and will be rolled up to the Director’s retirement date, at which point it will be used to reduce 
the level of DB pension to which he is entitled from the Fund. The pensions table above makes no allowance for Ian Tyler’s ‘Scheme Pays’ arrangement.

•	 the Chief Executive and the HR director, who are invited to attend meetings of the Committee but are not present when matters 
relating directly to their own remuneration are discussed
•	 New Bridge Street (a trading name of Aon plc), (NBS).
NBS has been appointed as external independent executive remuneration advisers by the Committee and has provided a range 
of advice to the Committee during the year, including:
•	 provision of pay benchmarking data for the executive Directors and non-executive Directors
•	 annual update for the Committee on developments in best practice, market experience and regulatory requirements for all 
remuneration elements
•	 assistance with the drafting of the Remuneration Report
•	 valuation of share-based payments for IFRS 2 purposes
•	 calculation of vesting levels under the TSR element of the PSP awards.
Neither NBS nor any part of Aon plc provided any other services to the Company during the year under review. Total fees paid to NBS 
in respect of its services to the Remuneration Committee were £55,798.
NBS is a signatory to the Remuneration Consultants’ Code of Conduct. The Committee is satisfied that the advice that it receives from 
NBS is objective and independent.
s tatement of shareholder voting at AGM 
At the 2013 AGM, the Remuneration Report received the following votes from shareholders
Total number of votes % of votes cast
For 303,759,518 75.21%
Against 100,110,156 24.79%
Total votes cast 403,869,674 100%
Abstentions 42,527,882
The Committee has reflected on the significantly lower vote in favour of the Remuneration Report at the AGM in 2013, which it 
concluded could be attributed largely to investors’ concerns around the financial performance of the Group, following the operational 
issues in Construction Services UK, rather than specific issues with the remuneration policy, which had only recently been reviewed 
by major shareholders.

85 o pinion on financial statements of 
Balfour Beatty plc
In our opinion the financial statements:
•	 give a true and fair view of the state of 
the Group’s and of the Parent 
Company’s affairs as at 31 December 
2013 and of the Group’s loss and  
Parent Company’s profit for the year 
then ended;
•	 have been properly prepared in 
accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted 
by the European Union; and
•	 have been prepared in accordance with 
the requirements of the Companies Act 
2006 and, as regards the Group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation.
The financial statements comprise the Group 
and Parent Company Income Statements, 
the Group and Parent Company Statements 
of Comprehensive Income, the Group and 
Parent Company Balance Sheets, the Group 
and Parent Company Cash Flow Statements, 
the Group and Parent Company Statements 
of Changes in Equity and the related Notes 1 
to 41. The financial reporting framework 
that has been applied in their preparation 
is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by 
the European Union.
Going concern
As required by the Listing Rules we 
have reviewed the Directors’ statement 
on page 27 that the Group is a going 
concern. We confirm that:
•	 we have not identified material 
uncertainties related to events or 
conditions that may cast significant 
doubt on the Group’s ability to continue 
as a going concern which we believe 
would need to be disclosed in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted 
by the European Union; and
•	 we have concluded that the Directors’ 
use of the going concern basis of 
accounting in the preparation of the 
financial statements is appropriate.
However, because not all future events 
or conditions can be predicted, this 
statement is not a guarantee as to 
the Group’s ability to continue as a 
going concern.

o ur assessment of risks of material misstatement
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are those that had the greatest effect on our audit strategy, the 
allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team:
su Bje Ct nAtuR e oF RIsK ho W the s Co Pe o F ou R Au DIt R es Pon DeD to the RI s K
Recognition  
of contract 
revenue, 
margin and 
related 
receivables 
and liabilities
The industry is characterised by 
contract risk with significant 
judgements involved in the 
assessment of current and future 
contract financial performance, 
variations to original contract terms 
and claims.
Our work on the recognition of contract revenue, margin and related 
receivables and liabilities included:
•	 tests of controls over the recognition of contract revenue and margin;
•	 challenge of management’s key judgements inherent in the forecast 
costs to complete that drive the accounting under the percentage  
of completion method, including a review of the contract terms  
and conditions, management’s assessments of the forecasts,  
the existence and valuation of claims and variations both within 
contract revenue and contract costs; and
•	 an assessment of the recoverability of related receivables.
Goodwill Management is required to carry out 
an annual impairment test which 
incorporates judgements based on 
assumptions about future profitability 
for the related businesses.
We assessed and challenged management’s assumptions used in  
the impairment model for goodwill and intangible assets, described  
in Note 15 to the financial statements, including benchmarking the 
discount and long-term growth rates, against third party data and 
assessing the reasonableness of forecast future cash flows by 
comparison to historic performance and future outlook.
Assets held 
for sale, 
discontinued 
operations 
and disposal 
accounting
The classification and valuation of 
assets as held for sale is a key area of 
management judgement. In addition, 
the classification of businesses as 
discontinued operations must be 
carefully considered in line with the 
relevant accounting standard. In relation 
to disposed operations, management 
also applies judgement in determining 
the gain or loss on disposal. 
We challenged management’s judgement on assets held for sale 
through understanding the status of the sales process and reviewing 
correspondence from prospective purchasers. We assessed the 
classification of disposed businesses and assets held for sale as 
discontinued operations against the relevant criteria in the accounting 
standard. For disposed businesses we tested the calculation of the  
gain or loss on disposal and challenged the judgements made in relation 
to consideration and disposal provisions with reference to the sales 
agreements and supporting documentation. 
The Audit Committee’s consideration of 
the above risks is set out on page 56.
Our audit procedures relating to these 
matters were designed in the context of 
our audit of the financial statements as a 
whole, and not to express an opinion on 
individual accounts or disclosures. Our 
opinion on the financial statements is not 
modified with respect to any of the risks 
described above, and we do not express 
an opinion on these individual matters.
o ur application of materiality
We apply the concept of materiality  
both in planning and performing our  
audit, and in evaluating the effect of 
misstatements on our audit and on the 
financial statements. For the purposes  
of determining whether the financial 
statements are free from material 
misstatement we define materiality as  
the magnitude of misstatement that 
makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable 
person, relying on the financial statements, 
would be changed or influenced.
When establishing our overall audit 
strategy, we determined planning 
materiality for the Group to be £15 million, 
which is approximately 8% of underlying 
profit before tax. We use underlying  
profit before tax to exclude the effect  
of volatility (for example, separately 
disclosed non-underlying items) from our 
determination and as it represents a key 
performance measure for the Group.
balfourbeatty.com/ar2013 Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2013
86 An overview of the scope of our audit
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining 
an understanding of the Group and its 
environment, including group-wide controls, 
and assessing the risks of material 
misstatement at the group level. Based on 
that assessment, we focused our Group 
audit scope primarily on the audit work at 
the most significant operating companies 
where either full or specified audit 
procedures were carried out based on 
our assessment of the identified risks of 
material misstatement identified above. 
The remaining operating companies were 
subject to analytical review procedures 
designed to confirm that no further risks 
of misstatement existed that were 
material to the Group financial statements. 
Operating companies representing the 
principal business units within the Group’s 
reportable segments and accounting for 
80% of the Group’s revenue are subject to 
full audit procedures with those accounting 
for 7% of the Group’s revenue subject to 
specified audit procedures. Analytical 
review procedures were carried out at the 
remaining operating companies accounting 
for 13% of the Group’s revenue. The 
coverage of our audit procedures as a 
percentage of the revenue of each 
reportable segment is similar. 
The Group audit team follow a programme 
of planned visits to the significant operating 
companies. The Senior Statutory Auditor or 
another senior member of the Group audit 
team visited operating companies covering 
77% of Group revenue in the year. The 
Senior Statutory Auditor or another senior 
member of the Group audit team also 
discussed the risk assessment, reviewed 
documentation of key findings and 
participated in the close meetings for all 
operating companies subject to full scope. 
At the parent entity level we also tested 
the consolidation process and carried out 
analytical procedures to confirm our 
conclusion that there were no significant 
risks of material misstatement of the 
aggregated financial information of the 
remaining components not subject to audit 
or audit of specified account balances.
o pinion on other matters prescribed 
by the Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion:
•	 the part of the 2013 Remuneration 
Report to be audited has been properly 
prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006; and
•	 the information given in the Strategic 
Report and the Directors’ Report for the 
financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent 
with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required 
to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received 
and accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are 
required to report to you if, in our opinion:
•	 we have not received all the information 
and explanations we require for our 
audit; or
•	 adequate accounting records have not 
been kept by the Parent Company, or 
returns adequate for our audit have not 
been received from branches not visited 
by us; or
•	 the Parent Company financial 
statements are not in agreement with 
the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect  
of these matters.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are 
also required to report if in our opinion 
certain disclosures of Directors’ 
remuneration have not been made or  
the part of the 2013 Remuneration Report 
to be audited is not in agreement with  
the accounting records and returns.  
Under the Listing Rules we are required  
to review certain elements of the 2013 
Remuneration Report. We have nothing  
to report arising from these matters or  
our review.
Corporate Governance Statement
Under the Listing Rules we are also 
required to review the part of the 
Corporate Governance Statement relating 
to the Company’s compliance with  
nine provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. We have nothing  
to report arising from our review.
Our duty to read other information  
in the Annual Report 
Under the International Standards and 
Auditing (UK and Ireland), we are required 
to report to you if, in our opinion, 
information in the Annual Report is:
•	 materially inconsistent with the 
information in the audited financial 
statements; or
•	 apparently materially incorrect based  
on, or materially inconsistent with, our 
knowledge of the Group acquired in  
the course of performing our audit; or
•	 is otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider 
whether we have identified any 
inconsistencies between our knowledge 
acquired during the audit and the 
Directors’ statement that they consider 
the Annual Report is fair, balanced and 
understandable and whether the Annual 
Report appropriately discloses those 
matters that we communicated to the 
Audit Committee which we consider 
should have been disclosed. We confirm 
that we have not identified any such 
inconsistencies or misleading statements. 
Respective responsibilities of Directors 
and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ 
Responsibilities Statement, the Directors 
are responsible for the preparation of the 
financial statements and for being satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view.  
Our responsibility is to audit and express 
an opinion on the financial statements  
in accordance with applicable law and 
International Standards on Auditing  
(UK and Ireland). Those standards require 
us to comply with the Auditing Practices 
Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.  
We also comply with International 
Standard on Quality Control 1 (UK and 
Ireland). Our audit methodology and tools 
aim to ensure that our quality control 
procedures are effective, understood and 
applied. Our quality controls and systems 
include our dedicated professional 
standards review team, strategically 
focused second partner reviews and 
independent partner reviews.
This report is made solely to the 
Company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of 
the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work 
has been undertaken so that we might 
state to the Company’s members those 
matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditor’s report and for no other 
purpose. To the fullest extent permitted  
by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the 
Company and the Company’s members as 
a body, for our audit work, for this report, 
or for the opinions we have formed.
s cope of the audit of the financial 
statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence 
about the amounts and disclosures in the 
financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial 
statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud 
or error. This includes an assessment of: 
whether the accounting policies are 
appropriate to the Group’s and the Parent 
Company’s circumstances and have 
been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; the reasonableness of 
significant accounting estimates made by 
the Directors; and the overall presentation 
of the financial statements. In addition,  
we read all the financial and non-financial 
information in the Annual Report to identify 
material inconsistencies with the audited 
financial statements and to identify any 
information that is apparently materially 
incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired 
by us in the course of performing the audit. 
If we become aware of any apparent 
material misstatements or inconsistencies 
we consider the implications for our report.

GrOU p INCOME STaTEMENT Co MMent ARy on the G Rou P 
In Co Me s t Ate Ment
*
Total underlying profit from 
continuing operations for 2013 
was £203m. The total loss after 
tax including discontinued 
operations was £35m.
Background
The Group income statement includes 
the majority of the Group’s income and 
expenses for the year with the remainder 
being recorded within the statement of 
comprehensive income. The Group’s 
income statement is presented showing 
the Group’s underlying and non-underlying 
results separately on the face of  
the income statement to assist in 
understanding the underlying financial 
performance achieved by the Group.
In 2013 the income statement has been 
presented on a continuing basis. The post 
tax results of certain Mainland European 
rail businesses and the UK facilities 
management business, Balfour Beatty 
WorkPlace (BBW), which are classified  
as discontinued operations, are  
presented in a single line “(Loss)/profit for 
the year from discontinued operations”. 
The prior year numbers have been 
re-presented accordingly.
In addition, the Group restated the prior 
year income statement as a result of 
adopting IAS 19 Employee Benefits 
(Revised) in 2013, increasing the prior year’s 
total net interest cost by £10m. Previously 
the net pension finance charge was 
calculated by applying an expected rate  
of return to the pension assets and the  
AA corporate bond discount rate to  
the pension liabilities. IAS 19 Revised 
calculates the net pension finance charge 
by applying the AA corporate bond 
discount rate to the net pension surplus  
or deficit. The AA corporate bond rate is 
normally lower than the expected return 
on assets and so the effect is to give a 
higher net finance charge. 
Revenue
Revenue from continuing operations 
including joint ventures and associates 
increased by 2% to £10,118m from 
£9,966m in 2012. Revenue was broadly 
flat across all segments albeit there  
was a change in the geographical mix.  
In Construction Services, a 12% 
improvement in the US was offset by  
a corresponding reduction in the UK.  
In Professional Services reductions in 
Australia were largely mitigated by 
improvements in the US. Excluding  
the impact of currency, revenue from 
continuing operations including joint 
ventures and associates increased by 1%.
Gain on disposal of investments
The Group continued its programme 
of realising accumulated value in the 
Infrastructure Investments portfolio and 
generating income by disposing of its 
interest in two Consort Healthcare 
hospitals, four Transform Schools education 
projects and partially disposing of its 
interest in two Connect Roads highway 
projects resulting in a net underlying gain  
of £82m after recycling £21m from 
reserves to the income statement.
s hare of results of joint ventures 
and associates
Joint ventures and associates are those 
entities over which the Group exercises 
joint control or has significant influence 
and whose results are generally 
incorporated using the equity method 
whereby the Group’s share of the post-tax 
results of joint ventures and associates is 
included in the Group’s operating profit.
u nderlying profit from operations
Underlying profit from continuing 
operations decreased by 28% to £203m 
from £284m in 2012. Support Services and 
Investments delivered excellent operating 
results, including the benefit of £82m of 
gains from the above disposals. However, 
overall profits reduced as a result of a 
significant drop in mining related capital 
expenditure in Australia impacting the 
professional services business. In addition, 
a combination of a difficult external 
environment and an internal reorganisation 
in our UK construction business caused 
a shortfall in expected profits.
n on-underlying items
Non-underlying items are items of 
financial performance which the Group 
believes should be separately identified on 
the face of the income statement to assist 
in understanding the underlying financial 
performance achieved by the Group. 
Non-underlying items from continuing 
operations of £155m before tax were 
charged to the income statement. 
These comprised amortisation of  
acquired intangible assets of £30m and 
other items of £125m. The amortisation 
charge declined in the year as some 
acquired intangible assets became  
fully amortised. 
Significant other non-underlying items 
included a £52m curtailment charge from 
closing the defined benefit section of the 
Balfour Beatty pension scheme to future 
accrual for the majority of members and 
£52m of restructuring costs. Restructuring 
costs are mainly due to the planned 
restructuring of the UK construction 
business where six business units were 
integrated into three business streams 
£14m, and restructuring in Australia as  
a result of the severe market downturn 
£20m. The creation of the professional 
services shared service centre in 
Lancaster, Pennsylvania cost £10m.
n et finance costs
Net finance costs of £16m increased by 
£9m primarily resulting from the US 
private placement in March 2013. 
taxation
The underlying tax charge for continuing 
operations excluding the Group’s share of 
the results of joint ventures and associates 
of £50m equates to an effective tax rate  
of 43.1% (2012: 33.0%). This increase  
is due to the impact of unrelieved losses  
and changes in tax legislation.
(Loss)/profit from discontinued 
operations
(Loss)/profit from discontinued operations 
shows the post tax results relating to 
certain Mainland European rail businesses 
and BBW, which are classified as 
discontinued operations. 
In December we completed the sale of 
BBW for a net cash consideration of 
£155m. After transaction costs and other 
charges the disposal resulted in a non-
underlying gain of £16m. BBW contributed 
£19m (2012: £22m) to underlying profit 
from discontinued operations.
There was a disappointing performance  
in Mainland European rail mainly due to 
underperformance in Germany resulting in 
an underlying loss from operations of £26m 
(2012: profit of £2m). Non-underlying costs 
of £51m included £38m for writing down 
the goodwill in the German rail business  
to £nil, a loss on disposal of the Spanish 
business of £4m, a loss on disposal of the 
Stassfurt Signalling Workshop of £1m,  
rail restructuring costs of £6m and a £2m 
regulatory fine in Germany.
earnings per share (ePs )
Basic EPS from continuing operations  
was 2.5p, down 86% as a result of lower 
profits as discussed above. Underlying 
EPS from continuing operations was 
20.0p (2012: 31.7p).

discontinued operations of  
£35m and other comprehensive 
expense after tax of £177m. 
Background
The Statement of Comprehensive Income 
(OCI) is presented on a total Group basis 
combining continuing and discontinued 
operations.
OCI is categorised into items which will 
affect the profit and loss of the Group in 
subsequent periods when the gain or loss 
is realised and those which will not be 
recycled into the income statement.
Items which will not subsequently be 
reclassified to the income statement
Actuarial movements on retirement 
benefit liabilities are increases or 
decreases in the present value of the 
pension liability because of:
•	 differences between the previous 
actuarial assumptions and what has 
actually occurred
•	 changes in actuarial assumptions used 
to value the obligations. 
Actuarial losses for the Group including 
joint ventures and associates decreased 
from £115m in 2012 to £114m in 2013. 
Refer to Note 28.
Items which will subsequently be 
reclassified to the income statement
Currency translation differences
The Group operates in a number of 
countries with different local currencies. 
Currency translation differences arise  
on translation of the balance sheet  
and results from the local functional 
currency into the Group’s presentational 
currency, sterling.
Fair value revaluations –  
PPP financial assets 
Assets constructed by PPP concession 
companies are classified principally as 
available-for-sale financial assets. In the 
operational phase fair value is determined 
by discounting the future cash flows 
allocated to the financial asset using 
discount rates based on long-term  
gilt rates adjusted for the risk levels 
associated with the assets, with market 
related fair value movements recognised 
in OCI and other fair value movements 
recognised in the income statement. 
During the year there was an increase in 
gilt rates resulting in a fair value loss of 
£192m being taken through OCI. In 2012 
the fair value of the financial assets 
included a significant uplift due to the 
M25 reaching construction completion 
and being fair valued for the first time.
Fair value revaluations –  
cash flow hedges
Cash flow hedges are principally interest 
rate swaps, to manage the interest rate 
and inflation rate risks in the Group’s 
Infrastructure Investments’ subsidiary, 
joint venture and associate companies 
which are exposed by their long-term 
contractual agreements. The fair value  
of derivatives constantly changes in 
response to prevailing market conditions. 
During the year LIBOR increased resulting 
in a fair value gain on the interest rate 
swaps of £120m being recognised in  
OCI in 2013 (2012: £19m loss).
Available-for-sale investments  
in mutual funds
The available-for-sale investments in 
mutual funds comprise holdings in a 
number of funds, based on employees’ 
investment elections, in respect of the 
deferred compensation obligations  
of the Group as disclosed in Note 28. 
The fair value of the available-for-sale 
investments is £60m determined by  
the market price of each fund at the 
reporting date.
Recycling of revaluation reserves  
to the income statement on disposal
Fair value gains and losses relating to  
the PPP financial assets and derivatives 
recognised in OCI are transferred to the 
income statement upon disposal of the 
asset and therefore on disposal of eight 
Infrastructure Investments’ concessions, 
£21m was recycled to the income 
statement through OCI and is included  
in the gain on disposal. There is no 
associated tax on the amounts recycled  
to the income statement.

*
Total equity holders funds of 
£1,035m at 31 December 2013 
decreased by 21% primarily  
due to movements in other 
comprehensive income and  
the payment of dividends. 
Background
The Statement of Changes in Equity 
includes the total comprehensive income 
attributable to equity holders of the 
Company and non-controlling interests 
and also discloses transactions which 
have been recognised directly in equity 
and not through the income statement.
Dividends
The Board has recommended a final 
dividend of 8.5p in respect of 2013 in  
line with the prior year’s final dividend, 
resulting in a full-year dividend of 14.1p 
(2012: 14.1p). The full-year dividend paid 
during 2013 equated to £96m. Underlying 
dividend cover from continuing operations, 
taking into account PPP disposal gains,  
for 2013 is 1.4 times. 
j oint venture’ and associates’ dividends
Dividends of £47m were received in the 
year from joint ventures and associates 
(JVA) resulting in a transfer of this amount 
between JVA reserves and Group  
retained profit.
s hare issues
During the year 657,281 ordinary shares 
were issued for £1.4m of which £1.1m 
was share premium.
s pecial reserve
A special reserve of £185m was created 
in 2004 as a result of cancelling £181m  
of share premium and cancelling the  
£4m capital redemption reserve in  
Balfour Beatty plc. This was approved  
by the court and becomes distributable  
to the extent of future increases in  
share capital and share premium, of  
which £1m occurred in 2013 (2012: £2m). 
o ther reserves
Other reserves comprises: the equity 
components of the preference shares and 
convertible bonds £44m (2012: £17m); the 
Group’s hedging reserves £(56)m (2012: 
£(109)m); PPP financial asset revaluation 
reserve £56m (2012: £93m); currency 
translation reserve £8m (2012: £21m); 
merger reserve £249m (2012: £249m); 
and other reserves £22m (2012: £18m).
Equity component of convertible bonds
On 3 December the Group issued 
convertible bonds for net proceeds 
of £246m. The convertible bonds are 
compound instruments comprising both 
equity and liability components. The fair 
value of the liability component was 
£220m, estimated using the prevailing 
market rate at the date of issue for a 
similar non-convertible instrument.  
The equity component of £26m is the 
difference between the net proceeds and 
the fair value of the liability component 
representing the embedded option to 
convert the bonds into the Company’s 
ordinary shares. 
o ther reserve transfers relating to 
joint venture and associate disposals 
On disposal of JVAs, retained profits 
relating to these businesses are transferred 
from the JVA reserves to the Group’s 
retained profits.

Bala NCE SHEETS
At 31 December 2013 Co MMent ARy on the G Rou P 
BALAn Ce sheet
*
Total assets of £5.7bn were 1% 
less than last year. Total liabilities 
of £4.7bn increased by 4% 
primarily due to the increase in 
the pension deficit during the year. 
Background
The Group’s balance sheet shows the 
Group’s assets and liabilities as at 31 
December 2013. In accordance with IAS 1 
Presentation of Financial Statements and 
IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale 
and Discontinued Operations, the Group 
does not re-present the prior year balance 
sheet for discontinued operations or 
disposals. Instead, at December 2013,  
all assets and liabilities relating to the 
discontinued operations are no longer 
consolidated line by line in the Group’s 
balance sheet but shown within assets 
held for sale or liabilities held for sale.  
This should be borne in mind when 
making year-on-year comparisons. 
Goodwill
The goodwill on the Group’s balance 
sheet at 31 December 2013 decreased to 
£1,048m (2012: £1,160m). £64m of this 
reduction was due to the disposal of 
Balfour Beatty WorkPlace with a further 
£38m reduction due to an impairment in 
respect of Rail Germany. 
Impairment reviews have been carried 
out on all goodwill. No goodwill, other 
than Rail Germany mentioned above, 
was impaired.
Investments in joint ventures and 
associates
Investments in joint ventures and 
associates decreased during the year 
primarily due to the disposal of 
Infrastructure Investments joint ventures.
PPP financial assets
The £87m decrease in the PPP financial 
assets is principally driven by the part 
disposal of Connect CNDR Holdings Ltd 
and the reduction in the fair value of the 
remaining financial assets due to a rise  
in discount rates resulting from a rise  
in gilt rates.
Working capital
Net movements in working capital are 
discussed in the statement of cash flows 
commentary on page 97. 
Provisions are discussed in the working 
capital commentary and in detail in 
Note 25.
Borrowings
Borrowings excluding non-recourse 
loans
The Group’s principal committed facilities 
total £950m and extend through to 2016. 
The purpose of these facilities, and some 
other smaller facilities, is to provide 
liquidity from a group of core relationship 
banks to support Balfour Beatty in its 
activities. However, as the Group’s 
business has evolved over time, Balfour 
Beatty has diversified its sources of  
funds away from the bank market. 
As part of that process, in March 2013 the 
Company issued notes in a US$350m US 
private placement with an average coupon 
of 4.94% per annum and an average 
maturity of 9.3 years. The incremental 
annual cost of this funding is 
approximately £9m. 
In December the Group issued £253m of 
unsecured convertible bonds due 2018 at 
a coupon of 1.875% per annum. The 
incremental annual cost in the income 
statement of this funding is approximately 
£8m. The proceeds from these new funds 
were used in the first instance to repay 
borrowings under the committed facilities.
Non-recourse loans
In addition, the Group has non-recourse 
facilities in companies engaged in PPP 
projects and infrastructure investments. 
At 31 December 2013, the Group’s share 
of non-recourse net borrowings amounted 
to £1,953m (2012: £2,122m), comprising 
£1,599m (2012: £1,754m) in relation to 
joint ventures and associates as disclosed 
in Note 18.2 and £354m (2012: £368m) 
on the Group balance sheet in relation  
to subsidiaries as disclosed in Note 26.
Retirement benefit liabilities
The Group’s balance sheet includes 
aggregate liabilities ie deficits of £434m 
(2012: £333m restated for IAS 19 
Revised) in the Group’s pension schemes. 
The retirement liabilities increased 
primarily due to an increase in the inflation 
assumptions and a £52m curtailment 
charge resulting from the majority of the 
Balfour Beatty Pension Fund’s (BBPF) 
members ceasing to accrue future defined 
benefits and becoming deferred members. 
Refer to Note 28 for further details. 
Any surplus of deficit contributions would 
be recoverable by way of a reduction in 
future contributions as the Group has the 
ability to use surplus funds in the defined 
benefit section of the BBPF to pay its 
contributions due under the defined 
benefit and defined contribution sections 
of the BBPF. 
Assets and liabilities held for sale
Refer to Note 12 for an analysis of assets 
and liabilities relating to the discontinued 
operations at the year end. The Group is 
continuing negotiations with interested 
parties and does not consider the value 
of the remaining Mainland European rail 
businesses to be impaired at the year end.
o ther
In addition to the liabilities on the  
balance sheet, in the normal course of  
its business, the Group arranges for 
financial institutions to provide clients  
with guarantees in connection with its 
contracting activities, commonly referred 
to as bonds. These bonds provide a client 
with a level of financial protection in the 
event that a contractor fails to meet its 
commitments under the terms of a 
contract. They are customary or 
mandatory in many of the markets in 
which the Group operates. In return for 
issuing the bonds, the financial institutions 
receive a fee and a counter indemnity 
from the Company. As at 31 December 
2013, contract bonds in issue by financial 
institutions under uncommitted facilities 
covered £2.8bn (2012: £3.3bn) of the 
contract commitments of the Group.
Equity commitments
During 2013 the Group invested £48m 
(2012: £55m) in a combination of equity 
and shareholder loans to Infrastructure 
Investments’ project companies and at 
the end of the year had committed to 
provide a further £137m from 2014 
onwards, inclusive of £50m expected for 
two projects at preferred bidder stage. 
£73m of this is expected to be invested  
in 2014.

*
Cash and cash equivalents 
decreased by 1% during the  
year to £526m. Cash used in 
operating activities decreased  
by 26% to £175m.
Background 
The statement of cash flows shows the 
cash flows from operating, investing and 
financing activities during the year.
Working capital
Working capital includes: inventories and 
non-construction work in progress; 
amounts due to and from construction 
contract clients; operating trade and other 
receivables; operating trade and other 
payables; and operating provisions.  
Where the net working capital balance is 
in an asset position, ie the inventory and 
receivables balances are greater than the 
payables and provisions, this is referred  
to as “positive working capital”. Where 
this is not the case this is referred to  
as “negative working capital”.
Working capital movements
The movement of the individual  
working capital balances on the balance 
sheet will not be reflective of the actual 
movement of working capital in the year 
because the December 2013 balances 
exclude amounts relating to discontinued 
operations and disposals whereas the 
prior year balances include these balances.
Working capital movements are disclosed 
in Note 31.1. 
Inventories and non-construction work 
in progress
During 2013 movement on inventories and 
non-construction work in progress was 
broadly flat with a £5m decrease for 
continuing operations.
Amounts due from construction 
contract clients
During 2013 there was a £93m increase  
in amounts due for construction contract 
clients from continuing operations 
primarily due to a large contract in  
Support Services on which work is being 
performed but payment is not made  
until completion of certain milestones  
in the project. 
Operating trade and other receivables
During 2013 there was a £166m increase 
in operating trade and other receivables 
for continuing operations primarily due  
to new contract wins in Construction 
Services US which is in line with its 
increased revenue in the second half  
of 2013.
Amounts due to construction  
contract clients
During 2013 there was a £33m increase  
in amounts due to construction contract 
clients for continuing operations due  
to the lifecycle of some projects in 
Professional Services and Construction 
Services US.
Operating trade and other payables
During 2013 there was a £106m increase 
in operating trade and other payables for 
continuing operations primarily due to new 
contract wins in the second half of the 
year for Construction Services US in line 
with increased cost of sales.
Operating provisions
During 2013 there was a £14m decrease 
in operating provisions for continuing 
operations primarily due to utilising 
restructuring provisions during the year. 
Refer to Note 25.
Cash used in operations
Underlying cash used in continuing 
operations of £83m (2012: £175m) was 
impacted by a working capital outflow  
of £129m (2012: £339m) and pension 
deficit payments of £57m (2012: £61m). 
Non-underlying cash used in continuing 
operations was £75m (2012: £44m) after 
adjusting for the following non-cash items: 
a £51m (2012: £44m) pension curtailment 
charge resulting from ceasing to accrue 
future defined benefits for the majority  
of the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund’s 
members and amortisation of acquired 
intangible assets £30m (2012: £39m).
Cash used in discontinued operations was 
£4m (2012: £nil) after adjusting for a 
non-cash movement relating to goodwill 
impairment of £38m (2012: £95m). 
Cash flows from investing activities
The Group received dividends of £47m 
(2012: £58m) from joint ventures and 
associates during the year. 
During the year the Group purchased 
intangible assets of £38m (2012: £25m)  
of which £21m (2012: £nil) related to 
Edinburgh student accommodation. Of 
the £82m property, plant and equipment 
purchased during the year, £71m relates 
to continuing operations and relates to: 
the purchase of plant and equipment 
£39m; capitalisation of leasehold 
improvements £20m mainly relating to the 
new professional services shared service 
centre, and the refit of our New York 
headquarters; and assets in course of 
construction £12m, the majority of which 
relates to investment projects in the US. 
The Group disposed of interests in seven 
PPP joint ventures and one infrastructure 
joint venture during the year for £102m.  
In addition the Group partially disposed  
of one PPP subsidiary for £26m, retaining 
an interest in the entity as a joint venture. 
The Group also disposed of Balfour Beatty 
WorkPlace, the UK facilities management 
business (BBW), Rail Spain and  
Stassfurt Signalling Workshop for a net 
consideration of £152m, of which £146m 
relates to the disposal of BBW being 
consideration of £155m less transaction 
costs and cash disposed of £9m.
Cash flows from financing activities 
The Group diversified its borrowings  
in the year by entering into a US private 
placement in March 2013 for US$350m, 
(£231m) and in December 2013, the 
Group issued convertible bonds for net 
proceeds of £246m. These funds were 
used in the first instance to repay 
borrowings under committed facilities.
Ordinary dividends of £96m were 
declared and paid during the year and 
preference dividends of £11m were paid.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents decreased 
from £532m to £526m excluding the 
project cash held in a jointly controlled 
operation which is classified within assets 
held for sale.

The annual financial statements have 
been prepared on a going concern  
basis as discussed on page 27 and in 
accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by 
the European Union and therefore comply 
with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation 
and with those parts of the Companies 
Act 2006 that are applicable to companies 
reporting under IFRS. The Group has 
applied all accounting standards and 
interpretations issued by the International 
Accounting Standards Board (IASB)  
and International Financial Reporting 
Interpretations Committee as adopted 
by the European Union and effective  
for accounting periods beginning on  
1 January 2013. The Group early  
adopted amendments to IAS 36 
Recoverable Amount Disclosures  
for Non-financial Assets.
The financial statements have been 
prepared under the historical cost

2.1 Accounting standards
Adoption of new and revised 
standards
The following accounting standards, 
interpretations and amendments have 
been adopted by the Group in the  
current period: 
•	 IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement
•	 Amendments to the following 
standards: 
 − IFRS 1 Government Loans
 − IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: 
Disclosures – Offsetting Financial 
Assets and Financial Liabilities 
 − IAS 19 Employee Benefits (Revised) 
 − IAS 32 Financial Instruments: 
Disclosures – Offsetting Financial 
Assets and Financial Liabilities
 − IAS 36 Impairment of Assets
 − IAS 36 Recoverable Amount 
Disclosures for Non-financial Assets 
 − Improvements to IFRSs (2009–2011). 
Other than IAS 19 Employee Benefits 
(Revised) (IAS 19 Revised), the above  
new and amended standards do not have 
a material effect on the Group. The effect 
on the financial statements of adopting 
IAS 19 Revised is disclosed in Note 38.
Accounting standards not yet adopted 
by the Group
The following accounting standards, 
interpretations and amendments have 
been issued by the IASB but had either 
not been adopted by the European Union 
or were not yet effective in the European 
Union at 31 December 2013: 
•	 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 
•	 IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial 
Statements 
•	 IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements 
•	 IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in 
Other Entities
•	 IFRIC 21: Levies 
•	 Amendments to the following 
standards: 
 − IFRS 10, IFRS 11 and IFRS 12: 
Investment Entities 
 − IFRS 10, IFRS 11 and IFRS 12: 
Transition Guidance
 − IAS 19 Employee Benefits: Defined 
Benefit Plans: Employee 
Contributions
 − IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements 
 − IAS 28 Investments in Associates 
and Joint Ventures
 − IAS 39 Novation of Derivatives and 
Continuation of Hedge Accounting
 − Improvements to IFRSs (2010–2012)
 − Improvements to IFRSs (2011–2013).
Of these, IFRS 9 is expected to have the 
most significant effect. 
IFRS 9 will replace IAS 39 Financial 
Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement. IFRS 9 in issue as at 
31 December 2013 concerns the 
classification and measurement of 
financial assets and financial liabilities,  
the de-recognition of financial instruments 
and hedge accounting. 
The requirements of IFRS 9 in issue as  
at 31 December 2013 would result in  
the Group’s PPP financial assets being 
reclassified from “available-for-sale”, 
which is a category that would no longer 
exist under the current new standard,  
to a debt instrument measured either at 
amortised cost or at fair value through 
profit or loss. Assuming the Group adopts 
the fair value through profit or loss option, 
movements in the fair value of PPP 
financial assets will no longer be 
recognised in other comprehensive 
income. Retrospective application of this 
requirement would result in the closing 
balance of fair value movements 
recognised in PPP financial asset reserves 
being transferred to retained earnings. The 
effect within the Group’s reserves would 
be a transfer of £57m from PPP financial 
asset reserves to retained earnings. The 
effect within the share of joint ventures’ 
and associates’ reserves would be a 
transfer of £251m from PPP financial 
asset reserves to retained earnings.
On 28 November 2012 the IASB issued  
an Exposure Draft, Classification and 
Measurement: Limited Amendments to 
IFRS 9, which proposes a new category 
for the classification of financial assets 
and liabilities, “Fair value through other 
comprehensive income”. Should these 
proposals be adopted, the Group’s PPP 
financial assets will be classified as  
“Fair value through other comprehensive 
income” which would not result in a 
material change to the current accounting 
for the Group’s PPP financial assets.

2.3 Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements include 
the results of the Company and its 
subsidiaries, together with the Group’s 
share of the results of joint ventures and 
associates, drawn up to 31 December 
each year.
a) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities over which the 
Group has control, being the power to 
govern the financial and operating policies 
of the investee entity so as to obtain 
benefits from its activities. The results 
of subsidiaries acquired or sold in the 
year are consolidated from the effective 
date of acquisition to the effective date 
of disposal.
The acquisition method of accounting 
is used to account for the acquisition of 
subsidiaries by the Group. On acquisition, 
the assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at 
their fair values at the date of acquisition. 
Any excess of the fair value of the cost 
of acquisition over the fair values of 
the identifiable net assets acquired is 
recognised as goodwill. Any deficiency 
of the cost of acquisition below the fair 
values of the identifiable net assets 
acquired (discount on acquisition) is 
credited to the income statement in the 
period of acquisition. The interest of 
non-controlling equity holders is stated 
at the non-controlling equity holders’ 
proportion of the fair value of the assets 
and liabilities recognised. 
When the Group loses control of a 
subsidiary, the profit or loss on disposal  
is calculated as the difference between  
(i) the aggregate of the fair value of the 
consideration received and the fair value 
of any retained interest less direct costs  
of the transaction and (ii) the previous 
carrying amount of the assets (including 
goodwill), less liabilities of the subsidiary. 
The fair value of any investment retained 
in the former subsidiary at the date when 
control is lost is regarded as the fair value 
on initial recognition for subsequent 
accounting under IAS 39 Financial 
Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement or, when applicable, the 
cost on initial recognition of an investment 
in an associate or jointly controlled entity. 
Amounts previously recognised in other 
comprehensive income in relation to the 
subsidiary are accounted for in the same 
manner as would be required if the 
relevant assets or liabilities were disposed 
of (i.e. reclassified to profit or loss or 
transferred directly to retained earnings).
Any acquisition or disposal which does not 
result in a change in control is accounted 
for as a transaction between equity 
holders. The carrying amounts of the 
controlling and non-controlling interests 
are adjusted to reflect the changes in their 
relative interests in the subsidiary. Any 
difference between the fair value of the 
consideration paid or received and the 
amount by which the non-controlling 
interests are adjusted is recognised 
directly in equity and attributed to the 
owners of the parent.
Accounting policies of subsidiaries are 
adjusted where necessary to ensure 
consistency with those used by the 
Group. All intra-Group transactions, 
balances, income and expenses are 
eliminated on consolidation.
b) Joint ventures and associates 
Joint ventures are those entities over 
which the Group exercises joint control 
through a contractual arrangement. 
Associates are entities over which 
the Group is in a position to exercise 
significant influence, but does not 
control or exercise joint control, through 
participation in the financial and 
operating policy decisions of the investee. 
The results, assets and liabilities of joint 
ventures and associates are generally 
incorporated in the financial statements 
using the equity method of accounting 
except when classified as held for sale. 
The Group may elect to measure some  
of its investments in associates at fair 
value through profit or loss in accordance 
with IAS 39 where the investment is  
held by a Group entity which meets  
the classification of a venture capital 
organisation, in which case the 
investment will be marked to market  
with movements being recognised in  
the income statement. The equity return  
from the military housing joint ventures  
of Balfour Beatty Investments US is 
contractually limited to a maximum level 
of return, beyond which Balfour Beatty 
Investments US does not share in any 
further return. 
Any excess of the fair value of the cost of 
acquisition over the Group’s share of the 
fair values of the identifiable net assets 
of the joint venture or associate entity at 
the date of acquisition is recognised as 
goodwill. Any deficiency of the fair value 
of the cost of acquisition below the 
Group’s share of the fair values of the 
identifiable net assets of the joint 
venture or associate at the date of 
acquisition (discount on acquisition) 
is credited to the income statement 
in the period of acquisition. 
Investments in joint ventures and 
associates are initially carried in the 
balance sheet at cost (including goodwill 
arising on acquisition) and adjusted by 
post-acquisition changes in the Group’s 
share of net assets of the joint venture  
or associate, less any impairment in the 
value of individual investments. Losses of 
joint ventures and associates in excess of 
the Group’s interest in those joint ventures 
and associates are only recognised to the 
extent that the Group is contractually 
liable for, or has a constructive obligation 
to meet, the obligations of the joint 
ventures and associates.
Unrealised gains and losses on 
transactions with joint ventures and 
associates are eliminated to the extent  
of the Group’s interest in the relevant  
joint venture or associate.
c) Jointly controlled operations
The Group’s share of the results,  
assets and liabilities of contracts carried 
out in conjunction with another party  
are included under each relevant  
heading in the income statement  
and balance sheet. 
2.4 Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are 
recorded at the rate of exchange at the 
date of the transaction. Monetary assets 
and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are translated at the rates  
of exchange at the reporting date. 
Significant exchange rates used in the 
preparation of these financial statements 
are shown in Note 3.
For the purpose of presenting 
consolidated financial statements, the 
results of foreign subsidiaries, associates 
and joint venture entities are translated at 
average rates of exchange for the year, 
unless the exchange rates fluctuate 
significantly during that period, in which 
case the exchange rates at the date 
of transactions are used. Assets and 
liabilities are translated at the rates of 
exchange prevailing at the reporting date. 
Goodwill and fair value adjustments 
arising on the acquisition of a foreign 
entity are treated as assets and liabilities 
of the foreign entity and translated at the 
rates of exchange at the reporting date. 
Currency translation differences arising 
are transferred to the Group’s foreign 
currency translation reserve and are 
recognised in the income statement 
on disposal of the underlying investment. 
In order to hedge its exposure to certain 
foreign exchange risks, the Group may 
enter into forward foreign exchange 
contracts. Refer to Note 2.26(c) for  
details of the Group’s accounting  
policies in respect of such derivative 
financial instruments. 
2.5 Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of 
the consideration received or receivable 
for goods and services provided, net of 
trade discounts, value added and similar 
sales based taxes, after eliminating 
revenue within the Group.
balfourbeatty.com/ar2013 Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2013
99 2 PRIn CIPAL ACCount In G Po LICIes 
Cont Inue D
2.5 Revenue recognition continued
Revenue is recognised as follows:
•	 revenue from construction and service 
activities represents the value of work 
carried out during the year, including 
amounts not invoiced
•	 revenue from manufacturing activities 
is recognised when title has passed
•	 interest income is accrued on a time 
basis using the effective interest 
method by reference to the principal 
outstanding and the effective interest 
rate, which is the rate that exactly 
discounts estimated future cash 
receipts through the expected life  
of the financial asset to that asset’s  
net carrying amount
•	 dividend income is recognised when 
the equity holder’s right to receive 
payment is established. 
2.6 Construction and service contracts
When the outcome of individual contracts 
can be estimated reliably, contract 
revenue and contract costs are recognised 
as revenue and expenses respectively 
by reference to the stage of completion 
at the reporting date. 
Costs are recognised as incurred and 
revenue is recognised on the basis of the 
proportion of total costs at the reporting 
date to the estimated total costs of  
the contract.
No margin is recognised until the outcome 
of the contract can be estimated with 
reasonable certainty. 
Provision is made for all known or 
expected losses on individual contracts 
once such losses are foreseen. 
Revenue in respect of variations to 
contracts and incentive payments is 
recognised when it is probable it will be 
agreed by the client. Revenue in respect 
of claims is recognised when negotiations 
have reached an advanced stage such  
that it is probable that the client will 
accept the claim and the probable  
amount can be measured reliably. 
Profit for the year includes the benefit  
of claims settled in the year on contracts 
completed in previous years.
2.7 segmental reporting
The Group considers its Board of Directors 
to be the chief operating decision maker 
and therefore the segmental disclosures 
provided in Note 5 are aligned with the 
monthly reports provided to the Board of 
Directors. The Group’s reporting segments 
are based on the types of services 
provided. Operating segments with similar 
economic characteristics have been 
aggregated into four reportable segments. 
A description of each reportable segment is 
provided in Note 5. Further information on 
the business activities of each reportable 
segment is set out on pages 28 to 35.
Working capital is the balance sheet 
measure reported to the chief operating 
decision maker. The profitability measure 
used to assess the performance of the 
Group is underlying profit from operations.
Segment results represent the contribution 
of the different segments after the 
allocation of attributable corporate 
overheads. Transactions between 
segments are conducted at arm’s length 
market prices. Segment assets and 
liabilities comprise those assets and 
liabilities directly attributable to the 
segments. Corporate assets and liabilities 
include cash balances, bank borrowings, 
tax balances and dividends payable.
Major clients are defined as clients 
contributing more than 10% of the 
Group’s external revenue.
2.8 Pre-contract bid costs and 
recoveries
Pre-contract costs are expensed as 
incurred until it is virtually certain that a 
contract will be awarded, from which time 
further pre-contract costs are recognised 
as an asset and charged as an expense 
over the period of the contract. Amounts 
recovered in respect of pre-contract costs 
that have been written off are deferred 
and amortised over the life of the contract.
For construction and services projects, 
the relevant contract is the construction 
or services contract respectively. With 
respect to PPP projects, there are 
potentially three contracts over which 
the recovered costs could be amortised, 
the concession contract itself, 
the construction contract or the services 
contract. An assessment is made as to 
which contractual element the pre-
contract costs relate to, in order to 
determine which is the relevant period  
for amortisation. The relevant contract  
is either the construction contract that 
ultimately gives rise to a financial or 
intangible asset; or the services contract 
where there is no initial construction.
2.9 Profit from operations
Profit from operations is stated after the 
Group’s share of the post-tax results of 
equity accounted joint venture entities and 
associates, but before investment income 
and finance costs.
2.10 Finance costs 
Finance costs of debt, including premiums 
payable on settlement and direct issue 
costs, are charged to the income 
statement on an accruals basis over the 
term of the instrument, using the effective 
interest method. 
2.11 n on-underlying items
Non-underlying items are items of 
financial performance which the Group 
believes should be separately identified on 
the face of the income statement to assist 
in understanding the underlying financial 
performance achieved by the Group. Such 
items will not affect the absolute amount 
of the results for the period and the trend 
of results. Underlying items are items 
before non-underlying items.
Non-underlying items include: 
•	 gains and losses on the disposal of 
businesses and investments, unless 
this is part of a programme of releasing 
value from the disposal of similar 
businesses or investments such  
as PPP concessions
•	 costs of restructuring and reorganisation 
of existing businesses
•	 costs of integrating newly acquired 
businesses
•	 acquisition and similar costs related  
to business combinations such as 
transaction costs
•	 impairment and amortisation charges 
on intangible assets arising on business 
combinations (amortisation of acquired 
intangible assets) 
•	 impairment of goodwill. 
These are examples, however, from time 
to time it may be appropriate to disclose 
further items as non-underlying items 
in order to highlight the underlying 
performance of the Group. Amortisation 
charges in respect of software are 
included in underlying items. 
2.12 t axation
The tax charge comprises current tax and 
deferred tax, calculated using tax rates 
that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the reporting date. Current tax 
and deferred tax are charged or credited to 
the income statement, except when they 
relate to items charged or credited directly 
to equity, in which case the relevant tax is 
also accounted for within equity. Current 
tax is based on the profit for the year.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using 
the liability method, on temporary 
differences arising between the tax bases 
of assets and liabilities and their carrying 
amounts in the financial statements. 
Deferred tax on such assets and liabilities 
is not recognised if the temporary 
difference arises from the initial 
recognition of goodwill or from the initial 
recognition (other than in a business 
combination) of other assets and liabilities 
in a transaction that affects neither the 
taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the 
extent that it is probable that future taxable 
profit will be available against which the 
temporary differences can be utilised. The 
carrying amount of deferred tax assets is 
reviewed at each reporting date.
balfourbeatty.com/ar2013 Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2013
100 2 PRIn CIPAL ACCount In G Po LICIes 
Cont Inue D 
2.12 t axation continued
Deferred tax is provided on temporary 
differences arising on investments in 
subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, 
except where the timing of the reversal 
of the temporary difference can be 
controlled by the Group and it is probable 
that the temporary difference will not 
reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are 
offset when they relate to income taxes 
levied by the same taxation authority and 
the Group intends to settle its current tax 
assets and liabilities on a net basis.
2.13 Intangible assets
a) Goodwill
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of 
subsidiaries and other businesses, joint 
ventures and associates and represents 
the excess of the fair value of 
consideration over the fair value of the 
identifiable assets and liabilities acquired. 
Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries 
and other businesses is included in 
non-current assets. Goodwill on 
acquisitions of joint ventures and 
associates is included in investments 
in joint ventures and associates. 
Goodwill is reviewed annually for 
impairment and is carried at cost less 
accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill 
is included when determining the profit 
or loss on subsequent disposal of the 
business to which it relates.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the 
date of transition to IFRS (1 January 2004) 
has been retained at the previous UK 
GAAP amounts subject to being tested 
for impairment. Goodwill written off or 
discount arising on acquisition credited  
to reserves under UK GAAP prior to  
1998 has not been reinstated and is not 
included in determining any subsequent 
profit or loss on disposal. 
b) Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets are stated at  
cost less accumulated amortisation  
and impairment losses. 
c) Research and development
Internally generated intangible assets 
developed by the Group are recognised 
only if all the following conditions are met:
•	 an asset is created that can be identified
•	 it is probable that the asset created will 
generate future economic benefits 
•	 the development cost of the asset can 
be measured reliably.
Other research expenditure is written off 
in the period in which it is incurred.
2.14 Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated 
at cost less accumulated depreciation 
and impairment losses. Cost includes 
expenditure associated with bringing the 
asset to its operating location and condition. 
2.15 Leasing
Leases which transfer substantially all 
of the risks and rewards of ownership 
to the lessee are classified as finance 
leases. All other leases are classified 
as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are 
recognised as assets of the Group at their 
fair value or, if lower, at the present value 
of the minimum lease payments, 
determined at the inception of the lease, 
and depreciation is provided accordingly. 
The liability to the lessor is included in the 
balance sheet as a finance lease obligation. 
Lease payments are apportioned between 
finance charges and reduction of the lease 
obligation so as to achieve a constant 
effective rate of interest on the remaining 
balance of the liability.
Rentals payable under operating leases 
are charged to income on a straight-line 
basis over the term of the relevant lease. 
Benefits received and receivable as an 
incentive to enter into an operating lease 
are also spread on a straight-line basis 
over the lease term.
2.16 Impairment of assets
Goodwill arising on acquisitions and other 
assets that have an indefinite useful life 
and are not subject to amortisation are 
reviewed at least annually for impairment. 
Other intangible assets and property, 
plant and equipment are reviewed for 
impairment whenever there is any 
indication that the carrying amount 
of the asset may not be recoverable. 
If the recoverable amount of an asset 
is less than its carrying amount, an 
impairment loss is recognised.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair 
value less costs to sell and value in use. 
Value in use is assessed by discounting 
the estimated future cash flows that the 
asset is expected to generate. For this 
purpose assets, including goodwill, are 
grouped into cash-generating units 
representing the level at which they are 
monitored by the Board of Directors for 
internal management purposes. Goodwill 
impairment losses are not reversed in 
subsequent periods. Reversals of other 
impairment losses are recognised in 
income when they arise.
2.17 Investments
Investments are recognised and 
derecognised on the trade date where a 
purchase or sale of an investment is under 
a contract whose terms require delivery 
of the investment within the timeframe 
established by the market concerned, and 
are initially measured at cost, including 
transaction costs.
Available-for-sale investments are 
measured at fair value. Gains and losses 
arising from changes in the fair value 
of available-for-sale investments are 
recognised in equity, until the investment is 
disposed or is determined to be impaired, 
at which time the cumulative gain or loss 
is included in the net profit or loss for the 
period. Held to maturity investments are 
measured at amortised cost.
2.18 Assets held for sale 
Non-current assets and groups of assets 
to be disposed of are classified as held 
for sale if their carrying amounts will 
be recovered through a sale transaction 
rather than through continuing use.  
Held for sale assets are measured at  
the lower of their carrying amount or  
fair value less costs to sell.
2.19 Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower  
of cost and net realisable value. 
Cost includes an appropriate proportion 
of manufacturing overheads incurred  
in bringing inventories to their present 
location and condition and is determined 
using the first-in first-out method. Net 
realisable value represents the estimated 
selling price less all estimated costs of 
completion and costs to be incurred in 
marketing, selling and distribution.
2.20 t rade receivables
Trade receivables are initially recorded at 
fair value and subsequently measured at 
amortised cost as reduced by allowances 
for estimated irrecoverable amounts. 
2.21 t rade payables
Trade payables are not interest bearing 
and are stated at cost. 
2.22 Provisions
Provisions for insurance liabilities  
retained in the Group’s captive insurance 
companies, legal claims, defects and 
warranties, environmental restoration, 
onerous leases, and other onerous 
commitments are recognised at the best 
estimate of the expenditure required to 
settle the Group’s liability. Provisions are 
recognised when: the Group has a present 
legal or constructive obligation as a result 
of a past event; it is probable that an 
outflow of resources will be required to 
settle the obligation; and the amount of 
the obligation can be estimated reliably. 
2.23 Borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts 
are recorded at the proceeds received,  
net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, 
including premiums payable on settlement 
or redemption and direct issue costs, are 
charged to income on an accruals basis 
using the effective interest method and 
are added to the carrying amount of  
the instrument.

2.24 Retirement benefit costs
The Group, through trustees, operates 
a number of defined benefit and defined 
contribution retirement and other long 
term employee benefit schemes, 
the majority of which are of the defined 
benefit type and are funded. Defined 
benefit contributions are determined  
in consultation with the trustees,  
after taking actuarial advice. 
For defined benefit retirement benefit 
schemes, the cost of providing benefits 
recognised in the income statement 
and the defined benefit obligations 
are determined at the reporting date 
by independent actuaries, using the 
projected unit credit method. The liability 
recognised in the balance sheet 
comprises the present value of the 
defined benefit pension obligation, 
determined by discounting the estimated 
future cash flows using the market yield 
on a high quality corporate bond, less the 
fair value of the scheme assets. Actuarial 
gains and losses are recognised in the 
period in which they occur in the 
statement of comprehensive income.
Contributions to defined contribution 
pension schemes are charged to the 
income statement as they fall due.
2.25 s hare-based payments
Employee services received in 
exchange for the grant of share options, 
performance share plan awards and 
deferred bonus plan awards are charged  
in the income statement on a straight-line 
basis over the vesting period, based on 
the fair values of the options or awards  
at the date of grant and the numbers 
expected to become exercisable. The 
credits in respect of the amounts charged 
are included within separate reserves in 
equity until such time as the options or 
awards are exercised, when the proceeds 
received in respect of share options are 
credited to share capital and share 
premium or the shares held by the 
employee trust are transferred to 
employees in respect of performance 
share plan awards and deferred bonus 
plan awards. 
2.26 Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities 
are recognised in the Group’s balance 
sheet when the Group becomes a  
party to the contractual provisions  
of the instrument.
a) Classification of financial liabilities 
and equity instruments
Financial liabilities and equity instruments 
are classified according to the substance 
of the contractual arrangements. An 
equity instrument is any contract that 
evidences a residual interest in the assets 
of the Group after deducting all of its 
liabilities. Equity instruments issued by 
the Company are recorded at the proceeds 
received, net of direct issue costs. 
b) Cumulative convertible redeemable 
preference shares and convertible 
bonds
The Company’s cumulative convertible 
redeemable preference shares and the 
Group’s convertible bonds are compound 
instruments, comprising a liability 
component and an equity component.  
The fair value of the liability components 
were estimated using the prevailing 
market interest rates at the dates of issue 
for similar non-convertible instruments. 
The difference between the proceeds  
of issue of the preference shares and 
convertible bonds and the fair value 
assigned to the respective liability 
components, representing the embedded 
option to convert the liability components 
into the Company’s ordinary shares, is 
included in equity. The interest expense 
on the liability components is calculated 
by applying applicable market interest 
rates for similar non-convertible debt 
prevailing at the dates of issue to the 
liability components of the instruments. 
The difference between this amount and 
the dividend/interest paid is added to the 
carrying amount of the liability component 
and is included in finance charges, together 
with the dividend/interest payable. 
c) Derivative financial instruments 
and hedge accounting
The Group uses derivative financial 
instruments to manage interest rate risk 
and to hedge exposures to fluctuations in 
foreign currencies and commodity prices 
in accordance with its risk management 
policy. The Group does not use derivative 
financial instruments for speculative 
purposes. A description of the Group’s 
objectives, policies and strategies with 
regard to derivatives and other financial 
instruments is set out in Note 39. 
Derivatives are initially recognised in the 
balance sheet at fair value on the date the 
derivative transaction is entered into and 
are subsequently remeasured at their 
fair values. 
Changes in the fair value of derivatives 
that are designated and qualify as fair 
value hedges are recognised in the 
income statement together with any 
changes in the fair value of the hedged 
item that are attributable to the 
hedged risk. 
Changes in the fair value of the effective 
portion of derivatives that are designated 
and qualify as cash flow hedges are 
recognised in other comprehensive 
income (OCI). Changes in the fair value  
of the ineffective portion of cash flow 
hedges are recognised in the income 
statement. Amounts originally recognised 
in OCI are transferred to the income 
statement when the underlying 
transaction occurs or, if the transaction 
results in a non-financial asset or liability, 
are included in the initial cost of that asset 
or liability.
Changes in the fair value of derivative 
financial instruments that do not qualify 
for hedge accounting are recognised in 
the income statement as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when 
the hedging instrument expires or is sold, 
terminated, or exercised, or no longer 
qualifies for hedge accounting. At that 
time, any cumulative gain or loss on the 
hedging instrument recognised in OCI  
is retained in equity until the hedged 
transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction 
is no longer expected to occur, the net 
cumulative gain or loss recognised in OCI 
is transferred to the income statement  
for the period.
Derivatives embedded in other financial 
instruments or other host contracts 
are treated as separate derivatives and 
recorded in the balance sheet at fair value 
when their risks and characteristics are 
not closely related to those of the host 
contract. Changes in the fair value of 
those embedded derivatives recognised  
in the balance sheet are recognised  
in the income statement as they arise.
d) PPP concession companies
Assets constructed by PPP concession 
companies are classified principally as 
available-for-sale financial assets.
In the construction phase, income is 
recognised by applying an attributable 
profit margin to the construction costs 
representing the fair value of construction 
services. In the operational phase, income 
is recognised by allocating a proportion 
of total cash received over the life of 
the project to service costs by means 
of a deemed constant rate of return on 
those costs. The residual element of 
projected cash is allocated to the financial 
asset using the effective interest rate 
method, giving rise to interest income. 
Due to the nature of the contractual 
arrangements the projected cash flows 
can be estimated with a high degree 
of certainty.
In the construction phase the fair value 
of the Group’s PPP financial assets is 
determined by applying an attributable 
profit margin on the construction costs 
representing the fair value of construction 
services performed. In the operational 
phase fair value is determined by 
discounting the future cash flows 
allocated to the financial asset using 
discount rates based on long-term gilt 
rates adjusted for the risk levels 
associated with the assets, with market 
related movements in fair value 
recognised in OCI and other movements 
recognised in the income statement. 
Amounts originally recognised in OCI  
are transferred to the income statement 
upon disposal of the asset.

2.27 j udgements and key sources 
of estimation uncertainty
The preparation of consolidated financial 
statements under IFRS requires 
management to make judgements, 
estimates and assumptions that affect 
amounts recognised for assets and 
liabilities at the reporting date and the 
amounts of revenue and expenses 
incurred during the reporting period. 
Actual outcomes may differ from these 
judgements, estimates and assumptions. 
The judgements, estimates and 
assumptions that have the most 
significant effect on the carrying value 
of assets and liabilities of the Group as at 
31 December 2013 are discussed below. 
a) Revenue and margin recognition
The Group’s revenue recognition and 
margin recognition policies, which are set 
out in Notes 2.5 and 2.6, are central to 
how the Group values the work it has 
carried out in each financial year. 
These policies require forecasts to be 
made of the outcomes of long term 
professional services, construction 
services and support services contracts, 
which require assessments and 
judgements to be made on recovery 
of pre-contract costs, changes in the 
scope of work, contract programmes, 
maintenance and defects liabilities and 
changes in costs. 
b) Taxation
The Group is subject to tax in a number  
of jurisdictions and judgement is required 
in determining the worldwide provision  
for income taxes. The Group provides  
for future liabilities in respect of  
uncertain tax positions where additional 
tax may become payable in future periods 
and such provisions are based on 
management’s assessment of exposures.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally 
provided for in full and deferred tax assets 
are recognised to the extent that it is 
judged probable that future taxable profit 
will arise against which the temporary 
differences will be utilised. 
c) Non-underlying items
Non-underlying items are items of 
financial performance which the Group 
believes should be separately identified on 
the face of the income statement to assist 
in understanding the underlying financial 
performance achieved by the Group. 
Determining whether an item is part of 
underlying items or non-underlying items 
requires judgment. A total non-underlying 
cost after tax of £157m was charged to 
the income statement for the year ended 
31 December 2013.
d) Impairment of goodwill
Determining whether goodwill is impaired 
requires an estimation of the value in use 
of the cash-generating units to which the 
goodwill has been allocated. The value in 
use calculation requires an estimate to be 
made of the timing and amount of future 
cash flows expected to arise from the 
cash-generating unit and the application 
of a suitable discount rate in order to 
calculate the present value. A nominal 
growth rate, based on real GDP growth 
plus CPI inflation, is used to calculate a 
terminal growth multiple in accordance 
with the Gordon Growth Model. The 
discount rates used are based on the 
Group’s weighted average cost of capital 
adjusted to reflect the specific economic 
environment of the relevant cash-
generating unit. The carrying value of 
goodwill at 31 December 2013 was 
£1,048m (2012: £1,160m).
e) Available-for-sale financial assets 
At 31 December 2013 £2,747m (2012: 
£3,183m) of assets constructed by the 
Group’s PPP subsidiary, joint venture and 
associate companies are classified as 
“available-for-sale financial assets”. In the 
operational phase the fair value of these 
financial assets is measured at each 
reporting date by discounting the future 
value of the cash flows allocated to the 
financial asset. A range of discount rates, 
is used from 5.5% to 8.5% (2012: 4.7%  
to 7.7%), which reflects the prevailing  
risk free interest rates and the different 
risk profiles of the various concessions.  
A £192m loss was taken to other 
comprehensive income in 2013 and a 
cumulative fair value gain of £405m had 
arisen on these financial assets as a result 
of movements in the fair value of these 
financial assets at 31 December 2013.
f) Recoverable value of recognised 
receivables
The Group has recognised trade 
receivables with a carrying value of 
£803m (2012: £824m). The recoverability 
of trade receivables is regularly reviewed 
in the light of the available economic 
information specific to each receivable 
and specific provisions are recognised for 
balances considered to be irrecoverable.
g) Provisions
Provisions are liabilities of uncertain 
timing or amount and therefore in making 
a reliable estimate of the quantum and 
timing of liabilities judgement is applied 
and re-evaluated at each reporting date. 
The Group recognised provisions at 
31 December 2013 of £193m 
(2012: £228m).
h) Retirement benefit obligations
Details of the Group’s defined benefit 
pension schemes are set out in Note 28, 
including tables showing the sensitivity 
of the Group pension scheme obligations 
and assets to different actuarial 
assumptions. At 31 December 2013, the 
retirement benefit liability recognised on 
the Group’s balance sheet was £434m 
(2012: £333m restated). The effects 
of changes in the actuarial assumptions 
underlying the benefit obligation, discount 
rates and the differences between 
expected and actual returns on 
the schemes’ assets are classified as 
actuarial gains and losses. During 2013 
the Group recognised net actuarial losses 
of £114m in equity (2012: £115m losses 
restated), including its share of the 
actuarial gains and losses arising in joint 
ventures and associates.
i) Held for sale and discontinued 
operations
When it is probable that businesses will 
be sold within one year and they are being 
actively marketed they meet the criteria to 
be classified as held for sale. Discontinued 
operations are businesses or a group of 
businesses which meet the criteria to be 
classified as held for sale, have been sold 
or abandoned and form a separate major 
line of business of the Group. Details of 
the Group’s discontinued operations are 
set out in Note 12.

Continuing operations
10.1.1 The amortisation of acquired intangible assets from continuing operations comprises: customer contracts £10m (2012: £16m); 
customer relationships £11m (2012: £14m); and brand names £9m (2012: £9m).
10.1.2.1 In response to the downturn in Australia, the Group incurred restructuring and reorganisation costs of £20m (2012: £2m) 
mainly relating to the mining sector. The 2013 restructuring costs comprise: redundancy costs £12m (2012: £2m); and onerous leases 
£8m (2012: £nil). 
10.1.2.2 The Group continued to implement its plan to restructure a number of its businesses in order to increase its focus on the 
needs of clients and upon growth sectors, further integrate its service offering to these clients, and realise operational efficiencies.  
In 2013 restructuring costs of £32m were incurred (2012: £62m) relating to: Construction Services UK £14m (2012: £34m), where six 
business units have been streamlined and restructured into one business with three business streams; Support Services UK £5m 
(2012: £5m); other UK entities £7m (2012: £10m); continuing Mainland European rail businesses £nil (2012: £7m) and other non-UK 
entities £6m (2012: £6m). 
The 2013 restructuring costs comprise: redundancy costs £16m (2012: £24m); external advisers £6m (2012: £8m); impairment of land 
and buildings £nil (2012: £5m); reversal of impairment of land and buildings £(3)m (2012: £nil); gain on sale of property £(3)m (2012: 
£nil); other property related costs £4m (2012: £11m); pension curtailment cost £1m (2012: £2m); and other restructuring costs £11m 
(2012: £12m). 
The Company incurred restructuring costs of £3m (2012: £2m) during the year.
10.1.2.3 On 31 August 2013 the majority of members of the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund ceased to accrue future defined benefits  
and became deferred members resulting in a curtailment charge of £51m with associated costs of £1m (2012: £nil) being incurred. 
10.1.2.4 In 2013, transitioning other operating companies to the UK shared service centre in Newcastle-upon-Tyne and increasing  
the scope led to incremental costs of £7m (2012: £4m) being incurred. 
10.1.2.5 In 2013, the implementation of the US shared service centre in Lancaster, Pennsylvania with the transfer of roles from  
New York led to incremental costs of £10m (2012: £2m) being incurred.
10.1.2.6 Post-acquisition integration and reorganisation costs of £4m (2012: £9m) have been incurred in 2013 of which £3m (2012: £nil) 
relates to Howard S. Wright post-acquisition reorganisation costs and £1m (2012: £1m) relates to Parsons Brinckerhoff post-acquisition 
reorganisation costs. In 2012, a liability of £8m was settled in respect of a geotechnical survey carried out by a company acquired by 
Parsons Brinckerhoff prior to its own acquisition by Balfour Beatty in 2009. 
10.1.2.7 During 2012 an impairment charge of £12m arose on the Group’s 60% interest in Regional & City Airports (Exeter) Holdings 
Ltd from writing the carrying value of the Group’s joint venture investment down to £nil, as a result of the continued effect of adverse 
economic conditions upon traffic at regional airports, which was exacerbated by an increase in Air Passenger Duty effective from  
April 2012. Exeter was subsequently sold in 2013 (Note 32.3.5). 
10.1.3 The non-underlying items charged against Group operating profit from continuing operations gave rise to a tax credit of £35m 
comprising: £9m on amortisation of acquired intangible assets and £26m on other non-underlying items (2012: £35m comprising: 
£13m on amortisation of acquired intangible assets and £22m on other non-underlying items).
The non-underlying items charged against Company operating profit gave rise to £3m tax (2012: £1m).
Discontinued operations
10.2.1 The amortisation of acquired intangible assets from discontinued operations comprises: customer contracts £1m (2012: £1m); 
customer relationships £1m (2012: £4m); and brand names £nil (2012: £1m).
10.2.2.1 During 2012, following a strategic review in the light of low activity levels and the commoditisation of work, the Group decided 
to divest all of its Mainland European rail businesses over time. At 28 June 2013 Rail Germany, Rail Scandinavia and Rail Spain were 
classified as discontinued operations with a £38m goodwill impairment arising in respect of Rail Germany. During 2012, £95m of 
goodwill in the Mainland European rail businesses was impaired. Refer to Note 12.
10.2.2.2 Restructuring costs of £6m (2012: £2m) were incurred in respect of Mainland European rail businesses classified as 
discontinued operations of which £4m (2012: £1m) related to redundancy costs.
10.2.2.3 On 31 August 2013 the majority of members of the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund ceased to accrue future defined benefits and 
became deferred members resulting in a curtailment charge of £2m being incurred in relation to Balfour Beatty WorkPlace employees.
10.2.2.4 During 2013, Rail Germany incurred a £2m fine imposed by the German competition authority in respect of allegations of 
historic anti-competitive behaviour occurring in Schreck-Mieves GmbH, a company acquired by Balfour Beatty in 2008.
10.2.2.5 On 1 March 2013 the Group disposed of Rail Spain for a net loss of £4m. Refer to Note 32.3.1.
10.2.2.6 On 1 August 2013, as the initial step in disposing of Rail Germany, the Group disposed of the Stassfurt Signalling Workshop  
to its local management for €1 resulting in a net loss of £1m. Refer to Note 32.3.6.
10.2.2.7 On 13 December 2013 the Group disposed of the UK facilities management business, Balfour Beatty WorkPlace for net cash 
proceeds of £155 million resulting in a net gain of £16m. Transaction costs of £2m were incurred in 2012 relating to the disposal of 
Balfour Beatty WorkPlace. Refer to Note 32.3.10.
10.2.3 The non-underlying items charged against Group operating profit from discontinued operations gave rise to a tax credit of £2m 
comprising: £nil on amortisation of acquired intangible assets and £2m on other non-underlying items (2012: £4m comprising: £1m on 
amortisation of acquired intangible assets and £3m on other non-underlying items).

Rail disposal group
Following a strategic review in light of low activity levels and the commoditisation of work, the Group decided to divest all of its 
Mainland European rail businesses over time. The Group has been actively marketing its Mainland European rail businesses and 
accordingly, when it is probable that these businesses will be sold within a year and meet the criteria to be classified as an asset  
held for sale, or are sold or abandoned, they will form part of the Rail disposal group and be disclosed as discontinued operations.
To be classified as a discontinued operation, the businesses must represent a separate major line of business. Other than the  
Mainland European rail businesses there are no significant Group operations in Mainland Europe and therefore by exiting these 
businesses, the Group is exiting from a separate major geographical operation and meets the criteria to classify these businesses  
as discontinued operations.
On 1 March 2013 the Group disposed of its interest in Rail Iberica SA (Rail Spain) to its local management for a cash consideration  
of €1 resulting in a net £4m loss on disposal. Refer to Note 32.3.1.
On 28 June 2013 it was probable that Rail Germany and Rail Scandinavia would be disposed within a year and therefore met the criteria 
to be classified as an asset held for sale, with a £38m goodwill impairment. Together with Rail Spain they constitute the Rail disposal 
group within discontinued operations. 
On 1 August 2013, as the initial step in disposing of Rail Germany, the Group disposed of the Stassfurt Signalling Workshop to its  
local management for €1 resulting in a net loss of £1m and closed its Switches and Crossings manufacturing facility during the year. 
Refer to Note 32.3.6.
On 10 December 2013, the Group announced that it had reached agreement to sell Rail Scandinavia to Strukton Rail BV resulting  
in a small gain. This disposal is effective from 8 January 2014. Refer to Note 37.
The Rail disposal group was part of the Construction Services segment.
u K facilities management disposal group
Balfour Beatty WorkPlace (BBW) is the Group’s only significant buildings facilities management business in the UK and represents  
a separate major line of business.
On 28 June 2013, it was probable that BBW would be disposed of within a year and therefore BBW met the criteria to be classified  
as an asset held for sale and consequently as a discontinued operation.
On 13 December 2013 the Group disposed of BBW to GDF Suez Energy Services for net cash consideration of £155m. This resulted  
in an estimated net non-underlying gain of £16m. Refer to Note 32.3.11. 
BBW was part of the Support Services segment.

The recoverable amount of goodwill is based on value in use. Cash flow forecasts are based on the expected workload of each 
cash-generating unit (CGU) giving consideration to the current level of confirmed and anticipated orders. Cash flow forecasts for the 
next three years are based on the Group’s 2014 budget and strategic roadmap. The other key inputs in assessing each CGU are its 
revenue growth rate and discount rate. The revenue growth rates have been applied to cash flows after three years into perpetuity and 
have been derived from estimated GDP growth rates based on published data for the economic environment of each CGU less 1.0%  
to reflect current economic uncertainties and their consequent estimated effect on public sector spending on infrastructure. The cash 
flows assume a residual value based on a multiple of earnings before interest and tax.

s ensitivities
The Group’s impairment review is sensitive to changes in the key assumptions used. The major assumptions that result in significant 
sensitivities are the discount rate and the long-term revenue growth rate. 
Except as noted below, a reasonable possible change in a single assumption will not give rise to impairment in any of the Group’s CGUs. 
Using a pre-tax discount rate of 12.1% and revenue growth rate of 2.6% the recoverable amount of the remaining goodwill in the 
continuing Mainland Europe rail business is £25m based on value in use, with consequent headroom of £6m. A 1.0% increase in the 
discount rate and a 1.0% reduction in the growth rate would lead to a further impairment of £1m.
The recoverable amount of the Blackpool International Airport goodwill is £4m with headroom of £nil, based on the value in use of 
the trading business and the fair value of the land. Any decrease in the fair value of the land will lead to a commensurate impairment 
of the goodwill.

The Group reached financial close on a student accommodation project in which the Group has demand risk and therefore,  
under IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements, recognises an intangible asset as “Infrastructure Investments intangible”.
Software and other primarily includes software of the UK shared service centre and operating companies with a cost of £59m 
(2012: £45m) and accumulated amortisation of £3m (2012: £1m). Of the total software, £58m (2012: £49m) is internally generated 
software with a cost of £62m (2012: £50m) and accumulated amortisation of £4m (2012: £1m).
Intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives, which are one to four years for customer 
contracts, three to 10 years for customer relationships, three to seven years for software, and up to five years for brand names, 
except for customer contracts and relationships relating to Parsons Brinckerhoff, Barnhart and Balfour Beatty Investments US which 
are amortised on a basis matching the returns earned over the life of the underlying contracts and relationships. These contracts have  
a duration of up to eight years for customer contracts and relationships relating to Parsons Brinckerhoff and Barnhart and up to 50 years  
for customer contracts relating to Balfour Beatty Investments US. 
The Infrastructure Investments intangible is amortised on a straight-line basis over the life of the project which is 50 years. 
The software for the UK shared service centre and operating companies is amortised on a basis matching its usage profile over its 
seven-year life. The Group’s knowledge sharing and collaboration software is amortised on a basis matching its usage profile over its 
five-year life. Other intangible assets are amortised up to 10 years.

 Re-presented to classify certain Mainland European rail businesses and the UK facilities management business as discontinued operations (Notes 12 and 38).
The principal joint ventures and associates are shown in Note 41. The original cost of the Group’s investments in joint ventures and 
associates was £137m (2012: £199m). 
The Group’s share of borrowings of joint ventures and associates is shown in Note 18.2. The amount which was supported by the 
Group and the Company was £nil (2012: £nil), relating to the Group’s share of guaranteed borrowings. The borrowings of the PPP joint 
venture and associate entities are repayable over periods extending up to 2048. The non-recourse borrowings arise under facilities 
taken out by project specific joint venture and associate concession companies. The borrowings of each concession company are 
secured by a combination of fixed and floating charges over that concession company’s interests in its project’s assets and revenues 
and the shares in the concession company held by its immediate parent company. A significant part of these loans has been swapped 
into fixed rate debt by the use of interest rate swaps. 
As disclosed in Note 34, the Group has committed to provide its share of further equity funding of joint ventures and associates in 
Infrastructure Investments’ projects and military housing concessions. Further, in respect of a number of these investments the Group 
has committed not to dispose of its equity interest until construction is complete. As is customary in such projects, banking covenants 
restrict the payment of dividends and other distributions. 
Provisions utilised of £87m (2012: £4m) relate to the investments in Metronet BCV Ltd and Metronet SSL Ltd. On 18 July 2007 a PPP 
Administrator was appointed to the principal trading subsidiaries (Infracos) of these companies. On 27 May 2008 the business and  
the majority of assets and liabilities of the Infracos was transferred to new companies owned by TfL and on 11 December 2009 the 
Infracos entered into compulsory liquidation.

The Group’s investment in military housing joint ventures’ and associates’ projects is recognised at the initial equity investment plus 
the value of the Group’s accrued preferred return from the underlying projects. The military housing joint ventures and associates have 
total non-recourse net borrowings of £1,858m (2012: £1,787m). Note 41(f) details the Group’s military housing projects.
The Group has elected to recognise its investment in Balfour Beatty Infrastructure Partners LP (Infrastructure Fund) at fair value with 
movements in fair value being recognised through the income statement. The Infrastructure Fund holds multiple assets which are 
valued by third parties. 
Capital expenditure authorised and contracted which has not been provided for in the financial statements of the joint ventures and 
associates amounted to £2m (2012: £2m). 
As a result of the net fair value revaluations of PPP financial assets and cash flow hedges on three Infrastructure Investments 
concessions, where the borrowings are non-recourse to the Group, the Group has not recognised cumulative fair value revaluation 
charges to other comprehensive income of £24m (2012: £15m).

Based on prior experience, an assessment of the current economic environment and a review of the financial circumstances of individual 
clients, the Directors believe no further credit risk provision is required in respect of trade receivables.
The Directors consider that the carrying values of current trade and other receivables approximate their fair values. The fair value of 
non-current trade and other receivables amounts to £108m (2012: £98m) and has been determined by discounting future cash flows 
using yield curves and exchange rates prevailing at the reporting date.

Contract provisions include construction insurance liabilities, principally in the Group’s captive insurance companies, and defect and 
warranty provisions on contracts, primarily construction contracts, that have reached practical completion. 
Employee provisions are principally liabilities relating to employers’ liability insurance retained in the Group’s captive insurance 
companies and provisions for employee termination liabilities arising from the Group’s restructuring programmes.
Other provisions principally comprise: motor and other insurance liabilities in the Group’s captive insurance companies; legal claims  
and costs, where provision is made for the Directors’ best estimate of known legal claims, investigations and legal actions in progress; 
property-related provisions, mainly onerous lease commitments, some of which arise from the Group’s restructuring programmes;  
and environmental provisions.
The Group takes actuarial advice when establishing the level of provisions in the Group’s captive insurance companies and certain 
other categories of provision.
Insurance-related provisions within these categories were £86m (2012: £95m) as follows: Contract provisions £52m (2012: £49m); 
Employee provisions £28m (2012: £35m); and Other, mainly motor provisions £6m (2012: £11m).
Restructuring provisions within these categories were £12m (2012: £26m) as follows: Contract provisions £nil (2012: £nil); Employee 
provisions £7m (2012: £14m); and Other, mainly property-related, provisions £5m (2012: £12m). The restructuring provisions reduced 
substantially in the period as staff left the businesses and the property portfolio was streamlined by the surrender or other disposal  
of leases.

The PPP project finance sterling loans arise under non-recourse facilities taken out by project specific subsidiary concession 
companies. The loans of each concession company are secured by a combination of fixed and floating charges over that concession 
company’s interests in its project’s assets and revenues and the shares in the concession company held by its immediate parent 
company. A significant part of these loans has been swapped into fixed rate debt by the use of interest rate swaps.
Included in cash and cash equivalents is restricted cash of: £17m (2012: £15m) held by the Group’s captive insurance company, 
Delphian Insurance Company Ltd, which is subject to Isle of Man insurance solvency regulations; £2m (2012: £nil) currently not readily 
remittable from Argentina; £1m (2012: £nil) held within construction project bank accounts; and £65m (2012: £25m) relating to the 
maintenance and other reserve accounts in the Infrastructure Investments subsidiaries.
Cash, deposits and term deposits include the Group’s share of amounts held by jointly controlled operations of £144m (2012: £232m).
The Group discloses its borrowings under committed facilities as current liabilities due to requirements in IAS 1. However the 
borrowings are drawn down under committed facilities expiring in more than one year and the Group believes they will be rolled 
forward within the terms of the facilities.

26.2 us private placement
In March 2013 the Group raised US$350m (£231m) of borrowings through a US private placement of a series of notes with an average 
coupon of 4.94% per annum and an average maturity of 9.3 years. At 31 December 2013, as a result of movements in exchange 
differences, the balance outstanding was £212m.

26.3 Convertible bonds
On 3 December 2013 the Group issued convertible bonds of £100,000 each maturing on 3 December 2018 at a total issue price of 
£252.7m and incurred transaction costs of £6.3m resulting in net proceeds of £246.4m. The bonds have a coupon of 1.875% per 
annum payable semi-annually in arrears and the initial conversion price has been set at £3.6692 per share. 
From 14 January 2014 until 14 days prior to final maturity one bond is convertible at the option of the holder into one preference  
share in Balfour Beatty Finance No 2 Ltd which is immediately transferred to the Company in exchange for the issue of ordinary shares 
in the Company. 
The bonds are a compound instrument, comprising an equity and a liability component. The fair value of the liability component at  
the date of issue, included under non-current liabilities, was £220m estimated using the prevailing market interest rate of 4.29% for  
a similar non-convertible instrument. The difference between the net proceeds of issue of the convertible bonds after the transaction 
costs and the fair value assigned to the liability component, representing the value of the equity conversion component, is included  
in equity holders’ funds. Refer to Note 29.3.
The Group has the option to redeem the bonds from December 2015 under certain circumstances.

At the reporting date the Group had unrecognised tax losses from operations that arose over a number of years of approximately 
£452m (2012: £280m) which are available for offset against future profits. £15m (2012: £22m) will expire between five and 20 years 
after the year in which they arose, using losses incurred in earlier years before those incurred in later years, with the first expiry in 
2015. The remaining losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
At the reporting date the undistributed reserves for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised were £901m (2012: £905m) 
in respect of subsidiaries and £101m (2012: £128m) in respect of joint ventures and associates. No liability has been recognised in 
respect of these differences because either no temporary difference arises or the timing of any distribution is under the Group’s control 
and no distribution which gives rise to taxation is contemplated.

28.1 Group
The Group, through trustees, operates a number of defined contribution and defined benefit pension schemes. 
Defined contribution schemes are those where the Group’s obligation is limited to the amount that it contributes to the scheme and 
the scheme members bear the investment and actuarial risks. 
Defined benefit schemes are schemes other than defined contribution schemes where the Group’s obligation is to provide specified 
benefits on retirement. 
IAS 19 Employee Benefits (Revised) (IAS 19 Revised) prescribes the accounting for defined benefit schemes in the Group’s financial 
statements. Obligations are calculated using the projected unit credit method and discounted to a net present value using the market 
yield on a high quality corporate bond. The pension expense relating to current service cost is charged to contracts or overheads based 
on the function of scheme members and is included in cost of sales and net operating expenses. The net finance cost arising from  
the expected interest income on plan assets and interest cost on scheme obligations is included in finance costs. Actuarial gains and 
losses are reported in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. The IAS 19 Revised accounting valuation is set out in Note 28.2.
A different calculation is used for the formal triennial funding valuations undertaken by the scheme trustees to determine the future 
company contribution level necessary so that over time the scheme assets will meet the scheme obligations. The principal difference 
between the two methods is that under the funding basis the obligations are discounted using a rate of return reflecting the 
composition of the assets in the scheme, rather than the rate of return on a high quality corporate bond as required by IAS 19 Revised 
for the financial statements. Details of the latest formal triennial funding valuations are set out in Note 28.3. 
The assets of the schemes do not include any direct holdings of the Group’s financial instruments, nor any property occupied by, 
or other assets, of the Group.
Principal schemes 
The Group’s principal schemes are the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund (BBPF), which includes defined contribution and defined benefit 
sections, and the Balfour Beatty Shared Cost Section of the Railways Pension Scheme (Railways Pension Scheme). The defined 
benefit sections of both schemes are funded and closed to new members with the exception of employees where employment has 
transferred to the Group under certain agreed arrangements. Pension benefits are based on employees’ pensionable service and their 
pensionable salary. 
The schemes operate under trust law and are managed and administered by Trustees on behalf of the members in accordance with 
the terms of the Trust deed and rules and relevant legislation. Defined benefit contributions are determined in consultation with the 
Trustees, after taking actuarial advice. The Trustees are responsible for establishing the investment strategy and ensuring that there  
are sufficient assets to meet the cost of current and future benefits. 
These schemes expose the Group to investment and actuarial risks where additional contributions may be required if assets are not 
sufficient to pay future pension benefits: 
 − Investment risk: Equity returns are a key determinant of investment return but the investment portfolio is also subject to a range  
of other risks typical of the investments held, for example, credit risk on corporate bond holdings. 
 − Actuarial risk: The ultimate cost of providing pension benefits is affected by inflation rates and members’ life expectancy. The net 
present value of the obligations is affected by the market yield on a high quality corporate bond used to discount the obligations.
Changes in the principal actuarial assumptions based on market data, such as inflation and the discount rate, and experience,  
such as life expectancy, expose the Group to fluctuations in the net IAS 19 Revised liability and the net finance cost. 
BBPF
The investment strategy of the BBPF is to hold assets of appropriate liquidity and marketability to generate income and capital growth. 
The BBPF invests partly in a diversified range of assets including equities and hedge funds in anticipation that, over the longer term, 
they will grow in value faster than the obligations. The equities are in the form of pooled funds and are a combination of UK, other 
developed market and emerging market equities. The remaining BBPF assets are principally fixed and index-linked bonds and swaps  
in order to match the duration and inflation exposure of the obligations and enhance the resilience of the funding level of the scheme. 
The performance of the assets is measured against market indices.
Following the previous formal triennial funding valuation of the BBPF carried out as at 31 March 2010, the Group agreed to make ongoing 
deficit payments to the BBPF of £48m per annum from April 2010, increasing each year by CPI (capped at 5%) plus 50% of any increase 
in the Company’s dividend in excess of capped CPI. Following the merger of the Parsons Brinckerhoff Scheme with the BBPF the Group 
agreed to make additional deficit payments of £11m per annum, with the first payment made in October 2012. During 2012 the Group 
also agreed to make additional conditional deficit contributions of £1m per month, payable quarterly in arrears, if the BBPF funding levels 
in any given month were below certain funding targets set out in the BBPF journey plan, with the first payment made in January 2013.
A formal triennial funding valuation of the BBPF was carried out as at 31 March 2013. As a result the Group agreed with effect from 
April 2013 to make revised ongoing deficit payments of £50m per annum, increasing to: £55m per annum from April 2016; £60m per 
annum from April 2017; and £65m per annum from April 2018 to May 2020, increasing each year by CPI (minimum 0% and capped at 
5%) plus 200% of any increase in the Company’s dividend in excess of capped CPI. If the Company makes any one-off return of value 
to shareholders such as a special dividend, share buy-back, capital payment or similar before the next actuarial valuation is agreed, 
there will be an additional increase in the deficit payment for the following year only, calculated as the regular deficit payment for that 
year multiplied by 75%, multiplied by the value of the one-off return of value, divided by the total of the regular dividends for the year  
in which the one-off return was made. The Group has the ability to use surplus funds in the defined benefit section of the BBPF to pay 
its contributions towards future service benefits in the defined benefit and defined contribution sections of the scheme. 
In 2012 a pension increase exchange (PIE) offer to certain current pensioners, widows and widowers of the BBPF, to forego their 
entitlement to future non-statutory inflation increases in return for a higher pension than their current entitlement, resulted in a £2m 
reduction to the pension liability and a consequential net past service cost credit of £2m. balfourbeatty.com/ar2013 Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2013

28.1 Group continued 
BBPF continued 
On 31 August 2013 the majority of members of the BBPF ceased to accrue future defined benefits and became deferred members 
resulting in a curtailment charge of £53m, recognised as a non-underlying item, of which £2m related to discontinued operations. 
During 2013 various group restructurings resulted in an additional £1m curtailment charge. 
Railways Pension Scheme
The economic interest of the Group in the Railways Pension Scheme is approximately 60% of the scheme’s assets and liabilities based 
on the relevant provisions of the trust deed and rules and trustee guidelines regarding future surplus apportionments and deficit financing. 
The Railways Pension Scheme invests in a range of pooled investment funds intended to generate a combination of capital growth  
and income and as determined by the Trustee, taking account of the characteristics of the obligations and the Trustee’s attitude to risk. 
The majority of the Railways Pension Scheme’s assets that are intended to generate additional returns, over the rate at which the 
obligations are expected to grow, are invested in a single pooled “growth” fund. This fund is invested in a wide range of asset  
classes and the fund manager RPMI has the discretion to vary the asset allocation to reflect its views on the relative attractiveness of 
different asset classes at any time. The remaining assets in the Railways Pension Scheme are principally fixed and index-linked bonds.
Following the formal triennial funding valuation carried out as at 31 December 2010, the Group agreed to make ongoing fixed deficit 
contributions of £1.3m per annum plus an additional 1% of the active members’ payroll costs. 
Parsons Brinckerhoff Scheme
During the year ended 31 December 2012, Parsons Brinckerhoff Ltd operated a defined benefit scheme (Parsons Brinckerhoff 
Scheme) which had been closed to new members since 31 July 2003. On 30 June 2012 the Parsons Brinckerhoff Scheme merged 
with the BBPF and the Group agreed to make additional deficit payments of £11m per annum to the BBPF, with the first payment made 
in October 2012. On 28 June 2012 the Parsons Brinckerhoff Scheme released its legal charge over a Group leasehold property with  
a book value of £4m at 31 December 2011 in return for a one-off deficit contribution of £2.5m. The deficit contributions have been 
superseded by the deficit contributions agreed in the March 2013 BBPF formal triennial funding valuation. 
Other schemes
Other schemes comprise unfunded post-retirement benefit obligations in Europe and North America, the majority of which are closed 
to new entrants, and deferred compensation schemes in the US, where an element of employees’ compensation is deferred and 
invested in available-for-sale assets (as disclosed in Note 19.1) in a trust, the assets of which are for the ultimate benefit of the 
employees but are available to the Group’s creditors in the event of insolvency.

In the year ended 31 December 2012, the Group reassessed the difference between the RPI and CPI measures of price inflation from 
0.90% to 0.70%. The reduction was applied following consideration of proposals made by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) to 
change the method to calculate RPI and independent advice received from the Group’s actuaries. This change in assumptions gave rise 
to a £25m actuarial increase in liabilities which was recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.  balfourbeatty.com/ar2013 Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2013

28.2 IAs 19 accounting valuations continued 
Principal actuarial assumptions for the IAS 19 accounting valuations of the Group’s principal schemes continued
In January 2013 the market RPI expectation increased by 0.30% following an announcement by the ONS that there would be no 
material change in the calculation of RPI. As a result of this announcement and following independent advice received from the Group’s 
actuaries, the Group reassessed the difference between RPI and CPI measures of price inflation from 0.7% to 1.0% in 2013 reducing 
the pension liability by £38m which was recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. 
In December 2013, following independent advice from the Group’s actuaries based on further announcements by the ONS, the Group 
reassessed the difference between RPI and CPI measures of price inflation from 1.0% in January 2013 to 1.2% reducing the pension 
liability by a further £36m which was recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. 
The BBPF actuary undertakes regular mortality investigations based on the experience exhibited by pensioners of the BBPF and due  
to the size of the membership of the BBPF (49,455 members at 31 December 2013) is able to make comparisons of this experience 
with the mortality rates set out in the various published mortality tables. The actuary is also able to monitor changes in the exhibited 
mortality over time. This research is taken into account in the Group’s mortality assumptions across its various defined benefit schemes. 
The mortality assumptions as at 31 December 2013 have been updated to reflect the experience of Balfour Beatty pensioners for the 
period 1 April 2003 to 31 March 2013. The mortality tables adopted for the 2013 and 2012 IAS 19 valuations are the SAPS tables with  
a multiplier of 101% for male and for female members (2012: 90% for male and 103% for female members) and 110% for female 
widows and dependants (2012: 103%); all with an improvement rate in line with the CMI core projection model to 2013 (2012: flat 
1.6% pa to 2013), plus future improvements from 2013 in line with the CMI core projection model applicable to each member‘s year  
of birth with a long term rate of 1.25% pa for male and 1.00% pa for female members.

In December 2012 allowance was made for approximately three future years of life expectancy for former members of the Parsons 
Brinckerhoff Scheme. The 2013 investigation revealed that the life expectancy for these members is similar to other members of the 
BBPF, therefore mortality assumptions have been aligned in 2013. 
The BBPF defined contribution employer contributions paid and charged to the income statement have been separately identified in 
the table below and the defined contribution section assets and liabilities amounting to £259m (2012: £200m) have been excluded 
from the tables on pages 132 to 134. Defined contribution charges for other schemes include contributions to multi-employer  
pension schemes.

Sensitivity of the Group’s retirement benefit obligations at 31 December 2013 to different actuarial assumptions 
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on reasonably possible changes in assumptions occurring at the end of  
the reporting period. In each case the relevant change in assumption occurs in isolation from potential changes in other assumptions.  
In practice more than one variable is likely to change at the same time. The sensitivities have been calculated using the projected  
unit credit method.

Until 1 February 2013, certain employees of the Company were members of the BBPF. Retirement benefit assets, liabilities, income 
and expenditure relating to this fund were allocated on an appropriate basis to Group companies participating in the scheme based  
on pensionable payroll for the year. On 1 February 2013 the employees of the Company and the net pension deficit allocated to the 
Company were transferred to Balfour Beatty Group Employment Ltd, which has been established as the employing entity for the 
Balfour Beatty Group’s UK businesses.  balfourbeatty.com/ar2013 Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2013

29.2 Cumulative convertible redeemable preference shares of 1p each
Issued
Million £m
At 31 December 2012 and 2013 112 –
All issued preference shares are fully paid. During the current and prior year no preference shares were repurchased for cancellation 
by the Company.
Holders of preference shares are entitled to a preferential dividend equivalent to a gross payment of 10.75p per preference share per 
annum, payable half-yearly. A preference dividend of 5.375p gross (4.8375p net) per cumulative convertible redeemable preference 
share of 1p was paid on 1 July 2013 in respect of the six months ended 30 June 2013. A preference dividend of 5.375p gross  
(4.8375p net) per cumulative convertible redeemable preference share was paid on 1 January 2014 in respect of the six months  
ended 31 December 2013. 
On 1 July 2020 any preference shares still outstanding are redeemable at £1 each, together with any arrears or accruals of dividend, 
unless the holder exercises any option granted by the Company to extend the redemption date. The maximum redemption value of 
all of the issued and outstanding preference shares, excluding any arrears or accruals of dividend, was £112m at 31 December 2013 
(2012: £112m).
At the option of the holder, preference shares are convertible on the first day of the next calendar month following receipt of 
the conversion notice into new Balfour Beatty plc ordinary shares effectively on the basis of 24.69136 ordinary shares for every 
100 preference shares, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. The Company is entitled to convert all outstanding preference 
shares into ordinary shares if there are fewer than 44,281,239 preference shares in issue or if the average of the closing mid-market 
price for a Balfour Beatty plc ordinary share during a 30-day period exceeds 810p, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances.
The preference shares carry no voting rights at a general meeting of the Company, except where the dividend is six months or more 
in arrears, or where the business of the meeting includes a resolution which directly affects the rights and privileges attached to the 
preference shares or a resolution for the winding up of the Company. On winding up the Company, holders are entitled to receive the 
sum of £1 per preference share, together with any arrears or accruals of dividend, in priority to any payment on any other class of shares.
The preference shares are a compound instrument, comprising an equity and a liability component. The fair value of the liability 
component at the date of issue, included under non-current liabilities, was estimated using the prevailing market interest rate of 13.5% 
for a similar non-convertible instrument. The difference between the proceeds of issue of the preference shares and the fair value 
assigned to the liability component, representing the value of the equity conversion component, is included in equity holders’ equity, 
net of deferred tax. balfourbeatty.com/ar2013 Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2013

The fair value of the liability component of the preference shares at 31 December 2013 amounted to £113m (2012: £120m). The fair 
value is determined by using the market price of the preference shares at the reporting date.
Interest expense on the preference shares is calculated using the effective interest method.
29.3 Convertible bonds
On 3 December the Group issued convertible bonds for net proceeds of £246m. The convertible bond is a compound instrument 
comprising equity and liability components. The fair value of the liability component was estimated as £220m using the prevailing 
market rate at the date of issue for a similar non-convertible instrument. The difference between the net proceeds and the fair value  
of the liability represents the embedded option to convert the liability into the Company’s ordinary shares being the equity component 
of £26m. Refer to Note 26.

The retained profits of Balfour Beatty plc are wholly distributable. By special resolution on 13 May 2004, confirmed by the court on 
16 June 2004, the share premium account was reduced by £181m and the £4m capital redemption reserve was cancelled, effective 
on 25 June 2004, and a special reserve of £185m was created. This reserve becomes distributable to the extent of future increases 
in share capital and share premium account, of which £1m occurred in 2013 (2012: £2m). balfourbeatty.com/ar2013 Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2013

30.3 The retained profits in the Group and the retained profit of the Company are stated net of investments in Balfour Beatty plc 
ordinary shares acquired by the Group’s employee discretionary trust, the Balfour Beatty Employee Share Ownership Trust, to satisfy 
awards under the Balfour Beatty Performance Share Plan and the Balfour Beatty Deferred Bonus Plan. In 2013, 0.7m (2012: 1.0m) 
shares were purchased at a cost of £1.6m (2012: £3.0m). The market value of the 3.3m (2012: 3.7m) shares held by the Trust at 
31 December 2013 was £9.3m (2012: £10.1m). The carrying value of these shares is £10.0m (2012: £11.8m). Following confirmation 
of the performance criteria at the end of the performance period in the case of the Performance Share Plan, and at the end of the 
vesting period in the case of the Deferred Bonus Plan, the appropriate number of shares will be unconditionally transferred to 
participants. In 2013, no shares were transferred to participants in relation to the April 2010 awards under the Performance Share Plan 
(2012: no shares for the April 2009 award under the Performance Share Plan), and 1.1m shares were transferred to participants in 
relation to awards under the Deferred Bonus Plan (2012: 1.0m). The trustees have waived the rights to dividends on shares held by the 
Trust. Other reserves in the Group and the Company include £5.1m relating to unvested Performance Share Plan awards (2012: £4.7m), 
£1.1m relating to unvested share options (2012: £2.9m), and £3.3m relating to unvested Deferred Bonus Plan awards (2012: £3.4m).

32.1 Current and prior year acquisitions
32.1.1 There were no material acquisitions during the year ended 31 December 2013. 
32.1.2 Deferred consideration paid during 2013 in respect of acquisitions completed in earlier years was £11m, £8m relating to the 
acquisition of Subsurface Group Inc (Subsurface) and £3m on other acquisitions. 
32.1.3 In addition to the amounts shown above, £2m and £1m held in escrow at 31 December 2012 relating to the acquisitions 
of Power Efficiency and Office Projects respectively were paid during 2013. 
32.1.4 The fair values of the acquired assets and liabilities disclosed as provisional at 31 December 2012 in respect of Subsurface were 
finalised during 2013 giving rise to a decrease in both goodwill and provisions of £1m.

The fair value of the contingent consideration arrangements is estimated by applying the provisions of the purchase agreement to 
management’s assessment of possible outcomes and discounting the expected contract costs and insurance claim proceeds to their 
present value. The maximum amount that the Group could be required to pay or receive under the terms of the contingent consideration 
arrangements is: £11m payable or £16m receivable in respect of Parsons Brinckerhoff and £1m payable in respect of Subsurface. 
32.2.1 The contingent consideration payable relating to Howard S. Wright (HSW) was settled in April 2013 with a final settlement of £6m, 
£3m of which was paid in cash and the remainder netted-off against notes receivable from the HSW sellers, resulting in a £3m gain. 
32.2.2 £1m contingent consideration payable relating to SpawMaxwell was released to the income statement during the year.

32.4 Prior year disposals 
32.4.1 On 1 February 2012, the Group disposed of its 50% interest in the shares and loan notes issued by Transform Schools (North 
Lanarkshire) Holdings Ltd for a cash consideration of £18m. This disposal resulted in a gain of £8m being recognised within underlying 
operating profit, comprising a loss of £2m in respect of the disposal of the investment in the joint venture and a £10m gain in respect 
of revaluation reserves recycled to the income statement.
32.4.2 On 11 May 2012 the Group disposed of its 33.3% interest in the shares and loan notes issued by Health Management (UCLH) 
Holdings Ltd (HMU) for an agreed cash consideration of £66m. On this date the Group ceased to jointly control HMU by virtue of a put/
call structure with a preferred bidder. The other shareholders in HMU exercised pre-emption provisions in the shareholders’ agreement 
and the disposal was completed on 11 July 2012.
As a consequence of the disposal, £2m was donated to the UCLH Charity and treated as a cost of disposal. This donation would not

The disposal resulted in a net gain of £44m being recognised within underlying operating profit, comprising a gain of £6m in respect of 
the disposal of the investment in the joint venture and a £38m gain in respect of revaluation reserves recycled to the income statement.
32.4.3 The above disposals resulted in a total underlying gain of £52m after recycling £48m revaluation reserves to the income 
statement through other comprehensive income.

The Company and certain subsidiary undertakings have, in the normal course of business, given guarantees and entered into 
counter indemnities in respect of bonds relating to the Group’s own contracts and given guarantees in respect of their share of certain 
contractual obligations of joint ventures and associates and certain retirement benefit liabilities of the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund and 
the Railways Pension Scheme. Where such agreements are entered into, they are considered to be and are accounted for as insurance 
arrangements. Guarantees are treated as contingent liabilities until such time as it becomes probable payment will be required under 
the terms of the guarantee.
Provision has been made for the Directors’ best estimate of known legal claims, investigations and legal actions in progress. The Group 
takes legal advice as to the likelihood of success of claims and actions and no provision is made where the Directors consider, based on 
that advice, that the action is unlikely to succeed, or that the Group cannot make a sufficiently reliable estimate of the potential obligation.

39.1 Capital risk management
The Group and Company manage their capital to ensure their ability to continue as a going concern and to maintain an optimal capital 
structure to reduce the cost of capital. The components of capital are as follows: equity attributable to equity holders of the Company 
comprising issued ordinary share capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in Notes 29.1 and 30; preference shares as 
disclosed in Note 29.2; US private placement as disclosed in Note 26; convertible bonds as disclosed in Note 26; and cash and cash 
equivalents and borrowings as disclosed in Note 26.
The Group and Company maintain or adjust their capital structure through the payment of dividends to equity holders, issue of new 
shares and buyback of existing shares, and drawdown of new borrowings and repayment of existing borrowings. The policy of the Group 
and the Company is to ensure an appropriate balance between cash, borrowings, other than the non-recourse borrowings of companies 
engaged in Infrastructure Investments projects, working capital and the value in the Infrastructure Investments investment portfolio.
The overall capital risk management strategy of the Group and the Company remains unchanged from 2012.

Financial risk factors
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk; credit risk; and liquidity risk. The Group’s financial risk 
management strategy seeks to minimise the potential adverse effect of these risks on the Group’s financial performance.
Financial risk management is carried out centrally by Group Treasury under policies approved by the Board. Group Treasury liaises 
with the Group’s operating companies to identify, evaluate and hedge financial risks. The Board provides written principles for overall 
financial risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit 
risk, use of derivative financial instruments and non-derivative financial instruments, and the investment of excess liquidity. Compliance 
with policies and exposure limits is monitored through the Group’s internal audit and risk management procedures. The Group uses 
derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures. The Group does not trade in financial instruments, including derivative 
financial instruments, for speculative purposes. balfourbeatty.com/ar2013 Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2013

39.2 Group continued 
(a) Market risk
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The 
Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risk, including:
•	 forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on trading activities transacted in a currency that is not 
the functional currency of the operating company
•	 interest rate swaps to mitigate the cash flow variability in Infrastructure Investments concessions arising from variable interest rates 
on borrowings.
There has been no material change to the Group’s exposure to market risks and there has been no change in how the Group manages 
those risks since 2012.
(i) Foreign currency risk management
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from exposure to various currencies, primarily to US 
dollars, euros, Australian dollars, Hong Kong dollars and United Arab Emirate dirhams. Foreign exchange risk arises from future trading 
transactions, assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations.
Group policy requires operating companies to manage their transactional foreign exchange risk against their functional currency. 
At 31 December 2013 no individual entities within the Group had material financial assets or liabilities in a functional currency other 
than their own. Whenever a current or future foreign currency exposure is identified with sufficient reliability Group Treasury enters  
into forward contracts on behalf of operating companies to cover 100% of foreign exchange risk above materiality levels determined  
by the Chief Financial Officer. 
Refer to page 146 for details of forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding at the reporting date in respect of foreign currency 
transactional exposures. 
As at 31 December 2013, the notional principal amounts of foreign exchange contracts in respect of foreign currency transactions 
where hedge accounting is not applied was £324m (2012: £274m) receivable and £325m (2012: £287m) payable with related cash 
flows expected to occur up to four (2012: five) years. The foreign exchange gains or losses resulting from fair valuing these unhedged 
foreign exchange contracts will affect the income statement throughout the same periods.
The Group has designated forward exchange contracts with a notional principal amount of £63m (2012: £21m) receivable and £66m 
(2012: £23m) payable as cash flow hedges against highly probable cash flows which are expected to occur in up to four (2012: four) 
years. Fair value gains on these contracts of £nil (2012: £nil) have been taken to hedging reserves through other comprehensive 
income. The cumulative amount deferred in the hedging reserves relating to cash flow hedges at the reporting date is £nil (2012: £nil). 
No significant amounts in relation to hedge ineffectiveness have been charged or credited to the income statement in relation to any 
foreign exchange cash flow hedges. 
The Group’s investments in foreign operations are exposed to foreign currency translation risks. The Group does not enter into forward 
foreign exchange or other derivative contracts to hedge foreign currency denominated net assets. In March 2013 the Group raised 
US$350m through a US private placement which has been designated as a net investment hedge against changes in the value of the 
Group’s US net assets due to exchange movements. Exchange movements in the year totalled £19m (2012: £nil).
The hedging policy is reviewed periodically. At the reporting date the only change to the hedging policies since 2012 was to designate 
the US private placement as a net investment hedge. 
(ii) Interest rate risk management
Interest rate risk arises in the Group’s Infrastructure Investments concessions which borrow funds at both floating and fixed interest 
rates and hold available-for-sale financial assets.
Floating rate borrowings expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. The Group’s policy to manage this risk is to swap floating rate 
interest to fixed rate, using interest rate swap contracts. 
In an interest rate swap, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating rate interest amounts calculated  
on agreed notional principal amounts. The net effect of a movement in interest rates on income would therefore be immaterial.  
The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the yield curve at the reporting date. 
During 2013 and 2012, the Group’s PPP subsidiaries’ borrowings at variable rates of interest were denominated in sterling.
The notional principal amounts of the outstanding subsidiaries’ interest rate swaps outstanding at 31 December 2013 totalled  
£357m (2012: £404m) with maturities that match the maturity of the underlying borrowings ranging from one year to 24 years. 
At 31 December 2013, the fixed interest rates range from 4.3% to 5.1% (2012: 4.2% to 5.1%) and the principal floating rates are  
LIBOR plus a fixed margin.
A 50 basis point increase/decrease in the interest rate in which financial instruments are held would lead to a £2m increase (2012: £8m) 
/£3m decrease (2012: £9m) in amounts taken directly to other comprehensive income by the Group in relation to the Group’s exposure 
to interest rates on the available-for-sale financial assets and cash flow hedges of its Infrastructure Investments subsidiaries.
Interest rate risk also arises on the Group’s cash and cash equivalents, term deposits and other borrowings. A 50 basis point increase/
decrease in the interest rate of each currency in which these financial instruments are held would lead to a £nil (2012: £nil) 
increase/£1m (2012: £2m) decrease in the Group’s net finance cost. balfourbeatty.com/ar2013 Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2013

(a) Market risk continued
(iii) Price risk management
The Group’s principal price risk exposure arises in its Infrastructure Investments concessions. At the commencement of the 
concession an element of the unitary payment by the client is indexed to offset the effect of inflation on the concession’s costs.  
The Group is exposed to price risk to the extent that inflation differs from the index used.
(b) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations, resulting in financial loss. Credit risk arises from  
cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and credit exposures to clients, including outstanding receivables and 
committed transactions. The Group has a policy of assessing the creditworthiness of potential clients before entering into transactions. 
For cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments the Group has a policy of only using counterparties that are 
independently rated with a minimum long term credit rating of BBB+. At 31 December 2013 £44m (2012: £37m) did not meet this 
criterion due to the operational and relationship difficulties in transferring certain balances, however no losses are anticipated from 
these counterparties. The credit rating of a financial institution will determine the amount and duration for which funds may be 
deposited under individual risk limits set by the Board of Directors for the Group and subsidiary companies. Management monitors  
the utilisation of these credit limits regularly. 
For trade and other receivables credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable using independent 
ratings where available or by assessment of the client’s credit quality based on its financial position, past experience and other factors. 
The Group’s most significant clients are public or regulated industry entities which generally have high credit ratings or are of a high 
credit quality due to the nature of the client.
The maximum exposure to credit risk in respect of the above at 31 December is the carrying value of financial assets recorded in the 
financial statements, net of any allowance for losses.
(c) Liquidity risk
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash balances and banking facilities, continuously monitoring forecast and 
actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities. Details of undrawn committed borrowing facilities 
are set out in Note 26.1. The maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities is set out on page 147.
Fair value estimation
The Group holds certain financial instruments on the balance sheet at their fair values. The following hierarchy classifies each class  
of financial asset or liability in accordance with the valuation technique applied in determining its fair value.
Level 1 – The fair value is calculated based on quoted prices traded in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The Group holds 
available-for-sale investments in mutual funds which are traded in active markets and valued at the closing market price at 31 December. 
Level 2 – The fair value is based on inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, 
either directly or indirectly. The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows 
utilising yield curves at the reporting date and taking into account own credit risk. Own credit risk for the Infrastructure Investment 
swaps is not considered material and is calculated using the following credit valuation adjustment (CVA) calculation: loss given default 
multiplied by exposure multiplied by probability of default. The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using 
quoted forward exchange rates at the reporting date and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching the maturities of the 
foreign exchange contracts. Own credit risk for the other derivative liabilities is not considered material and is calculated by applying  
a relevant credit default swap (CDS) rate obtained from a third party.
Level 3 – The fair value is based on unobservable inputs. The fair value of the Group’s PPP financial assets is determined in the 
construction phase by applying an attributable profit margin by reference to the construction margin on non-PPP projects reflecting the 
construction risks retained by the construction contractor, and fair value of construction services performed. In the operational phase  
it is determined by discounting the future cash flows allocated to the financial asset at a discount rate which is based on long term  
gilt rates adjusted for the risk levels associated with the assets. The consequent movement in the fair value is taken to other 
comprehensive income.
There have been no transfers between these categories in the current or preceding year. balfourbeatty.com/ar2013 Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2013

In respect of the Level 3 PPP financial assets, a change in the discount rate would have a significant effect on the value of the asset 
and a 50 basis points increase/decrease, which represents management’s assessment of a reasonably possible change in the risk 
adjusted discount rate, would lead to a £22m increase (2012: £28m)/£21m decrease (2012: £26m) in the fair value of the assets taken 
through other comprehensive income. A reasonably possible change in the attributable profit margin would not have a significant  
effect on the value of the asset. Refer to Note 20 for a reconciliation of the movement of the opening balance to the closing balance.
The carrying values less impairment provision of trade and other receivables and payables approximate their fair values due to their 
short term nature. The fair value of financial liabilities for disclosure purposes is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash 
flows at the current market interest rate that is available to the Group for similar financial instruments.

Financial risk factors
(a) Market risk
(i) Foreign currency risk management
For the Company, there would be no material effect of any strengthening/weakening in US dollar, euro, Australian dollar, Hong Kong 
dollar or United Arab Emirates dirham exchange rates against sterling. The Company’s external forward foreign exchange contracts 
hedge the currency risk on foreign currency loans entered into with Group companies or are offset by forward foreign exchange 
contracts with the Group’s operating companies where Group Treasury is hedging the exchange rate risk arising on trading activities 
on their behalf.
(ii) Interest rate risk management
A 50 basis point increase/decrease in the interest rate of each currency in which financial instruments are held would lead to a £10m 
(2012: £8m) increase/decrease in the Company’s net finance cost. This is mainly attributable to the Company’s exposure to UK interest 
rates on its cash and cash equivalents and term deposits and amounts due to and from its subsidiaries. There would be no effect on 
amounts taken directly by the Company to other comprehensive income.
(b) Credit risk
The Company bears credit risk in respect to trade and other receivables and payables due from/to subsidiaries. There were no amounts 
past due at the reporting date. The maximum exposure is the carrying value of the financial assets recorded in the financial statements. 40 Au DIt e XeMPt Ions t AKen F o R su Bs IDIARIes

Roads
s ummary Balfour Beatty is a promoter, developer and investor in 12 road and street lighting projects under Balfour Beatty’s Connect 
brand to construct new roads, to upgrade and maintain existing roads and to replace and maintain street lighting.
Contractual arrangements The principal contract in the roads concessions is the project agreement with the governmental highway 
authority setting out the obligations for the construction, operation and maintenance of the roads including lifecycle replacement by 
Connect for the life of the concession to specified standards. In the case of M1-A1, A30/A35 and A50 the inflation-indexed payment 
is related to traffic volumes. In the case of M77/GSO and CNDR, the inflation-indexed payment is partly based on availability and 
partly on traffic volumes, and is subject to any performance related deductions. In the case of M25, the inflation-indexed payment 
is wholly based on availability and is subject to any performance related deductions. Construction of the roads was subcontracted 
to construction joint ventures in which Balfour Beatty had a 50% interest or, in the case of the M77/GSO and CNDR, 100% to 
Balfour Beatty subsidiaries. On the street lighting projects, payment is by a periodic inflation-indexed availability payment subject to 
performance deductions and the replacement and maintenance obligations have been subcontracted to a Balfour Beatty subsidiary. 
There are no provisions to reprice the contracts and all assets transfer to the client at the end of the concessions.

Military housing 
s ummary Balfour Beatty through its subsidiary Balfour Beatty Communities LLC is a manager, developer, and investor in a number 
of US military privatisation projects associated with a total of 54 US government military bases which includes 54 military family 
housing communities and one unaccompanied personnel housing community that are expected to contain approximately 42,500 
housing units once development, construction and renovation are complete.
The projects comprise 11 military family housing privatisation projects with the United States Department of the Army (Army), seven 
projects with the United States Department of the Air Force (Air Force) and two projects with the United States Department of the 
Navy (Navy). In addition, there is one unaccompanied personnel housing (UPH) project with the Army at Fort Stewart. 
Contractual arrangements The first phase of the project, known as the initial development period, covers the period of initial 
construction or renovation of military housing on a base, typically lasting three to eight years. With respect to Army and Navy projects, 
the government becomes a member or partner of the project entity (Project LLC); the Air Force is not a named partner or member 
in Balfour Beatty Communities’ Project LLCs, however it contributes a commitment to provide a government direct loan to the 
Project LLC and has similar rights to share in distributions and cash flows of the Project LLC. On each project, the Project LLC 
enters into a ground lease with the government, which provides the Project LLC with a leasehold interest in the land and title to the 
improvements on the land for a period of 50 years. Each of these military housing privatisation projects includes agreements covering 
the management, renovation, and development of existing housing units, as well as the development, construction, renovation and 
management of new units during the term of the project, which, in the case of the Army, could potentially extend for up to an additional 
25 years. The 50-year duration of each project calls for continuous renovation, rehabilitation, demolition and reconstruction of housing 
units. At the end of the ground lease term the Project LLC’s leasehold interest terminates and all project improvements on the land 
generally transfer to the government.
Preferred returns The projects will typically receive, to the extent that adequate funds are available, an annual minimum preferred 
rate of return. On most existing projects, this annual minimum preferred rate of return ranges from 9% to 12% of Balfour Beatty 
Communities’ initial equity contribution to the project. During the initial development period, the project is precluded from distributing 
funds to pay the minimum preferred rate of return. The unpaid amounts will generally accrue and accumulate, and can be used to fund 
renovation and construction costs, if necessary. If the accumulated funds are not needed to fund renovation and construction costs, 
at the end of the initial development period they are distributed to pay accrued preferred returns to Balfour Beatty Communities and 
the government in accordance with the terms of the project agreements.

Military housing continued 
Allocation of remaining operating cash flows Subsequent to the initial development period, any operating cash flow remaining 
after the annual minimum preferred rate of return is paid is shared between Balfour Beatty Communities and the reinvestment 
account held by the project for the benefit of the government. On most of the existing projects, the total amount that Balfour Beatty 
Communities is entitled to receive (inclusive of the preferred return) is generally capped at an annual modified rate of return, or 
cash-on-cash return, on its initial equity contribution to the project. Historically, these caps have ranged between approximately  
9% to 18% depending on the particular project and the type of return (annual modified rates of return or cash-on-cash). However,  
in some of the more recent projects, there are either no annual caps or lower projected annual rates of return. The total capped return 
generally will include the annual minimum preferred return discussed above. The reinvestment account is an account established for 
the benefit of the military, but funds may be withdrawn for construction, development and renovation costs during the remaining life  
of a privatisation project upon approval by the applicable military service. 
Return of equity Generally, at the end of a project term, any monies remaining in the reinvestment account are distributed to Balfour 
Beatty Communities and the Army, Navy or Air Force, in a predetermined order of priority. Typically these distributions will have the 
effect of providing the parties with sufficient funds to provide a minimum annual return over the life of the project and a complete 
return of the initial capital contribution. After payment of the minimum annual return and the return of a party’s initial contribution,  
all remaining funds will typically be distributed to the applicable military service.

u nsolicited telephone calls
In the past, some of our shareholders 
have received unsolicited telephone calls 
or correspondence concerning investment 
matters from organisations or persons 
claiming or implying that they have some 
connection with the Company. These are 
typically from overseas based "brokers" 
who target UK shareholders offering  
to sell them what often turn out to be 
worthless or high-risk shares in UK or 
overseas investments. Shareholders are 
advised to be very wary of any unsolicited 
advice, offers to buy shares at a discount 
or offers of free reports on the Company. 
If you receive any unsolicited  
investment advice:
•	 always ensure the firm is on the 
Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) 
Register and is allowed to give financial 
advice before handing over your money. 
You can check via http://www.fsa.gov.
uk/register/home.do
•	 double-check the caller is from the firm 
they say they are – ask for their name 
and telephone number and say you  
will call them back. Check their identity  
by calling the firm using the contact 
number listed on the FCA Register.  
If there are no contact details on the 
FCA Register or you are told that they 
are out of date, or if you have any  
other doubts, call the FCA Consumer 
Helpline on 0800 111 6768
•	 check the FCA’s list of known 
unauthorised overseas firms at  
http://www.fca.org.uk. However, these 
firms change names regularly, so even 
if a firm is not listed, it does not mean 
they are legitimate. Always check that 
they are listed on the FCA Register
•	 if you are approached about a share 
scam, you should inform the FCA  
using the share fraud reporting form  
at http://www.fca.org.uk/consumers/
scams/investment-scams/share-fraud-
and-boiler-room-scams/reporting-form, 
where you can also find out about the 
latest investment scams or alternatively, 
you can call the FCA Consumer Helpline 
(see above). If you use an unauthorised 
firm to buy or sell shares or other 
investments, you will not have access 
to the Financial Ombudsman Service 
or be eligible to receive payment under 
the Financial Services Compensation 
Scheme if things go wrong

Overview
Chairman’s statement
During this year Optos has successfully 
achieved substantial growth of its business, 
whilst investing in a range of additional 
complementary technologies. The expansion of 
the widefield retinal scanning business has been 
driven by both the well-received launch of a new 
high-performance device, the 200Tx, and by the 
introduction of new business models which are 
assisting optometrists and ophthalmologists to 
access this technology. These advances have 
delivered significant increases in both revenues 
and profits. 
Our core widefield scanning devices are  
well established, with over 4,200 devices 
now installed in optometry and ophthalmology 
practices in the markets that we serve, a growth 
of some 8% during the year. Over 32 million 
widefield retinal digital optomap® examinations 
have now been performed by eyecare specialists, 
underlining both the efficacy and utility of our 
core technology. 
Throughout the year we have continued to focus 
upon our customers’ requirements by introducing 
a much-enhanced range of pricing, rental and 
purchase options. We have expanded our sales 
force, moving into new territories in Europe and 
Australia, and established a new team addressing 
retinal specialists in North America. The acquisition 
of Opto Global Pty Holdings Ltd was completed 
in December 2010 and we have been selling 
the Opto Global product range throughout 2011, 
both directly and through the network of 
distributors we acquired with the business. 
In brief
•  Over 4,200 widefield scanning 
devices installed with optometrists 
and ophthalmologists
•  We have expanded our sales 
force, moving into new territories 
and new segments
•  The acquisition of Opto Global 
was completed in December 2010 
and followed by the acquisition 
of OCT products in October 2011
•  We launched the 200Tx to 
ophthalmology customers and 
unveiled Daytona on schedule
 “  Advances in our 
range of products 
and business models 
delivered significant 
increases in both 
revenues and profits.”
Dr Peter Fellner

We have established 
a strong platform 
from which to build

Overview
Business review
Governance
Financial statements
Our newly launched 200Tx device has performed 
strongly, attracting customers in our direct markets, 
and has enabled us to address important export 
markets such as Japan, one of the largest 
markets in the world for medical devices. 
Increasing flows of strong clinical data have 
demonstrated the importance of widefield fundus 
imaging in the management and treatment of 
disease. We believe that widefield auto-fluorescence 
images provide clinicians with valuable additional 
information relating to the health of retinal cells, 
which makes the use of our technology even more 
compelling for ophthalmologists and optometrists 
worldwide. We can also now supply treatment 
laser products, surgical microscopes and corneal 
cross-linking products to our clinician customers. 
We believe strongly that Optos’ growing range 
of products can make an important difference 
to ophthalmologists, vitreo-retinal specialists 
and their patients. 
Within our optometry customer base, the Opto 
Global visual acuity and perimetry products are 
competitive with similar products, and give our 
sales force an expanded offering alongside the 
core P200 and 200Dx scanning devices. We have 
further enhanced our product range by offering 
new software features such as OptosAdvance, 
which provides optometrists secure, web-based 
storage of images that can be reviewed remotely. 
In September 2011, we announced the proposed 
acquisition of additional diagnostic imaging 
devices from OPKO Health Inc. including optical 
coherence tomography (“OCT”) and ultrasound 
devices, together with a strong development pipeline. 
This acquisition was completed in October 2011 
and the integration of that business into Optos
is moving forward rapidly. We are excited by 
the potential that these products offer in all of 
our customer segments. In order to finance this 
acquisition, we put in place a $30m, three-year 
revolving credit facility which will allow the 
business to be funded on a more conventional 
and cost-effective basis. 
As a result of these initiatives, we delivered 
revenues of $143.3m for the year ended 
30 September 2011 compared to $106.3m 
in the previous year. On a like-for-like basis, 
ignoring the impacts of the Opto Global acquisition 
and of finance lease accounting, revenue growth 
was over 25%, driven by capital sales. The 
acquisitions of Opto Global and the OPKO Health 
assets resulted in exceptional expenses of $2.4m 
in the year. These were offset by a $1.75m credit 
relating to a reassessment of the likely deferred 
consideration payable to the former shareholders 
of Opto Global. Pre-tax profits before exceptional 
items were $22.7m compared to $12.7m in the 
previous year, with basic earnings per share after 
tax and exceptional items increasing to 32.1c 
compared with 20.0c in the previous year. 
Looking forward to the next financial year, we 
believe that our next generation ultra-widefield 
retinal scanner, Daytona, will enable Optos to 
achieve a further major transition, assisting the 
international expansion of the business. Daytona is 
a desk-top sized high-specification, high-resolution 
device that is modular, robust, reliable and patient 
friendly. It can deliver images of a quality similar 
to or better than our P200C device, including 
auto-fluorescence imaging, which is proving 
so valuable to eyecare specialists. We promised 
to unveil the product in October 2011 and were 
delighted to deliver on that promise. 
The scheduled commercial shipment of Daytona 
products remains on track for the first quarter 
of 2012. Our expanded sales teams are looking 
forward to selling Daytona, alongside our new 
OCT products and existing device range. 
I would like to thank Patrick Paul, who retired 
as a Non-executive Director during the year, for 
his significant contributions to the growth and 
development of the Company, and to welcome 
John Goddard and David Wilson to the Optos 
Board as Non-executive Directors. I would also 
thank our investors for their support during the 
past year and our employees for their outstanding 
efforts which have underpinned the advances 
achieved within the business. 
We look forward to the next year with 
confidence. The impending launch of Daytona 
and an extended product range, including OCT, 
will arm our sales and marketing organisation 
with a range of highly competitive devices, 
which will further strengthen our position 
in the retinal healthcare field.

Chief Executive’s review
Accelerating 
growth in our 
core business
In brief
•  We delivered a significant 
increase in both revenues 
and profits
•   We expanded into several 
new markets
•   We developed a growing body of 
clinical evidence that demonstrates 
the critical importance of 
retinal diagnostics
•   We made strong progress 
towards becoming the leading 
retinal diagnostics company
Overview
The strong growth in our revenues, increasing 
35% from $106.3m in 2010 to $143.3m this year, 
reflects the successful implementation of a number 
of key strategic changes during the past year. 
New business models 
Our customers have responded well to the 
alternative business models we now offer. Many 
are still happy to work with our pay-per-patient 
rental model, but we are seeing an increasing 
trend towards the new alternatives such as 
fixed rental contracts, rent-to-own or outright 
purchases of the devices. We believe this 
contributed to the low levels of customers 
choosing to de-install their devices, with only 
around 5% of our customers returning their 
products at the end of the contract term 
compared to 10% the previous year.
Improved core products 
At the beginning of this year, our sales team 
focused only on selling our core ultra-widefield 
imaging devices to a customer base focused 
largely on optometry. We armed our teams with an 
improvement to our base P200 device, the 200Dx. 
Many customers chose to acquire the 200Dx 
upgrade, which offers improved image quality, 
either on a new contract, through purchase or upon 
renewing their existing contracts. Others chose 
the P200 which was priced more competitively. 
We also acquired additional products, initially 
through a distribution deal with Accutome, then 
through the purchase in December 2010 of the 
Australian company, Opto Global Pty Holdings Ltd, 
and further through our in-house development 
of the image management and archiving product, 
OptosAdvance. This range of products gave 
the sales team the opportunity to attract new 
customers and retain existing contacts.
Expanding into ophthalmology  
Our P200C devices remain popular with clinical 
optometrists and general ophthalmologists, 
particularly in the Canadian and German markets. 
Additionally, Optos chose to focus significant 
efforts on the ophthalmologist and retinal 
 “  We have expanded into 
several new markets, 
whilst building our 
product portfolio both 
through acquisition and 
organic development.”

specialist sectors with the launch and promotion 
of the 200Tx device promoted solely to those 
customers. A specialist six-person sales team 
was established to lead the sales efforts into 
this marketplace in North America, supported 
by the broader sales team. 
The clinical information delivered by the images 
from these devices, including our standard 
optomap® images derived using red and green 
lasers, together with fluorescein angiography 
images using blue laser technology (disclosing 
information about the vasculature of the retina) 
and auto-fluorescence (delivering information 
about the metabolic state of the retinal cells 
and their health) all in the widefield is attracting 
significant medical interest. We are pleased to 
have placed over 140 of the 200Tx devices. 
The additional Opto Global products used by 
ophthalmologists, including treatment lasers 
and surgical microscopes, are helping to 
establish Optos in the ophthalmology sector.
Geographic expansion  
We took significant steps towards expanding 
our geographic reach. Sales representatives 
were recruited in new territories in Europe, 
including Austria and the Netherlands, and the 
sales teams strengthened in our other direct 
markets, being Germany, UK, Switzerland, 
Sweden, Norway and Spain. Our European 
presence was further strengthened through the 
appointment of distributors and dealers in Italy 
and Poland. Opto Global brought us an extensive 
international distributor network, including in 
Europe, Middle East and Africa. It also brought 
us a direct footprint in Australia, a market for 
which we see great potential. The 200Tx product 
also brought us our first sales in the important 
Japanese market where we appointed a 
strong distributor. 
Expanding our product range  
In October 2011, we completed the acquisition of 
the business and assets of OPKO Instrumentation, 
bringing access to established OCT and ultrasound 
products together with a product pipeline including 
a lower-cost OCT product (Falcon) nearing market 
launch. We are excited by this acquisition, as 
we believe that Optos’ widefield retinal imaging 
technology, combined with the specific data that 
can be derived from OCT images, has the potential 
to offer eyecare professionals the most powerful 
tools for disease diagnosis and management. 
We were also proud to deliver our leading 
development project, Daytona, on schedule. 
This project, conceived two years ago, set out to 
deliver a desk-top sized version of our widefield 
SLO scanning device. Our objective was to create 
a product that would deliver images of a quality 
as high as the P200C device, would capture the 
same widefield view of the retina, would be robust, 
manufacturable in volume, with auto-fluorescence 
imaging, run from new, intuitive software and would 
offer a device that could be used by customers 
globally regardless of practice size or physical 
or climatic environment. We unveiled Daytona as 
planned In October and are set to ship product to 
customers before the end of the first half of 2012.
Research and development  
Our R&D activities are driven from Scotland 
and our team is now some 45 strong, including 
the software and hardware engineers who 
joined with OCT business just after the year end. 
Significant projects delivered this year include 
Daytona and OptosAdvance.
In 2011 we gained additional patent protection 
for our core widefield imaging technology, 
extending the SLO core patent claims through 
2027. The focus in 2012 is to deliver Daytona 
at volume, add additional imaging modalities to 
our 200Tx device and deliver the next generation 
Falcon OCT devices, ensuring full integration of 
the recently acquired assets and devices. 
Our sales team is now over 90 strong, with 
clinical experts supporting and training all 
representatives to allow them to deliver 
excellent support to clinicians.

Marketplace and industry overview
The importance of eyecare increases daily. Somewhere in the world, 
someone goes blind every five seconds and a child goes blind every 
minute. Worldwide it is estimated that 7 million people lose their 
vision every year and that 180 million people are blind or visually 
impaired. Rates of vision loss are expected to double by 2020 unless 
prevention efforts are intensified.
Leading causes of vision loss include cataracts, glaucoma and age 
related macular degeneration (“AMD”). AMD is the leading cause 
of blindness in people over the age of 55. Diabetic retinopathy 
is the leading cause of preventable blindness in the world.
The economic and social impact of loss of sight is significant, 
the global cost of vision loss is estimated to be nearly $3tn yearly.
Optometrists offer primary specialist care for eyes, generally treating 
healthy patients, checking for eye disease and managing certain 
diseases. Much of the optometrists’ income is patient pay, although 
some reimbursement is available for certain disease treatments and 
through some eyecare insurance products. Ophthalmologists provide 
secondary and tertiary care for eyes, generally treating patients with 
disease, with much of their patients gaining insurance or health system 
reimbursement for the treatments offered.
Whilst the economic climate internationally is unstable, within Optos’ 
markets and sectors eyecare specialists remain attractive customers. 
Reimbursement rates will always come under pressure and Optos 
intends to respond by delivering increasingly useful services and 
improved product pricing where possible.

Expand our customer segments
Optometry
Optometry has been the core of our business, 
particularly in the US market
•   Optometrists are the primary providers of 
eyecare and digital retinal screening is becoming 
an accepted part of the comprehensive eye 
examinations they conduct.
•   Our P200 and 200Dx devices are used by most 
of our optometry customers, although some 
choose to use our higher-end devices.
•  We have added further products used by 
optometrists, such as the visual acuity chart 
devices and automated perimeters. The optical 
coherence tomography (OCT) products are also 
used in wellness screening by optometrists.
Ophthalmology
Ophthalmologists are the providers of secondary 
eyecare, managing patients who have been 
diagnosed by their primary healthcare provider 
as needing specialist treatment
•  Ophthalmologists require additional functionality 
for imaging devices to properly assess and 
treat their patients as do vitreo-retinal 
specialists who focus on retinal diseases 
such as diabetic retinopathies. The 200Tx 
is directed to this customer group. 
•  The products acquired through our recent 
acquisitions, such as the photo disruption 
and photo coagulation lasers, OCT and 
ultrasound scanners, delivers a fuller  
offering to this segment. 
Our core sales force has been strengthened due to the addition of a small team with 
specialised knowledge of the work of ophthalmologists and vitreo-retinal specialists. 
This Vit-Ret team supports those specialists and assists the core team in delivering 
our new products to general ophthalmologist customers. 
Daytona
Designed to globalise our core widefield retinal imagining technology
400+ 
Ophthalmology customers 
in Germany, Switzerland, 
Japan and North America
Our next generation ultra-widefield retinal scanner, Daytona, is 
intended to assist the expansion of the business by appealing to a more 
global market through its small footprint (easier to ship) and improved 
ease of use. In North America, it is aimed at the clinical optometry market, 
and at both optometrists and general ophthalmologists elsewhere.
This project, conceived 2 years ago, set out to deliver a desk-top sized 
version of our widefield SLO scanning device, with the objectives of 
creating a product that delivered images of a quality as high as the P200C 
device, capturing the same widefield view of the retina, was robust, 
manufacturable in volume, with auto-fluorescence imaging, run from new, 
intuitive software and offering a device that could be used by customers 
 globally regardless of practice size or physical or climatic environment. 
  We unveiled Daytona as planned In October and are set to ship product 
   to customers before the end of the first quarter 2012.

Shortly after the year end we completed the 
acquisition of the instrumentation division of 
OPKO Health, bringing access to established OCT 
(optical coherence technology) and ultrasound 
products together with a product pipeline 
including a lower-cost OCT product, Falcon, 
nearing market launch. 
OCT delivers an image that shows a  
three-dimensional, cross-sectional view of 
the retina in any particular area, typically 
in the central pole area of the retina around 
the optic nerve and macula, and is used to detect 
the presence of and understand the severity of 
disease, determine treatment approaches and 
monitor post-treatment effects.
We are excited by this acquisition, as we believe 
that Optos’ widefield retinal imaging technology, 
combined with the specific data that can be 
derived from OCT images, has the potential to 
offer eyecare professionals the most powerful 
tools for disease diagnosis and management. 
The spectral OCT market 
is both growing and 
diversifying, presenting 
a unique opportunity for 
new entrants to quickly 
gain market share.

Delivering our strategy
We are building 
and improving our 
sales channels and 
increasing their 
efficiency through 
our expanded 
product range.
Leverage our sales channels
Though ultra-widefield retinal imaging 
remains at the core of our business, we have 
vastly expanded our offering in the past two 
years. By providing a wider offering, we are able 
to meet more of the needs of the practice, and 
become the overall retina company of choice 
for professionals worldwide.
This increased product range is an important tool 
for our sales team, allowing them to engage new 
customers and offer additional products which 
might appeal to existing customers. We maximise 
these channels through keeping in place industry 
based and proven sales management, as well as 
in-depth salesforce training to ensure our staff 
are as helpful and knowledgeable as possible.
Retinal imaging products
Our widefield retinal imaging technology, combined with 
the specific data that can be derived from OCT images, 
offers ophthalmologists and optometrists the most 
powerful tools for disease diagnosis and management.
Medical/surgical devices
Optos has acquired a wide range of medical surgical 
devices including photocoagulators, photodisruptors, 
surgical microscopes and corneal cross‑linking systems. 
Designed by a development process focused on longevity, 
dependability and a high level of precision and performance 
for optimum clinical outcomes, these products have a 
reputation for value, reliability and efficiency.
Diagnostic instruments
Expanding the company goal to support practitioners in 
diagnosing, analysing and monitoring ocular pathology, 
Optos recently added new product lines through the 
acquisition of Opto Global. The products, including 
ultrasound technology, visual field devices, ophthalmic 
lenses and visual acuity systems, are complementary 
additions to the core imaging technology.

$3m 
delivered by the acquisition of Opto Global in revenues from 
new products as well as synergies from new sales channels
Optos plc Annual report and accounts 2011 19
The acquisition of Opto Global, completed in 
December 2010, brings additional devices for 
both optometrist and ophthalmologist practices, 
(including the visual acuity products SmartChart 
and the AP100, AP200 & AP300 perimeters and  
treatment lasers) and has expanded our 
geographic reach outside our core North 
American and European markets.
We are now building a significant direct presence 
in Australia and exploiting the distributor network 
we acquired with Opto Global. We appointed a 
distributor in Japan to whom we have delivered 
over 20 200Tx devices. The OPKO transaction 
brings us further opportunities to expand our 
international presence.
In addition we are continuing to build inventory 
of our P200C and 200Tx devices and invest in 
expanding our sales force. We have placed a 
number of devices on trial at key opinion leader 
sites on extended payment terms. In addition, we 
have improved our manufacturing capability such 
that we now build P200C and P200MA devices in 
the US as well as Scotland. This investment will 
enable lower service and maintenance costs in 
the future by delivering product from proximal 
locations and free up capacity in Scotland to 
handle the new Daytona device, which we expect 
to be an internationally attractive product.

from outright sales of 
devices and $19.8m 
from sales under

Delivering significant 
increases in revenues 
and profits
Revenues and customer base
As we forecasted last year, an increasing proportion 
of our revenues for 2011 came from sales of 
devices both outright and under finance leases, 
as well as with related service and warranty 
income. We expect this trend to continue in 
future years, as we expand internationally, both 
through direct sales and distributor relationships, 
and penetrate further into ophthalmology and 
towards the introduction of our next generation 
desk-top scanning devices and OCT products. 
As disclosed at the interim results, we have 
re-assessed the anticipated useful life of our 
current product range from an accounting 
perspective and as a consequence now expect 
the majority of new and renewed rental contracts 
to fall to be treated as sales under finance leases 
rather than operating leases. During the year we 
secured 415 finance lease contracts compared 
to 88 in 2010.
Our revenues grew by 35% to $143.3m 
(2010: $106.3m) and include $37.6m from 
outright sales of devices (2010: $8.1m) and 
$19.8m from sales under finance leases 
(2010: $7.7m). Included within these outright 
sales were $3.0m of revenues from products 
acquired with Opto Global which were consolidated 
from January 2011. Revenues from the recurring 
streams of operating lease rentals and service 
and warranty revenues fell from $90.5m in 
2010 to $85.9m this year. 
Adjusting revenues in both the current and 
prior financial year to treat all receipts under 
rental contracts as if they were operating leases 
and deducting revenues from the Opto Global 
products resulted in like-for-like growth in 
revenues of over 25%.
Our core North American markets generated 
revenues of $117.1m (2010: $93.4m), an increase 
of 23%, with markets outside North America growing 
strongly by 103% from $12.9m to $26.2m.

Overview
Business review
Governance
Financial statements
This growth included expansion in our direct 
markets in Europe, sales through new distributor 
relationships and first direct sales in Australia 
and New Zealand.
Our customer base for core Optos scanning devices 
increased from 3,912 to 4,240 during the year, with 
811 devices owned outright and 80%, or 3,429, 
on rental contracts. Of these 487 classify as finance 
leases. We sold 529 devices in 2011 compared 
to 115 in 2010, influenced by the broader range 
of business models and sales through distributors 
and to ophthalmology customers.
Our asset utilisation efforts remained effective, 
with the average monthly optomaps® for the year 
being 112 compared to 110 last year. 
Future minimum revenues receivable under 
non-cancellable operating lease contracts at the end 
of 2011 fell from $169.8m to $105.9m, although 
a further $37.4m is due under non-cancellable 
contracts accounted for as finance leases of 
which $25.8m is recognised in the balance sheet. 
Gross and operating profits and net finance costs
Gross profits increased by $20.5m to $91.4m, 
representing a gross margin of 64% compared to 
67% in 2010, a year where the impact of higher 
margin finance lease contracts skewed the 
overall picture. 
Overheads before exceptional items increased 
from $53.4m in 2010 (50% of revenues) to $66.3m 
(46% of revenues), reflecting higher selling costs 
with an expanded sales force and commissions 
on higher sales, increased volumes of device build 
and refurbish, increased internationalisation of 
products and the addition of the Opto Global 
operations. With the launch of Daytona and the 
addition of new markets, further products, including 
OptosAdvance, and the OCT and ultrasound devices, 
we anticipate further increases in revenues and 
overheads in the coming year.
Operating margins before exceptional costs 
increased from 16% to 17.5% this year, delivering 
operating profits of $25.1m. 
Average numbers of employees increased 
from 277 to 364 with 395 actual employees 
at the year end. Staff costs for the year were 
$44.4m compared to $30.2m in the previous 
year, reflecting the higher staff numbers and 
increased incentive payments arising from 
improved revenue and profit performance, 
investment in upgrading certain key positions 
and in employee development.
Interest charges and other finance costs reduced 
from $5.0m in 2010 to $3.3m, reflecting the 
continuing reduction in vendor finance debt. 
Finance revenue of $0.9m (2010: $0.2m) was 
comprised primarily of the implied discount 
within finance lease rental contracts.
Exceptional items and acquisitions
Exceptional items incurred in the year included 
$2.4m of costs relating to the acquisition of 
Opto Global completed in December 2010 and 
the OPKO Health device business completed after 
the current year end in October 2011. These 
charges were offset by a $1.75m credit relating 
to a reassessment of the deferred consideration 
payable for Opto Global. Opto Global was 
purchased for $11.75m of which $10.75m was 
settled in cash and the balance through the 
issue of 434,487 new shares in Optos plc. 
The contracts also allowed for payment of 
deferred consideration of up to $3m depending 
on sales performance for the twelve months 
from 1 March 2011. 
At the time the acquisition was secured, the 
Board assessed the likely deferred consideration 
to be $2.5m and a provision of that amount 
was established. Since that time, whilst overall 
performance of the Opto Global business has 
been good, with prospects for product sales 
in Australia looking particularly exciting, the 
requirement for the “base” Opto Global business 
to achieve a floor of $5m of revenue in the 
measurement year looks challenging. The contract 
states no consideration should be paid if this 
hurdle is not met. Accordingly, the Directors 
now assess a maximum of $0.75m of deferred 
consideration is likely to be payable and the 
reduction in the provision released to the 
profit and loss.
Profit on ordinary activities before tax, taxation 
and post‑ tax profits
The Group made a profit on ordinary activities 
before tax of $22.7m and a profit of $22.0m 
after exceptional items, compared to $12.7m 
in the prior year. 
A tax credit of $0.8m arose in the year 
(2010: $1.3m), comprising a current tax credit 
of $0.5m on release of provisions made in prior 
periods and a deferred tax credit of $0.3m, as 
all recognisable brought forward tax losses were 
brought in to deferred tax assets. The effective 
tax charge on the current year profits was largely 
matched by the recognition of an additional 
$6.6m of deferred tax asset. 
With effect from 2012 the Group anticipates 
recognising a full tax liability on its future profits, 
although in cash terms would not anticipate 
paying significant taxes in the UK until 2013 
or beyond, although some taxes are likely to be 
payable in the US where losses will be utilised 
sooner, and in other territories such as Canada 
and Germany.
The resultant post-tax profit after exceptional 
items was $22.8m, representing undiluted 
earnings per share of 32.1c compared with 
20.0c in the previous year.
Over 80% of our core 
imaging devices are 
placed with customers 
on a rental basis, giving 
good visibility of 
future revenues.
The acquisition of 
Opto Global delivered 
$3.0m of revenues from 
new products as well 
as synergies from new 
sales channels.

Overview
Business review
Governance
Financial statements
As the business expands to cover a 
range of products and business models, 
the measures by which performance 
is managed will move towards overall 
growth in revenues, operating margins 
and cash generation together with the 
maintenance and expansion of the 
customer base.
Measures relating to the pay-per-patient 
optomap® imaging business, whilst of 
great importance, will have less relevance 
to the overall Group results in future 
periods as the product range expands 
and are included for information only 
this year. 
Cash flow
During 2011 we invested significant cash in 
the business, acquired Opto Global, launched 
into ophthalmology, entered new geographies 
and increased research and development spend 
as well as prepared for both the acquisition 
of the OPKO Health instrumentation business 
and the Daytona launch.
As a consequence, cash flow from operating 
activities was $37.2m compared to $46.4m in 
2010. Adding back cash receipts from finance 
lease receivables and interest of $3.4m (disclosed 
within investing activities) increases adjusted 
operating cash flows to $40.6m compared 
with $46.8m. 
Manufacturing operations in 2010 related largely 
to P200 and 200Dx devices which were already 
owned by the business and required little additional 
investment other than the costs of refurbishing 
devices and establishing new customer sites. In 
2011 we built significant numbers of new devices 
in addition to refurbishing existing products and 
also increased inventories as we moved to supply 
higher volumes of 200Tx devices, the Daytona 
launch and adding Opto Global products. Debtors 
were high as a result of high capital sales 
towards the end of the year.
Investing activities used $37.8m (2010: $18.5m), 
net of finance income and finance lease receipts, 
with the acquisition of Opto Global for $10.75m, 
significant expenditure on intangible assets and 
in building and refurbishing medical devices. 
The intangible asset expenditure of $6.5m relates 
largely to the capitalisation of costs of internal 
R&D projects, with the Daytona project representing 
the majority of this expenditure. 
Net cash flows from financing activities resulted 
in a net cash outflow of $30.7m (2010: $16.7m) 
with vendor finance repayments of $31.5m and 
receipts of $3.6m compared with payments of 
$37.4m and receipts of $24.2m in 2010. 
Cash balances fell by $31.0m in the year to 
$10.2m, whilst finance lease obligations reduced 
by $26.9m from $62.3m to $35.4m, giving net 
debt at the year end of $25.2m compared to 
$21.1m at the start of the year.
Balance sheet
Shareholders’ equity and net assets at the 
year end were $100.5m, a $25.5m increase, 
principally reflecting the profit for the year, 
share issuance proceeds and adjustment for 
share-based payments. 
Non-current assets increased from $87.8m 
to $97.6m with reductions in property, plant 
and equipment through transfers of devices 
to inventories offset by increased finance lease 
receivables and intangible assets arising on 
R&D projects and the Opto Global acquisition. 
Current assets increased to $66.5m with an 
$11.0m increase in trade receivables reflecting 
high sales towards the year end and inventories 
up $18.8m, including $10.2m of assets transferred 
from PPE and increases in other devices, 
including Opto Global.
Within trade and other payables, the increase 
of $14.5m included a $7.2m increase in deferred 
revenue with some $8.7m of future revenue 
secured (much relating to service and warranty 
contracts) to be recognised in future years as 
well as higher accrual levels, reflecting increased 
business activity.
Across the approximately 3,000 devices on 
operating lease agreements, the carrying value 
of medical devices was $36.6m at the year end, 
an average carrying value of approximately 
$12.5k with the newer P200C and P200MA 
devices typically carried at a higher value 
than the P200 and 200Dx devices.

Principal risks and uncertainties
There are a number of potential risks and uncertainties that have been identified 
within the business which could have a material impact on the Company’s long‑ term 
performance. These are not all of the risks which the Directors have identified but 
those that the Directors currently consider likely to be material.
Area of risk Potential impacts Mitigating activity
The successful launch of the 
Daytona product is critical to the 
long-term growth of the Company.
The Company is currently heavily reliant on its P200 and P200C medical devices, which 
produce the Company’s retinal exam products and are principally targeted at optometry 
customers. These products, together with related services, accounted for the majority 
of the Company’s revenues for the year ended 30 September 2011. If any third-party 
produces a more advanced device with improved functionality to these devices, or a 
similar device with significantly lower build costs, this could have a material adverse 
effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. 
The Company has invested significantly in the development of a new desk-top sized, 
“plug and play” device which is being branded as Daytona. The Daytona product was 
unveiled in October 2011 and will go on sale in the first calendar quarter of 2012. As 
with any new product there are risks associated with the ability to build to the cost and 
the volume required, as well as risks relating to the continued success of the existing 
product range.
To mitigate this we have created a New Product 
Introduction team which is specifically responsible 
for transferring the product from product development 
through scale-up into full-scale manufacturing to ensure 
that the Daytona product can be built to meet the market 
demand in a cost-effective way. In addition the new 
design is modular based and therefore is less complex 
to manufacture than existing products. The Company 
has taken specialist marketing advice on how best to 
position the Daytona device to reduce the risk of 
cannibalisation. Pricing programmes have been 
established in the marketplace.
The Company is projecting 
significant growth in new 
territories as well as 
increasing penetration into 
the ophthalmology sector.
The Company currently generates most of its revenue in the optometry sector within 
North America. 
The Company seeks to address the risk of over-reliance on one sector and one market 
through investing significant resources in building sales and distribution resources 
outside the North American optometry market, building direct and indirect sales 
channels to address ophthalmology and specialist markets and in additional territories. 
Furthermore, the Company has invested in demonstrating the clinical efficacy and 
superiority of its devices and developing the quality and functionality of its products 
in order to seek to address competitive threats. 
The Company is continuing to develop the P200Tx device to 
include new features and applications that will further meet 
the customer needs, in particular within the ophthalmology 
sector. Through the recent acquisitions the Company now 
has access to an established distributor network upon 
which to build and so increase market penetration into 
new regions. This is further supported through clinical 
studies, the developing P200Tx product and the new 
Daytona device.

Overview

Financial statements
Area of risk Potential impacts Mitigating activity
The growth of the Company’s 
business, particularly as it enters 
the ophthalmology sector and new 
territories, is dependent on it 
manufacturing its devices in a 
cost-effective and repeatable way. 
The Company’s devices are complex and expensive to build and rely on a number of 
specialist components and parts. 
In order to improve security of supply, the Company 
is developing the ability to manufacture, repair and refurbish 
its devices at both its manufacturing sites and will hold 
supplies of parts at dual locations. Where a product is single 
sourced, the Company seeks to hold sufficient inventories 
to manage expected demand. The Company’s development 
teams run projects to reduce the cost of building devices 
and, in developing Daytona as discussed opposite, the team 
is seeking to place more reliance on readily available 
component and technologies rather than the current 
reliance on specialist manufacture and supply.
The Company has made two 
acquisitions in the last year. 
There is a risk that they are 
not fully integrated and so 
the synergies are not achieved. 
In October 2011 the Company acquired the assets and business of the instrumentation 
division of OPKO Health, Inc. The Company is therefore now engaged in the development, 
manufacture and sale of optical coherence tomography (“OCT”) diagnostic devices and 
optical ultrasound scanners. The successful integration and launch of the existing OCT 
products and the development of the new OCT products is a key risk.
In December 2010 the Company acquired Opto Global Pty Holdings Ltd. The company 
sources and sells precision optometric and ophthalmic equipment with markets primarily 
in the Middle and Far East as well as Africa and South America. 
The acquisition enhances the Optos product range and offers the opportunity to launch 
the sale of Optos products through key Opto Global distributors. The acquisition also 
provides a direct selling route for Optos products into Australia. As described opposite, 
the Company appointed an integration team. There are no manufacturing processes to 
assimilate as all products are sourced from third parties. Although there were some 
initial delays, the Opto Global product range is now integrated and the Company is using 
the Opto Global distributors to sell both Optos and Opto Global products. There has also 
been success selling Optos products into Australia. Managing the supply chain is a key 
risk and this has been integrated within the overall Company’s logistics management.
To mitigate this risk the Company has an experienced 
integration team in place to manage the transition. 
The acquired products are sold through the same channels 
and to the same customer groups as the existing products. 
The manufacturing processes are relatively straightforward 
and within the scope of the Company’s existing manufacturing 
experience. The sales team has all been given training on 
the new devices and marketing material produced to support 
the new products. The new product development programmes 
are nearing completion and will be integrated within the 
existing Optos project management systems.

Principal risks and uncertainties continued
The Company’s operating 
results and financing capacity 
could be adversely affected 
by the current fragile economic 
position. At the same time the 
Company is launching new 
products and expanding into 
new areas. Although the 
Company has new financing 
in place there are covenants 
attached that need to be 
monitored and met.
Any significant downturn in economic markets would be likely to impact adversely on 
disposable incomes, which may in turn result in reduced public demand for the Company’s 
products and thereby materially and adversely affect the Company’s business and financial 
position. A reduction in footfall in optometrists’ offices or closure of those offices could 
adversely impact the Company’s ability to earn revenues from optomap® examinations 
above the MMP and might cause a reduction in the renewal rate of contracts.
In addition, as the Company continues to develop and launch new products, as well 
as expand into new regions, there will be increased cash requirements, including 
working capital.
The Company does, however, benefit from good visibility 
of secured forward revenues through its contracts that 
typically have a term of around three years, although there 
can be no guarantee that customers will not default under 
those contracts. Also the Company is now selling a higher 
proportion of its products as capital sales and thereby 
receiving the cash earlier. The Company will closely monitor 
its covenant compliance and there is flexibility within the 
facility to draw down additional secured lending if required.
Area of risk Potential impacts Mitigating activity
The Company is subject to pricing 
pressures in common with other 
consumer-based businesses and 
relies in part on reimbursement 
agreements with insurers and 
government health authorities.
There can be no guarantee that the Company can deliver continued increases in revenue, 
nor can there be any certainty that the optomap® image or any other procedure will 
continue to qualify under health reimbursement schemes or that the reimbursement 
rates will not decrease. The Company may also be subject to healthcare-related taxes 
imposed by government agencies such as a medical devices tax that is to be introduced 
by the US Government. 
The near-term success of the Company’s business depends 
on consumers understanding the benefit of regular optomap® 
examinations at the price offered by the Company and 
healthcare professionals. The Company seeks to drive 
adoption and awareness of its product through strong 
educational programmes and compelling evidence from 
clinical studies.

Intellectual property suits 
that are brought against the 
Company may significantly 
harm the business, as could 
significant litigation. 
Technology-based companies are frequently subject to litigation with respect to patent 
and other intellectual property rights. Any litigation to determine the validity of third-party 
infringement claims or defend the Company’s intellectual property could at a minimum 
be costly. The Company believes the core patent protection around its product is strong 
and is not aware of any significant actual or pending suits. The Company’s business 
exposes it to the risk of certain litigation, for example, a patient suffering harm during 
the image process or the Company’s retinal image system not identifying an underlying 
medical problem. 
The Company does not offer diagnostic or treatment services 
and its customers are all qualified eyecare clinicians who are 
fully trained in the use and interpretation of the optomap® 
product. The Company maintains product liability insurance 
although there can be no certainty the insurance coverage 
would be sufficient to meet the cost of any claims.
The Company’s business is 
international and it operates 
in several countries and 
currencies and its results 
are impacted by changes in 
currency exchange rates.
Optos reports its results in US dollars, the currency in which the majority of its revenues 
and costs arise. The Group monitors its non-US dollars foreign currency exposure and, 
when deemed necessary by the Board, seeks to minimise its transaction exposure by 
using forward foreign currency contracts to eliminate exposures on any committed 
significant transactions. 
Wherever possible the majority of cash balances are 
maintained in US dollars to mitigate the impact of 
currency fluctuations. 
Area of risk Potential impacts Mitigating activity
The Company operates in a 
highly regulated industry. 
The Company’s medical devices are subject to strict US Federal Food and Drug 
Administration (“FDA”) regulations and the requirements of similar foreign regulatory 
bodies. Although the Company’s devices are currently FDA cleared to market, if the 
Company or its third-party manufacturers fail to satisfy regulatory requirements or 
regulations change, this could result in the imposition of sanctions on the Company 
or cause the Company to be unable to sell its product in certain markets or face 
adverse publicity.
The Company operates to relevant ISO guidelines 
and monitors and anticipates developments in 
regulatory thinking.

Governance
Corporate governance
 “ We continue to manage the Company’s affairs 
in accordance with the principles and provisions 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code.”
 Dr Peter Fellner, Chairman
The Board remains committed 
to ensuring that high standards 
of Corporate Governance 
are maintained
Chairman’s Statement 
Pages 06–07

Corporate Governance Code
The Board of Directors (the “Board”) remains 
committed to ensuring high standards of 
Corporate Governance are maintained and 
continues to manage the Company’s affairs in 
accordance with the principles and provisions of 
the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”) 
(June 2010). 
Statement of compliance
The Board considers that the Company has 
complied with the principles and provisions 
set out in the Code throughout the year ended 
30 September 2011.
Board of Directors
The principal duty of the Board is to represent 
and protect the interests of the Company’s 
shareholders by ensuring that the Company 
is well-managed and operated in a way which 
is in the interests of its shareholders. The Board 
is responsible for oversight of the formulation 
and implementation of the strategy of the 
Company. The Board is also responsible for 
oversight of the Company’s operations and has 
an obligation to keep informed of the Company’s 
activities and appropriate policies and 
procedures in order to assist management in 
formulating, developing and implementing plans 
and serves as a body to review and provide 
advice to management on the operations of the 
Company. The Board is committed to reviewing 
its membership on a regular basis. The Chairman 
ensures that Board discussions are conducted 
taking all views into account so that no one 
individual Director or small group of Directors 
dominate the proceedings.
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
There is a distinct and defined division of 
responsibilities between the Chairman and the 
Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”). The Chairman is 
primarily responsible for the effective working 
of the Board and the CEO is responsible for the 
operational management of the business and 
for the implementation of strategy as agreed by 
the Board. The division of responsibilities is 
reviewed annually by the Board.
Board balance and independence
During the accounting period, the Board comprised 
two Executive Directors: Roy Davis, CEO, and 
Christine Soden, CFO. The Non-executive Directors 
comprised Dr Peter Fellner, Dr Peter Kehoe, 
Barry Rose and Rosalyn Wilton. Patrick Paul 
resigned from the Board as a Non-executive 
Director as at 23 February 2011 and John Goddard 
and David Wilson were appointed to the Board 
as Non-executive Directors with effect from 
1 June 2011.
Patrick Paul was presumed not independent 
within the meaning of the Code because he 
served on the Board for more than nine years 
since first elected and held significant interests 
in the shareholding of the Company. 
As at 30 September 2011, all of the Non-executive 
Directors were independent as provided for by 
the UK Corporate Governance Code.
Role of Non-executive Directors
The Company’s Non-executive Directors 
provide input to the business by contributing 
to the oversight function of the Board and to 
the development of the Company’s strategy. 
Non-executive Directors are required to be 
satisfied that the financial information is accurate 
and that the internal controls and policies and 
procedures governing risk management are 
effective and appropriate. The Company’s 
Non-executive Directors are available to 
shareholders. The Non-executive Directors 
met as a group on 2 occasions during the 
financial year ended 30 September 2011 
without the presence of Executive Directors. 
Board process and information
The Board met 13 times during the year, 
including once over a two-day period with senior 
management to focus on strategy and business 
planning. Dialogue occurs regularly between 
Directors outside of scheduled meetings. Meeting 
agendas include review and approval of minutes 
recorded of the previous meeting, matters arising, 
items for discussion, special items, items for note

Overview
Business review
Governance
Financial statements
Board process and information continued
and any other business. Board materials are 
distributed by the Company Secretary normally 
not less than seven days in advance of meeting 
dates to allow Directors to adequately prepare 
for meetings. Minutes of Board and Committee 
meetings are normally distributed within 14 days 
following each meeting. 
The Board receives operational and financial 
information to assist in monitoring and assessing 
the ongoing performance of the business on a 
monthly basis. This includes reports from the 
CEO, CFO and Company Secretary. The Board 
also schedules and reviews special items 
covering business critical areas during the year. 
The Executive with responsibility for the Special 
Items submits a written report covering the items, 
which is included in the Board materials, and 
attends the Board meeting by invitation for that 
part of the agenda to discuss the report in detail. 
No-one other than Directors and the Company 
Secretary is entitled to be present at Board 
meetings unless specifically invited to attend. 
In those instances when a Director has been 
unable to attend Board or Committee meetings, 
his or her comments on the papers for that 
meeting are communicated to the Chairman in 
advance so that they can be duly considered.
Functions of the Board
The Board acknowledges and accepts its statutory 
duties and, in doing so, encourages the long-term 
success of the Company by exercising independent 
judgement with respect to: material strategic and 
operational issues; safeguarding corporate assets 
by reviewing the financial policies and affairs of 
the Company and overseeing the Company’s 
financial reporting process and internal controls; 
reviewing of the adequacy of the Company’s 
systems for compliance with all applicable laws 
and regulations; overseeing the Company’s risk 
management process and ensuring that the 
Company has appropriate procedures in place 
to manage risks; and evaluating the effectiveness 
of the Board and its Committees at least annually. 
The Board delegates to the Company’s Operating 
Board (which is chaired by the CEO, comprised 
the Company’s senior management and meets 
on a monthly basis) certain decisions, including 
implementing the strategy, operational plans and 
policies of the Company and the Company’s 
subsidiary companies as determined by the 
Board, delivering the operating and financial 
results against budgets and managing and 
controlling the allocation of capital, human 
and technical resources.
Senior Independent Director
The Code recommends that the Board should 
appoint one of its independent Non-executive 
Directors to serve as the Company’s Senior 
Independent Director (“SID”). Barry Rose is 
the SID for the Company. Mr Rose is available 
to shareholders. Employees can contact the 
SID under the provisions set out in the Group’s 
“Whistle-Blowing Policy” if they have concerns 
that have not been resolved through normal 
channels or for which contact through the 
normal channels is inappropriate. 
Accountability and audit 
All Directors have accepted a duty of care 
and accountability to act in the interests of the 
Company. The Audit Committee has a particular 
role, acting independently from management, 
to ensure that the interests of shareholders are 
properly protected relative to financial reporting 
and internal control. 
Risk management and internal control
The Board confirms that there is an ongoing 
process for identifying, monitoring, evaluating 
and managing the Company’s significant risks, 
that such a process has been in place for the year 
ended 30 September 2011 and up to the date of 
approval of the annual report and accounts, that 
it is regularly reviewed by the Board and that it 
accords with the internal control guidance for 
Directors relative to the Code.

Governance
Corporate governance continued
Risk management and internal control continued
The Directors acknowledge that they have overall 
responsibility for the Company’s system of internal 
control and for reviewing its effectiveness. The 
Board continued to apply C.2 of the Code by 
establishing a continuous process for identifying, 
evaluating and managing the risks that are 
considered significant. Its system is designed to 
manage the risk and can only be a reasonable 
and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. 
A Group risk and control framework has 
been established and includes a range of controls, 
including financial, operational and compliance. 
It is based principally on reviewing reports from 
management and considering whether significant 
risks are identified, evaluated, classified and 
controlled and ensuring that any significant 
weaknesses are promptly and properly remedied. 
This includes manuals of policies and procedures 
applicable to all material aspects of the business, 
a budgetary control system which includes 
monitoring actual performance against  
pre-determined plans and the appointment 
of suitably qualified and experienced staff 
to execute on their agreed responsibilities. 
External audit risk assessment and planning 
is in place. The Audit Committee considers and 
determines relevant action in respect of any 
control issues raised by either the Executive 
Directors or the external auditors. 
There is currently no dedicated internal audit 
function. The Directors review and determine 
the requirement for a dedicated internal audit 
function on an annual basis. The Directors have 
determined, based on the size and complexity 
of the Group, that a dedicated internal audit 
function is not currently required. If any specific 
internal control weakness is either perceived or 
identified, the Directors will engage an independent 
third-party to carry out additional tests.
Performance evaluation
The Board undertakes an evaluation of its own 
performance and that of its Committees and 
individual Directors, including an assessment of 
the effectiveness of the Chairman, Executive and 
Non-executive Directors and Company Secretary. 
A meeting to conduct a performance evaluation 
of the Chairman with the Non-executive Directors 
under the leadership of the SID took place in the 
financial year ended 30 September 2011.
Board and Committee meeting attendance
The Board and its Committees meet on a regular 
basis to discuss and agree matters which are 
specifically reserved to them for review and 
decision. Contact between Board and Committee 
meeting dates is carried out by the Directors as 
and when required to discuss and agree matters 
arising relative to addressing and advancing the 
business of the Company.
Appointments and resignations 
John Goddard and David Wilson were appointed 
to the Board as Non-executive Directors on 
1 June 2011. Patrick Paul resigned from the 
Board on 23 February 2011.
Board Committees
The Board appoints the members of the Audit, 
Remuneration and Nomination Committees, each 
of which has the responsibility to assist the Board 
in its oversight capacity. The Committees meet at 
regularly scheduled times throughout the year 
and at any other time that may be necessary to 
assist the Board in executing its responsibilities. 
Certain other individuals are invited to attend the 
Committee meetings when required and relevant 
to the proceedings. The written Terms of Reference 
setting out the duties and responsibilities of the 
Board and its Committees are reviewed and 
revised as may be necessary on an annual basis. 
Committee Terms of Reference are available from 
the Company Secretary or on the Company’s 
website at www.optos.com.

Board Committees continued
Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee has responsibility for 
planning and reviewing the Company’s interim 
and preliminary reports and accounts and in 
engaging the Company’s auditors in that process. 
The ultimate responsibility for reviewing and 
approving the Company’s Interim and preliminary 
reports and accounts remains with the Board on 
the recommendation from the Committee.
The Audit Committee is chaired by Barry Rose 
and its other members during the year 
included Dr Peter Fellner, John Goddard (from 
7 September 2011), Patrick Paul (through 
23 February 2011), and Rosalyn Wilton. 
The Company Secretary serves as secretary 
to the Audit Committee.
John Goddard, Barry Rose and Rosalyn Wilton 
are independent within the meaning of the Code. 
Patrick Paul was not independent within the 
meaning of the Code. The Code states that the test 
of independence is inappropriate to the Chairman 
of the Board. The Code provides for the Chairman of 
a listed company below the FTSE 350 to be 
a member of, but not chair, the Audit Committee 
provided that he or she was independent upon 
appointment. Peter Fellner was independent 
within the meaning of the Code on his appointment. 
The Board considered all members of the 
Audit Committee throughout the year ended 
30 September 2011 to be independent in 
character and judgement and in possession of 
the relevant business experience and requisite 
financial expertise.
The main activities of the Audit Committee during 
the financial year ended 30 September 2011 
included: completing the review of the 
Company’s financial results for the year ended 
30 September 2010 and reviewing the interim 
and full-year results for the year ended 
30 September 2011 and for receiving the 
reports of the external auditors on those 
results; considering the audit work carried out 
by the external auditors and any significant 
judgemental and reporting issues identified 
in the auditors’ reports; reviewing and discussing 
the risk register that is prepared and monitored 
by the Operating Board, which consists of the 
Company’s senior management, that set out the 
likelihood and potential impact of the significant 
risks faced by the Company; reviewing the 
Group’s controls; reviewing and agreeing the 
need for an internal audit function; confirming 
the adequacy of the Company’s whistle-blowing 
policy; and undertaking a specific review of 
the Company’s sales contracts procedures 
and reviewing the collection of revenue.
In accordance with the Code, the Company 
maintains a policy on the engagement of the 
external auditors with respect to the performance 
of non-audit related work. The policy also 
provides that any non-audit work involving a 
single expenditure of more than $0.2m must 
be assigned to tender. The amount paid for 
non-audit work during the year is set out in 
Note 5 to the Financial Statements on page 75. 
Remuneration Committee
A description of the role, composition and 
responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee 
can be found on page 43 in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee has responsibility 
to assist the Board with succession planning and 
with the selection process for the appointment 
of a new Director or Chairman. The Nomination 
Committee is chaired by the Chairman of the 
Board and comprises all Non-executive Directors. 
The Chairman of the Board serves as Secretary 
to the Committee. 
Save for Patrick Paul, who resigned as a  
Non-executive Director on 23 February 2011, 
all members of the Committee are independent 
within the meaning of the Code. The Code states 
that the test of independence is inappropriate 
to the Chairman of the Board. Peter Fellner 
fulfilled the independence criteria at the time 
of his appointment.
The principal responsibilities of the Nomination 
Committee are as follows: evaluate the balance 
of skills, knowledge and experience on the Board 
and, following this evaluation, prepare a description 
of the role and requisite capabilities required 
for a particular appointment; assess the time 
commitment expected on the part of the Chairman 
of the Company and to require Non-executive 
Directors to undertake that they will have sufficient 
time to meet their commitments to the Company; 
oversee the search process for suitably qualified 
Non-executive Directors as and when required, 
using outside advisers as the Nomination Committee 
may determine as appropriate; and arrange for 
all members of the Nomination Committee 
to meet the preferred candidate prior to making 
a formal recommendation to the Board.
The main activities of the Nomination Committee 
during the financial year ended 30 September 2011 
included the appointment of an external search firm 
culminating in the appointment of John Goddard 
and David Wilson to the Board as Non-executive 
Directors and considering the contribution 
and commitment of the Directors standing 
for re-election.
The number of meetings held during the financial 
year ended 30 September 2011 and the attendance 
record at these meetings is set out on page 34.
Communication with shareholders
The Company believes in having an open and 
regular dialogue with shareholders to ensure that 
the goals, objectives and overall business strategy 
of the Company are communicated and understood. 
The Board supports the use of the Company’s 
Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) as a means for 
communicating with shareholders and encourages 
their participation. 
The CEO and CFO make twice yearly presentations 
following the Company’s interim and preliminary 
results announcements. Hosting site visits and 
investor information days provides the investment 
community and shareholders with the opportunity 
to improve their understanding of the Company 
and its strategy.

Governance
Corporate governance continued
Communication with shareholders continued
During the year the Company issued interim 
management statements and pre-close trading 
statements relating to performance for a 
specified period of time and disclosed relevant 
business news through the regulatory news 
service. In accordance with the DTRs, the 
Company notifies the market of its total voting 
rights and issued share capital at the beginning 
of every month covering the previous month. 
Health and safety 
There were no health and safety enforcement 
actions at any of the Company’s locations during 
the year ended 30 September 2011. 
The Company’s policy regards the health, safety 
and welfare of all employees as a matter of prime 
importance and serves as the basis for the Company 
owing a duty of care under law and as a matter 
of best practice to protect its employees and 
others from harm arising from work activities. 
The Company has a written policy on health 
and safety which comprises the following elements: 
statement of the Company’s commitment to 
health and safety and detailing how safety will 
be managed; details of where responsibilities are 
allocated and how employees fit into the overall 
safety management system; and details of how 
specific activities and functions are managed. 
The last element includes risk assessments, fire 
safety, first aid, incident and accident reporting, 
electrical safety, work equipment, hazardous 
substances and manual handling. Information, 
instruction and training on health and safety 
are provided across the Company.
The Company’s global web-based system procured 
for Quality Management System applications 
has, over the last year, been expanded to also 
accommodate the Company’s health and safety 
policies and procedures. This system allows 
instant access to the Company’s internal policies 
and procedures by any employee of the Company. 
It is the Company’s intention to continue to expand 
the use of this global web-based system in other 
areas of health and safety applications.
The Company is compliant with medical device 
directive (2007/47/EC) with respect to ISO 13485 
and CE marking of its products. This is with 
particular reference to the requirement relating 
to risks associated with substances leaking from 
medical devices. The Company has declared that 
none of its devices contain di(2-ethylhexyl)
phthalate (“DEHP”) at levels equal to or greater 
than 0.1% by mass and that no raw materials 
containing or derived from bisphenol A (“BPA”) 
are in contact with the patient.
The Board has acknowledged and accepted its 
responsibility for health and safety across the 
Group. The CEO has overall responsibility for 
ensuring that line management is responsible for 
the day-to-day management of health and safety. 
The Board receives monthly updates and on a 
quarterly basis a detailed report on health and 
safety, which enables the Directors to closely 
assess safety and review the effectiveness of the 
health and policy throughout the financial year.
Environment
There was no environmental enforcement action 
at any of the Company’s locations during the 
financial year ended 30 September 2011.
The Company makes available to its customers 
medical retinal imaging devices that are designed 
to ensure at a very minimum that they comply 
with applicable laws, regulations and industry 
standards in each of the country markets in 
which it operates. These devices, by design, have 
a minimal impact on the environment. 
The Company engages in the continuous 
development of a range of packing materials that 
are suitable for multi-trip use. The Company is 
further rationalising and minimising the number 
of material movements both internally and 
externally by developing the US Distribution 
Service Centre as a manufacturing hub in addition 
to its repair capabilities. This is part of a six sigma 
lean strategy which is expected to deliver several 
benefits, including a positive environmental 
impact. This strategy will necessarily involve 
the supply chain.

Environment continued
Additionally, the Company’s newest desk-top 
retinal imaging device uses less packaging, 
less power and has simpler installation 
requirements, which together results in a 
greener environmental outcome.
The Company undertakes to recycle its paper, 
plastics, metal and personal computers and 
mobile telephones. Medical devices are no longer 
excluded from the RoSH directive as from 2014. 
The redesign of certain electronics to be “lead 
free” is well underway with suppliers validating 
these new processes. 
Under an approved producer compliance scheme, 
the Company is meeting the Waste Electrical 
Electronic Equipment (“WEEE”) Regulations.
Equal opportunities
The Company is an equal opportunities employer. 
This means that it is Company policy that no 
individual or group of individuals experiences 
discrimination, harassment or victimisation on 
any grounds. The Company upholds a policy of 
providing equal opportunities to all persons. This 
underpins and guides all aspects of employment, 
including recruitment and promotion, and provides 
encouragement to employees at all levels to act 
fairly and to prevent discrimination on any ground, 
including, but not limited to, age, sex, race, marital 
status, sexual orientation, religion or disability. 
Company policies for recruitment, training, 
career development and promotion of employees 
are open, fair and inclusive in their approach. 
The Company recognises the need to develop 
and regularly review employment policies and 
procedures to ensure that recruitment, training 
and development, promotion and compensation 
decisions are made on the basis of competency, 
performance, ability and potential. The Company 
seeks to facilitate a culture that enables employees 
to successfully balance professional and personal 
requirements and commitments. We believe 
that this helps recruit and retain skilled and 
motivated employees.
Corporate giving
The Company believes that building and 
maintaining vibrant, healthy communities 
is a shared responsibility and is committed 
to doing its part. Employees are encouraged 
to engage with and make a difference in the 
communities where they live and work and the 
Company supported employees and partnered 
with customers and organisations in a number 
of worthy causes and initiatives to give back 
and make that important difference. Many 
employees contributed independently of the 
Company to support their colleagues in their 
charitable endeavours. 
The Company continues to maintain an informal 
giving programme that provides modest financial 
support to encourage the community spirit of its 
employees. It is about looking for opportunities 
to empower and collaborate with employees 
and the community through charitable work, 
not-for-profits, professional organisations, schools 
and others. It is also about being proactive to 
promote and address issues that matter to 
stakeholders. The Company does not make 
donations to political parties or bodies.
Going concern
The Directors, having reviewed the Group’s 
budget for the next financial year and other 
longer-term plans, are satisfied that the Group 
has adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future and therefore 
it is appropriate to continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the accounts.

present suggestions and views, and through regular 
inter-departmental and management meetings, 
all of which are designed to allow for and encourage 
a free and cross-functional flow of information 
and ideas. Employees participate directly in the 
success of the Company through an individual 
and performance related bonus scheme and 
through a share award and option scheme.

Directors’ remuneration report
This Directors’ Remuneration Report (the “Report”) 
has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 
of the Accounting Regulations under the Companies 
Act 2006 (“2006 Act”), the Large and Medium-Sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
Regulations 2008 Schedule 8, Paragraph 4, 
the UK Corporate Governance Code (June 2010) 
(the “Code”) and the relevant requirements of the 
Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority. 
As required by the 2006 Act, a resolution 
to approve the Report will be proposed at the 
Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) of the Company 
being held on 21 February 2012. The vote on 
this resolution is, however, advisory and no 
aspect of an individual Director’s remuneration 
is conditional on the vote being passed. 
The 2006 Act further requires the auditors to 
report to the Company’s Members on certain 
parts of the Report and to state whether, in 
their opinion, those parts of the report have 
been properly prepared in accordance with 
the 2006 Act. Certain items in the Report are 
required to be audited and are identified as 
such against the relevant heading.
The role, composition and responsibilities of 
the Remuneration Committee (the “Committee”)
The Committee has responsibility for the Group’s 
overall remuneration philosophy, policies and 
procedures, which are determined with due 
regard to the interests of shareholders and the 
Company. The Company has specific responsibility 
for the policy of the remuneration of the Executive 
Directors, Company Secretary and the Operating 
Board (“OB”), which consists of the Company’s 
senior management. The Remuneration Committee 
extends consideration to several components 
in respect of the remuneration of the Executive 
Directors, Company Secretary and the OB, which 
together comprise the total remuneration package. 
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by 
Rosalyn S Wilton and its other members during 
the financial year ended 30 September 2011 
included Dr Peter J Fellner, Dr Peter H Kehoe 
(from 22 March 2011), Barry M Rose and 
David I Wilson (from 7 September 2011). 
The Company Secretary serves as secretary 
to the Committee. All members of the Committee 
are considered independent within the meaning 
of the Code. The Code states that the test of 
independence is inappropriate to the Chairman 
of the Board of Directors. Peter J Fellner was 
independent within the meaning of the Code 
on his appointment. The Board considers 
that the Chairman of the Board should be a 
member of the Remuneration Committee as it 
is essential that the Chairman be involved in 
the decision-making process relative to the 
remuneration of the Executive Directors.
The principal responsibilities of the 
Remuneration Committee are as follows: 
determine the remuneration policy for the 
Group; determine the policy and specific 
remuneration for the Executive Directors 
including, where applicable, their service 
contracts; determine whether the Executive 
Directors, Company Secretary and members 
of the Operating Board (“OB”), which comprises 
the Company’s senior management, should 
be eligible to receive annual bonuses and any 
benefits under the Deferred Bonus Plan (“DBP”), 
Performance Share Plan (“PSP”) or Share Option 
Plan (“SOP”); determine the performance 
conditions to be attached to annual bonus 
payments and any benefits awarded under 
the DBP, PSP or SOP; determine pensionable 
remuneration; and determine and recommend 
to the Board the remuneration of the Chairman.
Fees paid to Non-executive Directors are 
determined and approved by the Board. 
The remuneration of Non-executive Directors 
is determined by the Board as a whole. 
The members of the Remuneration Committee 
have no personal financial interest, other than 
as shareholders, in the matters to be decided, 
no actual or potential conflicts of interest arising 
from other directorships and no day-to-day 
operational responsibility within the Company.
Compensation philosophy
The Group’s compensation philosophy (the 
“philosophy”) serves as a high-level tool to help 
the Board and management align compensation 
related decisions back to strategy. The philosophy 
aims to: pay a market-competitive level of 
compensation; be sufficient to recruit, motivate 
and retain Executives of the calibre required; be 
structured such that an appropriate portion of the 
package links rewards to corporate and individual 
performance to drive a results-oriented culture; 
share financial success with all employees through 
incentive compensation programmes; ensure 
compensation achieves an appropriate balance 
between risk and reward; and be aligned to the 
enhancement of sustained shareholder value. 
In setting the remuneration of the Executive 
Directors and senior management, the Committee 
takes into account the economic environment 
and financial performance of the Group, together 
with the pay and employment conditions 
of employees elsewhere in the Group.
Executive Directors’ remuneration
During the financial year ended 30 September 2011, 
the Remuneration Committee consulted with 
Deloitte LLP on structuring and benchmarking 
the Executive Directors’ remuneration. 
Remuneration for the Executive Directors 
seeks to balance fixed remuneration and 
performance related awards, with the target 
of achieving stretch performance. With the 
adoption of a DBP on 23 February 2011, the 
remuneration split consists of four elements: 
fixed (base salary and benefits); short-term 
variable (annual bonus); deferred bonus and 
performance based matching awards; and 
long-term variable (share-based awards). 
Fixed comprises base salary and benefits in 
kind. Short-term variable is comprised of a 
non-deferred bonus amount. There is a mandatory 
minimum deferred amount. Long-term variable 
comprises of a matching award under the DBP 
and awards made under the PSP. 
_3_OPTS_ar11_middle_[Jenny.sh].indd   16 17/01/2012   11:07:26 Optos plc Annual report and accounts 2011 44
Base salary and benefits
Base salaries are based upon a combination of 
individual contribution and overall performance 
and in the light of competitive positioning as 
mentioned earlier. Base salaries are reviewed 
annually. When reviewing the salaries of the 
Executive Directors, the Committee also has 
regard to the impact of the cost of pension 
provision and pay and conditions elsewhere 
in the Group. In particular, the Committee takes 
account of the level of salary increases awarded 
to other employees in the Group when deciding 
on increases for the Executive Directors. Benefits 
in kind include private health insurance, life 
insurance and a contribution of 10% of gross 
basic annual salary to a defined contribution 
pension scheme.
The Committee has approved an increase in 
annual base salary of 5% to £320,250 for Roy Davis 
for the financial year beginning 1 October 2011. 
The Committee resolved that the annual base 
salary of the CFO would increase by 2.5% to 
£205,000 for the financial year beginning 
1 October 2011. The Committee determined that 
the increases for both the CEO and CFO reflect 
the scope and responsibilities associated with the 
roles. The increases are within the range of base 
salary increases for employees in the wider Group.
The Committee determined that the annual base 
salaries for the CEO and CFO are positioned 
within the market competitive range compared 
to companies of a similar size and complexity.
Annual bonus
The Company operates an annual bonus plan 
that is intended to place the total cash earnings 
of Executives at the median for the market upon 
the achievement of stretching performance 
objectives. The factors to be measured for bonus 
purposes and the corresponding levels of bonus 
are pre-determined at the beginning of each 
financial year in the light of the Company’s strategy. 
Achievement of stretch targets provided for a 
bonus opportunity equivalent to a maximum 100% 
of basic annual salary. The annual bonus provides 
a direct link between annual business performance 
and reward. The Committee considered and 
assessed the financial performance of the 
Company for the year ended 30 September 2011 
and resolved to award a bonus to both the CEO 
and CFO equivalent to 77.75% of their respective 
base salaries. The bonus award for the year was 
based on the Group achieving certain financial 
targets relating to revenue, operating profit and 
operating cash flow, adjusted to reflect exceptional 
items and to regularise the impact of accounting 
treatments for customer rental agreements.
With the implementation of the DBP, there is 
a 25% mandatory deferral of the bonus amount 
payable to the Executive Directors.
For the financial year ending 30 September 2012, 
the Executive Directors will have a maximum 
bonus opportunity equivalent to 100% of basic 
annual salary dependent upon the achievement 
of stretching financial performance targets. 
The Committee has resolved to employ metrics 
similar to those used in FY11 and has established 
a minimum, base and stretch targets relative to 
revenue, operating profit and operating cash flow.
Deferred Bonus Plan (“DBP”) and performance 
based matching awards
The DBP was approved by shareholders at 
the Company’s Annual General Meeting held 
on 23 February 2011. This plan is designed 
to encourage share ownership and to further 
support the delivery of the Group’s business 
strategy and commitment to generating long-term 
value for shareholders. For Executive Directors, 
the DBP provides for the deferral of up to a 
maximum 50% of annual bonus for three years,

Financial statements
Deferred Bonus Plan (“DBP”) and performance 
based matching awards continued
to be held in the form of shares in the Company 
and with an opportunity to earn a matching 
awards of shares, up to a maximum ratio of 
1:1, subject to the achievement of a further 
performance condition.
There will be a mandatory 25% deferral of 
the annual bonus being paid to the Executive 
Directors for the year ended 30 September 2011. 
This deferral will be into shares in the Company 
which must be held for three years. A further 25% 
of the annual bonus may be voluntarily deferred. 
In order to encourage share ownership for the 
Operating Board, which comprises the Company’s 
most senior management team, these Executives 
may be invited to defer up to 30% of their annual 
bonus into shares for a three-year period.
Any bonus deferred on a mandatory basis will 
be subject to a claw-back provision such that, 
at the discretion of the Committee, the deferred 
shares may be forfeited should it subsequently 
be confirmed that the original results on which 
the bonus was calculated contained a material 
misstatement of the Group’s financial results.
In order to more closely align remuneration 
with the longer-term success of the Company 
and growth in shareholder value, participants 
will be granted an opportunity to earn a matching 
award of shares. Matching shares will vest at 
the end of the three-year deferral period. For 
the initial grant under the DBP, matching awards 
will vest subject to a performance target based 
on relative Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”), 
compared to the FTSE Small Cap Index (exclusive 
of investment trusts). The Committee had 
determined that relative TSR is an appropriate 
performance condition in order to measure 
performance by reference to the external market, 
therefore strengthening the alignment of executive 
interests with those of shareholders.
Awards will vest on a pro rata basis between 
30% and 100% for performance between median 
and upper quartile and will be subject to the 
participant continuing to be employed by the 
Group at the end of the three-year deferral period.
Other share-based awards 
The Company operates two long-term incentive 
plans offering share-based awards, the PSP and the 
SOP. Both plans are supervised by the Committee. 
Executive Directors are eligible to participate 
in both the PSP and SOP. No awards were made 
to the Executive Directors under the SOP for 
the financial year ended 30 September 2011. 
Both Executive Directors received awards under 
the PSP for the same period, as detailed below.
A minor change to the operation of the PSP 
is proposed for 2010-11 to enable participants 
to benefit from UK tax efficiencies under the 
HM Revenue & Customs approved share schemes 
legislation. Awards made in 2010-11 will therefore 
be structured as Approved Performance Share Plan 
(“APSP”) Awards and comprise an HM Revenue & 
Customs approved option (in respect of the first 
£30,000 worth of an award) and a PSP award for 
amounts that exceed this limit. The number of 
shares that may be delivered under the PSP award 
will be adjusted at vesting/exercise to ensure that 
the total pre-tax value delivered to participants 
remains unchanged. The Company does not intend 
to make awards under both the PSP and SOP in 
the same grant period.

Performance Share Plan (“PSP”) 
Any Group employee, including the Executive 
Directors, is eligible to participate in the PSP, 
upon invitation and at the discretion of the 
Committee. An employee may not normally 
receive Awards in a financial year over shares 
having a market value in excess of 100% of his 
or her annual base salary in that financial year. 
Awards will normally vest on the third anniversary 
of the date of grant, to the extent that any 
performance conditions that may be attached 
to the award have been satisfied and provided 
that the participant is employed by the Company 
at the date of vesting. Awards granted under the 
PSP are always subject to performance conditions. 
The Committee may grant awards under the 
PSP as conditional shares, a nil (or nominal) 
cost option with a short exercise period or as 
forfeitable shares. The Committee may also 
decide to grant cash-based awards of an 
equivalent value to share-based awards or 
to satisfy share-based awards in cash.
Details of awards and associated performance 
conditions are detailed below:
Financial year ended 30 September 2009
Roy Davis received an award of 490,000 on

of grant was £0.4125. The award shall vest and 
be exercisable on 9 March 2012 to the extent 
that the following EPS targets are met.
The number of shares which vest upon achieving 
a result between the minimum and maximum 
targets for each measure will be determined 
on a straight-line basis. The Committee, having 
confirmed that the performance conditions have 
been satisfied, determined that 100% of the 
above-noted award shall vest on 9 March 2012.

50% of the awards are subject to meeting 
a cumulative EPS target and 50% is subject 
to meeting a cumulative cash flow target 
for the three-year financial period ending 
30 September 2012. To ensure that the 
performance criteria used to measure the 
awards is assessed on a fair and consistent 
basis between accounting periods, the Committee 
has determined that adjusted EPS will be defined 
as attributable profit before tax (adjusted to 
account for customer leases as operating rather 
than finance leases and exclude amortisation/
impairment of acquired intangibles or goodwill, 
any notional interest on deferred consideration 
and any other acquisition-related costs or credits). 
Adjusted cash flow will be defined as net cash flow 
from operations less amounts invested in building 
new medical devices plus receipts from finance 
lease receivables and excluding any notional 
interest on deferred consideration and any other 
acquisition-related costs or credits.

100% of the awards is subject to meeting 
cumulative operating cash flow figures 
for the three-year financial period ending 
30 September 2013. To ensure that the 
performance criteria used to measure the

has determined that adjusted cash flow will be 
defined as net cash flow from operations less 
amounts invested in building new medical devices

cumulative operating cash flow for the three 
financial years ending 30 September 2013 
reaches a specified figure, as set out above.

is subject to the Company delivering a level 
of EPS in each of the financial years that 
the Committee determines to be satisfactory, 
taking into account expectations for the 
performance of the Company known at the 
time when the Award was granted.

Other share incentive schemes
The Company has operated discretionary 
share option arrangements and other vesting 
arrangements which were put in place prior to 
the Company’s admission to the London Stock 
Exchange in 2006. Some of these arrangements 
were subject to performance conditions as 
summarised in Note 25 to the Financial Statements. 
Share Option Plan (“SOP”)
Any Group employee is eligible to participate 
in the SOP at the discretion of the Committee. 
Executive Directors and employees who participate 
in the PSP will not participate in the SOP at 
any same granting period. Awards may not be 
granted under the SOP more than ten years after 
shareholder approval of the SOP was obtained.
Performance Share Plan continued
Financial year ending 30 September 2012 
continued
The awards shall vest and be exercisable 
on 21 November 2014 to the extent that the 
cumulative operating cash flow for the three 
financial years ending 30 September 2014 
reaches a specified figure, as set out below.
The number of shares which vest upon achieving 
a result between the minimum and maximum 
targets for each measure will be determined 
on a straight-line basis.
The SOP comprises two parts: a plan approved 
by HM Revenue & Customs that provides for 
the Award of UK tax qualified options and an 
unapproved plan. This structure enables the 
Company to utilise certain UK tax benefits and 
retain the flexibility to provide, where necessary, 
options in excess of the limits imposed by UK tax 
legislation. It is also intended that the SOP will 
be able to provide US based employees with 
incentive stock options (“ISO”) so as to achieve 
certain tax efficiencies in the United States. 
An employee may not normally receive options 
under the SOP in any financial year over shares 
having a market value in excess of 50% of annual 
base salary in that financial year. The Committee, 
when granting options, will set the time or times 
at which options will become exercisable as well 
as any performance conditions to which the 
options are subject. 
The Committee normally intends that options 
under the SOP where the underlying shares have 
a market value at grant of less than £10,000 will 
not be subject to performance targets, however, 
the Committee retains the discretion to request 
performance conditions be attached to awards 
under the plan. Awards not subject to performance 
conditions will normally vest on the third 
anniversary of grant. 
This vesting schedule may be altered to reflect 
stock market conditions and practice in different 
jurisdictions. Options where the underlying shares 
have a market value in excess of £10,000, or in 
the discretion of the Committee such Awards 
with a market value of less than £10,000 on 
the date of grant will be subject to performance 
conditions which will normally based on the 
same targets as those applying to Awards made 
under the PSP in the same financial year.
Save-As-You-Earn (“SAYE”)
The Company has a shareholder approved SAYE 
scheme in place for UK-based employees. The 
first date of grant was 24 December 2010, with 
a contract saving start date of 1 February 2011. 
It is a three year subscription. The Committee 
resolved that the option price for this grant 
was £1.03, which represented the maximum 
allowable 20% discount under the plan rules. 
Eligible employees will have the opportunity to 
participate in this scheme in the financial year 
ending 30 September 2012. The Committee once 
again resolved to offer participants the maximum 
allowable discount.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”)
The Committee resolved at its meeting held on 
7 September 2011 to seek shareholder approval 
to implement an ESPP for US-based employees at 
the Company’s Annual General Meeting to be held 
on 21 February 2012. This incentive scheme 
mirrors the type and efficiencies of the SAYE 
scheme currently in place in the UK. Details of 
the proposed ESPP will be available in the 
Notice of Annual General Meeting.

Directors’ remuneration continued
The dates of the letters of appointment and their 
respective expiration dates for the Non-executive 
Directors who served during the year ended 
30 September 2010 are as follows:
Service agreements
The Company has entered into service agreements 
with its Executive Directors, none of which are 
for a fixed term. It is the Committee’s policy to 
offer service agreements for an indefinite term 
subject to termination, normally on a maximum 
of six months’ notice or an equivalent severance 
payment. The Company has the right, in its 
absolute discretion, to terminate the service 
agreements at any time by making a payment in 
lieu of the notice period comprising basic salary, 
bonuses (based upon the bonus paid during the 
previous financial year), benefits and pension 
contributions. There are no other provisions for 
early termination of the service agreements.
The Company entered into a service agreement 
with Roy Davis dated 17 November 2008 which 
provided that he received a basic annual salary 
of £275,000 (which is reviewed annually), 
a contribution of 10% of basic salary into a 
pension scheme of his choice and eligibility 
for a non-pensionable annual bonus target of 
up to 60% of his basic annualised salary, which 
can rise to a maximum potential bonus of 100% 
value of the annualised salary dependent upon 
certain performance related stretch conditions 
being met. The agreement and hence Roy Davis’ 
employment may be terminated by either party 
by giving not less than six months’ written notice 
and in the event of a change in control of the 
Company, he is entitled to receive a further 
six months’ notice from the Company. Roy Davis’ 
service agreement provides that, immediately 
preceding a change in control, all then-outstanding 
but unvested portions of the equity compensation 
in the form of awards for ordinary shares shall 
immediately become fully vested, subject to 
achievement of the targets set out in the service 
agreement and, at all times, the discretion of 
the Committee. 
The Company entered into a service agreement 
with Christine Soden dated 1 December 2009 
which provided that she receive a basic annual 
salary of £200,000 (which is reviewed annually),

out in the service agreement and, at all times,

Non-executive Directors
The Company’s policy is to establish and 
maintain a body of Non-executive Directors 
with a breadth of skills and experience that is 
appropriate to the Company’s size and business. 
In this context, it is the Board’s policy for the 
Non-executive Directors to be paid a level of fee 
that reflects market conditions and is sufficient 
to attract individuals with appropriate knowledge 
and experience. The Board seeks to pay the 
market rate to reflect the time taken to carry 
out the role of a Non-executive Director.
The Company has entered into a letter of 
appointment with each of its Non-executive 
Directors. Each letter of appointment is for a 
fixed three-year renewable term and includes 
a provision that either party may terminate the 
appointment at any time during the term of 
appointment by giving three months’ notice 
of termination. The appointment may also be 
terminated any time in accordance with the 
Articles of Association or as may be required 
under the law.

We have audited the Financial Statements of Optos plc for the year ended 30 September 2011 which comprise Consolidated Income Statement, the Group and 
Company Balance Sheets, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Group and Company Statements of Changes in Equity, the Group and Company 
Cash Flow Statements and the related notes 1 to 28. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International 
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the Parent Company Financial Statements, as applied in accordance with 
the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been 
undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the 
fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit 
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 42, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the Financial Statements 
and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the Financial Statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards 
for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the Financial Statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the Financial 
Statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate 
to the Group’s and the Parent Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting 
estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the Financial Statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the 
Annual Report and Accounts to identify material inconsistencies with the audited Financial Statements. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements 
or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion:
•	 the Financial Statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 30 September 2011 and of the Group’s 
profit for the year then ended;
•	 the Group Financial Statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; 
•	 the Parent Company Financial Statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and as applied in accordance 
with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
•	 the Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group Financial Statements, 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.

Share premium 
Share premium comprises the cumulative difference between the net proceeds and nominal value of the Company’s issued 
equity share capital. 
Foreign exchange reserve 
This reserve includes all cumulative differences on the translation of the Group’s net investment in foreign operations. Optos elected 
to deem the cumulative differences on the retranslation into US dollars of the Group’s net investment in foreign operations to 
be $nil as at 1 October 2004. As a result, in the event of any future disposal of a foreign operation, any gain or loss on disposal 
will include cumulative translation differences arising only on or after 1 October 2004.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
for the year ended 30 September 2011
1 Authorisation of financial statements and statements of compliance
The consolidated Financial Statements of Optos plc for the year ended 30 September 2011 were approved and authorised for issue by the Directors on 21 November 2011. 
Optos plc is a limited company incorporated in Scotland and is listed on the London Stock Exchange.
The consolidated Financial Statements of Optos plc have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union and applied in accordance with the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
2 Accounting policies
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to the 
years presented, unless otherwise stated.
i) Basis of preparation and accounting policies
a) Basis of preparation 
The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting policies based on IFRS and IFRIC interpretations endorsed by the European Union 
(“EU”) and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The consolidated Financial Statements are presented in US dollars as this is the Group and Company’s functional currency, and all values are rounded to the nearest 
one hundred thousand ($0.0m) except when otherwise indicated.
Having considered uncertainties under the current economic environment, and after making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company 
and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the Annual Report and Accounts. 
This conclusion has been reached having considered the effect of liquidity risk on the Group’s ability to operate effectively. Currently, liquidity risk is not considered 
a significant business risk to the Group given its level of cash, available debt facilities and cash flow projections. The key liquidity risks faced by the Group are considered 
to be the failure of banks where funds are deposited and the inability to secure additional debt finance in order to facilitate the expansion of the Group’s business or 
to introduce new or improved products.
As part of this review the Directors considered the current levels of available debt facilities, the structure of the debt finance being multiple asset-backed arrangements 
that are non-recourse on the Company, and the availability of other sources of debt capital including the $30m revolving credit facility. The Directors also considered 
the levels of future cash flows guaranteed under its rental customer agreements and the pattern of future debt repayments associated with current finance obligations.
Share-based payments previously shown in the income statement are now included within Administrative and other expenses as they are no longer considered to be 
exceptional. The amounts are disclosed in Note 5.
No Company profit and loss account is presented for Optos plc, as permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006.

2 Accounting policies continued
i) Basis of preparation and accounting policies continued
b) Basis of consolidation
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred, 
measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree. The choice of measurement of non-controlling interest, either 
at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets is determined on a transaction by transaction basis. Acquisition costs incurred are 
expensed and included in administrative expenses.
When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the 
contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date. This includes the separation of embedded derivatives in host contracts 
by the acquiree.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the 
contingent consideration which is deemed to be an asset or liability will be recognised in accordance with IAS 39 either in profit or loss or in other comprehensive 
income. If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it should not be remeasured until it is finally settled within equity.
Goodwill is initially measured at cost being the excess of the aggregate of the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised 
for the non-controlling interest (and where the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition-date fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity 
interest in the acquiree) over the net identifiable amounts of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed in exchange for the business combination. Assets acquired 
and liabilities assumed in transactions separate to the business combinations, such as the settlement of pre-existing relationships or post-acquisition remuneration 
arrangements are accounted for separately from the business combination in accordance with their nature and applicable IFRSs. Identifiable intangible assets, meeting 
either the contractual-legal or separability criterion, are recognised separately from goodwill. Contingent liabilities representing a present obligation are recognised 
if the acquisition-date fair value can be measured reliably.
If the aggregate of the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for the non-controlling interest (and where the business 
combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition-date fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree) is lower than the fair value of the 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities and the fair value of any pre-existing interest held in the business acquired, the difference is recognised in profit and loss.
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business 
combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units (or groups of cash-generating units) that are expected to benefit from 
the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units. Each unit or group of units to which goodwill is allocated 
shall represent the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes and not be larger than an operating segment 
before aggregation.
Where goodwill forms part of a cash-generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the operation disposed of 
is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation. Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured 
based on the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained.
Subsidiary undertakings are entities controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating 
policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing control, potential voting rights that presently are exercisable or convertible are taken into 
account. The financial statements of subsidiary undertakings are included in the consolidated Financial Statements from the date that control commences until the date 
that control ceases. The financial statements of the subsidiary undertakings are prepared for the same reporting year as the Parent Company, using consistent accounting 
policies. All intercompany balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from intra-group transactions, have been eliminated in full.
All intercompany balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from intra-group transactions, have been eliminated in full.

c) IFRS 8 “Operating Segments”
The Group has adopted IFRS 8 “Operating Segments”. The Group has two reportable segments, being North America and Rest of World markets. In assessing 
performance and making resource allocation decisions, the Operating Board (which is the Group’s chief operating decision-making body) and the Board review 
revenues and gross profits by segment. The Group derives all its revenues from rental agreements, service contracts, sales of devices under finance leases and 
outright sales of medical devices.
The business is managed on an integrated basis, with functions managed globally and decisions reached through cross-functional committees. In particular, Research 
and Development is actively targeted at new products and at enhancing the existing products for all markets. Manufacturing, marketing, sales, regulatory and support 
functions are managed and operate on a global basis and are not specific to individual markets or products.
d) Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are held at historical cost less any applicable provision for impairment.
e) Exceptional items
Material items of income and expense which, because of the nature and infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation to allow a better 
understanding of the elements of the Group’s financial performance for the prior year, are presented as exceptional items on the face of the income statement to 
facilitate comparisons with the current period and assessment of trends in financial performance.
f) Foreign currency translation
The consolidated Financial Statements are presented in US dollars, which is the Group’s functional and presentation currency. Each entity in the Group determines its own 
functional currency and items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency. Transactions in foreign currencies are 
initially recorded in the functional currency rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated 
at the functional currency rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. All differences are taken to profit or loss, with the exception of differences on foreign 
currency borrowings that provide a hedge against a net investment in a foreign entity. These are taken directly to equity until the disposal of the net investment, 
at which time they are recognised in profit or loss. Tax charges and credits attributable to exchange differences on those borrowings are also dealt with in equity. 
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions. 
Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined.
The functional currency of the foreign operations Optos Canada Inc., Optos GmbH and Optos Australia is the Canadian dollar, Euro and Australian dollar respectively. 
As at the reporting date, the assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated into the presentation currency of Optos plc (the US dollar) at the rate of exchange 
ruling at the balance sheet date and their income statements are translated at the weighted average exchange rates for the year. The exchange differences arising on 
the translation are taken directly to a separate component of equity. On disposal of a foreign entity, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in equity relating to 
that particular foreign operation is recognised in the income statement. The Company’s share capital and share premium account are denominated in Sterling and are 
translated at the historical rates of exchange.
Optos has elected to deem the cumulative differences on the retranslation into US dollars of the Group’s net investment in foreign operations to be $nil as at 
1 October 2004. As a result, in the event of a future disposal of a foreign operation, any gain or loss on disposal will only include cumulative translation differences 
arising on or after 1 October 2004.

g) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost of acquisition or manufacture, less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment in value. In the case of 
medical devices, certain of the costs of manufacture relate to the capitalisation of directly attributable internal labour costs. The employee costs and appropriate 
overheads associated with upgrading and installing the devices at the relevant customer site under operating leases are also capitalised. 
Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment at rates calculated to write off the cost less estimated residual values based on prices prevailing at the 
balance sheet date of each asset evenly over its expected useful life as follows:
Medical devices    three to five years
Leasehold improvements   lesser of ten years or period of the lease
Other plant and equipment  three to ten years
Medical devices refer to retinal examination equipment being used or expected to be used under operating lease rental agreements. Medical devices are depreciated 
from the point of activation at the relevant customer site. In the case of a device that is removed from one customer site, upgraded and relocated to a new customer 
site, depreciation is recalculated to write off the remaining net book value of that device together with the additional capitalised costs relating to the upgrade and 
installation over the remaining useful life of the asset.
Medical devices expected to be sold (outright or by way of finance lease) are held as inventory.
The carrying values of plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be 
recoverable. When an item of property, plant and equipment is sold after the end of its rental term, sale proceeds are recorded as revenue with the remaining net 
book value of the device or inventory carrying value recorded as cost of goods.
The assets’ residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each financial year end.
The Company launched its new 200Tx device in March 2011 and determined that these devices would have an expected useful life of four years if held as a fixed 
asset for use by the business or rental under operating lease contracts.

h) Leases
Group as a lessor
Arrangements between Optos and its customers are assessed on a case by case basis, taking into account the terms of the contract, the fair value and the estimated 
residual life of the underlying device. 
Finance leases
Arrangements between Optos and the customer where substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the asset have been transferred to the 
customer are classified as finance leases. The Group makes this assessment at the inception of the lease or at the date of contract extension, on the basis of one or 
more of the following factors:
•	 the lease transfers ownership of the equipment to the customer by the end of the lease term; 
•	 the customer has a right to buy the equipment either during the term of the lease or at the end of the lease at an advantageous price, and it is reasonable certain at 
the inception of the lease that this option will be exercised;
•	 the lease term covers the major part of the estimated useful life of the asset; or
•	 the present value of the minimum lease payments amounts to substantially all of the fair value of the asset. 
An amount equal to the fair value of the asset, or if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments is recognised as revenue in the income statement and 
as an asset in the statement of financial position. The fair value of service and maintenance is released to the income statement on a straight line basis over the lease 
term. Finance income is recognised on the basis of a constant monthly rate of return on the net investment in the finance lease which is equivalent to the incremental 
borrowing rate charged to the Group. The transaction is treated as a disposal and the carrying value of the device (either in plant property and equipment or inventories) 
recorded as a cost in the income statement in accordance with the policy for outright sales.
Operating leases
Arrangements between Optos and the customer where substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the asset have not been transferred to the 
customer are classified as operating leases. The Group makes this assessment based on the following factors:
•	 ownership of the asset does not transfer to the customer at the end of the lease term and there is no advantageous acquisition option for the customer at the end 
of the lease;
•	 the estimated useful life of the asset is considered to be five years which is significantly in excess of the lease term; and/or
•	 at the inception of the lease the present value of the minimum lease payments is significantly less than the fair value of the asset.
The majority of the Group’s contracts commit the customer to pay a fixed monthly sum (the “MMP”) plus a variable monthly sum should the usage of the device exceed 
the minimum agreed level (variable rental). These fixed rental payments from operating leases are recognised monthly in the income statement on a straight line basis 
over the lease term. Variable rentals are recognised monthly in line with actual usage of the device.

Group as a lessee
Finance leases
Assets held by the Group under finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item, are 
capitalised at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the item or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum future lease payments. Upon placement of 
medical devices at a customer site and where the customer enters into a fixed term contract to pay the Group fixed and variable amounts of revenue, the Group 
selectively enters into a financing agreement with third-party providers of debt finance. The debt finance provider advances the Group funds in return for taking 
the right to receive the fixed revenue streams and legal title to the device over the term of the finance arrangement. 
In such cases there is a transfer of legal title of the relevant device to the debt provider with legal title being transferred back to the Group at the end of the term of 
the debt. As the significant risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the Group, the finance received from the debt providers is recorded as fixed-rate obligations 
which are repayable by instalments and are secured over the related medical device. In such cases the medical devices are recorded as property, plant and equipment 
and the debt finance as finance leases payable. Lease payments payable under the medical device finance arrangements are apportioned between the finance charges 
and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability with the finance charges being charged directly 
against income over the lease term.
Leased assets are depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset or where there is no reasonable certainty that the Group will obtain ownership by the end 
of the lease term, over the lease term if shorter.
Operating leases
Leases where the lessor retains a significant portion of the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases and rentals payable are 
recognised in the income statement on a straight line basis over the lease term. 
i) Intangible assets
Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. With the exception of certain development costs internally 
generated intangible assets are not capitalised, and expenditure is charged against profits in the year in which the expenditure is incurred. Purchased intangible assets 
are capitalised at cost and amortised over the expected useful life of the asset. Intangible assets acquired as a result of a business combination are initially recognised 
at their fair value in accordance with IFRS 3 “Business combinations”. If an intangible asset is considered to have suffered impairment in value it is written down to its 
estimated recoverable amount in accordance with the Group’s policy on impairment.
Research and development costs
Research costs are expensed as incurred. Development expenditure incurred on an individual project is capitalised when the Group can demonstrate the technical 
feasibility of completing the project so that it will be available for use or sale, its intention to complete and its ability to use or sell the asset, how the asset will 
generate future economic benefits, the availability of resources to complete the asset and the ability to measure reliability the expenditure following development. 
Following the initial recognition of the development expenditure, the cost model is applied, requiring the asset to be carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation 
and accumulated impairment losses. Any expenditure carried forward is amortised over the benefits which are anticipated to accrue from the estimated commercial 
life of the asset from the point of full commercial launch, usually five years.
The carrying value of intangible assets is reviewed for impairment annually when the relevant asset is not yet in use or more frequently when an indication of 
impairment arises during the reporting year.
Computer software
Computer software that is not integral to an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised separately as an intangible asset whether acquired or developed 
internally. Amortisation is provided on a straight line basis so as to charge the cost of the software to the income statement over its expected useful life, which is 
in the range of three to five years.

j) Impairment of assets
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that the value of an asset may be impaired. If any such indication of impairment exists, 
or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of an asset or 
cash-generating unit is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell, and its value in use, and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate 
cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets or cash-generating units. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its 
recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are 
discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. 
Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in the income statement in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have 
diminished. If such indication exists, the recoverable amount is estimated. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in 
the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. If that is the case, the carrying amount of the asset 
is increased to its recoverable amount. That increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no 
impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognised in the income statement. After such a reversal, the depreciation charge 
is adjusted in future periods to allocate the asset’s revised carrying amount, less any residual value, on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life.
k) Inventories
Inventories primarily comprise finished goods, work-in-progress and spares and components all related to medical devices. Inventories are valued at the lower of 
cost and net realisable value, using the first-in, first-out or weighted average cost basis. Cost of raw materials, consumables and work in progress includes the cost of 
direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. 
Inventory is written down on a case by case basis if the anticipated net realisable value declines below the carrying amount of the inventories. Net realisable value 
is the estimated selling price less estimated cost to completion and selling expenses. When the reasons for a write down of the inventory have ceased to exist, the 
write down is reversed.
l) Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables, which generally have payment terms of 30–90 days, are recognised and carried at the original invoice amount less an allowance for any 
uncollectible amounts. Provision is made against the receivable when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect the debts. Balances 
are written off when the probability of recovery is assessed as being remote.
m) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and short-term deposits in the balance sheet comprise cash at banks and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
n) Interest bearing loans and borrowings
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received less directly attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition, 
interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

o) Taxation
Income tax
Current tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities.
The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax is recognised for all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the Financial 
Statements, with the following exceptions:
•	 where the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, 
at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and
•	 in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be 
controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, only to the extent that 
it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry-forward of unused tax credits and unused tax 
losses can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient 
taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each 
balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised 
or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the income statement. Otherwise, income tax is recognised in the 
income statement.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the 
deferred taxes are related to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.
Sales tax
Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of sales tax or equivalent, except:
•	 where the sales tax incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case, the sales tax is recognised as part 
of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item as applicable; and
•	 in the balance sheet where receivables and payables are stated with the amount of sales tax included.
The net amount of sales tax recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authorities is included as part of receivables or payables in the balance sheet.

p) Share-based payment transactions
Certain employees (including senior Executives) of the Group receive remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render 
services as consideration for equity instruments (“equity-settled transactions”).
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted and is recognised as an 
expense over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award. In valuing equity-settled transactions, 
no account is taken of any performance conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of the Company (“market conditions”), if applicable.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting 
irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding movement in equity, over the period in which the performance and/or service 
conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award (“the vesting date”). The cumulative expense recognised 
for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Group’s best estimate 
of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The income statement charge or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense 
recognised as at the beginning and end of that period.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, or a new award is designated as replacing a cancelled or settled award, the cost based on the original award 
terms continues to be recognised over the original vesting period. In addition, an expense is recognised over the remainder of the new vesting period for the incremental 
fair value of any modification, based on the difference between the fair value of the original award and the fair value of the modified award, both as measured on the 
date of modification. No reduction is recognised if this difference is negative. 
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any cost not yet recognised in the income statement for 
the award is expensed immediately. Any compensation paid up to the fair value of the award at the cancellation or settlement date is deducted from equity, with any 
excess over fair value being treated as an expense in the income statement.
The Group took advantage of the transitional provisions of IFRS 2 in respect of equity-settled awards and applied IFRS 2 only to equity-settled awards granted after 
7 November 2002 that had not vested on 1 January 2005. Where share options lapse as a result of the Company terminating the employment of an individual it is 
accounted for as a forfeiture of the option.
q) Revenue and lease income recognition
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue is 
measured at the fair value of the consideration received excluding discounts, rebates, VAT and other sales tax or duties. The following specific recognition criteria 
must also be met before revenue is recognised:
Rental income under operating leases
Revenue from the provision of retinal examinations using the Group’s medical devices is recognised according to the classification of the rental agreement as an 
operating lease. Such examinations are undertaken by customers who generally enter into agreements under which they pay a fixed monthly rental plus a variable 
monthly sum should the usage of the device exceed the minimum agreed level.
These fixed monthly rental payments from agreements which have been classified as operating leases are recognised monthly on a straight line basis to the income 
statement over the lease term. The variable rentals are recognised monthly in line with actual usage of the device.

Device sales under finance leases
Revenue from the sale of devices which have been classified as finance leases is recognised as an amount equal to the fair value of the asset, or if lower, the present 
value of the minimum leased payments. Variable rentals are recognised to revenue each month to the extent that they cannot be reliably estimated.
Device sales – outright
Revenue from the sale of devices is recognised in the income statement when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer, 
usually on dispatch or installation at the customer’s site, or where relevant, at the end of any validation period.
Service warranty and maintenance contracts
Revenue from the sale of service and maintenance contracts is recognised on straight line basis over the term of the contract.
Finance income
Finance income is recognised on the basis of a constant monthly rate of return on the net investment in the relevant finance lease.
Interest income
Revenue is recognised as interest accrues on cash deposits or loan arrangements. 
r) Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense when incurred.
s) Government grants
Government grants are recognised where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and all attaching conditions will be complied with.
When the grant relates to an expense item, it is recognised as income over the period necessary to match the grant on a systematic basis to the costs that it is intended 
to compensate. Where the grant relates to an asset, the fair value is credited to a deferred income account and is released to the income statement over the expected 
useful life of the relevant assets.
t) Post-employment benefits
Post-employment benefits comprise pension healthcare benefits provided to employees throughout the world.
The Group operates a number of defined contribution pension schemes. The assets of the schemes are invested and managed independently of the finances of the 
relevant company. The contributions are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they become payable.
u) Derecognition of financial liabilities
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.

v) Significant judgements made
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, the Board and management have made the following judgements, apart from those involving estimations 
which have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the Financial Statements:
Medical device financing arrangements
Upon placement of medical devices at a customer site, where the customer enters into a fixed-term contract to pay the Group fixed and variable amounts of revenue, 
the Group frequently enters into a financing agreement with third-party providers of debt finance. 
The Group considers the arrangement between the vendor finance provider and Optos to be a finance lease (as opposed to an operating lease) as defined in IAS 17 
because ownership of the asset reverts to Optos at the end of the finance arrangement for nil consideration.
The debt finance provider advances the Group funds in return for taking the right to receive the fixed revenue streams and legal title to the device over the term of 
the finance arrangement.
As the significant risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the Group, the proceeds received from the third-party providers of debt finance are recorded as 
fixed-rate obligations which are repayable by instalments. In such cases the medical devices are recorded as property, plant and equipment and the debt finance as 
finance leases. 
Group as a lessor and rental income
Revenue from the provision of retinal examinations using the Group’s medical devices is recognised according to the classification of the rental agreement as either 
an operating or finance lease. The Group considers the arrangements between Optos and its customers on a case by case basis, taking into account the terms of the 
contract, the fair value and the estimated residual life of the underlying device set out in Note 2(h) above on leasing. 
Revenue from rental agreements which have been classified as finance leases is recognised as an amount equal to the fair value of the asset, or if lower, the present 
value of the minimum leased payments. Variable rentals are recognised to revenue each month to the extent that they have not been previously reliably estimated 
and recognised.
These rental payments from agreements which have been classified as operating leases is recognised monthly in the income statement on a straight line basis to the 
income statement over the lease term.
Development costs
The Group amortises its capitalised development costs over the anticipated benefits expected to accrue in the first five years of operations of the device or 
technology. Management assesses the appropriateness of the period taking into account latest market expectations. Further details are included in Note 11.
Impairment of assets
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that the value of an asset may be impaired. If any such indication of impairment exists, 
or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of an asset or 
cash-generating unit is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell, and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset unless the asset does not generate 
cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets or cash-generating units. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its 
recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are 
discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. 
Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in the income statement in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have 
diminished. If such indication exists, the recoverable amount is estimated. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in 
the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. If that is the case, the carrying amount of the asset 
is increased to its recoverable amount. That increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no 
impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognised in the income statement. After such a reversal, the depreciation charge 
is adjusted in future periods to allocate the asset’s revised carrying amount, less any residual value, on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life.

w) Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a significant risk of causing a material 
adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below:
Useful lives of medical devices
The Group depreciates medical devices over their estimated useful lives. The Board and management annually assess the appropriateness of the current estimate of 
useful life.
Share-based payments
The assumptions underlying the calculation of the share-based payments expenses are based on independent advice. Certain awards under the Group’s long-term 
incentive plans are subject to the satisfaction of non-market related performance conditions. These conditions are based on future business performance and the 
Group makes estimates of the likelihood of these conditions being met. Changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on the measurement of the 
Group’s share-based payment charge. Further details are included in Note 23.
Deferred tax
The Group has gross unused tax losses. These losses are recognised under IAS 12 as deferred tax assets. The Group makes judgements as to the likelihood of these 
losses being recoverable, and changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on the Group’s reported tax charge. Further details are included in Note 8.

2 Accounting policies continued 
ii) Changes in estimates
In light of the developments outlined in the Business Review, relating to the launch of the next generation Daytona device in March 2011, the Directors revised their 
estimate of the expected useful economic lives of the P200, 200Dx and P200C medical devices, to end no later than 30 September 2014.
This has had the following consequences:
(i)  As typical lease terms will be for the major part of the remaining useful economic life of the asset, even if title is not ultimately transferred, the vast majority 
of new and renewed lease arrangements with customers will fall to be classified as finance leases under IAS 17 (the reporting standard for leases), and accounted 
for accordingly. This will accelerate the reduction in the proportion of future revenues expected to be derived from operating leases.
(ii)  The expectation that these devices will now be sold (either outright or by way of finance lease) rather than used by the Group under operating leases required 
their reclassification in the balance sheet from property, plant and equipment to inventory. Accordingly a transfer has been made of $10.2m being the lower of the 
previous carrying amount of the devices and related modules and their net realisable value. 
The impact of these changes was a reduction in the depreciation charge of $0.8m for the year ended 30 September 2011. In addition revenue increased by $11.2m 
and cost of sales by $4.2m in the year as a result of devices falling to be classified as finance leases that would previously have fallen to be classified as operating 
leases had the estimate not changed.
Looking forward, it is difficult to reliably estimate the impact on future accounting periods, since the impact is governed by the actual volumes and terms of new 
rental agreements, renewal agreements and the product mix, none of which are known. However, the expectation will be for increased revenues, cost of sales and 
gross profits from finance lease transactions, an increase in revenues from service contracts and a reduction in revenues from operating leases. There will be a 
consequential increase in finance lease receivables and a reduction in the future amounts receivable under operating lease. There will also be an increase in 
cash flows in building inventory and a reduction in the investment in plant, property and equipment. 
3 Segmental analysis
The Group has two reportable segments, being North America and Rest of World markets. In assessing performance and making resource allocation decisions, 
the Operating Board (which is the Group’s chief operating decision-making body) and the Board review revenues and gross profits by segment. 
Optos sells a range of diagnostic and treatment devices to healthcare professionals globally, either directly or through arrangements with distributors. Cash flow is 
generated through the rental or sale of devices and related software and support services. 
The business is managed on an integrated basis, with functions managed globally and decisions reached through cross-functional committees. In particular, Research 
and Development is actively targeted at new products and at enhancing the existing product for all markets. Manufacturing, marketing, sales, regulatory and support 
functions are managed and operate on a global basis and are not specific to individual markets or products.
Transfer prices between segments are set in accordance with the Group’s transfer pricing policy. Segment revenue, segment expense and segment result include 
transfers between geographical segments. Those transfers are eliminated on consolidation.

The Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Opto Global Holdings Pty Ltd on 13 December for $14.3m. The purchase consideration included an estimated 
$2.5m relating to the fair value of contingent consideration. The expectation is that the conditions relating to the contingent consideration will no longer be met 
in full. This is due to lower than expected sales primarily the result of delays in the integration of the products/distributors, as well as the time taken to obtain 
regulatory approval. As a consequence the fair value of contingent consideration has been reassessed as $0.8m, compared to $2.5m at the acquisition date.
The Group incurred acquisition costs of $1.1m for OptoGlobal which included $0.5m of one-off retention payments, the balance being professional fees. In addition 
the Group has incurred to date $1.3m of professional fees in relation to the acquisition of the assets and business of the instrumentation division of OPKO Health, Inc. 
which completed in October 2011.

plus $15.3m (2010: $19.6m) from the variable per Optomap® revenue for tests performed over the monthly minimum levels.
Revenue from the sales of devices classified as finance leases is the lower of an amount equal to the fair value of the asset or the present value of the minimum 
leased payments from rental contracts where the rental agreement has been assessed as a finance lease.
Service and warranty contracts relates to revenues from contracts to maintain and service the Company’s devices.

The deferred tax movement results from the annual review of deferred tax asset recognition, the conclusion of which is that it is appropriate, based on projected 
future profitability in each of the relevant territories, to recognise all deferred tax assets with the exception of tax losses incurred in Australia by the Opto Global 
business. These assets will be recovered when future tax charges are sufficient to absorb these tax benefits.
The movement in the net deferred tax asset between 2010 and 2011 comprises the recognition of a $1.8m deferred tax liability in relation to intellectual property 
acquired with Opto Global as well as the $0.3m credit to the income statement and $0.5m credit to other comprehensive income.
Company
All deferred tax assets at 30 September 2011 have been recognised based on projected future profitability. These assets will be recovered when future tax charges are 
sufficient to absorb these tax benefits. Deferred tax assets totalling $4.9m were not recognised at 30 September 2010 due to uncertainty regarding future recoverability.

8 Taxation continued
Tax losses
Deferred tax assets have been recognised in 2011 in respect of historic tax losses incurred in the UK, US, Canada and Germany as there is sufficient evidence in the 
form of projected future profitability to conclude that these losses will be recoverable in the foreseeable future. A deferred tax asset of $1.8m (2010: $nil), relating 
to unused tax losses in Australia, has not been recognised as there is insufficient certainty in relation to the recoverability of the asset. 
Impact of future tax rate changes
The Chancellor has announced that the main UK corporation tax rate will be reduced from the current rate of 26%, which has applied from 1 April 2011, to 23%, via 
a series of 1% annual reductions. The reduction in the corporation tax rate to 25% from 1 April 2012 was enacted on 19 July 2011. As this rate was enacted at the 
balance sheet date, and reduces the tax rate expected to apply when temporary differences reverse, it had the effect of reducing the UK deferred tax asset by $0.6m. 
The further rate reductions are to be incorporated within future legislative acts and so will not be substantively enacted until later periods. It is expected that the 
deferred tax balance should not be materially impacted by these proposed reductions in the corporation tax rate. 
9 Profit per ordinary share
Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the profit/(loss) before taxation and the profit after taxation for the financial year by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the profit before taxation and the profit/(loss) after taxation for the financial year by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year (adjusted for the effects of dilutive options). In the case of a loss, no impact for further dilution is 
reflected as this would not have the effect of increasing the loss per share and is therefore not dilutive.
The profit per ordinary share is calculated as follows:
        2011  2010
Weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue       71,057,274 69,979,015
Effect of dilution: share options       593,191 90,218

Medical devices refer to retinal examination equipment being used or expected to be used under operating lease agreements. Medical devices are depreciated from 
the point of activation at the relevant customer site. In the case of a device that is removed from one customer site, upgraded and relocated to a new customer site, 
depreciation is recalculated to write off the remaining net book value of that device together with the additional capitalised costs relating to the upgrade and installation 
over the remaining useful economic life of the asset. 
The Group has reviewed the economic useful lives of all assets and has determined that certain elements of medical devices (for example installation costs, computer 
and other peripherals) have a useful economic life of between three and five years depending on the specific circumstances of the assets, including the period over 
which the medical device is expected to be maintained at a particular customer site.

These peripheral components do not have a cost that is significant in relation to the total cost of the device and the medical device itself is still considered to have 
a useful economic life of between three and five years.
The carrying value of plant and equipment and medical devices held subject to finance leases at 30 September 2011 was $13.7m (2010: $23.9m) for the Group 
and $nil (2010: $nil) for the Company. Legal title to the leased assets transfers to the debt provider as security for the term of the agreement.

On 13 December 2010, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Opto Global Holdings Pty Limited for $14.3m. At that date, the fair value of the net assets and 
liabilities in Opto Global equaled $3.8m and consequently there is goodwill of $10.5m. The Group therefore has goodwill on its balance sheet at the reporting date for 
first time and so is required to test that goodwill for impairment.
The goodwill, acquired through business combination, has been allocated to the groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the 
acquisition. Optos has defined two cash-generating units which are equivalent to the two operating segments, North America and the Rest of the World. The goodwill 
has been allocated $3m to North America and $7.5m to the Rest of the World based on the expected benefits that will arise from the acquisition.

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is reviewed at the operating segment level. In assessing whether goodwill has been impaired, the carrying value 
of the operating segment (including goodwill) is compared with the recoverable amount of the operating segment. The recoverable amount is based on value in use 
using discounted risk-adjusted projections of the Group’s pre-tax cash flows based on the future projections in line with the overall strategy. The projection is based 
on forward plans for the next five years with a perpetual 1% increase for future years on the basis the business expects to continue to trade. These projections are 
approved by senior management.
For each operating segment we use an appropriate discount rate reflecting those risks and tax effects. In arriving at the appropriate discount rate for each group 
of cash flows, we adjust the Group’s post-tax weighted average cost of capital of 8% to reflect the impact of relevant risks, the time value of money and tax effects. 
The weighted average pre-tax discount rate used was between 11% and 12%. 
As a further check, we compare our market capitalisation to the book value of our net assets and this indicates significant surplus at 30 September 2011.
No goodwill impairment was identified.
The Group has also performed sensitivity analysis calculations on the projections. The Directors have concluded that, given the significant headroom that exists and 
the results of the sensitivity analysis performed, there is no significant risk that reasonable changes in any key assumptions would cause the carrying value of goodwill 
to exceed its value in use.

effective interest rate in relation to finance leases is 5.9% (Company: 7%).
All finance lease receivables are considered to be recoverable and therefore no provision for impairment is required. The fair value of finance lease receivables is 
considered not to be materially different to the carrying value in the balance sheet.

Social security contributions on share options are considered to fall within the scope of IFRS 2 and are measured as though a cash-settled option under IFRS 2. 
The provision is calculated based on the options outstanding at the balance sheet date that are expected to be exercised and relate to the expired portion of the 
vesting period and using the fair value of the options at the balance sheet date. It is expected that the costs will be incurred during the exercise period to May 2020.

Optos’ policy for the year ended 30 September 2011, for all suppliers, was to fix terms of payment when agreeing the terms of the credit account, to ensure that the 
supplier was aware of the terms, and to abide by the agreed terms of payment. Trade payables are typically paid twice monthly with terms equivalent to an average 
of 35 days.
Other payables are non-interest bearing and have an average term of between 30 and 60 days.
Deferred income represents prepaid service contracts and other items where delivery of the underlying product or service has yet to be delivered.

The Group entered into five commercial leases on property commencing August 1999, December 2005, May 2006, October 2007 and June 2010. The lease entered 
into on 12 August 1999 is for a period of twenty years, the December 2005 lease for ten years, the May 2006 lease for five years, the October 2007 lease for 
ten years and the June 2010 lease for three years. There are no renewal options or escalation costs included within the contracts. There are no restrictions placed 
upon the lessee by entering into these leases. The May 2006 lease has been renewed until May 2014.
22 Business combinations
On 13 December 2010, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Opto Global Holdings Pty Limited for $14.3m. At that date, the fair value of the net assets 
and liabilities in Opto Global equalled $3.8m and consequently there is goodwill of $10.5m.
Opto Global Holdings Pty Limited has headquarters in Australia. The company sources and sells precision optometric and ophthalmic equipment with markets 
primarily in the Middle and Far East as well as Africa and South America. The acquisition enhances the Optos product range as well as offering the opportunity 
to launch the sale of Optos products through key Opto Global distributors.
The acquired business contributed revenues of $3.8m and a net loss before taxation of $1.7m to the Group for the period from 13 December 2010 to 30 September 2011. 
This included one off retention payments to Opto Global employees of $0.5m and a charge of $0.6m for amortisation of the intangible assets acquired with the business. 
If the acquisition had occurred on 1 October 2010, Group revenue would have been $144.0m and profit before taxation would have been $20.6m. This includes 
additional foreign exchange losses of $0.5m and amounts written off in relation to trademarks of $0.5m and inventory of $0.3m prior to acquisition but after 
1 October 2010. These amounts have been calculated using the Group’s accounting policies. Costs of $1.1m directly attributable to the acquisition have been 
expensed in the income statement and included within exceptional items.
Details of net assets acquired and goodwill are as follows:
Purchase consideration:         $m
Cash paid         10.8
Fair value of shares issued (434,487 shares at $2.22)        1.0
Fair value of contingent cash         2.5
Total purchase consideration         14.3
The goodwill is attributable to the acquired customer base, synergies and economies expected from the acquisition of Opto Global Holdings Pty Limited.

As part of the sales and purchase agreement, a contingent consideration up to a maximum of $3m is due to the previous owners of Opto Global in the event that 
the business generates sales of at least $5m over the twelve-month period to 28 February 2012 from underlying operations and having met that hurdle, the business 
generates revenues of up to $9m from synergies. The expectation is that the conditions relating to the contingent consideration will no longer be met in full. This 
is due to lower than expected sales, primarily the result of delays in the integration of the products/distributors, as well as the time taken to obtain regulatory 
approval. As a consequence the fair value of contingent consideration has been reassessed as $0.8m, compared to $2.5m at the acquisition date.
The fair value of the shares issued was based on the published share price on 13 December 2010.

23 Capital commitments
In the normal course of business of agreeing contractual relationships with customers, the Group is committed to incurring around $1.3m of costs in the year to 
30 September 2011 (2010: $1.2m). These costs will enhance the value of the device and will be capitalised into property, plant and equipment when incurred.

25 Share-based payments
The Company has operated discretionary share option arrangements both pre and post its admission to the main market of the London Stock Exchange in February 2006 (“IPO”).
Option movements during year
The charge recognised from equity-settled, share-based payment transactions for employee services received during the year ended 30 September 2011 is $0.9m 
(2010: $0.5m) with an additional charge of $0.3m (2010: $0.1m) in respect of National Insurance.
Option terms
Pre-IPO discretionary options that remain outstanding vested over the three years commencing on the date on which the option was granted. One third of the options 
vested on grant and the remaining two-thirds vested over the following 36 months on a monthly basis.
A further vesting arrangement was utilised in respect of two separate grants. The first grant is subject to time-based vesting with one-third of the option vesting on 
the first, second and third anniversaries of the date of grant.
All pre-IPO option agreements contain provisions for the full acceleration of the option on a change in the control of the Company. Option holders who cease to be 
employees of the Group are entitled to exercise their vested options in full for a period of either one month or six months following cessation of employment, 
depending on the reasons for that cessation.
All option agreements contain provisions enabling the adjustment of the number of shares subject to option and the exercise price in the event of capitalisation issue, 
subdivision or consolidation of ordinary shares. All options are to be settled by way of equity with a maximum term of ten years from the date of grant.
Post-IPO, three new share plans were introduced. Details of these plans are as follows:
The Optos Performance Share Plan 2007
A performance share plan supervised by the Remuneration Committee, which grants awards of conditional shares, a nil (or nominal) cost option with a short exercise 
period or as forfeitable shares. Awards will normally vest on the third anniversary of grant (other than in exceptional circumstances) to the extent that applicable 
performance conditions have been met. All awards are subject to performance conditions set by the Committee and measured over a single three-year period. 
Awards are required to be exercised with six months of vesting. All awards normally lapse upon leaving employment, however under certain circumstances such 
as death, disability, illness, or the sale or transfer of a participant’s employing company, then the award will normally vest, subject to satisfaction of performance 
conditions and a pro rata basis for time between the grant and end of three-year period, as determined by the Remuneration Committee. In the event of a takeover 
or scheme of arrangement of winding up of the Company, all awards will vest early to the extent that the performance conditions have, or would have, in the 
opinion of the Remuneration Committee, been satisfied. Awards will then be subject to pro rata for time between the grant and three-year period, as determined 
by the Remuneration Committee unless it decides it is inappropriate to do so in the circumstances.

The Optos Share Option Plan 2007
An option plan supervised by the Remuneration Committee, structured to comprise elements approved by HM Revenue and Customs, so as to provide UK tax qualified 
options, as well as elements not so approved. The plan also provides US employees with incentive stock options so as to achieve tax efficiencies in the US. Grants 
awards are made at an exercise price which is not less than the market value of the Company’s ordinary shares on or around the time of grant. Awards will normally 
vest of the third anniversary of grant (other than in exceptional circumstances) to the extent that applicable performance conditions have been met. Any award can 
be subject to performance conditions set by the Committee and measured over a single three-year period.
Awards are required to be exercised within ten years of grant. All awards normally lapse upon leaving employment, however under certain circumstances such 
as death, disability, illness, or the sale or transfer of a participant’s employing company, then the award will normally vest, subject to satisfaction of performance 
conditions where appropriate and a pro rata basis for time between the grant and end of three-year period, as determined by the Remuneration Committee. In 
the event of a takeover or scheme of arrangement of winding up of the Company, all awards will vest early to the extent that the performance conditions where 
appropriate have, or would have, in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee been satisfied. Awards will then be subject to pro rata for time between the grant 
and three year period, as determined by the Remuneration Committee unless it decides it is inappropriate to do so in the circumstances.

The expected life of the options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur. The expected volatility reflects 
the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may also not necessarily be the actual outcome. As the Company has only a limited 
history of quoted share price volatility, the expected volatility has been based on the historical volatility of comparative companies. No other features of options 
granted were incorporated into the measurement of fair value.

27 Financial instruments: disclosures
The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise cash and finance leases.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to manage the Group’s funding and liquidity requirements. The Group has other financial instruments, such as trade 
receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations. The principal financial risks to which the Group is exposed are those relating to foreign currency, 
credit, liquidity and interest rate.
Foreign currency risk
The Group has invested in overseas operations and also buys and sells goods and services in currencies other than in the functional currency of its relevant 
operations. As a result, the Group’s non-US dollar revenues, profits, assets, liabilities and cash flows can be affected by movements in exchange rates.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the Sterling against the US dollar and the Euro against the US dollar exchange 
rates with all other variables held constant of the Group’s profit before tax due to fair value of monetary assets and liabilities. An increase in currency rate is defined 
as a strengthening of Sterling and Euro versus the US dollar.

2010    
Sterling versus US dollar     +10% (2.4) –10% 2.4
Euro versus US dollar     +10% — –10% —
The Group monitors its non-US dollar foreign currency exposure and, when deemed necessary by the Board, seeks to minimise its transaction exposure by using 
forward foreign currency contracts to eliminate exposures on any committed significant transactions. The Board has determined that it was not necessary to use 
forward foreign currency contracts in 2011. It is Group policy not to engage in any speculative forward exchange transactions of any kind. The Group does not 
currently hedge currency exposure in its net investment on overseas operations. 
Credit risk
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the funds are deposited over a number of counterparties who are banks with a mix of high quality balance sheets, high 
credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies or strong governmental support. The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The Group is exposed to risk over a large number of customers and there is no significant concentration of risk. Creditworthiness checks are undertaken before entering 
into contracts with new customers. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowance for doubtful receivables. An allowance for impairment is made 
where there is an identifiable loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of cash flows.

The fair value of items has been calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates. The carrying amounts of all other financial 
instruments of the Group, i.e. short-term trade receivables and payables that are not included in the above table, are a reasonable approximation of fair value. 
The carrying amount recorded in the balance sheet of each financial asset represents the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk.
The average length remaining on the finance lease obligations has reduced to 16 months. It has therefore been deemed that the carrying value is in line with the fair value.
The weighted average effective interest rate on cash balances for 2011 was 0.1% (2010: 0.1%).

Interest rate risk
Interest on financial instruments classified as fixed rate is fixed until the maturity of the instrument. Interest on financial instruments classified as floating rate is 
repriced at intervals of less than one year. The other financial instruments of the Group that are not included in the above tables are non-interest bearing and are 
therefore not subject to interest rate risk.
All of the Group’s borrowings are at fixed rates of interest. Excess cash is placed on short-term interest-bearing deposit accounts.
Based on current levels of net debt, interest rate risk is not considered to be material. 
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Group’s profit before 
tax (through the impact on floating rate deposits). There is no impact on the Group’s equity.

Liquidity risk
The Group aims to mitigate its liquidity risk by managing its cash resources and improving its credit rating to facilitate effective fund raising. The Group’s funding 
objective is to maintain continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of internally generated funds and finance leases, which it uses to fund the expansion 
of its business operations. During the year ended 30 September 2011, the Group continued to have access to sufficient funds to meet its business expansion needs. 
Excess cash is placed on short-term interest-bearing deposit accounts.

Capital management
The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to ensure that it maintains access to sufficient capital to continue to grow its business. The Group’s capital 
comprises equity attributable to equity holders, vendor financing and bank short-term deposits. The Group’s principal business model, of placing medical devices with 
customers on a rental basis, requires it to access capital to fund purchases of new medical devices which are included as property, plant and equipment on the Group’s 
balance sheet. The Group has, however, also increased the proportion of direct capital sales made to customers.
In addition to debt finance, the Group maintains cash at bank and on short-term deposits, where it seeks to optimise the rates of interest received. Cash deposits 
are managed in parallel with levels of debt financing in order to provide sufficient levels of liquidity to settle its ongoing requirements for creditor payments. 
The Group tracks and manages its levels of net debt. No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during the years ended 30 September 2010 
and 30 September 2011.

The Group entered into a facility agreement with Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets in respect of the provision of bilateral multi-currency revolving credit facilities of up 
to US$30 million. This facility is to be used to fund the acquisition of OPKO instrumentation division and for general working capital purposes. As at the year end this 
facility had not been enacted.

28 Post-balance sheet event
On 11 October 2011 the Group announced that following the approval of the transaction by its shareholders and satisfaction of all outstanding conditions, the 
acquisition of the assets and business of the instrumentation division of OPKO Health, Inc. completed. 
OPKO Instrumentation is engaged in the development, manufacture and sale of optical coherence tomography (“OCT”) diagnostic devices and optical ultrasound scanners, 
each used by the ophthalmic profession in the diagnosis and management of eye disease and conditions. Optos’ widefield retinal imaging technology, combined with 
the specific data that can be derived from OCT images, has the potential to offer ophthalmologists and optometrists the most powerful tools for disease diagnosis and 
management and strengthens Optos’ offering into optometry. The acquisition brings access to established OCT and ultrasound products together with a product pipeline 
including a lower-cost OCT product. Significant opportunities exist to accelerate sales through Optos’ direct sales force and to derive selling, marketing and operational 
synergies from combining Optos’ business with OPKO Instrumentation.
The consideration for the purchase included an initial cash consideration of US$17.5 million together with payment of royalties, at a rate of 2.5% or 5% on sales 
of certain products from the second anniversary of the date of completion. The maximum payment of royalties is set at an aggregate amount of US$22.5 million. 
The Group has entered into an agreement with Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets in respect of the provision of bilateral multi-currency revolving credit facilities of up to 
US$30 million. The Company has funded the acquisition and associated expenses from cash reserves and amounts drawn down under the above agreement.
Due to the proximity of the transaction to the reporting date additional disclosure information such as the valuation of intangibles and fair value adjustments cannot 
be given at this time as the purchase price allocation exercise is still underway and will not be completed by the reporting date.

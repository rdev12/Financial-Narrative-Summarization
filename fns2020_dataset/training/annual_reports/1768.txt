Group outlook
In 2015, the Group’s underlying earnings
1
 per share 
are expected to be marginally higher than in 2014, 
including some reliance on anticipated naval and 
aircraft orders. 
P27 Segmental performance
P14 Chief Executive’s review
 *Following a restructuring of its US operations in 2014 to improve competitiveness, including reduced management  
and administrative overhead, some activities previously included in the Group’s Platforms & Services (US) segment  
will, from 1 January 2015, be reported within the Cyber & Intelligence segment. The impact of the restructuring on  
the Group’s external reporting segments will be reected in 2015 and, therefore, the segmental outlook for 2015  
is based on restated comparatives for 2014.

ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS
Sales
2
 (in US$) are expected to be similar to 
2014, with growth from commercial business 
offsetting small reductions in defence. 
Margins are expected to be at the top end of 
a 12% to 14% guidance range.
CYBER & INTELLIGENCE
Comprising the US Intelligence & Security 
sector (2014 79% of sales) and 
UK-headquartered Applied Intelligence: 
Mid-single digit sales

 growth expected 
in 2015; with strong sales growth planned 
of around 30% in Applied Intelligence 
offsetting marginally lower sales in 
Intelligence & Security.
Margins anticipated within an 8% to 10% 
range, but at the lower end after integration 
costs of SilverSky and continued investment 
in the Applied Intelligence business. 
PLATFORMS & SERVICES (US)
Sales
2
 are expected to reduce by around 
10%, or 8% like-for-like excluding the disposal 
of the South African land business. 
Margins are expected to be in a 6% to 8% 
range, reecting continued margin dilution 
from sales trading on the Radford and 
commercial shipbuilding contracts.
PLATFORMS & SERVICES (UK)
Sales
2
 are expected to increase by 
approximately 5% with higher sales from 
Salam Typhoon deliveries and the Astute 
and Successor submarine programmes 
more than offsetting reduced trading on the 
Queen Elizabeth Class carrier programme. 
Margins expected to be at the lower end of 
a 10% to 12% range, reecting the impact 
of increased UK pension service costs due 
to the lower discount rate. 
PLATFORMS & SERVICES (INTERNATIONAL)
Sales
2
 in 2015 are expected to be 
approximately 10% higher than in 2014, 
including increased levels of support to the 
Salam Typhoon aircraft now in service and 
from higher volumes of weapon systems. 
Margins are expected to be similar to 2014.
HQ COSTS
HQ costs are expected to be a little higher 
than those in 2014. Underlying nance costs 
are expected to be similar to 2014. The 
effective tax rate is expected to be around 
20% with some dependency on the 
geographic mix of prots.

CHAIRMAN’S
LETTER
My rst year as Chairman of the Company has been both 
stimulating and engaging. I have visited our businesses 
throughout the United Kingdom, the United States of 
America, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Australia.
Without exception, I have been impressed by the 
remarkable skills of our people, reassured by our 
commitment to good corporate governance and proud 
of our determination to serve, supply and protect those 
that serve and protect us across the world.
The capabilities and pride of our people in what we do 
was particularly evident at the naming ceremony in 
Scotland of the HMS Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier in 
July, and at the prize-giving ceremony for the Chairman’s 
Awards in Washington, D.C., in December.
The executive team has continued to demonstrate 
their professionalism by effectively managing cost in 
a challenging business environment, and delivering 
underlying growth in earnings per share after adjusting 
for the one-off, retrospective benet from the Saudi 
Arabian price agreement in 2013. Group cash ow has 
continued to permit the buyback of shares, the support 
of our pension obligations and the recommendation of a 
nal dividend of 12.3p per share, making a total of 
20.5p per share for the year. 
The growing uncertainty and political instability in many 
parts of the world have undoubtedly increased many 
governments’ focus on defence and helped to stabilise 
budgets.
The message delivered by President Obama and Prime 
Minister Cameron at the NATO Summit in Wales, UK, 
calling for members to allocate 2% of Gross Domestic 
Product to their defence budgets, reected the change 
in tone and sentiment, and reinforced the importance 
of a thriving and innovative defence industry in the UK, 
US and with other allies overseas.
Throughout the year, the Company continued to enjoy 
a privileged position as a strategic supplier to the 
UK, US, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Australia. We 
have earned these positions over time through a mix of 
product excellence, service ethic and a commitment to 
working with each host nation to build local capability. 
This approach was particularly visible this year in the 
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, where we announced a 
reorganisation of our industrial interests which will 
enhance our local relationships and will provide high-quality 
employment for young people in the years to come.
In the second quarter of the year, the Board initiated 
a comprehensive review of all our businesses in order 
to deepen our understanding of current activity and 
establish a platform for longer-term strategic planning.
“ A YEAR OF STEADY 
PROGRESS AND 
ACHIEVEMENT.”
Sir Roger Carr, Chairman 05
BAE Systems
Annual Report 2014
STRATEGIC  REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Strategic Report
The review conrmed the importance of maintaining the 
breadth of our geographic balance, continued investment 
in the development of our wide product offering and 
the value of the service relationships we enjoy with 
the armed forces of the countries in which we operate. 
We will manage the Group’s business portfolio to address 
changes in markets and emerging opportunities. Whilst 
still a relatively small segment of the Group, prospects 
for growth in our Applied Intelligence business, which 
capitalises on our deep intelligence roots and benets 
from our wide commercial reach, are encouraging. 
In electronics, the leading-edge capability we have 
in military areas was considered to offer material 
opportunities for further penetration of the civil aircraft 
and adjacent commercial markets. The review also 
encompassed our commitment to apprenticeships, 
lifetime learning and bench-strength development to 
ensure we continue to attract and retain the nest 
engineering talent available in the marketplace.
Looking back, it has been a year of steady progress 
and achievement. We now look to 2015 with condence 
based on the existing programmes in which we are 
engaged and the depth of order backlog we have secured. 
With some reliance on anticipated naval and aircraft 
orders, there is, however, no room for complacency in 
a world where competitive pressures are increasing, 
customer demands for service and value unrelenting, 
and government nances constrained. We will respond 
to these challenges with energy, enthusiasm and vigour, 
recognising that we cannot rely on past achievement 
for future success. Picking up the pace, valuing the 
customer, driving down costs and preserving quality 
will be the watchwords of the business model and the 
hallmarks of our performance.
Directors
I succeeded Sir Richard Olver as Chairman of the Board 
on 1 February 2014 and Sir Richard stepped down from 
the Board on that date.
On 1 February 2014, Linda Hudson retired as President 
and Chief Executive Ofcer of BAE Systems, Inc. and 
as an executive director of BAE Systems plc. Linda made 
a material contribution to both the development of our 
US operations and its important role within the Group. 
On the same date, Jerry DeMuro was appointed as 
President and Chief Executive Ofcer of BAE Systems, 
Inc. and as an executive director of BAE Systems plc.
Paul Anderson, a non-executive director, retired from 
the Board on 31 December 2014 after six years of 
service. Throughout the two terms of his appointment, 
Paul made a major contribution to the strategic thinking 
of the Company in addition to chairing the Corporate 
Responsibility Committee. 
On behalf of colleagues and shareholders, I thank both 
Linda and Paul for all they have done for the Company 
and wish them well for the future.
Ian Tyler has now taken over the role of chairman of the 
Corporate Responsibility Committee.
During the course of the year, the Nominations Committee 
commenced a long-term succession planning review and 
agreed that our immediate priority was to search for a 
replacement for Paul who would have a general 
management background, international experience, be 
capable of assuming responsibility for the Remuneration 
Committee and improve the diversity of the Board. The 
search is now in process.
Dividend
The Board has recommended a nal dividend of 12.3p 
per share making a total of 20.5p per share for the year, 
an increase of 2% over 2013. At this level, the annual 
dividend is covered 1.85 times by underlying earnings 
(2013 2.1 times). Subject to shareholder approval at the 
2015 Annual General Meeting, the dividend will be paid 
on 1 June 2015 to holders of ordinary shares registered 
on 17 April 2015.

STRATEGIC  REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Strategic Report
Our strategy has guided us through 
challenging market conditions in recent 
years. Government spending is still under 
pressure in the US and UK, our largest 
markets, and competition is increasing 
around the world. We have responded by 
focusing on meeting our commitments 
to customers and on improving efciency, 
affordability and nancial performance.
All of these are essential to sustaining and winning 
new business in these competitive times. We have also 
continued to invest in our business and people and to 
develop the technology and skills we need to drive the 
business forward.
The operating environment is still challenging, but we 
have positive momentum and a strong foundation to 
build on. Our strategy has evolved in a number of areas, 
to provide a clear focus for our stakeholders.
Vision
Our vision is to be the premier international defence, 
aerospace and security company – a change from ‘global’ 
to recognise that, as a defence contractor, not all markets 
are accessible to the Group.
Mission
Our mission has been updated to recognise the important 
role we play in protecting and enhancing our customers’ 
vital interests, from defence and national security to 
critical infrastructure and commercial information.
Strategy
Our strategy sets out ve key longer-term areas of focus 
to help us achieve our vision. Maintaining and growing 
our defence businesses remains a core part of our 
strategy. We also continue to pursue growth in adjacent 
markets, including cyber security and commercial 
avionics. We are a trusted partner to the governments of 
a number of countries around the world and we continue 
to expand our international business. We will continue 
to support and develop our people and enhance 
competitiveness to drive success.
Strategic objectives
We dene our strategic objectives, which set near-term 
priorities and help employees to align their personal 
objectives to the Group’s strategy. This year, we have 
added a sixth strategic objective to accelerate plans to 
use our technology and engineering capabilities to nd 
new ways to create value.
Each year, the Group has an overall objective to meet its 
nancial targets and each Executive Committee member 
has specic annual objectives which focus on deliverables 
in support of the Group’s six strategic objectives.
Values
Our values underpin our strategy, dene how we work 
and represent a clear denition of our corporate culture.

CHIEF 
EXECUTIVE’S 
REVIEW
2014 has seen signs of greater stability and improving 
clarity emerge in markets where budgets have been 
constrained in recent years by the wider economic 
backdrop. In this challenging but stabilising environment, 
BAE Systems has delivered a solid overall performance 
in 2014, building on the good programme execution of 
recent years. 
Defence and security continues as a high priority in 
a number of the Group’s domestic and international 
markets, including the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. 
The Group has also continued to win signicant new 
business. Order intake of £4.3bn was achieved from 
international markets outside the US and the UK 
contributing to the £40.5bn order backlog at year end. 
That large order backlog provides good, multi-year visibility 
across many of the Group’s businesses. In addition, the 
Group has achieved over £10bn of order intake in the 
US and UK each year over the last three years. These 
US and UK programmes provide the Group with the 
intellectual property which can be used to develop 
international and support businesses for the future.
US 
In January 2014, a US bipartisan budget agreement 
provided a two-year window of defence funding visibility 
and some emerging stability. Only minor trading 
disruption was apparent in the last quarter of 2014 as 
the government operated under a Continuing Resolution 
until the mid-December passage of an omnibus 
appropriations bill for the 2015 scal year. This included 
stable Department of Defense funding compared with 
2014, and included funding for ground vehicle 
programmes and for additional F-35 Lightning II aircraft.
US budgets are now relatively stable, with some early 
indications of a modest improvement in 2016.
On 1 February 2014, Jerry DeMuro was appointed as 
President and Chief Executive Ofcer of BAE Systems, 
Inc. Following his appointment, and recognising the 
need for continued competitive enhancement, the 
Group’s US organisation was streamlined into three 
operating sectors with resultant reductions to 
administrative overhead.
The Group’s Intelligence & Security business continued 
to face a challenging environment serving US government 
security community customers.

BAE Systems
Annual Report 2014
STRATEGIC  REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Strategic Report
The Group’s Electronic Systems activities beneted from 
the broad base of high-technology defence systems and 
equipment and continued good growth in commercial 
aircraft electronics. We have maintained our leadership 
position in the US electronic warfare market. The 
selection of BAE Systems to supply an advanced, 
integrated electronic ight control system for Boeing’s 
new 777X programme was a notable achievement, 
expected to generate signicant new business in future 
years. The award adds to established positions providing 
ight and engine controls across multiple commercial 
aircraft platforms. 
There was strong margin performance in the Land 
& Armaments business and a number of order awards 
on programmes that sustain key combat vehicle 
industrial base capabilities. In December, BAE Systems 
was awarded a contract for the engineering and 
manufacturing development phase of the Armored 
Multi-Purpose Vehicle programme, which will sustain 
these capabilities in the longer term. 
BAE Systems is a major provider of ship repair services 
to the US Navy. Consistent with the US Navy’s increased 
focus on Asia-Pacic operations, the Group committed 
a $103m (£66m) investment to install new oating dry 
dock facilities in its San Diego shipyard. 
Performance issues identied in 2013 in commercial 
shipbuilding continued to depress margins in the US 
Support Solutions business. There were also further 
charges taken in 2014. The operational challenges 
identied in 2013 on the Radford ammunition facility 
maintenance contract have been mitigated signicantly 
during the year.
In November, the Group was disappointed to learn that 
the Republic of Korea had decided to terminate for 
convenience the US Air Force’s Foreign Military Sales 
contract with BAE Systems to upgrade Korea’s F-16 
aircraft eet. 
UK 
In the UK, the defence and security market has been 
stable. Notwithstanding the continued constraints on 
public spending in some sectors, BAE Systems 
continues to benet from long-term contracts in the 
air and naval domains. Both major political parties 
in the UK are committed to carrying out a Strategic 
Defence and Security Review after the general election 
in May. The Group benets from a large order backlog 
of long-term committed programmes with many key 
decisions now addressed for several years.
We recognise that the economic environment in the 
UK remains challenging, placing further pressure on 
many areas of public spending, including the UK 
defence budget. Through a continued focus on cost 
control, programme execution and efciency, the 
Group is working to deliver continuous improvements 
in affordability for the UK customer to ensure that the 
Group’s large, long-term contracts deliver both value 
and world-class capability.
In the air domain, Typhoon production and the Group’s 
extensive in-service military aircraft support and  
upgrade business in the UK provide a strong core of 
high-performing business. 2014 has seen a signicant 
acceleration of capability expansion onto the Typhoon 
combat aircraft platform. Activity is underway to integrate 
additional weapons and sensors onto the aircraft for 
the four European partner nations and international 
customers. In November, the formal launch of a funded, 
multi-nation development programme for an advanced, 
electronically-scanned radar was a key milestone 
in the Typhoon platform’s evolution.
Our participation in the F-35 Lightning II combat aircraft 
programme includes UK-manufactured rear fuselage and 
empennage assemblies as well as electronic systems 
content from the Group’s US-based business. The Group 
expects signicant growth in production volume with the 
planned acceleration of aircraft deliveries. 
The outlook for the Group’s UK maritime businesses is 
robust. The build of two Queen Elizabeth Class aircraft 
carriers is progressing well. The rst of Class was named 
in a formal ceremony by Her Majesty The Queen on 
4 July and subsequently oated out of the dock in which 
she was assembled, enabling assembly of blocks for the 
second vessel to commence as the rst vessel 
continues outtting alongside. BAE Systems welcomed 
the decision, announced by Prime Minister David 
Cameron at the NATO Summit held in the UK in October, 
to commit to the operation of both vessels, providing a 
continuous-at-sea UK carrier capability.

EXECUTIVE’S 
REVIEW
CONTINUED
International 
In Saudi Arabia, the Group delivered a further 
11 Typhoon aircraft in the year and developed its 
position as a key part of the Kingdom’s defence 
industrial base. 
In February 2014, agreement was reached with 
the Saudi Arabian government on price escalation 
for the Salam Typhoon programme under the current 
72-aircraft contract. 
In June, we announced a reorganisation of the Group’s 
portfolio of interests in a number of industrial companies 
in Saudi Arabia and an enhancement of its existing 
relationship with Riyadh Wings Aviation Academy LLC 
(Riyadh Wings). The reorganisation brings together 
shareholdings of BAE Systems and Riyadh Wings in 
Saudi companies specialising in training, electronics 
and IT systems engineering under a single holding 
company. The reorganisation is intended to enhance 
the growth prospects of this portfolio of businesses 
and reinforce an ongoing commitment to increasing 
local employment.
In Australia, where BAE Systems is the largest defence 
contractor, the government approved, in May 2014, a 
commitment to grow defence spending within a decade 
to 2% of Gross Domestic Product. 
The Group delivered the rst of two Canberra Class 
Landing Helicopter Dock (LHD) vessels for the Royal 
Australian Navy and manufacture of the second ship 
is progressing well. Following the high level of activity 
on this programme, there is currently no material 
follow-on workload contracted. BAE Systems and the 
Australian government continue to discuss options to 
sustain industrial capabilities and meet future naval 
requirements following on from the high level of 
workload on the LHD programme. 
BAE Systems is a 37.5% shareholder in the MBDA 
guided weapons joint venture. MBDA benets from 
sales to equip a range of air and naval platforms 
across European and wider international applications. 
In December, MBDA received a €301m (£234m) 
contract to supply the air-to-air missiles for India’s 
Jaguar aircraft eet. The MBDA business has seen 
increased bidding interest on ground-based air defence 
systems in some regions.
Actions continue to implement and nalise contracts 
for the restructuring of the Group’s naval ships business 
following last year’s agreement with the UK government. 
In August, the Group was awarded a contract for the 
build of three Offshore Patrol Vessels for the Royal 
Navy, sustaining shipbuilding skills between the 
Carrier programme and the start of manufacture for 
the anticipated Type 26 frigate programme. The Group 
continues to work on the Type 26 assessment phase 
and is discussing proposals with the UK Ministry of 
Defence for the future phases of the programme. 
The Type 26 programme will provide long-term clarity 
for UK complex warship manufacture, including at the 
Group’s facilities on the River Clyde in Scotland. 
Following the Scottish independence referendum in 
September, the people of Scotland decided to remain 
within the Union. The decision was welcomed, removing 
uncertainty for the Group’s employees and its business 
based in Scotland.
In October, the Group agreed a multi-year Maritime 
Support Delivery Framework contract for the operation 
of the Royal Naval Base at Portsmouth and global 
support for half of the Royal Navy’s surface eet.
In December, a signicant contract for the upgrade of 
the Spearsh torpedo was secured. 
In the submarines business, Artful, the third of a 
planned seven Astute Class submarines, was launched 
in May. Alongside build of Astute Class boats, 
engineering work continues to accelerate as part of 
the assessment phase of the Successor submarine 
programme. The Successor programme is the potential 
replacement of Vanguard Class submarines, intended 
to enter service towards the end of the next decade. 
Cyber security
BAE Systems continues to develop its strategy for 
commercial cyber security, with growth being delivered 
and a number of important contract wins in the year. 
Order backlog in the Applied Intelligence business 
grew by 37% in the year, building on the 60% increase 
in 2013. 
We continue to target strong growth opportunities in 
commercial cyber security markets and the acquisition 
of SilverSky in December accelerates the Group’s 
strategy to grow in the commercial cyber market, 
providing an established channel to US customers.

M&A
In August, the Group announced an agreement for 
the proposed sale of its 75% holding in BAE Systems 
Land Systems South Africa (Pty) Limited to Denel 
(SOC) Limited for cash consideration of approximately 
641 million Rand (£36m), subject to closing adjustments. 
The sale is expected to be completed in 2015.
As part of the reorganisation of the Group’s interests in 
Saudi Arabia, in September, BAE Systems acquired an 
additional 59% shareholding in Saudi Development and 
Training Company for 440 million Saudi Riyal (£72m).
In September, the Group completed the $21m (£13m) 
acquisition of Signal Innovations Group, Inc., a small-scale, 
high-technology provider of imaging technologies and 
analytics to the US intelligence community. 
In December, BAE Systems completed the acquisition 
of SilverSky for $232m (£149m).
In December, BAE Systems entered into an agreement 
with Esterline Corporation for the proposed acquisition 
of Eclipse Electronic Systems, Inc. for cash consideration 
of approximately $28m (£18m), subject to closing 
adjustments. The Texas-based business employs 
approximately 90 people and provides highly-advanced 
Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance products 
and services to the US defence and intelligence 
community. The proposed acquisition has not yet 
completed.
Balance sheet and capital allocation 
Following the triennial funding valuations of all of 
the Group’s UK pension schemes and subsequent 
discussions with trustees, new funding agreements 
have been concluded, with overall decit funding 
remaining broadly consistent with 2014. 
In February 2013, the Group initiated a share repurchase 
programme of up to £1bn over three years. As at 
31 December 2014, BAE Systems had purchased 
119 million shares for £495m under the programme. 
The Group’s balance sheet continues to be managed 
conservatively in line with the Group’s policy to retain 
its investment grade credit rating and to ensure 
operating exibility. Consistent with this approach, the 
Group meets its pension obligations, pursues organic 
investment opportunities, plans to pay dividends in line 
with its policy of long-term sustainable cover of around 
two times underlying earnings and to make accelerated 
returns of capital to shareholders when the balance 
sheet allows. Investment in value-enhancing acquisitions 
are considered where market conditions are right and 
where they deliver on the Group’s strategy. 
Responsible business
The way the Group conducts its business is of equal 
importance as product delivery. We continue to embed 
responsible business conduct throughout the Group. 
During 2014, our employees received business conduct 
refresher training and our Code of Conduct was updated 
and will be rolled out to all employees during the rst half 
of 2015.
The safety of our employees and those using our products 
is a priority for the Group. We continue to drive safety 
improvements and, in 2014, achieved an 11% reduction 
in the Recordable Accident Rate (see page 20), which 
represents the seventh consecutive year of improvement.
Management
Kevin Taylor, previously Group Strategy Director, has 
been appointed as Managing Director, Applied Intelligence, 
to lead the business as it enters the next phase of its 
strategy to target accelerated growth and further 
develop our technology for government and commercial 
customers. Kevin will remain an Executive Committee 
member. 
Looking forward
BAE Systems benets from a large order backlog, 
long-term programmes and high-technology capabilities. 
The Group continues to address customers’ needs 
across a broad international market base. In addition, 
BAE Systems has established a good balance of 
business activities in both advanced products and 
value-added support services. The Group is well 
positioned to continue to deliver shareholder value by 
addressing customers’ continuing defence and security 
needs as economies recover in domestic markets and 
defence priorities continue to evolve.

Underlying EBITA
2
 reduced by £223m to £1,702m 
(2013 £1,925m), giving a return on sales of 10.2% 
(2013 10.6%). The prior year included a £183m 
retrospective benet from the Salam price escalation 
settlement. Charges totalling £74m were taken in 
2014 on US commercial shipbuilding programmes in 
the Support Solutions business. Adverse exchange 
translation amounted to £49m.
Non-recurring items in 2014 includes a £47m accounting 
gain on the Group’s existing 40% shareholding in Saudi 
Development and Training Company following the 
acquisition of an additional 59% shareholding in the 
company offset by a £47m charge on classication of 
the Saudi Aircraft Accessories and Components 
Company (AACC) as held for sale.
Amortisation of intangible assets was £184m 
(2013 £189m).
Impairment of intangible assets includes goodwill 
impairment charges of £87m against the carrying value 
of Support Solutions reecting the performance issues 
in the US commercial shipbuilding business and £74m 
against the carrying value of the South African business 
expected to be sold in 2015.
Finance costs
1
 were £448m (2013 £392m). The 
underlying interest charge, excluding pension accounting, 
marked-to-market revaluation of nancial instruments 
and foreign currency movements, increased to £204m 
(2013 £179m), primarily from a higher level of net present 
value charges. Net interest expense on the Group’s 
pension decit was lower at £155m (2013 £195m) mainly 
reecting the reduction in the decit during 2013.
Taxation expense
1
 reects the Group’s underlying effective 
tax rate for the period of 19% (2013 22%), partially offset 
by a £51m credit in respect of the re-assessment of 
existing tax provisions. The calculation of the underlying 
effective tax rate is shown in note 6 to the Group 
accounts on page 115. The effective tax rate for 
2015 is expected to be around 20%, with the nal 
rate dependent on the geographical mix of prots.
Earnings per share
Underlying earnings
3
 per share for the year was 38.0p 
(2013 42.0p). The prior year included a 4.4p retrospective 
benet from the Salam price escalation settlement.
Basic earnings per share, in accordance with International 
Accounting Standard 33, Earnings per Share, was 23.4p 
(2013 5.2p). The increase on the prior year mainly reects 
the £887m of impairment charges taken in 2013 which 
are excluded from underlying earnings

Cash ow
Cash inow from operating activities was £913m (2013 
£205m), which includes cash contributions in respect of 
pension decit funding, over and above service costs, for 
the UK and US schemes totalling £391m (2013 £389m). 
As anticipated, advances received in prior years continue 
to be consumed on the Omani Typhoon and Hawk, 
Saudi training aircraft, European Typhoon Tranche 2 
and Indian Hawk programmes. Costs incurred are also 
being charged against provisions created in previous 
years on the Oman Offshore Patrol Vessel contract, 
rationalisation and settlement of a US contract pricing 
dispute. The rst of two payments in respect of the Salam 
price escalation settlement was received as expected.
The net cash proceeds from capital expenditure and 
nancial investment of £215m (2013 £153m outow) 
includes the sale and leaseback of two properties in 
Saudi Arabia, for which £418m was received in the year.
Dividends received from equity accounted investments 
reduced by £32m to £63m (2013 £95m) reecting a 
dividend received from the Group’s 50% shareholding 
in Gripen International in 2013.
Interest payments were £21m lower at £145m (2013 
£166m) primarily reecting the timing of interest 
payments on US dollar bonds and lower facility fees.
Taxation payments reduced to £92m (2013 £138m) 
mainly due to settlement of a US contract pricing dispute 
and other US issues.
There was a cash outow in respect of acquisitions and 
disposals reecting the acquisition of SilverSky (£147m) 
and Signal Innovations Group (£12m) and an additional 
59% shareholding in Saudi Development and Training 
Company (£71m).
The cash outow in respect of the share repurchase 
programme of £283m (2013 £212m) represents shares 
purchased and cancelled under the programme 
announced in February 2013.
Equity dividends paid in 2014 include payments in 
respect of the 2013 nal (£383m) and 2014 interim 
(£259m) dividends.
As a consequence of movements in US dollar and 
Euro exchange rates during the year, there has been 
a cash inow from matured derivative nancial 
instruments of £8m (2013 £47m outow) from rolling 
hedges on balances with the Group’s subsidiaries and 
equity accounted investments.
Foreign exchange translation, primarily in respect of the 
Group’s US dollar-denominated borrowing, increased 
reported net debt by £146m.
Net debt (as dened by the Group)
The Group’s net debt at 31 December 2014 is £1,032m, 
a net outow of £333m from the net debt position of

repurchase programme, pension decit funding, 
payment of the 2014 nal dividend and management 
of working capital. 
Balance sheet
The £248m increase in intangible assets to £10.0bn 
(2013 £9.7bn) arises from business acquisitions made 
in the year (£289m) and exchange translation (£258m), 
partly offset by the impairment of goodwill relating to the 
US commercial shipbuilding and South African businesses 
(£161m), and the year’s amortisation charge (£179m). 
Property, plant and equipment, and investment property 
reduced to £1.7bn (2013 £2.1bn) reecting the disposal 
of a residential and ofce facility in Saudi Arabia.
Equity accounted investments and other investments 
reduced to £236m (2013 £286m) mainly reecting the 
dividends of £63m received in the year. Note 12 to the 
Group accounts on page 125 identies the Group’s 
principal joint ventures, Euroghter, MBDA and Air 
Astana, and, this year, provides additional information 
in respect of the Group’s interests in those companies.
The £1.9bn increase in the Group’s share of the pre-tax 
pension decit mainly reects an increase in liabilities 
due to a 0.7 percentage point decrease in the real 
discount rate to 0.4% in the UK and a 0.8 percentage 
point decrease in the nominal discount rate to 4.1% in 
the US. Details of the Group’s pension schemes are 
provided in note 21 to the Group accounts on page 134.
The triennial funding valuations of all of the Group’s UK 
pension schemes were performed in 2014 and showed 
an aggregate funding decit of £2.7bn. New funding 
arrangements, including decit recovery plans which run 
until 2026, have been concluded with the trustees of 
those schemes.
A net deferred tax asset of £1.2bn (2013 £0.7bn) 
relating to the Group’s pension decit is included within 
net tax assets and liabilities.
There was a £0.5bn increase in working capital mainly 
reecting a net reduction in advance contract funding 
and utilisation of provisions.
At 31 December 2014, the South African land vehicles 
business (£41m) and AACC (£12m), both expected to be 
sold in 2015, are classied as held for sale. The disposal 
of the residential and ofce facility in Saudi Arabia 
classied as held for sale at 31 December 2013 
(£140m) was completed on 9 January 2014.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Certain of the Group’s principal accounting policies are considered 
by the directors to be critical because of the level of complexity, 
judgement or estimation involved in their application and their 
impact on the consolidated nancial statements:
Revenue and prot recognition
Sales £16.6bn (year ended 31 December 2014) 
See note 1 to the Group accounts
Carrying value of intangible assets
Intangible assets £10.0bn (at 31 December 2014)  
See note 9 to the Group accounts
Valuation of retirement benet obligations
Group’s share of IAS 19 
decit, net
£5.4bn (at 31 December 2014) 
See note 21 to the Group accounts
P102 For more information
TREASURY
The Group’s treasury activities are overseen by the Treasury Review 
Management Committee (TRMC). Two executive directors are members 
of the TRMC, including the Group Finance Director who chairs the 
Committee. The TRMC also has representatives with legal and tax 
expertise. The Group operates a centralised treasury department 
that is accountable to the TRMC for managing treasury activities in 
accordance with the treasury policies approved by the Board.
Objectives/policies
Net debt
Maintain a balance between the continuity, exibility and cost of 
debt funding through the use of borrowings from a range of markets 
with a range of maturities, currencies and interest rates, reecting 
the Group’s risk prole.
 – Material borrowings are arranged by the central treasury 
department and funds raised are lent onward to operating 
subsidiaries as required.
Interest rates
Manage the exposure to interest rate uctuations on borrowings 
through varying the proportion of xed rate debt relative to oating 
rate debt with derivative instruments, including interest rate and 
cross-currency swaps.
 – A minimum of 50% and a maximum of 90% of gross debt is 
maintained at xed interest rates.
Liquidity
Maintain adequate undrawn committed borrowing facilities.
 – An undrawn committed Revolving Credit Facility of £2bn 
contracted to December 2018 and £1.8bn contracted from 
December 2018 to December 2019 is available to meet expected 
general corporate funding requirements.
Monitor and control counterparty credit risk and credit limit utilisation.
 – The Group adopts a conservative approach to the investment of 
its surplus cash. It is deposited with nancial institutions with the 
strongest credit ratings for short periods.
Currency
Reduce the Group’s exposure to transactional volatility in earnings 
and cash ows from movements in foreign currency exchange rates.
 – All material rm transactional exposures are hedged.
 – The Group does not hedge the translation effect of exchange rate 
movements on the income statements or balance sheets of 
foreign subsidiaries and equity accounted investments it regards 
as long-term investments.
P150 Note 28 to the Group accounts
TAX
Objectives
The Group’s tax strategy is to: 
–  ensure compliance with all applicable tax laws and regulations; 
and 
–  manage the Group’s tax expense in a way that is consistent with 
its values and its legal obligations in all relevant jurisdictions.
Policies
The Group seeks to build constructive working relationships with 
tax authorities, following a policy of open disclosure in order to 
achieve early agreement and certainty in relation to its tax affairs. 
Whilst the Group aims to maximise the tax efciency of its business 
transactions, it does not use structures in its tax planning that are 
against the spirit of the law and actively considers the implications 
of any planning for the Group’s wider corporate reputation. Arm’s 
length principles are applied in the pricing of all intra-group 
transactions of goods and services in accordance with Organisation 
for Economic Co-operation and Development guidelines. Where 
appropriate, the Group engages with governments to help shape 
proposed legislation and tax policy. The Group endorses the 
statement of tax principles issued by the Confederation of British 
Industry in May 2013 (www.cbi.org.uk/media/2051390/
statement_of_principles.pdf).
BAE Systems operates internationally and is subject to tax in 
many different jurisdictions. The Group employs professional tax 
managers and takes appropriate advice from reputable 
professional rms. The Group is routinely subject to tax audits and 
reviews which can take a considerable period of time to conclude. 
Provision is made for known issues based on interpretation of 
country-specic legislation and the likely outcome of negotiations 
or litigation. The assessment and management of tax risks are 
regularly reviewed by the Group’s Audit Committee.
P114 Note 6 to the Group accounts
CAPITAL
Objectives
Maintain the Group’s investment grade credit rating and ensure 
operating exibility, whilst: meeting its pension obligations; 
pursuing organic investment opportunities; paying dividends in line 
with the Group’s policy of long-term sustainable cover of around two 
times underlying earnings; making accelerated returns of capital to 
shareholders when the balance sheet allows; and investing in 
value-enhancing acquisitions, where market conditions are right 
and where they deliver on the Group’s strategy.
Policies
The Group funds its operations through a mixture of equity funding 
and debt nancing, including bank and capital market borrowings. 
The capital structure of the Group reects the judgement of the 
directors of an appropriate balance of funding required. Three credit 
rating agencies publish credit ratings for the Group:

Electronic Combat
Electronic Systems maintains its leadership 
position in the US electronic warfare market. 
Initial design verication testing of the 
electronic warfare suite on the F-35 
Lightning II programme was completed 
during the year. Low-Rate Initial Production 
(LRIP) Lots 7 and 8 deliveries continue, 
and the business has received initial 
funding on Lots 9 and 10, with anticipated 
negotiations in 2015.
The business is under contracts, from 
Boeing and Warner Robins Air Logistics 
Complex, totalling over $0.9bn (£0.6bn) to 
install the Digital Electronic Warfare System 
(DEWS) on 84 new F-15 aircraft and upgrade 
the DEWS on 70 existing F-15 aircraft for the 
Royal Saudi Air Force. System verication 
and ight testing continues on schedule in 
advance of initial elding in the second half 
of 2015.
The US Air Force has dened its requirements 
for the next-generation electronic warfare 
system, Eagle Passive Active Warning 
Survivability System, for more than 400 
existing F-15 aircraft. The programme will 
consist of the design, development, 
integration and delivery of a passive and 
active electronic warfare suite. The business 
has submitted a proposal to Boeing and, in 
competition, an award decision is expected 
in the third quarter of 2015.
Following successful US Defense Advanced 
Research Projects Agency ight 
demonstrations, Electronic Systems has 
received an $86m (£55m) contract to 
design, develop and deliver initial electronic 
sensors for the Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile 
in support of its initial elding in 2018 on 
board B-1B aircraft.
In 2014, BAE Systems was not awarded 
the technology development contract for 
the Next-Generation Jammer.
Survivability & Targeting 
Electronic Systems completed its $38m 
(£24m) Common Infrared Countermeasures 
technology development contract on a US 
Army helicopter programme. A proposal for 
the engineering and manufacturing 
development phase, together with options 
for two LRIP phases, was submitted in 
November and, in competition, an award 
decision is expected in 2015.
A three-year Indenite Delivery, Indenite 
Quantity (IDIQ) contract with the US Army, 
with a potential value of approximately 
$496m (£318m), was agreed in May for 
third-generation Common Missile Warning 
Systems. The US Army has determined 
that this will be the baseline for export to 
international customers.
Electronic Systems continues to execute 
its $37m (£24m) Advanced Precision Kill 
Weapon System (APKWS™) Full-Rate 
Production Lot 3 contract with the US Navy, 
with more than 3,500 systems delivered 
to 31 December 2014. The APKWS 
laser-guided rocket achieved an Air 
Worthiness Release and successfully 
completed initial live testing on the US Army 
Apache D/E aircraft in 2014. The $45m 
(£29m) Full-Rate Production Lot 4 contract 
was nalised in December. The US Army is 
working closely with the US Navy to acquire 
APKWS for initial elding in 2015.
Jordan and the US Navy have signed a Letter 
of Offer and Acceptance to progress the rst 
international sale of the APKWS system. 
Other international opportunities were 
progressed, with the successful completion 
of a ground trial in Australia and, in November, 
the US Defense Security Cooperation Agency 
began the Congressional Notication 
process on a potential Foreign Military Sale 
to Iraq for up to 2,000 systems.
The business continues to perform on the 
Terminal High-Altitude Area Defence orders 
for 307 infrared missile seekers supporting 
both the US government and Foreign Military 
Sales worth $340m (£218m).
In May, Electronic Systems was awarded a 
ve-year IDIQ contract with a potential value 
of approximately $445m (£285m) to support 
the US Army’s Enhanced Night Vision Goggle 
III and Family of Weapon Sights – Individual 
programme. Following a protest by a 
competitor and re-competition, BAE Systems 
was awarded the contract in December. 
However, this new award has been further 
protested, with the next decision expected 
in March 2015.
Communications & Control
Electronic Systems continues to deliver 
on programmes in Korea, providing 
ight control systems, head-up displays, 
mission computers and automatic test 
equipment systems.
On the F-35 Lightning II programme, 
BAE Systems successfully completed 
Lot 7 deliveries of the vehicle management 
computer in support of Lockheed Martin’s 
production programme. Lots 8 and 9 are 
under contract.
The next-generation Striker®II 
helmet-mounted display was unveiled 
at the Farnborough Airshow in July. The 
system is a digital upgrade of the current 
product, in service on Typhoon and Gripen 
aircraft, providing seamless day and night 
capability through an integrated digital 
night vision camera.

LOOKING FORWARD
Whilst the longer-term outlook remains uncertain, the 2015 scal year omnibus 
appropriations legislation passed in December 2014 included stable Department of 
Defense funding and support for major programmes, including F-35 Lightning II aircraft.
Whilst further funding reductions and the resultant slowdown or cancellation of ongoing 
and new programmes could impact the business, Electronic Systems remains 
well-positioned to address changing US Department of Defense priorities. Its focus 
remains on maintaining a diverse portfolio of defence and commercial products and 
capabilities, with both US and international customers, and sustained emphasis on cost 
reduction and research and development.
The business expects to benet from its incumbent positions, particularly on the F-35 
Lightning II programme, increased activity on international defence programmes and

Intelligence & Security 
Whilst the US services market continued 
to experience challenges due to budget 
uncertainties, unpredictable and delayed 
acquisition and funding cycles, and the US 
withdrawal from Afghanistan, the Intelligence 
& Security business continues to focus on 
leveraging its core capabilities and domain 
expertise to pursue opportunities in 
intelligence analysis, special operations 
support, and Intelligence, Surveillance 
and Reconnaissance programmes, which 
remain priority activities in the US.
GEOINT-ISR (Geospatial Intelligence – 
Intelligence, Surveillance and 
Reconnaissance)
BAE Systems continues to mature its 
capabilities in activity-based intelligence 
which provides the intelligence and defence 
communities with increasingly automated, 
efcient and reliable data processing and 
management tools to transform big data 
into actionable intelligence. The business 
received authorisation to proceed on a 
$32m (£21m) Engineering Change Proposal 
for activity-based intelligence services.
In 2014, the business delivered the rst two 
software releases for testing of the Mobility 
Air Force Automated Flight Planning Service 
programme and passed nal quality test on 
the Aero Advisory Notication Tool capability 
in support of the US Air Force’s transition to 
a consolidated mission planning architecture. 
Development continues on the third release 
of the software.
The National Geospatial-Intelligence 
Agency awarded the business the rst six 
task orders, totalling $56m (£36m), under 
the ve-year Geospatial Data Services 
contract to assist in transforming the 
collection, maintenance and utilisation of 
geospatial intelligence data and products. 
The contract has an estimated total value 
of $335m (£215m).
In September, BAE Systems acquired Signal 
Innovations Group, a leading provider of 
imaging technologies and analytics to the 
US intelligence community. 
Global Analysis and Operations
In the market for Full Motion Video and 
Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance 
analysis, the business has ongoing contracts 
worth over $400m (£257m), which includes 
the services of over 400 analysts supporting 
mission critical activities.
The business continues to provide  
security-cleared intelligence analyst support. 
In August, BAE Systems won a ve-year 
contract worth up to $145m (£93m) to 
provide an intelligence community customer 
with counter-terrorism analysis services.
IT Solutions
On the Solutions for the Information 
Technology Enterprise Indenite Delivery, 
Indenite Quantity contract, with task orders

in competitive markets with fast-moving 
customer requirements. The business 
continues to grow through the provision 
of solutions which protect and enhance the 
operations of governments and commercial 
organisations in the areas of cyber security, 
nancial crime prevention, communications 
intelligence and digital transformation, and 
is demonstrating its ability to win large, 
multi-year contracts.
Applied Intelligence continues to invest 
in building its skills base, with over 100 
graduates joining the business in 2014, 
representing over one-third of BAE Systems’ 
UK graduate intake. A Global Delivery Centre

The business continues to grow, building 
on its strong relationship with the UK 
government, with orders including a £7m 
multi-year contract to address the UK 
Ministry of Defence’s complex information 
assurance challenges.
The IndustrialProtect™ solution to protect 
industrial control systems was launched in 
the US and Middle East and received a £3m

targeting to achieve an additional 150,000 
subscribers to the MobileProtect™ service.
Financial Crime
Applied Intelligence provides enterprise risk, 
fraud and compliance solutions 
internationally.
Applied Intelligence has won additional 
work with existing customers, including 
HSBC, which has procured NetReveal® 
Discovery, a suite of solutions that enable 
global nancial crime investigations across 
borders. Demand for multi-year managed 
service solutions has increased, with 
NetReveal® OnDemand being selected by 
RSA in Canada to provide insurance fraud 
solutions under a ve-year contract. Growth 
in the US continues with an order from a 
large US-based global personal and 
business payment provider.
Expansion is being achieved in other 
sectors, including healthcare with a 
£4m contract to provide Medicaid fraud 
prevention in Rhode Island and capital 
markets in the UK, Europe and Australia 
through a solution, launched in 2013, 
to protect against unauthorised trading, 
providing risk management controls to 
investment bank trading oors. 
Communications Solutions
The business is a provider of end-to-end 
communications intelligence solutions to 
government and communications service 
providers and is addressing opportunities 
in Europe, the Middle East and Asia-Pacic 
regions. It continues to win new clients, most 
recently in Asia-Pacic, and is developing 
follow-on business with existing clients as 
a result of new products from continued 
product investment.
UK Services
Applied Intelligence provides consulting 
and systems integration services, with 
a particular focus on enabling digital 
transformation. The business continues 
to support UK government agencies in their

 in the year reduced by

Applied Intelligence business was at 10%, 
almost all of which was from commercial 
customers. Completion of the SilverSky 
transaction occurred in mid-December and, 
therefore, only $4m (£3m) of sales trading

LOOKING FORWARD
In the US, whilst the longer-term outlook remains uncertain, the 2015 scal year omnibus 
appropriations legislation passed in December 2014 included stable Department of 
Defense funding. 
Intelligence & Security has reduced costs to address government budgets, whilst pursuing 
growth opportunities, particularly in critical, mission-focused areas. 
Recognising the continued challenges in the US market, a restructuring was announced 
in 2014 that realigned the Support Solutions business across the remaining US operating 
sectors. A Support Solutions business area which develops and maintains systems 
supporting critical missions for the US military was integrated with Intelligence & Security. 
This integrated portfolio provides critical mass and economies of scale over a full spectrum 
of services and capabilities to the US military and other government agencies. 
Applied Intelligence has a growing order backlog and pipeline of opportunities, underpinning 
expected growth from both government and commercial customers. In order to most 
effectively deliver against these opportunities, the business restructured into three divisions 
with effect from 1 January 2015: UK Services; International Services and Solutions; and 
Commercial Solutions. In 2015, the acquired SilverSky business will be integrated into 
the Commercial Solutions division, accelerating the growth strategy. 34

Land & Armaments
As the defence market stabilises, BAE Systems 
retains its focus on maintaining key 
programmes and building a strong domestic 
and international pipeline, whilst shaping the 
business portfolio and scaling operational 
resources for optimised competitiveness.
US Combat Vehicles
The business has focused on maintaining 
and enhancing its positions on vehicle 
programmes, with a number of signicant 
contracts received during the year.
In December, the US Army awarded 
BAE Systems a contract worth up to $1.2bn 
(£0.8bn) for the engineering and manufacturing 
development and Low-Rate Initial Production 
of the Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle. The 
initial award, valued at $383m (£246m), is 
for a 52-month base term during which the 
business will produce 29 vehicles, with an 
option to produce an additional 289.
In December, the business received a $34m 
(£22m) contract to convert 49 M3A3 Cavalry 
Bradley Fighting Vehicles to the M2A3 
Infantry conguration, extending the Bradley 
production line through the rst half of 2016. 
The business received a $154m (£99m) 
follow-on contract for the upgrade of an 
additional 53 vehicles to the M88A2 
HERCULES conguration, which will maintain 
the M88 production line to the end of 2016. 
In November, the US Army exercised an 
option, valued at $142m (£91m), to continue 
Low-Rate Initial Production of the M109A7 
self-propelled howitzer, with the rst deliveries 
expected in the second quarter of 2015.
BAE Systems’ signicant experience with 
amphibious vehicle platforms has resulted 
in its selection as one of two contractors 
competing for the US Marine Corps Assault 
Amphibious Vehicle survivability upgrade 
programme. The business is also competing 
for the engineering and manufacturing 
development phase of the Amphibious 
Combat Vehicle 1.1 contract. Down-selects 
for both programmes are expected in 2015.
Work on the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle 
(JLTV) programme was transitioned 
successfully from the Sealy, Texas, plant, 
which closed in June. BAE Systems, as a 
strategic partner to Lockheed Martin on the 
JLTV programme, completed limited user 
testing of the engineering and manufacturing 
development vehicles in the fourth quarter 
of 2014 in support of the competitive pursuit 
of a Low-Rate Initial Production award.
Following the US Army’s decision to 
discontinue the Ground Combat Vehicle 
programme, BAE Systems was awarded a 
follow-on bridge contract in June to continue 
related technology development efforts and 
maintain critical engineering talent.
Weapon Systems
The business was awarded a contract 
for four 57mm Mk3 naval guns for an 
international customer.
The business did not secure an order from 
India for M777 ultra-lightweight howitzers, 
but continues to pursue this prospect.
BAE Systems continues to develop its 
position in the advanced weapons market 
through its Electromagnetic Railgun 
programme, having competitively won 
contracts in excess of $100m (£64m) for land 
and sea-based demonstrators, pulse power 
modules and the next development phase 
of the hyper velocity projectile programme.
Following the Norwegian government’s 
decision to withdraw from the Archer artillery 
system programme, the business signed a 
contract amendment with Sweden establishing 
a new technical and schedule baseline for 
the contract, which has initial deliveries 
planned for the second half of 2015. 
BAE Systems Hägglunds
Work on the $865m (£555m) CV90 vehicles 
contract for the Norwegian Army remains on 
schedule, with series production of the 144 
vehicles continuing until 2017.
BAE Systems has offered the CV90 Armadillo 
concept for the Danish Armoured Personnel 
Carrier programme. Four manufacturers 
submitted bids in December and an award 
decision is expected in the rst half of 2015. 
FNSS
FNSS, BAE Systems’ Turkish joint venture, 
has continued production under the $559m 
(£359m) programme to produce 259 8x8 
wheeled armoured vehicles for the Royal 
Malaysian Army.
Production continued under a $360m 
(£231m) contract to upgrade 32 M113 
tracked armoured personnel carriers for the 
Royal Saudi Land Forces. The business is 
pursuing other armoured vehicle prospects 
elsewhere in the Middle East region.
Business disposal
BAE Systems expects to complete the 
disposal of its Land Systems South Africa 
business in 2015 following the agreement 
of a proposed sale of the company in 2014.
Support Solutions
Under Multi-Ship, Multi-Option (MSMO) 
contract vehicles with the US Navy, the 
US-based ship repair business received 
orders totalling $1.5bn (£1.0bn) for the 
repair, maintenance and modernisation of 
various vessels during the year. The business 
was awarded a new ve-year MSMO contract 
at its Hawaii shipyard to support the

San Diego shipyards. The new contracts, together 
with similar MSMO contracts in Norfolk, Virginia, 
and Mayport, Florida, reinforce the Group’s trusted 
partnership with the US Navy. BAE Systems has 
successfully completed more than 300 cruiser and 
destroyer availabilities over the last 20 years. 36
BAE Systems
Annual Report 2014
Strategic Report
The commercial shipbuilding business 
continued to experience challenges, taking 
$122m (£74 m) of charges against ongoing 
contracts in 2014. 
BAE Systems manages the operations of the 
Holston and Radford Army Ammunition Plants, 
receiving in excess of $400m (£257m) of 
contracts in 2014 for explosives, propellant 
and facility modernisation. Following the 
operational challenges at the Radford plant 
identied during 2013, performance 
has improved reecting the award of new 
contracts, pricing adjustments on existing 
contracts and operational efciencies.
In 2012, BAE Systems was selected to 
upgrade the Republic of Korea’s eet of 
F-16 aircraft. The US government approved 
the selection in 2013 and, whilst the 
business was successfully executing phase 
one of the programme, in November, Korea 
requested the termination for convenience of 
the US Air Force’s contract with BAE Systems. 
BAE Systems expects to recover all of its 
programme costs under normal terms of 
a termination for convenience. In response 
to the Korean government’s claim for 
approximately $43m (£28m) under a bid 
guarantee on the programme, the Group has 
asked a US federal court to rule that it does 
not owe any monies to Korea.
Under the eight-year, $534m (£343m) 
US Air Force contract, received in 2013, 
to maintain the readiness of Minuteman III 
intercontinental ballistic missiles in the US, 
the business completed the nine-month 
transition period from the incumbent on 
schedule in June and performed a 
successful test launch in September, 
a major milestone for the programme.
In February 2014, the US Air Force Space 
Command awarded BAE Systems a further 
three-year contract extension to maintain 
its Solid State Phased Array Radar System, 
space radars used for missile warning and 
space surveillance operations, raising the 
cumulative value of the contract to 
approximately $540m (£346m). This 
contract is expected to complete in 2018. 
In April, BAE Systems was informed that 
it had not been awarded the Automated 
Installation Entry III contract, which would 
have extended its current work in support of 
US Army installation security. BAE Systems’ 
protest of the award was upheld and the 
contract is being re-solicited.
In August, BAE Systems was one of ve 
companies awarded the ability to compete 
for task orders under an Indenite Delivery, 
Indenite Quantity contract to build-to-print 
a secure aoat network for the US Navy. 
In September, the US Navy’s Strategic 
Systems Programmes Ofce awarded 
BAE Systems a four-year, $72m (£46m) 
contract to continue the provision of logistics 
and supply systems support for the Trident II 
D-5 submarine-launched ballistic missile.
In December, the US Navy’s Naval Air 
Systems Command awarded BAE Systems 
a ve-year contract to provide full lifecycle 
engineering and technical support for 
communication and combat systems on land 
and at sea. The initial award is valued at $28m 
(£18m), with the total value of the ve-year 
contract estimated at $147m (£94m). 
Also in December, the US Navy awarded 
BAE Systems the nine-year DDG VI Radio 
Communications Systems contract to support 
radio and communications systems design 
and integration for 13 guided missile 
destroyers. The initial award is valued at $28m 
(£18m), with the total value of the nine-year 
contract estimated at $187m (£120m).

commercial shipbuild contracts. Charges 
taken in the rst and second half year 
totalled $122m (£74m). The Radford 
munitions contract has now been stabilised, 
with no additional provisioning necessary.

LOOKING FORWARD
Whilst the longer-term outlook remains uncertain, the 2015 scal year omnibus 
appropriations legislation passed in December 2014 included stable Department of 
Defense funding and support for major programmes, including the Group’s Bradley and 
M88 HERCULES vehicles, as well as requested funding for US Navy ship maintenance 
and the Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV) programme.
The business is investing to protect existing combat vehicle programmes and to establish 
new domestic and international programmes, such as the US Army’s AMPV, amphibious 
vehicles and international combat vehicle opportunities to sustain the Group’s US combat 
vehicle manufacturing base. The services and sustainment activities provide continuing 
opportunities for multi-year contracts on existing platforms. 
Recognising the continued challenges in the US market, a restructuring was announced 
in 2014 that realigned the Support Solutions business across the remaining US operating 
sectors. A business area which develops and maintains systems supporting critical 
missions for the US military will be reported in Intelligence & Security in 2015. As a result 
of the realignment of Support Solutions, the reporting segment retains all of the Land & 
Armaments businesses, as well as Ship Repair, Ordnance Systems and Protection 
Systems from Support Solutions. This change will allow the business to deliver more 
comprehensive, integrated and cost-effective product and service offerings across a full 
range of naval, land and individual warghter platforms. 37

Military Air & Information
In the year, deliveries of Typhoon Tranche 2 
aircraft to the four Euroghter partner nations 
totalled 16, bringing the cumulative number 
of Tranche 2 aircraft delivered to 219 of the 
contracted 236. Eighteen Tranche 3 front 
fuselage sub-assemblies were manufactured 
in the year. During 2014, there have been 
certain issues regarding acceptance of 
Typhoon Tranche 3 aircraft. Whilst the UK 
customer has continued to accept the 
aircraft, acceptances by Germany, Italy and 
Spain are held pending the completion of 
further technical and safety reviews by the 
NATO Euroghter and Tornado Management 
Agency, which are planned to be concluded 
during the rst quarter of 2015.
Work on the Omani Typhoon and Hawk 
aircraft contract continues, with  
sub-assembly manufacture for both aircraft 
types commencing and rst deliveries on 
schedule for 2017.
In July, BAE Systems was awarded a 
three-year, £72m contract by the UK 
Ministry of Defence to de-risk E-Scan 
radar development for the Royal Air Force’s 
Typhoon aircraft eet. In November, the 
four partner nations placed a contract with 
Euroghter for the full integration of the 
Captor E-Scan radar onto Typhoon aircraft 
and, as the system integrator, this award 
is worth £365m.
BAE Systems continues to support its UK 
and European customers’ Typhoon and 
Tornado aircraft and their operational 
commitments. The business supports its UK 
customer through availability-based service 
contracts. A £125m contract extension was 
received in the year to provide support to the 
Royal Air Force’s Tornado GR4 eet until the 
aircraft’s planned retirement in 2019. In 
December, BAE Systems was awarded a 
£112m contract to extend the Typhoon 
Availability Service for the in-service support 
of the Royal Air Force’s Typhoon eet by 
15 months.
On the F-35 Lightning II programme, 
BAE Systems has continued to deliver 
aircraft fuselages for the sixth and seventh 
Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP) contracts, 
with a total of 45 assemblies delivered to 
Lockheed Martin in 2014. Contract award 
for LRIP 8 for 43 assemblies was received 
in the year and manufacturing commenced. 
Proposals for LRIP 9 and 10 have been 
submitted with negotiations to commence 
in 2015.
Support continues to be provided to users 
of Hawk trainer aircraft around the world. In 
2014, the Indian Navy and Air Force received 
four and 15 Hawk aircraft, respectively, built 
under the Batch 2 licence for 57 aircraft by 
Hindustan Aeronautics Limited. A response 
to a proposal for an additional 20 Hawk 
aircraft for the Indian Air Force’s aerobatic 
display team has been submitted.
Working jointly with Dassault Aviation, 
progress is being made in maturing and 
demonstrating critical technology and 
operational aspects for an Unmanned 
Combat Air System. In November, the 
signature of a two-year feasibility study, 
worth a total of £120m to the six 
participating companies, was announced by 
the UK and French governments to continue 
joint Future Combat Air System technology 
development. The contract value to 
BAE Systems is £34m.
Taranis, the stealthy unmanned combat air 
vehicle demonstrator designed and built by 
BAE Systems with UK industry partners and 
the Ministry of Defence, has successfully 
completed a second phase of ight testing. 
During these latest tests, Taranis ew in a 
fully stealthy conguration.
The business undertook a review to 
ensure that its organisational operating 
model was aligned with its strategy and 
to improve competitiveness, which resulted 
in the announcement of 440 potential 
management redundancies in October.
Maritime
The consolidation of BAE Systems’ UK 
shipbuilding operations in Glasgow is 
progressing to plan, with shipbuilding 
operations at Portsmouth ceasing in the 
second half of 2014. The restructuring 
programme concludes in 2016.
BAE Systems has continued to negotiate 
contracts with the Ministry of Defence to 
enact the restructuring of its naval ships 
business. During the year, contracts were 
signed for the recovery of associated 
rationalisation costs and the revised target 
cost arrangements for the delivery of the 
Queen Elizabeth Class aircraft carriers. 
In August, BAE Systems was awarded a 
£348m contract to construct three new 
River Class Offshore Patrol Vessels for the

aircraft. There are a number of opportunities to secure future Typhoon export sales.
In Maritime, sales are underpinned by the design and subsequent build of the Successor 
submarine and Type 26 frigates, and the build of the Queen Elizabeth Class aircraft carriers 
and Astute Class submarines. The through-life support of these platforms, plus the Type 
45 destroyer, together with their associated command and combat systems, provides a 
sustainable business in technical services and mid-life upgrades.
Combat Vehicles (UK) continues to provide engineering support to a large installed base 
of vehicles across UK and export markets. The business is pursuing obsolescence and

of interests in a number of industrial companies in Saudi Arabia is intended to increase 
growth prospects and reinforce an ongoing commitment to support the national objectives 
of local skills and technology development, increasing employment and developing an 
indigenous defence industry.
In Australia, the government has increased the defence budget by 8% for the 2014–15 
scal year and remains on track to increase annual defence expenditure to 2% of Gross 
Domestic Product within a decade. Following delivery of the second Landing Helicopter 
Dock in 2015, the Williamstown shipyard needs a follow-on shipbuilding programme to 
sustain capability. In the longer term, there are signicant opportunities in the naval 
domain as Australia modernises its submarine and surface eets to strengthen its 
ability to secure access to sea lines of communication across the Indo-Pacic region.
In Oman, the business continues to provide support to its products in service to position 
for future requirements.
MBDA continues to build on the effective partnerships it has established with its domestic 
customers and is pursuing actively a signicant number of export opportunities, including 
substantial air defence requirements and weapons packages linked to prospective aircraft 
and naval procurements.  43

Strategic Report
In order to support the delivery of the 
strategy, our responsible business activities 
focus on the wider impacts of our business 
which have the most potential to affect the 
long-term value of the Group. Specically, we 
focus on ethics and governance, employee 
safety and wellbeing, diversity and inclusion, 
and operational environmental impacts. 
Areas, such as ethics, are managed at 
Group level. Others, such as diversity and 
inclusion, are managed locally, where teams 
apply local knowledge to making a difference 
and drive change.
Achievement of objectives for employee 
safety is directly linked to the remuneration 
of executive directors and other members 
of the Executive Committee.
Priorities for diversity and inclusion were 
set within each member of the Executive 
Committee’s personal development plan. 
An assessment of progress against these 
actions is determined by the Chief Executive 
as part of each Executive Committee 
member’s annual performance review.
Trust and integrity
To earn and retain our customers’ trust, we 
need to manage our operations responsibly 
and conduct our business in an ethical way.
We continue to embed our ethics programme 
globally, driving the right behaviours by 
supporting employees in making ethical 
decisions and embedding responsible 
business practices.
We have reinforced our commitment to 
ethical behaviour, with our employees 
receiving ethics training during 2014. 
Additional compliance-based e-learning 
training was also targeted at employees 
throughout the year. A refreshed Code of 
Conduct will be rolled out to all employees 
during the rst half of 2015.
If employees (or third parties) need help or 
guidance in addition to that provided by the 
Code of Conduct, or want to report a 
concern, they can call the Ethics Helpline, 
which is managed by a third party and is 
available 24 hours of every day using a 
freephone number from most countries. 
Employees can also get independent advice 
and support, or report concerns, via Ethics 
Ofcers, now in place across the business, 
or via the Ethics Helpline e-mail address, 
which is also made available to third parties 
via our website. During 2014, 1,037 
enquiries were reported to Ethics Ofcers 
and through the Ethics Helpline
1
.
Our governance framework covers the 
products we make and export. Our 
Responsible Trading Principles, Product 
Trading Policy and Pursuit of Export 
Opportunities Policy help employees to  
make informed decisions about the business 
opportunities we pursue and to address 
any responsible trading risks.
We are committed to respecting human 
rights in our operations, within our sphere 
of inuence.
During 2014, the Ethical Leadership Group, now 
called the Advisory Services Practice of NAVEX 
Global, conducted an assessment of our business 
conduct programme. During the assessment, 
NAVEX Global assessed documents, conducted 
interviews with senior leaders and held focus 
groups with our employees globally to assess 
perceptions of the programme. 
NAVEX Global’s report concludes that our 
business conduct programme continues to make 
progress and is now, in many respects, a best 
practice programme.
NAVEX Global’s report ndings focused on 
further embedding and maturing the Group’s 
business conduct programme, including 
recommendations for continued improvements 
in socialising and embedding new and existing 
processes consistently across the Group; 
ongoing assessment and improvement of the 
programme elements; and training for line 
managers and supervisors.
ETHICS DATA
All enquiries reported to Ethics Ofcers and via the 
Ethics Helpline were reviewed and reported either to 
the Ethics Review Committee or, in BAE Systems, Inc., 
to the Ethics Review Oversight Committee.
If an employee is found to be in breach of the Group’s 
Code of Conduct or any other relevant policies, 
appropriate disciplinary action, which may include 
dismissal, is taken.

Our employees 
Our employees are integral to our success. 
We value the talents and skills that our 
global workforce of 83,400
1
 people in 
40 countries brings to our business. 
Engaging and developing our workforce 
for current and future business is key to 
delivering our strategy successfully. We are, 
therefore, committed to attracting, selecting, 
developing and retaining the best people to 
deliver this.
Global training and development 
programmes support employees in making 
the most of their talents. Programmes are 
focused on continuous learning and 
development, using a blend of e-learning, 
classroom training and partnerships with 
academic institutions. 
We work with the education sectors in each 
of our markets to help shape the workforce 
of the future with a particular emphasis on 
encouraging young people to pursue careers 
in Science, Technology, Engineering and 
Mathematics (STEM).
During 2014, we recruited 275 graduates 
and 583 apprentices to support the talent 
pipeline in the UK.
The US business contributed in excess of 
$2m (£1m) to support accredited institutions 
and organisations that develop teachers 
and our future workforce by encouraging 
students to pursue and thrive in STEM 
disciplines. BAE Systems, Inc. recruited 
approximately 2,400 employees within the 
STEM disciplines during 2014, representing 
approximately 40% of employees recruited.
We are committed to creating an inclusive 
work environment where a diverse range of 
talented people can work together to ensure 
business delivery. Diversity amongst our 
workforce is a signicant force for innovation.
We focus on our goal of building a diverse 
workforce which reects that of the 
populations we recruit from. A particular 
current focus is increasing female 
representation in the pipeline for senior roles. 
Engaging our employees to help them make 
the fullest contribution to the business is 
important. Through a variety of media, we 
seek to listen to employees’ views and 
opinions, and keep them informed about 
developments and prospects for the 
business. Regular internal communication, 
including e-enabled channels, leadership 
blogs, newsletters, management and team 
meetings, monthly team briefs and the 
intranet, keeps employees informed, 
involved and engaged.
The Group welcomes employees becoming 
shareholders in BAE Systems and offers 
a number of employee share plans to 
support this.
During 2014, employees had the opportunity 
to provide feedback via our engagement 
survey (see page 20). 
Safety of our employees, and anybody who 
works on, or visits, our sites, is a key priority. 
We continue to embed a ‘safety rst’ 
approach by providing training and tools that 
help employees to understand the importance 
of a safe workplace, and encouraging 
employees to take responsibility for their 
own safety and the safety of those around 
them. Senior leadership plays a key role in 
maintaining the focus on safety and leading 
through example.

In 2014, the Executive Committee 
progressed actions to grow the female 
talent pipeline at senior executive levels:
Fostering a culture of inclusion – further 
to the unconscious bias training for all 
leaders which was rolled out during 2013, 
there was a focus in 2014 on raising further 
awareness and understanding. This included 
a UK-wide ‘Diversity and Inclusion Week’, 
which was the rst targeted awareness 
campaign for all employees in the UK. In the 
US, a month-long celebration of the UN’s 
‘Do One Thing for Diversity and Inclusion’ 
campaign and ‘Going Global’ engagement 
events were conducted at several sites.
Accelerating the development of  
high-potential women – an Executive 
Committee mentoring programme was 
launched in 2012 providing support and 
development to 46 participants in two 
cohorts. The programme has supported 90% 
of the rst cohort and 50% of the second to 
promotions or moves into broader roles.
Increasing leadership diversity – to ensure 
diverse candidate lists for leadership roles, 
where possible, executive search rms 
were employed with a track record of open 
and inclusive recruitment processes, and 
drawing from an appropriately diverse pool 
of candidates, with the overall aim of 
appointing the best person for the role. 
During 2014, the percentage of external 
female candidates hired in the leadership 
population was 20%. 
Measuring performance – on a national 
basis, dened goals and actions have been 
put in place to increase gender diversity. 
Gender diversity in leadership positions 
and succession plans is monitored.
DIVERSITY IS KEY TO A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS 46

Annual Report 2014
Strategic Report
The metric used to measure workplace 
injuries is the Recordable Accident Rate 
which, along with the number of major 
injuries, is used to determine an element 
of executive bonus. During 2014, the 
Recordable Accident Rate
1
 decreased by 
11%, consistent with the improvement 
target set. This progress represents a 
seventh consecutive year of improvement. 
The number of major injuries
1
 was reduced 
by 32% to 44 (see page 20).
We recognise that a healthy workforce is 
a more engaged and productive one and, 
during 2014, we continued to promote an 
enterprise-wide campaign on employee 
wellbeing.
Key relationships
Our employees are critical to the delivery 
of our strategy, but it is also how we work 
responsibly with others that supports 
our success.
We work with suppliers who embrace 
standards of ethical behaviour consistent 
with our own.
We require our suppliers to comply with 
local legislation. We expect and encourage 
all our suppliers to embrace ethical values 
of a comparable standard to our own. Our 
standards include issues such as ethical 
conduct, health and safety, environment 
and human rights. Compliance to required 
standards is evaluated during the supplier 
selection process and, for existing suppliers, 
as part of ongoing quality and approvals 
assurance. 
Advisers can only work for us after they have 
been approved via our due diligence process 
and authorised by an external panel. 
We continue to work with peers across 
the defence industry to improve ethical 
standards. During 2014, we participated in 
the International Forum on Business Ethical 
Conduct’s industry working group on 
collective action. 
We are committed to strengthening 
relationships and investing in the 
communities in which we operate. This is 
done via local recruitment and employment, 
contracting with local suppliers where 
possible, the taxes we pay and by supporting 
local charities and not-for-prot organisations. 
Globally, we and our employees, through 
the Community Investment programme, 
contributed more than £11m
1
 during 2014 
to local, national and international charities 
and not-for-prot organisations.
RESPONSIBLE 
BUSINESS
CONTINUED
We have global leadership programmes to 
deliver executive development for high-potential 
individuals looking to accelerate their career 
and leadership capability. The diversity, career 
progression and retention of participants is 
monitored on a regular basis to measure the 
effectiveness of these development programmes.
In Australia, our Accelerated Development 
Programme is open to those who are identied 
as high-potential individuals, and who have 
the energy and focus to accelerate their 
development. The programme is designed to 
accelerate high-potential leaders through a 
two-year on-the-job development experience.
Employees are required to participate in a range 
of development activities, including: mentoring 
by a management board or senior lead team 
member; leading business projects that grow and 
stretch them professionally; building a targeted 
individual development plan that addresses 
areas for improvement; access to career 
development coaching; and the opportunity to 
push their career with up to one role change 
during the programme.
Radway Green, the Group’s centre of excellence 
for the design, manufacture, proong and supply 
of small arms ammunition at the Munitions 
business in the UK, has won a prestigious 
Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents 
(RoSPA) Gold Medal for reducing injuries and 
its commitment to continuous improvement 
in accident and ill-health prevention at work. 
The medal is awarded once a company has 
received ve consecutive Gold awards in RoSPA’s 
annual Occupational Health and Safety Awards. 
Other Munitions sites, Bishopton Environmental 
Test Facility, Ridsdale Range and Washington, each 
received an individual 2014 RoSPA Gold award. 
DEVELOPING OUR PEOPLE EXTERNAL RECOGNITION FOR SAFETY PERFORMANCE
In April, our San Diego shipyard received two 
awards for its sustainability efforts.
The rst award came from the Port of San Diego, 
which honoured environmentally-conscious 
port businesses that have shown exemplary 
environmental achievements. During a 12-month 
assessment period, the San Diego yard achieved 
a reduction in energy, water and waste. The 
shipyard currently uses oily water separators, 
which process large quantities of industrial waste 
water and remove the free-oating oil, grease 
and raw petroleum hydrocarbons from waste 
water, allowing for reduction of the amount of 
hazardous waste disposed.
The second award came from the County of 
San Diego on Earth Day. The sustainable 
business award was given, in part, for the 
shipyard’s efforts to manage waste with an 80% 
diversion rate to landlls. Paper waste produced 
in ofces is 100% recycled. Metals and abrasive 
blasting materials are recycled and diverted.

Resource efciency 
Minimising the impact on the environment 
of our operations and products, and using 
resources more efciently are focus areas.
Our primary operational impacts on the 
environment are through the use of energy 
used for heating and lighting work spaces. 
We have relatively few energy-intensive 
processes. Water use is typically linked 
to employee numbers, apart from in our 
Munitions business where water is used 
via steam and cooling. In the majority of 
businesses, waste is of high value and 
recycled wherever possible.
Our businesses have targets in place to 
reduce the environmental impact of their 
operations and products by reducing energy, 
water and waste at a local level. These 
targets address specic issues or strategic 
aims. At Group level, we monitor business 
performance against targets and review 
global trend data. During 2014, at Group 
level, we decreased the amount of electricity 
and natural gas used, and hazardous waste 
generated. However, water used and 
non-hazardous waste generated increased 
reecting throughput on programmes, 
particularly at shipyard, submarine and 
munitions sites.
Our reported greenhouse gas emissions 
have decreased by 4% between 2013 
and 2014. The reduction in Scope 1 and 
2 emissions has been mainly due to a 
decrease in purchased electricity across 
our business as a result of various energy 
management initiatives. Our Scope 3 
emissions have reduced by 9% largely 
due to improvements in the environmental 
efciency of commercial ights and a 
marginal decrease in business travel. 
We have maintained a per employee rate 
of 18 tonnes CO

Businesses have environmental 
management systems in place that monitor 
and manage impacts from greenhouse gas 
emissions, material and solvent use, waste 
products and emissions to the atmosphere.
Environmental considerations are taken 
into account throughout a product’s lifecycle 
from concept, design and manufacture 
through to use and disposal. This includes 
reducing the environmental impacts of our 
products during research and development, 
minimising waste materials during 
manufacturing, and helping to reduce the 
impact of our products when they are used, 
upgraded or disposed of.

Methodology
The sources of greenhouse gas emissions fall within 
the Group’s consolidated nancial statements. 
Emissions from joint ventures and pension scheme 
properties not occupied by the Group are not included.
The greenhouse gas emissions data is in line with 
the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Accounting 
and Reporting Standard (revised version) and 
emission factors for fuels and electricity from the 
UK government’s Department for Environment 
Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA), published at  
www.ukconversionfactorscarbonsmart.co.uk/
The CO
2
e associated with carbon dioxide, methane 
and nitrous oxide is reported. Greenhouse gas 
emissions associated with hydrouorocarbons, 
peruorocarbons and sulphur hexauoride are 
estimated to be immaterial to total emissions.
The principal record of the Group’s worldwide facilities 
is its legal department’s Global Property Database.
Greenhouse gas emissions are primarily calculated 
from energy consumption records reported via the 
Group’s global environmental database. Where 
actual usage data is not available for facilities and 
residences within the Global Property Database, an 
estimated consumption is used based on the type 
of building.
Greenhouse gas emissions related to business travel 
include air travel data for the majority of the global 
business and rail data for business units operating in 
the UK and US. These data are taken from suppliers’ 
procurement records.

HOW WE  
MANAGE  
RISK
Board
The Board has overall responsibility for 
determining the nature and extent of the risk 
it is willing to take within the strategy, and 
ensuring that risks are managed effectively 
across the Group.
Risk is a regular agenda item at Board 
meetings and the Board reviews risk as part 
of its annual strategy review process. This 
provides the Board with an appreciation of 
the key risks within the business and 
oversight of how they are being managed.
The Board delegates certain risk management 
activities to the Audit and Corporate 
Responsibility committees as follows.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee monitors the Group’s 
key risks identied by the risk assessment 
processes and reports its ndings to the 
Board twice a year. It is also responsible for 
reviewing in detail the effectiveness of the 
Group’s system of internal control policies, 
and procedures for the identication, 
assessment and reporting of risk.
Corporate Responsibility Committee
The Corporate Responsibility Committee 
monitors the Group’s performance in 
managing the Group’s signicant non-nancial 
risks, including those arising in respect of 
business conduct, health and safety, and 
the environment, and reports its ndings to 
the Board on a regular basis.
Approach
The Group’s approach to risk management 
is aimed at the early identication of key 
risks, mitigating the effect of those risks 
before they occur and dealing with them 
effectively if they crystallise.
The Group is committed to the protection of 
its assets, which include human, intellectual 
and physical property, and nancial 
resources, through an effective risk 
management process, underpinned where 
appropriate by insurance.
Reporting within the Group is structured so 
that key issues are escalated through the 
management team and ultimately to the Board 
where appropriate. The underlying principles 
of the Group’s risk management policy are 
that risks are monitored continuously, 
associated action plans reviewed, appropriate 
contingencies provisioned and this 
information reported through established 
management control procedures.
The Board has conducted a review of the 
effectiveness of the Group’s systems of 
risk management and internal control 
processes, including nancial, operational 
and compliance controls and risk 
management systems, in accordance with 
the UK Corporate Governance Code. The 
Company has developed a system of internal 
controls that was in place throughout 2014 
and to the date of this report.
As with any system of internal control, the 
policies and processes that are mandated 
in the Operational Framework are designed 
to manage rather than eliminate the risk 
of failure to achieve business objectives 
and can only provide reasonable, and not 
absolute, assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
Financial and non-nancial risks
Financial risks expose the Group to potential 
costs which are quantiable on the basis 
that their probability and impact can be 
understood adequately and related to the 
nancial statements.
Non-nancial risks cannot be assessed readily 
in nancial terms and, therefore, cannot be 
reected reliably in the nancial statements.
Process
Businesses
The responsibility for risk identication, 
analysis, evaluation and mitigation rests 
with the line management of the businesses. 
They are also responsible for reporting and 
monitoring key risks in accordance with 
established processes under the Group’s 
Operational Framework.
The Group’s risk management process is set 
out in the Risk Management Policy, a mandated 
policy under the Operational Framework, 
and, in respect of projects, in the Lifecycle 
Management Framework, a core business 
process under the Operational Framework. 
Further guidance is provided by a Risk 
Management Maturity self-assessment tool.
Identied risks are documented in risk 
registers showing: the risks that have been 
identied; characteristics of the risk; the 
basis for determining mitigation strategy; 
and what reviews and monitoring are 
necessary. Each risk is allocated an owner 
who has authority and responsibility for 
assessing and managing it.
Project risks are reported and monitored in 
Group-mandated format Contract Review 
Packs, which are reviewed by management 
at monthly Contract Reviews. The nancial 
performance of projects is reported and 
monitored using Contract Status Reports, 
which form part of the Contract Review Pack. 
These include programme margin metrics, 
which are reviewed regularly by the Executive 
Committee and Board (see page 20). Project 
margin is recognised after making suitable 
allowances for technical and other risks 
related to performance milestones yet to 
be achieved.
In addition, every six months, the businesses 
complete an Operational Assurance 
Statement (OAS), which is a mandated policy 
under the Operational Framework. The OAS 
is in two parts: a self-assessment of 
compliance with the Operational Framework; 
and a report showing the key nancial and 
non-nancial risks for the relevant business. 
Together with reviews undertaken by Internal 
Audit and the work of the external auditors, 
the OAS forms the Group’s process for 
reviewing the effectiveness of the system 
of internal controls.
Executive Committee
The key nancial and non-nancial risks 
identied by the businesses from the risk 
assessment processes are collated and 
reviewed by the Executive Committee to 
identify those issues where the cumulative 
risk, or possible reputational impacts, could 
be signicant.
Management responsibility for the 
management of the Group’s most signicant 
non-nancial risks is determined by the 
Executive Committee. The OAS and 
non-nancial Risk registers are reviewed 
regularly by the Executive Committee to 
monitor the status and progression of 
mitigation plans, and these key risks are 
reported to the Board on a regular basis.
Principal risks
The Board has carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing 
the Company, including those that would 
threaten its business model, future 
performance, solvency and liquidity. Such 
risks have been identied as principal based 
on the likelihood of occurrence and the 
potential impact on the Group, and have 
been identied through the application of 
the policies and processes outlined above. 
These risks, together with details of how 
they are being mitigated and managed, are 
detailed on pages 50 to 53. 
As a result of its assessment of the Group’s 
principal risks, the Board has determined 
that a number of risks identied as being 
principal risks in the 2013 Annual Report, 
while still risks for the Group, are no longer 
considered to be principal risks and has 
added an additional risk relating to the  
Group’s employees (see page 53). 
Effective management of risks and opportunities 
is essential to the delivery of the Group’s strategic 
objectives, achievement of sustainable shareholder 
value, protection of its reputation and meeting the 
requirements of good corporate governance.

PRINCIPAL 
RISKS
Risks are identied as principal based on the 
likelihood of occurrence and the potential 
impact on the Group. The Group’s principal 
risks are identied below, together with a 
description of how we mitigate those risks.
1.
DEFENCE SPENDING
The Group is dependent on defence spending.
Description
 – In 2014, 93% of the Group’s sales were 
defence-related.
 – Defence spending by governments can 
uctuate depending on political 
considerations, budgetary constraints, 
specic threats and movements in the 
international oil price.
 – There have been constraints on government 
expenditure in a number of the Group’s 
principal markets, in particular in the US and 
UK, and there is a risk that there may be 
further reductions.
 – With the Eurozone area experiencing nancial 
difculties, affordability continues to be a key 
focus for customers.
Impact
 – Lower defence spending by the Group’s major 
customers could have a material adverse 
effect on the Group’s future results and 
nancial condition.
Mitigation
 – The business is geographically spread across 
US, UK and international defence markets.
 – The diverse product and services portfolio is 
marketed across a range of defence markets.
 – BAE Systems has a growing portfolio of 
commercial businesses, including commercial 
avionics and the commercial areas of the 
Applied Intelligence business. Sales in 
commercial markets represented 7% of the 
Group’s sales in 2014.
 – In Saudi Arabia, regional tensions continue to 
dictate that defence remains a high priority.
2.
GOVERNMENT CUSTOMERS
The Group’s largest customers are governments.
Description
 – The Group has long-standing relationships 
and security arrangements with a number of 
its government customers, including its three 
largest customers, the governments of the 
UK, US and Saudi Arabia, and their agencies. 
It is important that these relationships and 
arrangements are maintained.
 – In the defence and security industries, 
governments can typically modify contracts or 
terminate them at short notice. Long-term US 
government contracts, for example, are 
funded annually and are subject to 
cancellation if funding appropriations for 
subsequent periods are not made.
 – The Group’s performance on its contracts 
with some government customers is subject 
to nancial audits and other reviews which 
can result in adjustments to prices and costs.
Impact
 – Deterioration in the Group’s principal 
government relationships resulting in the 
failure to obtain contracts or expected funding 
appropriations, adverse changes in the terms 
of its arrangements with those customers or 
their agencies, or the termination of contracts 
could have a material adverse effect on the 
Group’s future results and nancial condition.
Mitigation
 – Government customers have sophisticated 
procurement and security organisations with 
which the Group can have long-standing 
relationships with well-established and 
understood terms of business.
 – In the event of a customer termination for 
convenience, the Group would typically be 
paid for work done and commitments made 
at the time of termination.
3.
INTERNATIONAL MARKET
The Group operates in an international market.
Description
 – BAE Systems is an international company 
conducting business in a number of regions, 
including the US and Middle East.
 – The risks of operating in some countries 
include: political changes impacting the 
business environment; economic downturns, 
political instability and civil disturbances; 
changes in government regulations and 
administrative policies; the imposition 
of restraints on the movement of capital; 
and the introduction of burdensome taxes 
or tariffs.
 – The Group is exposed to volatility in currency 
exchange rates, particularly in respect of the 
US dollar, Euro and Saudi Riyal.
Impact
 – The occurrence of any such events could have 
a material adverse effect on the Group’s 
future results and nancial condition.
Mitigation
 – The Group has a balanced portfolio of 
businesses across a number of markets 
internationally.
 – The Group’s policy is to hedge all material rm 
transactional exposures. 51

STRATEGIC  REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Strategic Report
4.
COMPETITION IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS
The Group’s business is subject to signicant competition in international markets.
Description
 – The Group’s business plan depends upon its 
ability to win and contract for high-quality new 
programmes, an increasing number of which 
are expected to be in non-UK/US markets.
 – The Group is dependent upon UK and US 
government support in relation to a number of 
its business opportunities in export markets. 
In the UK, export contracts are often 
structured on a government-to-government 
basis and government support can also 
involve military training, ministerial support 
for promotional activities and nancial 
support through UK Export Finance. In the US, 
most of the Group’s defence export sales are 
delivered through the Foreign Military Sales 
process, under which the importing government 
contracts with the US government.
Impact
 – The Group’s business and future results may 
be adversely impacted if it is unable to 
compete adequately and obtain new business 
in the markets in which it operates.
Mitigation
 – The Group has an international, multi-market 
presence, a balanced portfolio of businesses, 
leading capabilities and a track record of 
delivery on its commitments to its customers.
 – The Group continues to invest in research and 
development, and to reduce its cost base and 
improve efciencies, to remain competitive.
5.
LAWS AND REGULATIONS 
The Group is subject to risk from a failure to comply with laws and regulations. 
Description
 – The Group operates in a highly-regulated 
environment across many jurisdictions and is 
subject, without limitation, to regulations 
relating to import-export controls, money 
laundering, false accounting, anti-bribery and 
anti-boycott provisions. It is important that 
the Group maintains a culture in which it 
focuses on embedding responsible business 
behaviours.
 – Export restrictions could become more 
stringent and political factors or changing 
international circumstances could result in 
the Group being unable to obtain necessary 
export licences.
Impact
 – Failure by the Group, or its sales 
representatives, marketing advisers or others 
acting on its behalf, to comply with these 
regulations could result in nes and penalties 
and/or the suspension or debarment of the 
Group from government contracts or the 
suspension of the Group’s export privileges, 
which could have a material adverse effect on 
the Group.
 – Reduced access to export markets could 
have a material adverse effect on the Group’s 
future results and nancial condition.
Mitigation
 – BAE Systems has a well-established legal and 
regulatory compliance structure aimed at 
ensuring adherence to regulatory 
requirements and identifying any restrictions 
that could adversely impact the Group’s 
activities. A programme is underway to 
enhance resources dedicated to regulatory 
compliance.
 – Internal and external market risk 
assessments form an important element of 
ongoing corporate development and training 
processes.
 – A uniform global policy and process for the 
appointment of advisers engaged in business 
development is in effect.
 – The special compliance ofcer, appointed 
pursuant to commitments concerning ongoing 
regulatory compliance made in the course of 
the 2011 settlement with the US Department 
of State, concluded his monitorship in May 
2014 and, at the invitation of BAE Systems, 
agreed to remain in a limited capacity for a 
limited further period of time. 52

PRINCIPAL  
RISKS
CONTINUED
7.
CONTRACT CASH PROFILES
The Group is dependent on the award timing and cash prole of its contracts.
Description
 – The Group’s prots and cash ows are 
dependent, to a signicant extent, on the 
timing of, or failure to receive, award of 
defence contracts and the prole of cash 
receipts on its contracts.
Impact
 – Amounts receivable under the Group’s 
defence contracts can be substantial and, 
therefore, the timing of, or failure to receive, 
awards and associated cash advances and 
milestone payments could materially affect 
the Group’s prots and cash ows for the 
periods affected, thereby reducing cash 
available to meet the Group’s cash allocation 
priorities, potentially resulting in the need to 
arrange external funding and impacting its 
investment grade credit rating.
Mitigation
 – The Group’s balance sheet continues to be 
managed conservatively in line with its policy 
to retain an investment grade credit rating 
and to ensure operating exibility.
 – The Group monitors a rolling forecast of its 
liquidity requirements to ensure that there is 
sufcient cash to meet its operational needs 
and maintain adequate headroom.
8.
PENSION FUNDING
The Group has an aggregate funding decit in its dened benet pension schemes.
Description
 – In aggregate, there is an actuarial decit 
between the value of the projected liabilities 
of the Group’s dened benet pension 
schemes and the assets they hold.
 – The decits may be adversely affected by 
changes in a number of factors, including 
investment returns, long-term interest rate 
and price ination expectations, and 
anticipated members’ longevity.
Impact
 – Further increases in pension scheme decits 
may require the Group to increase the amount 
of cash contributions payable to these 
schemes, thereby reducing cash available to 
meet the Group’s cash allocation priorities.
Mitigation
 – Following triennial funding valuations of the 
Group’s UK pension schemes during 2014, 
where appropriate, revised decit recovery 
plans have been agreed which run until 2026.
 – Growth of the dened benet pension 
liabilities is expected to be curtailed as, in the 
UK, new employees have been offered dened 
contribution benets since April 2012 and, in 
the US, with effect from January 2013, 
employees no longer accrue salary-related 
benets in dened benet schemes.
 – In 2013, the trustees of a number of UK 
pension schemes entered into arrangements 
to insure against longevity risk for current 
pensioners, covering £4.4bn of liabilities, 
and, in 2014, 38% of BAE Systems Pension 
Scheme pensioners opted to exchange future 
increases on part of their pensions for higher 
non-increasing pensions.
6.
CONTRACT RISK AND EXECUTION
The Group has many contracts, including a small number of large contracts and xed-price contracts.
Description
 – In 2014, 43% of the Group’s sales were 
generated by its 12 largest programmes. 
At 31 December 2014, the Group had 
seven programmes with order backlog 
in excess of £1bn.
 – A signicant portion of the Group’s revenue 
is derived from xed-price contracts. Actual 
costs may exceed the projected costs on 
which the xed prices are agreed and, since 
these contracts can extend over many years, 
it can be difcult to predict the ultimate 
outturn costs.
 – It is important that the Group maintains a 
culture in which it delivers on its projects 
within tight tolerances of quality, time and 
cost performance in a reliable, predictable 
and repeatable manner.
Impact
 – The inability of the Group to deliver on 
its contractual commitments, the loss, 
expiration, suspension, cancellation or 
termination of any one of its large contracts 
or its failure to anticipate technical problems 
or estimate accurately and control costs on 
xed-price contracts could have a material 
adverse effect on the Group’s future results 
and nancial condition.
Mitigation
 – Contract-related risks and uncertainties 
are managed under the Group’s mandated 
Lifecycle Management process.
 – A signicant proportion of the Group’s largest 
contracts are with the UK Ministry of Defence. 
In the UK, development programmes are 
normally contracted with appropriate levels 
of risk being initially held by the customer and 
contract structures are used to mitigate risk 
on production programmes, including where 
the customer and contractor share cost 
savings and overruns against target prices.
 – The Group has a well-balanced spread of 
programmes and signicant order backlog 
which provides forward visibility.
 – The Group has limited exposure to xed-price 
design and development activity which is in 
general more risk intensive than xed-price 
production activity.
 – Robust bid preparation and approvals 
processes are well established throughout 
the Group, with decisions required to be 
taken at the appropriate level in line with 
clear delegations of authority. 53

PEOPLE
The Group’s strategy is dependent on its ability to recruit and retain people with appropriate talent and skills. All employees are 
required to act in accordance with the Group’s policies.
Description
 – Delivery of the Group’s strategy and business 
plan is dependent on its ability to compete to 
recruit and retain people with appropriate 
talent and skills, including those with 
innovative technological capabilities.
 – With constraints on defence spending in its 
UK and US markets, the Group’s business 
plan is targeting an increasing level of 
business in international export markets. It is 
important that the Group recruits and retains 
management with the necessary international 
skills and experience in the relevant 
jurisdictions.
 – It is important that all employees act in 
accordance with the requirements of the 
Group’s policies, including the Code of 
Conduct, at all times.
Impact
 – The loss of key employees or inability to 
attract the appropriate people on a timely 
basis, in particular to deliver the Group’s 
strategy in international markets, could 
adversely impact its ability to meet the 
business plan and, accordingly, have a 
negative impact on the Group’s future 
results and nancial condition.
Mitigation
 – The Group recognises that its employees are 
key to delivering its strategy and business 
plan, and focuses on developing the existing 
workforce and hiring talented people to meet 
current and future requirements.
 – The Group has well-established graduate 
recruitment and apprenticeship programmes 
and, in order to maximise the contribution 
that its workforce can make to the 
performance of the business, has an 
effective through-career capability 
development programme.
 – In order to seek to maximise its talent pool, 
the Group is committed to creating a diverse 
and inclusive environment for its employees.
 – BAE Systems continues to embed its ethics 
programme globally, driving the right 
behaviours by supporting employees in 
making ethical decisions and embedding 
responsible business practices.
9.
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SECURITY
The Group could be negatively impacted by information technology security threats.
Description
 – The security threats faced by the Group 
include threats to its information technology 
infrastructure, unlawful attempts to gain 
access to its proprietary or classied 
information and the potential for business 
disruptions associated with information 
technology failures.
Impact
 – Failure to combat these risks effectively could 
negatively impact the Group’s reputation 
among its customers and the public, cause 
disruption to its business operations, and 
could result in a negative impact on the 
Group’s future results and nancial condition.
Mitigation
 – The Group has a broad range of measures 
in place, including appropriate tools and 
techniques, to monitor and mitigate this risk.
1.
THE GROUP IS DEPENDENT UPON COMPONENT AVAILABILITY, SUBCONTRACTOR PERFORMANCE AND KEY SUPPLIERS
In the improving global economic environment, the Group has not identied any specic, material risks in relation to its 
strategically important subcontractors or suppliers.
2.
THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF ACQUISITIONS MAY NOT BE ACHIEVED
The Group has not engaged in acquisitions other than bolt-on acquisitions in the last three years.
3.
THE GROUP IS INVOLVED IN CONSORTIA, JOINT VENTURES AND EQUITY HOLDINGS WHERE IT DOES NOT HAVE CONTROL
Whilst the Group has such joint ventures, the principal ones being Euroghter, MBDA and Air Astana (as referred to on page 125), 
its relationships with the joint venture partners are such that the risk of disagreement leading to failure to meet the strategic 
objectives of those joint ventures is not currently regarded as a principal risk to the Group.
Changes in principal risks
As a result of its assessment of the Group’s principal risks referred to on page 48, the Board has determined 
that the following risks, identied as principal risks in the 2013 Annual Report, while still risks for the Group, 
are no longer considered to be principal risks:
Additional risks and uncertainties currently unknown to the Group, or which the Group currently deems immaterial, may also have an adverse 
effect on the business or nancial condition of the Group. 54

GOVERNANCE
SUMMARY
 ‘Every company should 
be headed by an 
effective board which is 
collectively responsible 
for the long-term success 
of the company.’
UK Corporate Governance Code
The Company seeks to maintain the 
highest standards of governance to ensure 
that it is performance-driven, but value-led. 
The Board is focused not simply on how 
much money the Company makes for its 
shareholders, but how it makes money.
To achieve this objective, the Board 
comprises both a strong executive and 
a majority of independent non-executive 
directors who have been selected to 
deliver an appropriate mix of diversity, 
skills and experience.
The Board is led by an independent 
Chairman, who in turn is well-supported 
by a Senior Independent Director.
Board members populate a range of 
formal committees to oversee nancial 
and cultural behaviour in the areas of audit, 
remuneration and corporate responsibility. 
Each committee is chaired by an 
independent non-executive director.
Membership and make-up of the Board, 
both for executive and non-executive roles, 
is carefully considered on a regular basis. 
The Nominations Committee is led by the 
Chairman and includes all non-executive 
directors. The Committee considers all 
Board appointments. In addition, the 
Committee reviews the bench strength of 
the senior executive team in conjunction 
with the Group Human Resources Director 
to assess development needs, resourcing 
and succession planning to meet the 
strategy of the Company.
As part of the succession planning 
process, external search rms are engaged 
to identify suitable candidates for both 
Board executive and non-executive roles 
when appropriate. All appointments are 
made on ability and merit, but the 
Committee recognises and values the 
benet of diversity in Board composition 
and executive management roles.
As a governing body, the Board focuses 
on the principles of openness and 
transparency to ensure the atmospherics 
and dynamics within the boardroom 
remain constructive and healthy. To review 
progress, the Board commissions an 
external independent evaluation every two 
years. In the intervening years, the Board 
undertakes an internal review comprising 
a questionnaire completed by all Board 
members supplemented by individual 
discussion when required. Following 
collective Board discussion on the ndings 
of the review, a plan for performance 
improvement is developed, implemented 
and monitored at six-monthly intervals as 
a Board agenda item.
Details of governance processes and 
procedures are listed opposite.

CORPORATE 
GOVERNANCE 
REPORT
The Board and its responsibilities
The Board has adopted a governance 
structure based on the principles of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code as published in 
September 2012 (the Code), which includes 
the following governance principles:
Strategy – reviewing and agreeing strategy 
for the Company;
Performance – overseeing the performance 
of the Group and also evaluating its own 
performance;
Standards and values – setting standards 
and values to guide the affairs of the Group;
Oversight – monitoring the effectiveness 
of the Company’s risk management and 
internal control systems; and
People – ensuring the Group is managed 
by individuals with the necessary skills and 
experience, and that appointments to the 
Board are managed effectively.
Pursuant to these principles, the Board 
has put in place a detailed governance 
framework, the Operational Framework, 
which includes the Company’s Code of 
Conduct. It sets out how we do business 
across BAE Systems and encapsulates the 
Company’s values, policies and processes, 
together with clear levels of delegated 
authority aimed at ensuring that all of its 
employees and businesses act in a clear, 
accountable and consistent manner.
There is a clear division of responsibility at 
the head of the Company and these are 
detailed in the Operational Framework. The 
Chairman leads the Board and is responsible 
for ensuring that it discharges its duties 
effectively. The Chief Executive is 
responsible for the implementation and 
delivery of the strategy agreed by the Board.
The Senior Independent Director acts as a 
sounding board for the Chairman and acts 
as an intermediary for the other directors 
when necessary. He is also available to 
shareholders if they have concerns which 
cannot be addressed through the normal 
channels. The Company Secretary is 
responsible to the Board for ensuring that 
board procedures are complied with.
In general, non-executive directors help 
develop the Company’s strategy, scrutinise 
the performance of management in meeting 
agreed goals and objectives, and monitor 
the reporting of performance. The Board 
considers all of the non-executive directors, 
with the exception of the Chairman, to be 
independent for the purposes of the Code.
All directors seek election on an annual 
basis at the Annual General Meeting.
Attendance by individual directors at 
meetings of the Board and its committees 
in 2014 is shown above.

Board effectiveness
This section considers the effectiveness of the 
board of directors and the way in which the 
provisions of the Code have been addressed.
Annual evaluation 
The Board’s evaluation in respect of 
performance in 2014 was facilitated 
internally by way of a questionnaire produced 
by the Company Secretary and completed by 
all directors. This included questions on the 
quality of the decisions made, the process 
used to reach those decisions and the 
contribution of individual members of the 
Board. The completed questionnaires were 
analysed by the Chairman and also by the 
Senior Independent Director. The results of 
the survey as they applied to the Board were 
discussed collectively and objectives for 
2015 agreed. The Chairman will meet with 
each director to provide feedback on 
individual performance. Feedback on the 
Chairman’s own performance will be provided 
by the Senior Independent Director, Nick Rose.
Having reviewed the analysis of the feedback 
provided by directors, the Board has agreed 
objectives for 2015, which will be monitored 
and progressed at the board meetings 
scheduled for the year. These include 
objectives concerning Board succession 
planning and how the Company identies 
and develops future leaders. Objectives have 
also been agreed that will build on the 
strategy work the Board undertook last year, 
and ensure that directors continue to 
develop the depth of their understanding of 
both strategic and key operational matters. 
Finally, the Board will continue to rene its 
processes to ensure that the use of modern 
technology improves the efciency and 
effectiveness of reporting.
The Board evaluation also included an 
assessment of performance against the 
objectives agreed for last year. The table 
below summarises this assessment.
Board induction
On appointment, all non-executive directors 
are advised of the likely time commitments 
and are asked to seek approval from the 
Nominations Committee if they wish to take 
on additional external appointments. The 
ability of individual directors to allocate 
sufcient time to the discharge of their 
responsibilities is, where necessary, part 
of the directors’ annual evaluation process 
overseen by the Chairman.
An induction programme is agreed for all 
new directors aimed at ensuring they are 
able to develop an understanding and 
awareness of the Company’s core 
processes, its people and businesses. In 
addition, as part of the induction process, 
new directors will typically visit the Group’s 
principal operations in order to meet 
employees, and gain an understanding of 
the Group’s products and services. Ongoing 
training is provided for the Board and 
individual directors as required.
Information for the Board
The Chairman, with the assistance of the 
Company Secretary, is responsible for 
ensuring that directors are supplied with 
information in a timely manner that is in a 
form and of a quality appropriate to enable 
them to discharge their duties. 
In the normal course of business, such 
information is provided by the Chief 
Executive in a regular report to the Board 
that includes information on operational 
matters, strategic developments, reports 
on the performance of Group operations, 
nancial performance relative to the business 
plan, business development, corporate 
responsibility and investor relations.
BOARD OBJECTIVES AND ACHIEVEMENTS
2014 OBJECTIVES 2014 ACHIEVEMENTS
Strategy
Focus on developing a more detailed strategic 
understanding of the Company’s businesses 
and markets.
Ensure that the strategy for the Company’s 
Applied Intelligence business is optimised to 
access fully the growth potential of the cyber 
security market.
 
During 2014, the Board undertook a comprehensive review of the business, which has provided a deeper 
understanding of current activity and has established a platform for longer-term strategic planning.
 
The strategy for Applied Intelligence continued to develop during the year, with the SilverSky acquisition 
accelerating the Group’s strategy to grow its commercial cyber business.
Succession planning
Engage with all directors on executive 
development and succession planning. 
Increase the levels of diversity and bench 
strength in key roles and make progress 
against the Company’s diversity objectives. 
 
The membership of the Nominations Committee was expanded to include all non-executive directors 
during the year. This has helped facilitate wider board-level engagement on executive development 
and succession planning. 
During the year, the Board initiated additional work on diversity and succession planning for key 
roles, but it is recognised that there is more to do in these areas and this is reected in the Board’s 
2015 objectives. 
Risk and risk management
The Board to continue reviewing the level 
of risk it is willing to take in achieving its 
strategic objectives. 
 
A review of principal risks was incorporated into the Board’s strategy review process. 
Board development
Develop a wider understanding by all directors 
of the use and management of commercial 
offset arrangements.
Use site visits by individual non-executive 
directors to help develop a deeper 
understanding of the Company. 
 
Facilitated by the Group Finance Director and Group Business Development executives, non-executive 
directors participated in a training session aimed at developing a deeper understanding of the 
management of commercial offset.
Whilst some site visits were undertaken by directors during the year, additional emphasis will be placed 
on this in 2015. 60
BAE Systems
Annual Report 2014
Governance
Business planning and 
going concern
The Company has developed an annual 
Integrated Business Planning (IBP) process, 
which comprises a strategic plan, a nancial 
forecast for the current year and nancial 
projections for the next ve years. The IBP 
represents a common process with standard 
outputs and requirements that produces 
consolidated plans at both the Group level 
and at a number of levels within the 
Company. The plan is reviewed each year 
by the Board as part of its strategy review 
process. Once approved by the Board, 
the IBP is cascaded down across all the 
Company’s businesses and provides the 
basis for setting all detailed nancial 
budgets and strategic actions that are 
subsequently used by the Board to 
monitor performance.
In undertaking its review of the IBP in 
2014, the Board considered the prospects 
of the Company over the one and ve-year 
periods covered by the process. The 
one-year planning period has a greater 
level of certainty and is, therefore, used to 
set detailed budgetary targets at all levels 
across the Group – it is also used by the 
Remuneration Committee to set targets 
for the annual incentive. The ve-year 
period provides less certainty of outcome, 
but provides a robust planning tool against 
which strategic decisions can be made. 
On the basis of this and other matters 
considered and reviewed by the Board 
during the year, the Board has reasonable 
expectations that the Company will be able 
to continue in operation and meet its 
liabilities as they fall due over the periods 
used for the assessment. In doing so, it is 
recognised that such future assessments 
are subject to a level of uncertainty that 
increases with time and, therefore, future 
outcomes cannot be guaranteed or predicted 
with certainty. Also, this assessment was 
made recognising the principal risks that 
could have an impact on the future 
performance of the Company (see pages 
50 to 53).
Accounting standards require that directors 
satisfy themselves that it is reasonable for 
them to conclude whether it is appropriate 
to prepare nancial statements on a going 
concern basis. The Group’s business 
activities, together with factors that are 
likely to affect its future development 
and position, are set out in the segmental 
performance section on pages 27 to 42. 
The nancial position of the Group, including 
information on cash ow, can be found in 
the nancial review section on pages 22 to 
26. Principal risks are detailed on pages 50 
to 53. In addition, the nancial statements 
include, amongst other things, notes on 
nance costs (page 113) and nancial risk 
management, including treasury policies on 
interest rate, liquidity, currency and credit 
risk (pages 150 and 151). After making due 
enquiry, the directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group has adequate 
resources to continue operational existence 
for the foreseeable future. For this reason, 
they continue to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the accounts.
Shareholder engagement
The Company has a well-developed investor 
relations programme managed by the Chief 
Executive, Group Finance Director and 
Investor Relations Director. In addition, the 
Chairman is available to meet with major 
shareholders and is in regular contact with 
them so as to keep them informed of 
progress on corporate governance matters. 
In order to assist in developing an 
understanding of the views of major 
shareholders, each year the Company 
commissions a survey of investors 
undertaken by external consultants. 
The results of the survey are presented 
to the Board.
The Company’s Annual General Meeting 
provides all shareholders with the 
opportunity to vote on the resolutions put 
to shareholders either electronically via the 
Company’s website or by post. All resolutions 
detailed in the Notice of Meeting are voted 
on by way of a poll so as to ensure that all 
votes are counted on the basis of one vote 
for every share held. The results of the 
voting on all resolutions are published on 
the Company’s website.

COMMITTEE 
REPORT
Dear Shareholders,
Business risk continues to be a much 
discussed topic in boardrooms and 
governance circles, placing continual 
emphasis on the importance of boards 
understanding the principal risks in their 
businesses and how they are being managed 
effectively. As reported on page 48, the 
Board as a whole has been reviewing risk 
with the Audit Committee supporting this 
activity and also considering the Group’s risk 
disclosures and reporting.
During the year, Ian Tyler assumed 
chairmanship of the Corporate Responsibility 
Committee which provides a helpful crossover 
for us in terms of his wider understanding of 
non-nancial and reputational risk. I also sit 
on the Remuneration Committee where I 
contribute to discussion on risk and reward.
Internal control and risk management
Effective management of risks and 
opportunities is essential to the delivery of 
the Group’s strategic objectives, achievement 
of sustainable shareholder value, protection 
of its reputation and meeting the 
requirement of good corporate governance. 
As set out on page 48, the Board has overall 
responsibility for determining the nature and 
extent of the risk it is willing to take, and 
ensuring that risks are managed effectively 
across the Group. At the Board’s request, 
the Committee has reviewed the Company’s 
principal risks in the light of new provisions 
in the 2014 UK Corporate Governance Code 
covering the assessment of principal risks, 
as well as the Financial Reporting Council’s 
(FRC) associated Guidance on Risk 
Management, Internal Control and Related 
Financial and Business Reporting. Whilst the 
2014 UK Corporate Governance Code does 
not apply to the Company until the next 
nancial year, the Board has elected to 
report on certain of the risk management 
and internal control principles in the new 
code on a best practice basis. 
The way in which the Company manages risk 
is set out on pages 48 and 49, with the 
principal risks facing the Group set out on 
pages 50 to 53.
We have reviewed the ongoing effectiveness 
of the Company’s risk management 
processes as part of our wider review of the 
effectiveness of internal controls.
Our review of internal controls has also 
encompassed a review of the reports relating 
to the six-monthly Operational Assurance 
Statements, which are submitted by each 
business or function as a mandated policy 
under the Group-wide Operational Framework, 
and controls reports and audit reports from 
both internal and external auditors.

A key controls focus for the Committee is the 
controls environment surrounding Lifecycle 
Management (LCM). LCM is integral to the 
successful execution of the Group’s projects 
and programmes, and of particular 
importance in the early identication of 
programme risk and the determination of 
prot recognition or provisioning. We have 
discussed the outputs of general nancial 
and LCM controls testing, and any required 
improvement actions, with management, 
and internal and external audit, with a view 
to ensuring the ongoing robustness of 
programme execution and risk mitigation.
During the year, we met with local senior 
management of the US Support Solutions 
business with regard to performance issues 
identied on commercial shipbuilding 
contracts as well as operational challenges 
identied on the Radford ammunition facility 
maintenance contract. We reviewed and 
discussed with management the wider 
control environment and risk management 
processes surrounding these businesses, 
including programme management controls 
and lessons learned, and the steps being 
taken to address the issues.
We have also received and discussed a 
report from the Group General Counsel 
on compliance with the Company’s Export 
Control Policy.
Financial reporting
The Committee reviews all signicant issues 
concerning the nancial statements. The 
principal matters we considered concerning 
the 2014 nancial statements were:
 – Recognition of prot and provisioning: 
We reviewed key estimates and judgements 
prior to publication of the nancial 
statements. Our review included the key 
estimates and assumptions applied in 
determining the nancial status of the 
more signicant programmes, including 
US commercial shipbuilding contracts.
 – Goodwill: We considered the level of 
goodwill held on the Group’s balance sheet 
in respect of a number of past major 
transactions and whether, given the future 
prospects of these businesses, the value 
of goodwill held on the balance sheet 
remains appropriate. The methodology 
for impairment testing used by the Group 
is set out in note 9 to the Group accounts 
on page 118. 
 – Impairments: the Group has incurred a 
goodwill impairment of £161m, of which 
£87m relates to performance issues in 
the US commercial shipbuilding business 
and £7 4m relates to the proposed disposal 
of the Group’s interest in BAE Systems 
Land Systems South Africa (Pty) Limited.
 – Acquisitions: we considered the 
acquisition accounting for acquisitions 
made in 2014 as set out in note 26 on 
page 147, these being SilverSky, Saudi 
Development and Training Company, and 
Signal Innovations Group, Inc.
 – Pensions: Recognising the scale of the 
Group’s pension obligation, we reviewed 
the key assumptions supporting the 
valuation of the retirement benet 
obligation. This included a comparison 
of the discount and ination rates used 
against externally derived data. We 
reviewed the methodology used to allocate 
a proportion of the retirement benet 
obligation to equity accounted investments 
and other participating employers, and 
concluded that this was appropriate with 
reference to agreements between the 
Company and those companies. We also 
considered the adequacy of disclosures 
in respect of the sensitivity of the decit 
to changes in these key assumptions. 
We noted that the Company and the 
trustees of the UK pension schemes have 
agreed recovery plans (where necessary) 
to address the funding positions resulting 
from the actuarial valuations carried out 
on the Group’s UK dened benet schemes 
in 2014. The Board as a whole has been 
kept apprised of progress in this regard.
 – Taxation: Whilst tax policy is ultimately a 
matter for the Board’s determination, we 
reviewed the Group’s tax strategy as set 
out on page 26. On a twice-yearly basis, 
we reviewed the Group’s tax charge and 
tax provisions. 
Taking into account the revised FRC guidance 
referred to above, the Committee agreed the 
parameters of, and reviewed the supporting 
report for, the going concern statement and 
the statement on the Board’s assessment 
of the prospects of the Company on the one 
and ve-year periods used in the Integrated 
Business Plan.
An intrinsic requirement of a group’s nancial 
statements is for the report and accounts to 
be fair, balanced and understandable. The 
co-ordination and review of the Group-wide 
input into the Annual Report is an extensive 
exercise performed within an exacting time 
frame which runs alongside the formal audit 
process undertaken by the Auditors.
The process to ensure that the Committee, 
and then the Board, are satised with the 
overall fairness, balance and clarity of the 
document has been underpinned by:
 – comprehensive guidance issued to all the 
contributors at operational level;
 – a verication process dealing with the 
factual content of the reports;
 – comprehensive reviews undertaken at 
different levels in the Group that aim to 
ensure consistency and overall balance; and
 – comprehensive review by the directors 
and the senior team.
External audit
The Company’s Auditors are KPMG LLP. The 
Committee has been kept up-to-date with 
the development of new EU-wide regulations 
concerning audit tenure and the longevity of 
audit rm relationships with the companies 
they audit. Under current EU transitional 
arrangements, the Company would be 
required to rotate its auditor by June 2020.
Continuity and consistency of audit quality 
are important, however the Committee is 
also mindful of the fact that KPMG LLP, and 
their legacy predecessors, have been in 
place as the Company’s Auditors since 1981 
without re-tender and it remains our present 
intention to initiate an audit re-tendering 
process not later than 2017 (for the 2018 
accounts) prior to the rotation of the current 
audit engagement partner. This is in line with 
best practice provisions on audit rotation in 
the Code. The Committee will keep this 
re-tendering time frame under review and 
will use our regular reviews of auditor 
effectiveness to assess whether an earlier 
date for a re-tender would be desirable. There 
are no contractual obligations that would 
restrict the selection of a different auditor.
It is the Committee’s view that, given the 
complexity of the audit process at 
BAE Systems, a signicant transition period 
will be required. Plans are being formulated 
to address this and the Committee’s Terms 
of Reference have been amended to enable 
it to oversee the tender process.
The Committee maintains oversight over 
the effectiveness of the Company’s Auditors 
principally by way of an annual review of 
audit effectiveness at the conclusion of each 
year-end audit and to supplement this with 
an in-depth review of audit effectiveness on 
a triennial basis. We undertook our triennial 
review midway through 2014 which enabled 
us to take a deeper look at the service 
provided by our Auditors. This included the 
enhancements made by our lead engagement 
partner after he had completed one full 
annual audit cycle, for example:
 – audit resource skilling, including familiarity 
with our business processes and the 
transfer of knowledge;
 – the planned rotation of lead partners to 
ensure continuity; and
 – enhanced reporting and communications.
KPMG’s plans to support us through our 
future audit transition were outlined and 
discussed. We also looked at fees from a 
value-for-money perspective.

STRATEGIC  REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Governance
We have since assessed the output of the 
annual review undertaken at the close of the 
2014 year-end audit. This review was based 
on a Group-wide evaluation at management 
and functional level, and covered areas 
such as:
 – understanding of the Group’s risks and 
opportunities to facilitate the development 
of an appropriate audit plan;
 – the robustness of audit processes;
 – objectivity;
 – quality of communications; and
 – ability to provide a seamless service 
across differing jurisdictions.
We provided feedback to the Auditors from 
the evaluation and will assess how the 
related actions have been incorporated into 
the 2015 audit plan when the latter has 
been formulated.
On the basis of the reviews undertaken in 
2014, and the review following the 2014 
year-end audit, the Committee proposed to 
the Board that it recommend that shareholders 
support the re-appointment of KPMG LLP at 
the 2015 Annual General Meeting. 
Internal Audit
Internal Audit plays an important role in 
assessing the effectiveness of internal 
controls by a programme of reviews based 
on a continuing assessment of business 
risk across the Group. 
The annual internal audit programme is 
agreed jointly by the Audit and Corporate 
Responsibility committees to ensure that 
the over-arching internal audit programme 
includes the assessment of the 
effectiveness of policies and processes 
relating to key areas of ethical and 
reputational risk, as well as nancial risk. 
The Committee considered the output from 
the 2014 annual internal audit programme 
of assurance work on a six-monthly basis. 
Over the past year, the Committee has 
beneted from interactive sessions with 
the respective heads of Internal Audit for 
the UK businesses, the US businesses 
and the international businesses. This has 
complemented the regular reporting we 
receive from, and private meetings we have 
with, the Internal Audit Director. As part of 
the annual evaluation of the Internal Audit 
function that the Committee oversees each 
year, we have discussed with the Internal 
Audit Director the level of skilling and 
resourcing required to deliver the 2015 
internal audit programme. 
 
Nick Rose 
Chairman of the Audit Committee
AUDITOR INDEPENDENCE – NON-AUDIT SERVICES POLICY
The Committee has a formal policy governing the engagement of the Auditors 
to provide non-audit services which we review on an annual basis. The Policy 
prohibits certain activities from being undertaken by the Auditors such as 
book-keeping and work relating to the preparation of accounting records and 
nancial statements that will ultimately be subject to external audit; nancial 
information system design and implementation; internal auditing; and any work 
where a mutuality of interest is created that could compromise the independence 
of the Auditors. The Policy also places restrictions on the employment of 
former employees of the Auditors.
Recognising that the Auditors are best placed to undertake certain work of 
a non-audit nature, the Policy permits the provision of Audit-Related Services 
and Permitted Non-Audit Services up to limits that are pre-approved by the 
Committee, with specic approvals required beyond such limits by the 
Committee. A copy of the policy is available on the Company’s website. 
Details of fees payable to the Auditors are set out on page 111. In 2014, 
non-audit fees represented 30% of the audit fee. The principal non-audit 
services provided by the Auditors related to tax compliance and advisory 
services, the interim review and equity advisory services.
OTHER KEY AREAS OF WORK UNDERTAKEN BY THE COMMITTEE IN 2014
During the year, the Committee has:
reviewed and challenged the external audit plan to gauge whether it was 
appropriately focused;
considered the accounting, nancial control and audit issues reported by 
the Auditors that owed from the audit work;
reviewed the conrmation and information received from KPMG on the 
arrangements that it has in place to safeguard its independence and 
objectivity;
reviewed and agreed the audit fee;
reviewed and discussed on a quarterly basis the nature and level of non-audit 
fees, and undertaken an annual review of the Non-Audit Services Policy which 
we concluded was still appropriate (see above); 
reviewed the effectiveness of the Company’s helpline procedures in respect 
of the reporting of possible accounting, nancial control or other nancial 
irregularities, which form part of our wider Ethics Helpline procedures, and 
concluded that the procedures continue to work effectively; 
reviewed on a twice-yearly basis the procedures for the identication, 
assessment and reporting of risk; and 
considered corporate governance and accounting developments. 64

RESPONSIBILITY 
COMMITTEE REPORT
Dear Shareholders,
This is the rst Corporate Responsibility 
Committee Report since I succeeded Paul 
Anderson as chairman of the Committee 
in September last year. During Paul’s 
chairmanship, the Committee placed a 
strong focus on ethical conduct, safety, 
and diversity and inclusion. These areas 
will continue to be our priorities.
Last year, the Committee reported that, ve 
years on from the Woolf Committee Report 
on business conduct in BAE Systems, it 
had agreed a number of actions aimed at 
maintaining the impetus and energy we 
have seen in this area. One of the key 
recommendations was that we engaged 
an independent third party to undertake 
a survey of ethical business culture to follow 
up on a similar survey undertaken in 2011.
This survey was undertaken by Ethical 
Leadership Group (NAVEX Global). It was 
completed during 2014 and the Committee 
reviewed the ndings. The survey concluded 
that BAE Systems has all the elements of 
a best practice programme in place and 
should continue to review and mature this. 
However, one of the key messages that we 
took from the report was the need to 
continually reinforce the key messages 
regarding responsible behaviour so as to 
ensure that these are understood across 
the Company at all levels. It emphasised 
also the importance of continuing to 
communicate the standards of behaviour 
we expect of employees and, in particular, 
to provide training and support to those 
with supervisory responsibilities to ensure 
they have the necessary skills to provide 
leadership at all levels across the Company.
The Committee will continue to monitor the 
implementation of the recommendations in 
the report.
As part of the Company’s planned activities, 
responsible behaviour training has been 
undertaken across the Group in 2014 and 
the refresh of the Code of Conduct has been 
completed. This will be issued to all 
employees in 2015.
It is essential that the Company has an 
effective means by which all employees have 
a means of raising matters of concern in 
condence. BAE Systems has both an Ethics 
Helpline through which such matters can be 
raised and also a network of Ethics Ofcers 
to whom employees can raise matters in 
condence. The Company continues to

are able to provide condential support and 
advice to employees on business conduct 
matters and also act as ambassadors for the 
Code of Conduct. The Committee oversees 
the effectiveness of these means of raising 
matters in condence and, twice a year, we 
review the number and nature of the issues 
raised, and monitor how they are resolved. 
The Committee’s overall safety goal for 
the Company remains one of achieving 
world-class levels of safety management. 
Whilst some parts of the Company are 
now achieving these levels, we continue 
to drive for further improvement, and see 
a focus on reducing signicant risks and 
the promotion of a strong safety culture 
as key to achieving continual improvement 
in safety performance. Benchmarking is 
important and, as a Committee, we look at 
a range of performance indicators that 
provide us with comparable information on 
the Company’s safety performance relative 
to other major companies. In addition, the 
leadership shown by senior management in 
driving the right behaviours and expectations 
is critical to achieving our safety objectives, 
and performance in this area is part of the 
executive annual incentive plan, for which the 
Committee sets performance targets and 
makes recommendations to the Remuneration 
Committee on levels of achievement. 
The Committee continues to monitor 
corporate responsibility-related risks and 
it reviews the output from the Company’s 
Internal Audit function regularly so that we 
can be responsive to possible emerging 
issues and trends. Also, to help develop a 
better understanding of particular matters, 
our meetings have included deep dives 
into particular issues. By way of example, 
in 2014, we spent time looking at the 
anti-bribery and corruption compliance 
processes used by the Group Business 
Development function and how they are 
applied in practice in overseas markets. 
The future agenda that we have set for the 
Committee aims to ensure that we maintain 
focus over the priority areas that we believe 
are most important for the Company in 
terms of corporate responsibility. During 
2015, we will undertake a number of deep 
dives into key areas. These will include 
diversity and inclusion, which remains an 
important focus for the Committee and 
where we will be reviewing the progress 
being made against the actions the 
Company has in place to grow the female 
talent pipeline at senior levels. Also, our 
annual programme of meetings includes 
a whole day visit to one of the Company’s 
sites. We have undertaken a number of 
such visits in the past and they have proved 
to be an excellent means of providing 
in-depth rst-hand experience of corporate 
responsibility matters.

REMUNERATION
COMMITTEE 
REPORT
Dear Shareholders,
On behalf of the Board, I am delighted to 
present the Remuneration Committee’s 
Report for 2014. 
We were pleased by the level of shareholder 
support received for our 2013 Remuneration 
Committee Report in our rst year of reporting 
under the new reporting regulations. In 
implementing the Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy (the Policy), we stated that it would 
apply for three years with 2015 being the 
rst year of operation. I am pleased to 
conrm that, for 2015, no revisions are 
proposed to our executive remuneration 
framework which would constitute a change 
to the Policy. However, we remain committed 
to continued transparency and engagement 
with our shareholders and have consulted 
with our major shareholders on proposed 
changes to our executive remuneration 
arrangements for 2015 which may be made 
at the discretion of the Remuneration 
Committee as follows:
Earnings per Share (EPS) performance 
condition applicable to Long-Term Incentive 
(LTI) grants
The current LTI performance metrics of 
5% to 11% average annual EPS growth with 
nil vesting at threshold were developed 
during a period of high-growth expectations 
from our shareholders commensurate with 
the then market opportunities. The metrics 
are no longer deemed appropriate given the 
recent changes in the market for defence 
companies. It is proposed to set a 
performance range of 3% to 7% average 
annual EPS growth for 2015 awards of 
Performance Shares under the Long-Term 
Incentive Plan (LTIP) as this will provide 
executives with an appropriately challenging 
and meaningful incentive to drive performance 
which, at the same time, delivers a level of 
nancial performance which supports capital 
market expectations. Achievement of 
performance at the threshold level represents 
signicant challenge due to the dependency 
on winning several pivotal orders. 
For this reason, it is proposed that there 
should be a level of reward equal to 25% 
of maximum for achievement of threshold. 
Average annual EPS growth of 5% will 
achieve 50% vesting with full vesting 
requiring 7% growth. Whilst not ‘straight-line’ 
vesting (as currently), this vesting prole will 
provide a potential reward for the executives 
which reects the unique set of market 
challenges which are expected in the next 
several years. It is intended that the revised 
EPS performance condition is also subject to 
the same ‘quality of earnings’ performance 
hurdle as applies to the Total Shareholder 
Return (TSR) condition, such that awards 
will not vest unless the Board is satised 
that there has been a sustained

performance of the Company (taking account 
of items such as cash, order book, risk and

The Committee intends to review the 
performance condition again for 2016.
Malus and clawback provisions
Reecting the changes to the malus and 
clawback provisions in the 2014 UK 
Corporate Governance Code, the Committee 
has determined the following: 
 – A two-year clawback period will be added 
to the end of the three-year vesting period 
applicable to Share Options and Restricted 
Shares awarded under the LTIP. This will 
mean that shares delivered on vesting 
and exercise will, except in exceptional 
circumstances, be held on the participant’s 
behalf until the fth anniversary of vesting. 
This policy amendment will apply to all 
awards made from and including 2015 to 
the executive directors and to all members 
of the Executive Committee. 
 – The Committee has also extended the 
denition of circumstances and trigger 
events to cover the emergence of nancial 
‘black holes’ which emerge regardless of 
whether they affect the results for the year 
on which the incentive is based. At the 
same time, the Committee’s ability to 
trigger malus or clawback on the grounds 
of misconduct has been extended to 
cover situations which give rise to 
disciplinary action short of termination. 
This policy amendment will apply to all 
awards made from and including 2015 
to all participants.
We will also maintain our requirement for 
executive directors to build up a signicant 
personal shareholding, which stands at 
300% of salary for the Chief Executive, 350% 
for the President and Chief Executive Ofcer 
of BAE Systems, Inc. and at 200% for the 
Group Finance Director.
Business performance in 2014
In 2014, BAE Systems delivered a solid 
overall performance. Pages 18 to 21 set 
out the performance against our 2014 
annual objectives, which focus on 
deliverables in support of both short-term 
results and the overall long-term strategy. 
For the purpose of incentives applicable 
to the executive directors:
 – order intake of £15.1bn was between 
target and stretch performance;
 – excluding the prior year retrospective 
benet from the Salam price escalation, 
underlying earnings per share increased 
to 38.0p, which was between target and 
stretch performance;
 – net debt of £1,032m achieved stretch 
performance; and
 – an 11% reduction was achieved in the 
Recordable Accident Rate and a reduction 
of over 30% in the number of major (most 
serious) injuries.
In relation to performance over the  
three-year period 2012 to 2014:
 – threshold TSR was achieved;
 – EPS performance was impacted by the 
challenges in US markets and performance 
issues identied previously. In addition, 
the base year, 2011, included a one-off 
benet of 5.9p from an agreement with 
the UK tax authorities; and
 – operating cash performance in the US 
business was impacted by the market 
challenges and performance issues 
referred to above.
Decisions for 2014
 – 2014 annual bonus pay-outs for the 
executive directors ranged from 56.5% 
to 74.5% of maximum.
 – Performance Share Plan (PSP) awards 
granted in March 2012 to UK executive 
directors will partially vest in 2015 as 
performance exceeded the TSR threshold; 
EPS portion will lapse. PSP awards granted 
to the US executive director will lapse as 
the operating cash and EPS measures 
were not met. 
 – Share Matching Plan (SMP) matching 
award granted in March 2012 will lapse 
in 2015 as EPS condition not met.
 – Share options granted in March 2012 to the 
executive directors will partially vest as 
performance exceeded the TSR threshold.
 – Approval at the 2014 Annual General 
Meeting (AGM) by shareholders of a single 
umbrella LTI plan with exibility to award 
Performance Shares, Share Options and 
Restricted Shares (to the US executive 
director only) within set award limits.
 – In relation to the retirement of Linda 
Hudson as President and Chief Executive 
Ofcer of BAE Systems, Inc., the 
Committee conrmed all elements of 
remuneration to be actioned in line with 
policy and as disclosed in last year’s 
Annual Report.
 – In relation to the appointment of Jerry 
DeMuro as President and Chief Executive 
Ofcer of BAE Systems, Inc., the Committee 
conrmed all elements of remuneration to 
be actioned in line with policy and as 
disclosed in last year’s Annual Report.
Context to the Committee’s decisions for 2015
Our remuneration strategy is to motivate our 
key talent to realise the Company’s strategic 
objectives, deliver on customer commitments, 
lead and inspire employees, and drive value 
for our shareholders. It recognises the need 
to be competitive in those markets in which 
we operate and compete for talent. A core 
design objective is an appropriate balance of 
short-term and long-term incentives, focused 
on Group performance, business segment 
performance and leadership behaviours that 
underpin a Total Performance culture. 
The focus of changes to our reward framework 
in recent years has been to improve 
alignment with shareholder value creation 
and address the perceived complexity of 
our long-term incentive arrangements by 
simplifying our arrangements. We believe 
the approval of the single LTI plan at the 
2014 AGM achieves simplication of our 
arrangements and have, therefore, focused 
this year on ensuring that our long-term 
incentives are appropriately rewarding our 
executive team only when their performance 
delivers tangible business results in line 
with the Group’s strategy. 
Key changes for 2015
 – The Chief Executive Ofcer has elected 
to not take any base salary increase for 
a third successive year. 
 – For the rst time since 2012, the 
salary of the Group Finance Director is 
to be increased, by 2%, with effect from 
1 January 2015.
 – To recognise his performance in role, 
the salary of the President and Chief 
Executive Ofcer of BAE Systems, Inc. 
is to be increased, by 2%, with effect 
from 1 January 2015.
 – First awards to be made under the 
approved single LTI plan in Spring 2015.
 – Proposed performance range of 3% to 
7% average annual EPS growth with 25% 
vesting at threshold to apply to 2015 
LTI awards. 
 – Strengthening of malus and clawback 
provisions to reect the changes in the 
2014 UK Corporate Governance Code 
applicable to the executive directors and 
all members of the Executive Committee.
For the purposes of the Companies Act 2006, 
the legally binding restrictions under the 
Policy took legal effect from 1 January 2015. 
As stated in last year’s Annual Report, the 
Policy has been operated in practice from 
the 2014 AGM.

REPORT
Directors’ remuneration in the year ending 31 December 2015
As stated in the Remuneration Committee Chairman’s letter on page 68, for the purposes of the Companies 
Act 2006, the Directors’ Remuneration Policy (the Policy) took legal effect on 1 January 2015. The Policy has been 
operating in practice since the date of its approval on 7 May 2014 at the 2014 AGM. The remuneration for 2015 will 
be implemented as follows:
 – The Chief Executive Ofcer has elected to not take any base salary increase for another year.
 – The salaries of the Group Finance Director and President and Chief Executive Ofcer of BAE Systems, Inc. 
are being increased by 2% with effect from 1 January 2015. 
 – The performance measures and weightings for 2015 for the Annual Incentive and Long-Term Incentives are set 
out on page 83.
 – The Committee is of the view that bonus targets for the Annual Incentive are commercially sensitive and that it 
would be detrimental to the Company to disclose them in advance. The targets will be disclosed retrospectively 
after the end of the relevant nancial year. 
 – The fee structure for non-executive directors has been reviewed and remains unchanged for 2015.

Sir Roger Carr was appointed to the Board as Chairman designate on 1 October 2013 at a fee of £75,000 per 
annum (pro-rata) until 1 February 2014 when he succeeded Sir Richard Olver as Chairman. His annual fee thereafter

To assist in completing handover activities and as agreed pursuant to the notice period under his letter of 
appointment, Sir Richard Olver’s services were retained by the Company up to 16 May 2014. For these services, 
he was paid his then annual fee of £725,000 (pro-rata) and retained use of a chauffeur-driven car: the fee for these 
services was £211,458 and the car-related benet totalled £5,380. His pro-rated fee and benet gures for the

 Linda Hudson retired from the Board on 1 February 2014. Further detail is provided below.
1.  The benets received by Ian King include the provision of a car allowance and the private use of a chauffeur-driven 
car (2014 £45k; 2013 £41k). The benets received by Peter Lynas include the provision of a car allowance and 
the private use of a chauffeur-driven car (2014 £18k; 2013 £17k). In addition, he received a second residence 
allowance of £28k (2013 £47k) as disclosed in previous years. Jerry DeMuro’s benets include private use of a 
chauffeur-driven car and parking (£2k); medical and dental benets (£9k); insured life and disability benets (£6k);

2.  Further detail on bonus payments is provided on page 72. One-third of the bonus paid to Ian King, Peter Lynas 
and Jerry DeMuro will be deferred compulsorily into BAE Systems shares for a three-year period, without 
additional performance.
3.  This column relates to the estimated or actual value of Long-Term Incentive Plans for which the performance period 
ended in the relevant nancial year. The 2012 PSP
EPS
 and 2012 SMP awards (for which the performance periods 
ended on 31 December 2014) did not meet their EPS performance condition and will lapse, as will the PSP
OCF
. The 
2012 PSP
TSR
 and ExSOP
2012
 awards (for which the performance periods ended on 31 December 2014) exceeded the 
threshold TSR level and vest at 26.7%. Shares deriving from notional dividends during the performance period for 
the PSP
TSR
 will also vest on a pro-rated basis. The 2011 PSP
TSR
 (for which the performance period ended on 31 March 
2014) did not meet its performance conditions and lapsed (see page 73 for more detail). As reported in the prior 
year, the 2011 PSP
EPS
 and SMP awards (for which the performance periods ended on 31 December 2013) lapsed.
4.  The gures in this column have been calculated in line with the method set out in Section 229 of the Finance Act 2004 
using a capitalisation factor of 20 to assess the increase in the value of the pension promise over the year, net of 
ination. Therefore, these gures are sensitive to salary increases and Consumer Prices Index (CPI) ination as follows: 
 – Salary increase: As pensionable salary is averaged over three years, the gures for Peter Lynas still show the 
effect of the promotional increase following his appointment as Group Finance Director.
 – CPI ination: In a year with high CPI ination, the increase in the value of the pension promise would be lower 
than in a year with lower CPI ination.
  Linda Hudson ceased to be an executive director on 1 February 2014 and a Group employee on 31 May 2014. 
There was no change in her accrued benet between 31 December 2013 and 31 January 2014, based on pay 
and service to that date and calculated (i) using one-twelfth of the prescribed ination gure to cover the month of 
January 2014; and (ii) taking one-fth of the dened contributions over her period of employment from 1 January 
to 31 May 2014. She subsequently took her accrued pension entitlements as cash lump sums (see page 76) in 
accordance with the rules of the US pension arrangements; there are no further benets due.
5.  This column includes (i) for Ian King, the value of Free Share awards under the UK all-employee Share Incentive 
Plan (SIP) and Matching Shares under voluntary investment in the SIP (for Peter Lynas, the value of his Free Share 
awards under the SIP was £479); and (ii) for Jerry DeMuro, the value of the 2014 grant under the Restricted Share 
Plan (RSP). This award formed part of Jerry DeMuro’s 2014 LTIP allocation but is required to be reported under 
‘Other’ as it has no performance conditions attached.
6.  As reported last year, Jerry DeMuro was appointed to succeed Linda Hudson as President and Chief Executive 
Ofcer of BAE Systems, Inc. on 1 February 2014 and joined the Board as an executive director on the same date. 
His salary on appointment was $950,000 per annum (pro-rata for 2014), with a maximum bonus opportunity of 
225% of salary, of which one-third will be deferred in shares for a period of three years. He also receives LTIP awards 
at the levels contained within the executive directors’ policy table. His pension arrangements are set out on page 75.
7.  Linda Hudson retired from the Board on 1 February 2014. As previously announced, the following arrangements 
applied on her retirement from the Board:
 – For a period of 120 days from 1 February 2014, Linda Hudson was employed as Senior Vice President and 
Chief Executive Ofcer Emeritus for BAE Systems, Inc. on her then existing terms performing transition activities 
to the new President and Chief Executive Ofcer of BAE Systems, Inc. and supporting handover with customers 
and external relationships. At the end of this 120-day period, 31 May 2014 (the ‘Termination Date’), Linda 
Hudson retired from BAE Systems, Inc. and ceased to be employed by BAE Systems, Inc. During this four-month 
period, her salary totalled $341,754 and her benets totalled $13,392.
 – On ceasing to be employed by BAE Systems, Inc., in accordance with the terms of her employment agreement, 
Linda Hudson was entitled to receive:
 – one year’s base salary of $1,045,350 paid six months after the Termination Date;
 – a bonus payment for 2014 of $490,008 (being a bonus payment calculated on a pro-rata basis up to the 
Termination Date determined on an ‘on-target’ basis) which was paid within 30 days of the Termination Date. 
One-fth of this payment (£59,576) is shown in the ‘Bonus’ column (for service to 1 February 2014);
 – payment of $51,896 for all accrued but unused vacation as at the Termination Date; and
 – a lump sum payment equivalent to 18 months’ medical premiums paid six months after the Termination Date 
(payment made of $22,984). 
 –  Outstanding awards made under the Company’s Long-Term Incentive Plans (as disclosed on page 81) were 
subsequently time pro-rated and, where appropriate, will vest on the normal vesting dates subject to meeting 
the requirements of any applicable performance conditions. The value of Long-Term Incentive Plan awards vested 
or delivered to Linda Hudson in the period from 1 February 2014 to 31 December 2014 was £1,624,853. In 
addition, the value of Linda Hudson’s (time pro-rated) 2012 ExSOP
2012
 award (for which the performance period 
ended on 31 December 2014, as referred to in note 3 above) is shown in the ‘LTIP’ column on page 70.
  After the Termination Date, Linda Hudson will serve as a non-executive director of BAE Systems, Inc. until April 
2015. For the period from 1 June 2014 to 31 December 2014, the fee paid to her in this regard was $73,667.

The following awards had performance periods that ended on 31 December 2014:
2012 Performance Share Plan (PSP) 
 – Performance conditions: half on relative TSR against comparator group, half on EPS growth of 5% to 11% per 
annum. The TSR performance condition ended on 31 December 2014 and resulted in 26.7% vesting of the TSR 
portion. The Committee is satised that there has been a sustained improvement in the Company’s underlying 
nancial performance and that it is appropriate for vesting at 26.7% of the TSR portion. The EPS growth was not 
achieved and, accordingly, this portion will lapse. For the US executive director, 50% of the performance condition 
was based on EPS and 50% on long-term operating cash performance at the level of the US businesses. The 
long-term operating cash target was not met and, therefore, that portion also lapsed. 
2012 Executive Share Option Plan (ExSOP
2012
)
 – Performance condition: relative TSR against comparator group. The TSR performance condition ended on 
31 December 2014 and resulted in 26.7% vesting.
2012 Share Matching Plan (SMP)
 – 2:1 match on shares deferred from 2011 annual incentive based on a performance condition of EPS growth of 5% 
to 11% per annum. The EPS growth was not achieved and, accordingly, this portion will lapse.
The following award had a performance period that ended on 31 March 2014:
2011 Performance Share Plan (PSP) 
 – Performance conditions: half on relative TSR against comparator group, half on EPS growth of 5% to 11% per 
annum. The Company’s TSR for the 50% of awards of shares granted in May 2011 under the TSR portion of 
the PSP was below the median position when compared against the comparator group of other defence and 
aerospace companies, and the award accordingly lapsed. The EPS performance period for the EPS portion 
of the award ended on 31 December 2013 and was reported on last year. 
A summary of TSR performance to 31 December 2014 on outstanding TSR-related LTIP awards is illustrated in

3. Accrued benet for Ian King and Peter Lynas is annual pension payable on retirement. Accrued benet for Jerry DeMuro is the sum of the 
dened contribution scheme contributions.
Note: The gures in this table relate to directors with a prospective benet. Linda Hudson left employment with the BAE Systems Group during 
2014 and encashed her benet entitlements as detailed below; no 2014 gures have therefore been included for her in the table above.
The above table has been subject to audit.
Current UK executive directors are members of the BAE Systems Executive Pension Scheme (ExPS) and the 
BAE Systems 2000 Pension Plan (2000 Plan) which together provide a pension for executive directors payable 
at 62 of 1/30th of three-year nal average salary for each year of service subject to the payment of members’ 
contributions (currently 8%). Benets paid prior to age 62 will be subject to actuarial reduction.
The ExPS tops up the underlying employee plan to provide a target benet for executive directors payable from 
normal retirement age of 1/30th of Final Pensionable Pay (FPP) for each year of ExPS pensionable service (subject 
to a maximum of two-thirds of FPP). FPP is dened as annual base salary averaged over the last 12 months prior to 
leaving service in respect of service accrued to 5 April 2006 and 36 months prior to leaving in respect of service 
from 6 April 2006. The ExPS also provides a lump sum death-in-service benet equal to four times base salary at 
date of death, and a spouse’s death-in-service pension equal to two-thirds of the prospective pension at normal 
retirement age. Children’s allowances are also payable, usually up to the age of 18. Spouses’ pensions and 
children’s allowances are also payable upon death in retirement and death after leaving the Company’s employment 
with a deferred pension. Once in payment, pensions are increased annually by the rise in the Retail Prices Index 
subject to a maximum increase of 5% per year in respect of pre-6 April 2006 service and 2.5% per year in respect 
of service from 6 April 2006.
The review of pension policies carried out in 2010 by the Committee concluded that the pension benets should 
continue to be based on the Company’s registered pension schemes and that, in appropriate circumstances, the 
Company will continue to have the option to offer an unfunded pension promise so as to mitigate the impact of 
further reductions to the Lifetime Allowance (introduced in 2006) and the impact of the reduced Annual Allowance. 
The current executive directors were given the choice to remain in the current arrangement and pay the increased tax 
or to take an unfunded promise: they both elected for the latter. The Committee has decided that in cases where the 
Company is to pay an unfunded promise, executives will be given the choice to commute some or all of the benet 
for a taxable lump sum, or take it as pension. Where an unfunded pension is taken, ten years after retirement, the 
executive will be given a further opportunity to commute the residual value of the unfunded pension for a lump sum.
As stated above, Ian King and Peter Lynas already have an unfunded promise from the Company arising from the 
2006 changes to the taxation of pension benets, which has been extended to cover the reduced Annual Allowance 
at no additional cost to the Company.
Ian King and Peter Lynas are both members of the 2000 Plan, applicable to former employees of Marconi Electronic 
Systems (MES), and members of the ExPS with a normal retirement age of 62. The 2000 Plan provides a pension of 
1/50th of Final Pensionable Earnings (FPE) for each year of pensionable service, payable from a normal retirement 
age of 65 and members pay contributions of 8% of Pensionable Earnings. FPE under the 2000 Plan is the best 
consecutive three-year average of base salary and bonus in the ten Plan Years prior to leaving, less an offset for State 
pensions. The Company decided in 2006 to limit pensionable bonuses in the 2000 Plan in the 2006/07 Plan Year to 
20% of base salary and to 10% of base salary for the 2007 /08 Plan Year and thereafter. However, there is a guarantee 
that the FPE gure for benets in respect of service prior to 6 April 2007 will not be less than the FPE gure at 5 April 
2007 to ensure that employees do not lose the benet of contributions paid on past bonuses. Ian King and Peter 
Lynas joined the ExPS in 1999. Therefore, their individual total pensions are the sum of their 2000 Plan benets 
plus the top up from the ExPS, most of which is provided through the unfunded promise referred to above.
Jerry DeMuro participates in a Section 401(k) dened contribution arrangement set up for US employees in which 
the company will match his contributions up to a maximum contribution of 6% of salary, up to regulatory limits 
(for 2015 $265,000). In 2014, the company paid contributions of $13,408 into this 401(k) arrangement. 76

Linda Hudson stepped down from the Board on 1 February 2014 and ceased to be a Group employee on 31 May 
2014. Her leaving arrangements were disclosed in the 2013 Annual Remuneration Report (and on page 71). Linda 
Hudson was a member of a US retirement plan which provides a cash sum at retirement equal to a percentage of 
career average pay. After her departure from the company, she received full payment of her qualied and non-qualied 
pension benets in the amounts of $141,420 and $1,404,625, respectively.
In addition, Linda Hudson participated in a Section 401(k) dened contribution arrangement set up for US employees 
in which the company will match employee contributions up to a limit. In 2014, the company paid contributions of 
$15,600 into this 401(k) arrangement.

Description of share plans and summary of performance conditions
PSP 
Shares under award vest after satisfaction of the three-year performance condition. Shares under award attract 
dividends prior to vesting. Awards that vest are exercisable in three tranches between the third and seventh 
anniversary of vesting (being capable of exercise on a phased basis from the third, fourth and fth anniversary of 
grant). For US participants, the awards are automatically delivered at the end of years three, four and ve, subject 
to the performance condition being achieved. In 2015, shares will be awarded under the Long-Term Incentive Plan 
(a single umbrella plan) that was approved at the 2014 AGM as detailed on pages 83 and 85.
Awards made to the UK executive directors since 2008 have been weighted 50% on the PSP
EPS
 performance 
condition and 50% on the PSP
TSR
 performance condition. Awards made to the US executive director were weighted 
in the same way until 2011 and in 2014. In 2012 and 2013, the weighting for the US executive director was 50% 
on the PSP
EPS
 performance condition and 50% on the PSP
OCF
 performance condition. The TSR comparator groups 
are shown below.
Plan Performance condition
PSP
EPS
For awards made in 2015, rate of average annual EPS growth over the three-year performance period, with 25% 
vesting at 3% average growth per annum, 50% vesting at 5% average growth per annum and 100% vesting at 7% 
average growth per annum, with vesting on a straight-line basis between these parameters. Awards will not vest 
unless the Board is satised that there has been a sustained improvement in the underlying nancial performance 
of the Company (taking account of items such as cash, order book, risk and project performance).
Pre-2015, rate of average annual EPS growth over the three-year performance period, with nil vesting at 5% 
average growth per annum and 100% vesting at 11% average growth per annum, with vesting on a straight-line 
basis between these two parameters.
PSP
TSR
The proportion of the award capable of exercise is determined by:
(i)  the Company’s TSR (share price growth plus dividends) ranking relative to a comparator group of 12 other 
international defence companies over a three-year performance period. No shares vest if the Company’s TSR 
is outside the top 50% of TSRs achieved by the sectoral comparator group, with 25% vesting at median, 100% 
vesting if it is in the top quintile and vesting on a straight-line basis between these two parameters; and
(ii)  whether there has been a sustained improvement in the Company’s underlying nancial performance. In taking 
such a view, the Committee may consider (but not exclusively) the following nancial metrics: net cash/debt; 
EBITA
1
; order book; turnover; risk; and underlying project performance.
PSP
OCF
Long-term operating cash performance at the level of the US businesses over a three-year performance period. 
The Committee is of the view that cash performance gures are commercially sensitive and that it would be 
detrimental to the interests of the Company to disclose them in advance.

2012
The proportion of the award capable of exercise is determined by the Company’s TSR (share price growth plus 
dividends) ranking relative to a comparator group of 12 other international defence companies over a three-year 
performance period. No shares vest if the Company’s TSR is outside the top 50% of TSRs achieved by the sectoral 
comparator group, with 25% vesting at median, 100% vesting if it is in the top quintile and vesting on a straight-line 
basis between these two parameters.
RSP 
The RSP is not subject to a performance condition as it is designed to address retention issues principally in the US. 
The shares are subject only to the condition that the participant remains employed by the Group at the end of the 
vesting date (three years after the award date). Shares under award attract dividends prior to vesting. In 2015, shares 
will be awarded under the single umbrella plan that was approved at the 2014 AGM as detailed on pages 83 and 85. 
Awards made from 2015 will be subject to a further two-year clawback period after the initial three-year vesting period.
SMP 
The SMP was a standalone investment plan linked to the award under the Annual Incentive Plan. It operated for the 
nal time in 2013 in relation to the annual incentive relating to 2012 performance. Executive directors were required 
to invest at least one-third (and maximum 50%) of their annual incentive into the SMP and were granted a conditional 
award of matching shares against the gross value of the annual incentive invested. The matching shares attract 
dividends during the three-year deferral period, released on vesting of any matching shares.
Plan Performance condition
SMP In respect of a three-year performance period, nil match for average EPS growth of 5% per annum increasing 
uniformly to a maximum 2:1 match at 11% growth per annum.
Statement of directors’ shareholdings and share interests
Minimum Shareholding Requirement (MSR)
Executive directors are compulsorily required to establish and maintain a minimum personal shareholding equal to 
a set percentage of base salary. An Initial Value must be achieved as quickly as possible using shares vesting or 
options exercised through the executive share option schemes and Long-Term Incentive schemes by retaining 50% 
of the net value (i.e. the value after deduction of exercise costs and tax) of shares acquired under these schemes. 
Once the Initial Value is achieved, a Subsequent Value must be achieved in the same way, except that a minimum 
of 25% of the net value must be retained on each exercise or acquisition. Shares owned benecially by the director 
and his/her spouse count towards the MSR. The MSR does not apply after the individual has ceased to be a 
director. Any case of non-compliance would be dealt with by the Committee. 
The following table sets out MSR Initial Value and Subsequent Value: 
Director Initial Value Subsequent Value
Ian King 150% 300%
Peter Lynas 100% 200%
Jerry DeMuro 175% 350%
Linda Hudson 175% 350%
Ian King and Peter Lynas were both in excess of their ‘Subsequent Value’ MSR at 31 December 2014. Following the 
announcement in 2013 of Linda Hudson’s retirement in 2014, the Committee agreed to reduce her MSR to 175% 
and she subsequently retained a holding to that level until she ceased to be a director. Jerry DeMuro joined the 
Board in 2014 and does not yet hold shares in the Company.
There are no shareholding requirements for the Chairman or the non-executive directors. GOVERNANCE

STRATEGIC  REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Governance
The Directors’ Remuneration Policy (‘the Policy’) set out 
on pages 84 to 92 was agreed by shareholders at the 
Annual General Meeting (AGM) on 7 May 2014. For the 
purposes of the Companies Act 2006, the Policy took 
legal effect on 1 January 2015. As stated in last year’s 
Annual Report, this Policy has been operating in practice 
from the 2014 AGM. The approved policy has been 
re-printed verbatim from the 2013 Annual Report, 
updated only so that the page numbers refer to the 
2014 Annual Report in order to aid readability. 
Directors’ remuneration for 2015
For 2015, it remains our intention to operate the Policy 
that was agreed by shareholders at the 2014 AGM. 
This section sets out how the Policy will apply in 2015.
Following approval of the single Long-Term Incentive Plan 
(LTIP) at the 2014 AGM, the rst awards will be made 
under this plan in Spring 2015. As set out in our 
Remuneration Committee Chairman’s letter on page 67, 
the Committee intends to make the following changes 
to our executive remuneration arrangements for 2015 
which do not constitute a change to the Policy approved 
by shareholders in 2014:
Earnings per Share (EPS) performance condition 
applicable to Long-Term Incentive (LTI) grants
It is proposed to set a performance range of 3% to 7% 
average annual EPS growth for the 2015 awards of 
Performance Shares under the LTIP. Achievement of 
threshold performance will result in 25% vesting; there 
will be 50% vesting for 5% average annual EPS growth 
and 100% vesting for 7% average annual EPS growth, 
with pro-rata vesting for intermediate performance. The 
revised EPS performance condition will be subject to the 
same ‘quality of earnings’ performance hurdle as applies 
to the Total Shareholder Return (TSR) condition, such 
that awards will not vest unless the Board is satised 
that there has been a sustained improvement in the 
underlying nancial performance of the Company (taking 
account of items such as cash, order book, risk and 
project performance).
Malus and clawback provisions
In accordance with the changes to the UK Corporate 
Governance Code in 2014, the Committee has 
strengthened the malus and clawback provisions 
applicable to incentive awards made to the executive 
directors and to all members of the Executive 
Committee from and including 2015 as follows:
 – a two-year clawback period will be added to the end 
of the three-year vesting period applicable to Share 
Options and Restricted Shares awarded under the 
LTIP; and
 – the denition of circumstances and trigger events has 
been extended.
Metrics and weightings applicable in 2015
 – The performance metrics and weightings applicable to 
the 2015 annual incentive are unchanged from those 
set out last year (see page 85). 
 – Performance Shares will continue to have 50% of the 
award based on TSR growth as set out on page 86. 
For 2015, the remaining 50% of the award is subject 
to the EPS performance condition set out above. For 
US participants, other than members of the Executive 
Committee, 50% of the awards made in 2014 and 
2015 are subject to the long-term operating cash 
performance of the US business in place of TSR 
growth.
 – There is no change in 2015 to the performance 
metrics and weightings applying to Share Options or 
Restricted Shares.
Illustration of application of policy
The following charts show the value of the package each 
of the executive directors would receive based on 2015 
base salaries, remuneration and 2015 LTI awards 
assuming the following scenarios: minimum xed pay 
(including salary, benets and pension as provided in the 
single gure table on page 70); pay receivable assuming 
on-target performance is met; and maximum pay 
assuming variable elements pay out in full. The 
scenarios below exclude any share price appreciation 
and dividends.
UK legislation requires that these charts are given in 
relation to the rst year in which the remuneration policy 
takes legal effect. As detailed in last year’s Annual Report, 
the charts below are reporting the actual levels for 2015.

DIRECTORS’ 
REMUNERATION POLICY
It is intended in practice to operate the Directors’ Remuneration Policy (‘the Policy’) from the 2014 AGM. For the 
purposes of the Companies Act 2006, the Policy will only take legal effect on 1 January 2015 subject to shareholder 
approval at the 2014 AGM.
The Committee considers remuneration policy annually to ensure that it remains aligned with business needs and is 
appropriately positioned relative to the market. However, in the absence of exceptional or unexpected circumstances 
which may necessitate a change to the Policy, there is currently no intention to revise the Policy more frequently than 
every three years. We use target performance to estimate the total potential reward and benchmark it against reward 
packages paid by BAE Systems’ competitors.
Our Policy is to set base salary with reference to the relevant market-competitive level. Actual total direct reward 
reects the performance of the individual and the Company as a whole. The aim is to deliver an overall remuneration 
package for executive directors which provides an appropriate balance between short-term and long-term reward and 
between xed and variable reward as described in the table below.
Whilst our long-term incentive plans provide the Committee with discretion in respect of vesting outcomes that affect 
the actual level of reward payable to individuals, such discretion would only be used in exceptional circumstances 
and, if exercised, disclosed at the latest in the report on implementation of the remuneration policy (i.e. the Annual 
Remuneration Report) for the year in question.
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS’ POLICY TABLE
BASE SALARY
Purpose and link to strategy
Recognise market value of role and individual’s skills, experience and performance to ensure the business can attract and 
retain talent.
Operation
Salaries are reviewed annually. Business and individual performance, skills, the scope of the role and the individual’s time in the 
role are taken into account when assessing salaries, as is market data for similar roles in the relevant market comparator group.
The comparator group for UK executive directors is comprised of selected companies from the top 70 of the FTSE 100 and is 
constructed to position BAE Systems around the median in terms of market capitalisation. For the President and Chief Executive 
Ofcer of BAE Systems, Inc., the comparator group is drawn from companies in the US aerospace and defence sectors, together 
with similar organisations in the general industry sector where BAE Systems, Inc. is positioned at the median of the comparator 
group by reference to revenue size.
Maximum opportunity
When considering salary increases for the executive directors in their current roles, the Committee considers the general level 
of salary increase across the Group and in the relevant external market.
Actual increases for the executive directors in their current roles will generally not exceed the average percentage increase for 
employees as a whole, taking account of the level of movement within the relevant UK/US comparator group.
As a maximum, in exceptional circumstances (such as a material increase in job size or complexity, or a recently appointed 
executive director where the salary is positioned low against the market), the increase will not exceed 10% in any single year.
Performance metrics used, weighting and time period applicable
None.
ANNUAL INCENTIVE
Purpose and link to strategy
Drive and reward annual performance of individuals and teams on both nancial and non-nancial metrics, including leadership 
behaviours in order to deliver sustainable growth in shareholder value. 
Compulsory deferral into shares increases alignment with shareholder interests.
Operation
75–80% of the annual incentive is driven off in-year nancial performance, and 20–25% is based on driving performance and 
improvement in the area of corporate responsibility and other non-nancial objectives supporting the Group’s strategy. 
One-third of the total annual incentive amount is subject to compulsory deferral for three years in BAE Systems shares without 
any matching.
A clawback mechanism exists under which part or all of the deferred bonus can be recovered if performance for which the bonus 
was awarded is subsequently restated or shown to be materially inaccurate or misleading or where the executive’s employment 
can be terminated for cause.
Cash dividends are payable to the participants on the shares during this three-year deferral period.
Maximum opportunity
Chief Executive and the President and Chief Executive Ofcer of BAE Systems, Inc.: 225% of salary
Group Finance Director: 160% of salary
The pay-out for maximum performance is 200% of on-target. The pay-out for achieving a threshold performance is 40% of the 
target, with no pay-out for achieving less than this. Pay-out for performance between targets is calculated on a straight-line basis. GOVERNANCE

ANNUAL INCENTIVE continued
Performance metrics used, weighting and time period applicable
Metrics and weightings applicable in 2014: 
Group earnings per share (EPS) – 40% 
Group cash – 25% 
Order intake – 15% 
Safety – 5% 
Personal objectives – 15%
Performance is assessed on an annual basis, using a combination of the Group’s main performance indicators for the year. 
The measures include nancial and non-nancial metrics as well as the achievement of personal objectives. Measures will 
be weighted each year according to business priorities.
See notes 4 and 5 on page 88 regarding the selection and weighting of performance metrics.
Notwithstanding performance against the above metrics, all bonus payments are at the discretion of the Remuneration 
Committee, which will be based on an assessment of the individual’s personal contribution to business performance over 
the relevant year and leadership behaviours demonstrated in making that contribution, relative to others.
LONG-TERM INCENTIVES (LTI)
Operation
All awards are granted based on a percentage of salary and share price at the date of grant.
Dividend equivalents in respect of vested shares are paid at the time of vesting and are not taken into account when determining 
individual limits.
Pre-vesting clawback provisions apply to all awards and are intended to cover situations, for example, where results are restated 
or otherwise turn out to be materially inaccurate or where the executive’s employment can be terminated for cause.
The Committee will establish the targets for each measure at the start of each performance period based on Group projections 
and market expectations for the business. The performance conditions for previous awards are described in the Annual 
Remuneration Report.
Awards and performance conditions can be adjusted to take account of variations of share capital and other transactions or events.
On a change of control or similar transaction, awards generally will vest to the extent performance conditions are then satised 
(if applicable) and then be pro-rated to reect the acceleration of vesting unless the Committee decides otherwise. Alternatively, 
awards may be exchanged for equivalent awards over shares in the acquiring company.
The share plan rules may be amended from time-to-time by the Committee in certain circumstances including minor changes for 
administrative, tax or other regulatory purposes.
Subject to this Policy, performance conditions may be amended in other circumstances if the Committee considers it appropriate.
Performance metrics used, weighting and time period applicable
See notes 4 and 5 on page 88 regarding the selection and weighting of performance metrics.
Operation
It is proposed to consolidate the three long-term incentive plans described below into a single umbrella plan with effect from 
1 January 2015, subject to shareholder approval at the 2014 AGM
1
.
Maximum opportunity
Subject to shareholder approval of the proposed umbrella plan at the 2014 AGM
1
, over the lifetime of this remuneration policy, 
the Committee will have discretion to vary the weighting and mix of different types of awards within the following limits:
(a) Performance Shares: 
UK executive directors:
Between 50% and 75% of overall LTI Expected Value (EV)
US executive directors:
Between 25% and 50% of overall LTI EV
(b) Share Options:
Between 25% and 50% of overall LTI EV
(c) Restricted Shares:
Applicable to US executive directors only. No more than one-third of overall LTI EV

Benets include provision of a company car (or cash equivalent), life assurance and ill-health benet cover which are provided 
directly or through membership of the Company’s pension schemes.
Opportunity for UK executive directors to participate in the Share Incentive Plan, a tax approved all-employee plan.
Additional benets such as relocation assistance may also be provided in certain circumstances if considered reasonable and 
appropriate by the Committee.
Maximum opportunity
Benets are set at a level which the Remuneration Committee considers to be appropriate against comparable roles in 
companies of similar size in the relevant market.
Relocation assistance comprises reimbursement for direct items of expenditure, such as legal, estate agency, removals and 
temporary accommodation, based on actual costs incurred which are linked to the size and value of the property, plus a 
maximum relocation allowance of £2,500.
Benets are as reported and itemised within the single total gure shown as part of the Annual Remuneration Report on page 70. 
The main benets in the UK include a car allowance (£16,000 per annum) and private use of a chauffeur-driven car, plus life 
assurance and ill-health benet cover provided through membership of the Company’s pension schemes. In the US, the benets 
include a cash allowance for car and parking ($20,900 per annum) and private use of a chauffeur-driven car, medical and dental 
benets, and insured life and disability benets. The maximum cost of such benets will reect the associated market-competitive 
cost of provision.
Participation limits for the Share Incentive Plan are those set by the UK tax authorities from time-to-time.
Performance metrics used, weighting and time period applicable
None.
PENSION
Purpose and link to strategy
Provide competitive post-retirement benets or cash allowance equivalent.
Operation
For any new externally appointed executive directors in the UK, membership of the Company’s executive dened contribution 
plan is offered with Company contributions set as a percentage of base salary. Individuals may elect to receive some or all of 
their pension contribution as a cash allowance.
Current UK executive directors are members of the BAE Systems Executive Pension Scheme and members of the underlying 
employee pension plan, which provide a target benet for executive directors payable at normal retirement age (62) of 1/30th 
of nal pensionable earnings (FPE) for each year of service up to a maximum of two-thirds of FPE. Member contributions are 
currently 8%. Further detail is provided on page 75 as part of the Annual Remuneration Report.
Any new externally appointed US executive directors would be offered membership of the US dened contribution plan.
Maximum opportunity
Company contribution of 19% (in addition to employee contribution of 6%) of base salary only.
Under the existing dened benet scheme, a maximum of two-thirds of FPE accrued at 1/30th for each year of service.
The US dened contribution plan provides 100% company matching contributions up to a maximum of 6% of base salary, 
subject to US statutory limits.
Operation
Where executive directors’ pension entitlement or accrual is restricted to the Lifetime Allowance and/or the Annual Allowance 
under the relevant pension scheme the Company may offer an unfunded pension promise to offset the impact of these restrictions.
Maximum opportunity
The difference between the value of the registered pension scheme benets as restricted to the Lifetime Allowance and Annual 
Allowance and the full value of those registered pension scheme benets that would be payable if there were no Annual Allowance 
or Lifetime Allowance restrictions. 88

DIRECTORS’ 
REMUNERATION 
POLICY
CONTINUED
Notes to the executive directors’ policy table 
Remuneration policy for other employees
1  The Company’s approach to annual salary reviews is consistent across the Group, with consideration given to the scope of the 
role, level of experience, performance and market data for similar roles in other companies.
2  All leaders may participate in an annual bonus scheme with similar metrics to those used for the executive directors. Other 
employees may participate in performance-based incentive plans which vary by organisational level and with relevant metrics for 
the particular area of the business.
3  Long-Term Incentive grants may be made to the most senior managers in the business (approximately 250 individuals globally). 
The nature of the awards depends on the individuals’ location, roles and responsibilities, in particular:
 – performance measures and targets for performance share grants are made in line with those applying to executive directors; 
 – there are no performance conditions attached to share option grants below executive director level; and
 – Restricted Share grants are currently made to the most senior managers in the US reecting competitive market practice.
Performance measures and targets
4  The Committee selected the performance conditions because these are central to the Company’s overall strategy and are the 
key metrics used by the executive directors to oversee the operation of the business. The non-nancial performance targets are 
determined by the Committee in consultation with the Corporate Responsibility Committee.
5  The performance measures and targets are determined annually by the Committee, taking account of the Group’s strategic 
objectives, the internal business plan and budgets, as well as external market expectations and general economic conditions. 
The Committee is of the view that the performance targets for the annual bonus are commercially sensitive and that it would be 
detrimental to the interests of the Company to disclose them before the start of the nancial year. The targets will be disclosed 
retrospectively after the end of the relevant nancial year.
Minimum Shareholding Requirement (MSR)
6  The Committee has agreed a policy whereby the executive directors are required to establish and maintain a minimum personal 
shareholding equal to a set percentage of base salary. An Initial Value must be achieved as quickly as possible using shares 
vesting or options exercised through the executive share option schemes and other Long-Term Incentive schemes by retaining 
50% of the net value (i.e. the value after deduction of exercise costs and tax) of shares acquired under these schemes. Once the 
Initial Value is achieved, a Subsequent Value must be achieved in the same way, except that a minimum of 25% of the net value 
must be retained on each exercise or acquisition. Shares owned benecially by the director and his/her spouse count towards 
the MSR. The MSR does not apply after the individual has ceased to be a director. Any case of non-compliance would be dealt 
with by the Committee.
The following table sets out MSR Initial Value and Subsequent Value: 
Initial Value Subsequent Value
Chief Executive 150% 300%
Group Finance Director 100% 200%
President and Chief Executive Ofcer of BAE Systems, Inc. 175% 350%
Illustration of application of remuneration policy
The charts opposite show the value of the package each of the 
executive directors would receive based on 2014 base salaries, 
remuneration and 2014 LTI awards assuming the following 
scenarios: minimum xed pay (including salary, benets and 
pension as provided in the single gure table on page 70); pay 
receivable assuming on-target performance is met; and maximum 
pay assuming variable elements pay out in full. The scenarios 
opposite exclude any share price appreciation and dividends.
UK legislation requires that these charts are given in relation 
to the rst year in which the remuneration policy takes legal 
effect. Rather than providing further charts for assumed 2015 
remuneration and awards, we invite shareholders to assume 
similar levels for 2015 and we will report on actual levels in 2015.

NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS’ (NEDs) POLICY TABLE
FEES
Purpose and link to strategy
To attract NEDs who have a broad range of experience and skills to provide independent judgement on issues of strategy, 
performance, resources and standards of conduct.
Operation
NEDs fees are set by the Non-Executive Directors’ Fees Committee.
NEDs receive a basic fee with an additional fee for those who are chairmen of committees and/or undertake the role of Senior 
Independent Director.
NEDs also receive a travel allowance per meeting on each occasion that a scheduled Board meeting necessitates air travel of 
more than ve hours (one way) to the meeting location, subject to a maximum of six travel allowances per year. 
Fees are typically reviewed annually, taking into account time commitment requirements and responsibility of the individual roles, 
and after reviewing practice in other comparable companies. 
The Chairman’s fees are set by the Remuneration Committee on a three-year basis and not normally subject to review during 
that period.
Maximum opportunity
Actual fee levels are disclosed in the Annual Remuneration Report for the relevant nancial year.
The current Chairman’s fee has been set at £650,000 and xed at this level for three years from the date of appointment 
(1 February 2014).
The aggregate cost of fees and benets paid to NEDs (including the Chairman) will not exceed an annual limit of £2.5m.
Performance metrics used, weighting and time period applicable
None.
BENEFITS
Purpose and link to strategy
Reimbursement for reasonable and documented expenses incurred in the performance of duties.
Operation
NEDs are not eligible to participate in any pension benets provided by the Company, nor do they participate in any  
performance-related incentives.
The Chairman is provided with a chauffeur-driven car. This may be used for non-Company business, but the cost of the benet of 
such usage shall be paid by the Chairman.

REMUNERATION 
POLICY
CONTINUED
Prior commitments 
The Company will honour any commitments made in respect of executive director and non-executive director remuneration before 
the date on which either: (i) the Directors’ Remuneration Policy becomes effective or (ii) an individual becomes a director, even 
where such commitments are not consistent with the policy prevailing at the time any such commitment is fullled. This includes 
(without limitation) all existing share awards as detailed on pages 80 and 81 under the PSP, SMP, RSP, ExSOP and ExSOP
2012
, 
Linda Hudson’s leaving arrangements as detailed on page 71 and Peter Lynas’ second residence allowance as detailed on page 70. 
Approach to recruitment remuneration
The recruitment policy provides an appropriate framework within which to attract individuals of the required calibre to lead a 
company of BAE Systems’ size, scale and complexity. The Remuneration Committee determines the remuneration package for 
any appointment to an executive director position, either from within or outside BAE Systems. 
Operation
The Remuneration Committee will take into consideration all relevant factors, including overall total remuneration, the type 
of remuneration being offered and the jurisdiction from which the candidate was recruited, and will operate in order to ensure 
that arrangements are in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders without paying more than is necessary to 
secure the individual of the required calibre.
The fees and benets applicable to the appointment of any new non-executive directors will be in accordance with the policy 
table on page 89.
Opportunity
The Committee seeks to align the remuneration package offered with the policy set out in the executive directors’ policy table 
above recognising that participation under the policy above varies by geography. 
 – For UK and other non-US executive director appointments, participation in annual incentive plans will not exceed 225% of 
annual salary and long-term awards under this policy will not exceed 550% of annual salary. 
 – For US executive director appointments, participation in annual incentive plans will not exceed 225% of annual salary and 
long-term awards under this policy will not exceed 750% of annual salary.
The Committee may make awards on hiring an external candidate to ‘buy-out’ existing equity or, in exceptional circumstances, 
other elements of remuneration forfeited on leaving the previous employer. In doing so, the Committee will take account of 
relevant factors including any performance conditions attached to these awards, the form in which they were granted (e.g. cash 
or shares) and the time over which they would have vested. Buy-out awards would be capped to be no higher, on recruitment, 
than the fair value of those forfeited. Full details will be disclosed in the next Annual Remuneration Report following recruitment 
which will include details of the need to grant a buy-out award.
Fixed elements (base salary, retirement and other benets)
The salary level will be set in accordance with the policy described in the executive directors’ policy table above.
The executive director shall be eligible to participate in applicable BAE Systems’ employee benet plans, including coverage 
under applicable executive and employee pension and benet programmes in accordance with the terms and conditions of 
such plans, as may be amended by the Company in its sole discretion from time to time.
In the case of promotion of an existing Group employee to an executive directorship on the Board, commitments made before 
such promotion will continue to be honoured whether or not they are consistent with the remainder of this policy.
Annual Incentive Plan
The appointed executive director will be eligible to earn a discretionary annual bonus in accordance with the Annual Incentive 
framework as described in the executive directors’ policy table above.
The level of opportunity will be consistent with the policy disclosed in the executive directors’ policy table in this report and 
subject to the maximums referred to therein.
Long-Term Incentive Plans
The executive director will be eligible for equity awards in such amounts as the Committee may determine in its sole discretion, 
subject to this policy and the rules of the Long-Term Incentive Plans.
The level of opportunity will be consistent with the policy set out in the executive directors’ policy table above and subject to the 
maximums referred to therein.
Other
For internal and external appointments, the Committee may agree that the Company will meet certain relocation expenses in 
accordance with the provisions described under the Benets section of the policy table on page 87. GOVERNANCE

In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, all directors are subject to annual election or re-election at the 
Company’s AGM. 92

Policy on payment for loss of ofce
Operation
The policy on payment for loss of ofce provides a clear set of principles that govern the payments that will be made for loss 
of ofce, and take account of the need to ensure a smooth transition for leadership roles during times of change. The policy that 
will apply for a specic executive director’s payment for loss of ofce will be the policy that was in place at the point when the 
payment for loss of ofce was agreed for the executive director in question.
Notice and pay in lieu of notice
Executive directors’ contracts allow for termination with contractual notice from either party or termination by way of payment 
in lieu of notice, at the Company’s discretion. Neither notice nor a payment in lieu of notice will be given in the event of gross 
misconduct. In the event of the termination of an executive director’s contract, it is the Committee’s policy to seek to limit any 
payment made in lieu of notice to a payment of not more than one year’s base salary.
Any compensation payment made in connection with the departure of an executive director will be subject to approval by the 
Remuneration Committee, having regard to the terms of the service contract and the specic circumstances surrounding the 
termination, including whether the scenario aligns to an example under the approved leaver criteria, performance, service and 
health or other circumstances that may be relevant. 
Jerry DeMuro’s contract of employment automatically renews for one-year periods from 31 December each year, unless one 
party gives at least 90 days’ notice of non-renewal. If the employment is (a) terminated by the Company (other than for cause 
as dened in the contract) or (b) he resigned for a ‘Good Reason’ (as dened in his contract), he is entitled to a termination 
payment equal to (i) one year’s base salary and (ii) a pro-rated bonus for the relevant nancial year. He will also be entitled to 
a continuation of medical benets for 18 months (or a cash payment in lieu).
Retirement benets
As governed by the rules of the relevant pension plan. No enhancement for leavers will be made.
Annual Incentive Plan
The Remuneration Committee may exercise its discretion to make an annual incentive payment as part of the termination package. 
Where an executive director’s employment is terminated after the end of a performance year but before the payment is made, the 
executive director will remain eligible for an annual incentive award for that performance year subject to an assessment based on 
performance achieved over the period. No award will be made in the event of gross misconduct.
Where an executive director leaves by reason of death, ill-heath, retirement, a transfer of business or redundancy, the 
Remuneration Committee may use its discretion to determine that an executive director is entitled to receive a bonus (subject 
to an assessment based on performance over the period and pro-rated for time) in respect of the nancial year in which the 
individual ceased employment. 
If the Remuneration Committee regards it necessary to use their discretion, it must be shown how this is in the interests of the 
Company and its shareholders.
The Committee’s policy is not to award an annual incentive for any portion of the notice period not served.
Long-Term Incentive Plans
The treatment of outstanding share awards in the event that an executive director leaves is governed by the relevant share 
plan rules.
Under the Long-Term Incentive Plans, awards and options generally vest and/or become exercisable where an executive director 
leaves by reason of ill-health, injury, disability, retirement with the agreement of the Company, redundancy or leaving in such 
circumstances as the Committee determines (each an ‘approved leaver’). Awards and options generally continue and vest on 
the normal vesting date (or, in the case of Performance Shares, the rst normal vesting date), unless the Committee determines 
that the awards should vest on cessation. Any performance conditions will be applied at the time of vesting.
In the event of death, awards generally vest at the time of death subject to the satisfaction of any performance conditions at 
that time. Awards are then pro-rated as set out below.
On the vesting and/or exercise of awards and/or options as set out above, the number of shares received will, unless the 
Committee decides otherwise, be reduced pro-rata to reect the period in which the executive director was in employment as 
a proportion of the relevant vesting or performance period (as applicable).
Where an executive director’s employment is terminated for any other reason, his awards and options will lapse.
If the Remuneration Committee regards it necessary to exercise its discretion as permissible under the share plan rules, 
then disclosure will include an explanation of how the application of discretion was in the best interests of the Company and 
its shareholders. 
Where an executive director’s employment is terminated or an executive director is under notice of termination for any reason 
at the date of award of any Long-Term Incentive awards, no Long-Term Incentive awards will be made.
Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Company
The Remuneration Committee does not consult directly with employees as part of the process for reviewing executive pay. 
When considering salary increases for the executive directors, the Remuneration Committee considers the general level of 
salary increase across the Group and in the external market.
Stakeholder considerations
The Remuneration Committee conducts an annual programme of consultation with major shareholders in order to seek their 
input to the development of remuneration policy or plans.

Prot forecast
In its half-year results announcement on

statement, which is regarded as a prot 
forecast for the purposes of the Financial 
Services Authority’s Listing Rule 9.2.18 
(and which replaced the prot forecast made 
in the Group’s full-year results announcement 
on 20 February 2014 and in the Annual 
Report 2013):
“With the non-recurring benet from the 
Salam price escalation settlement in the 
second half of 2013, and before exchange 
translation, the Group continues to expect 
reported earnings per share to be some 
5% to 10% lower than in 2013. Exchange 
translation, assuming an average US$1.70 
exchange rate, is expected to impact those 
earnings by around one pence compared to 
previous guidance.”
Underlying earnings per share was 42.0p 
in 2013. In 2014, underlying earnings 
per share was 38.0p. The average US$ 
exchange rate for 2014 was 1.647.
Employees
The Group is committed to giving full and 
fair consideration to applications for 
employment from disabled people who

by one or more members to vote against the 
resolution; or if the proxy has been 
instructed by one or more shareholders to 
vote either for or against a resolution and by 
one or more of those shareholders to use 
his discretion how to vote). On a poll, every 
member present in person or by proxy and 
entitled to vote shall have one vote for every 
ordinary share held. Subject to the relevant 
statutory provisions and the Company’s 
Articles of Association, holders of ordinary 
shares are entitled to a dividend where 
declared or paid out of prots available for 
such purposes. Subject to the relevant 
statutory provisions and the Company’s 
Articles of Association, on a return of capital 
on a winding-up, holders of ordinary shares 
are entitled, after repayment of the £1 
Special Share, to participate in such a 
return. There are no redemption rights in 
relation to the ordinary shares.
Rights and obligations of the Special Share
The Special Share is held on behalf of the 
Secretary of State for Business, Innovation 
and Skills (the ‘Special Shareholder’). 
Certain provisions of the Company’s Articles 
of Association cannot be amended without 
the consent of the Special Shareholder. 
These provisions include the requirement 
that no foreign person, or foreign persons 
acting in concert, can have more than a 
15% voting interest in the Company, the 
requirement that the majority of the directors 
are British, and the requirement that the 
Chief Executive and any executive Chairman 
are British.
The holder of the Special Share is entitled 
to attend a general meeting, but the Special 
Share carries no right to vote or any other 
rights at any such meeting, other than to 
speak in relation to any business in respect 
of the Special Share. Subject to the relevant 
statutory provisions and the Company’s 
Articles of Association, on a return of capital 
on a winding-up, the holder of the Special 
Share shall be entitled to repayment of the 
£1 capital paid up on the Special Share in 
priority to any repayment of capital to any 
other members.
The holder of the Special Share has the 
right to require the Company to redeem the 
Special Share at par or convert the Special 
Share into one ordinary share at any time.
Restrictions on transfer of securities
The restrictions on the transfer of shares 
in the Company are as follows:
 – the Special Share may only be issued to, 
held by and transferred to the Special 
Shareholder or his successor or nominee;
 – the directors shall not register any 
allotment or transfer of any shares to a 
foreign person, or foreign persons acting 
in concert, who at the time have more than 
a 15% voting interest in the Company, or 
who would, following such allotment or 
transfer, have such an interest;
 – the directors shall not register any person 
as a holder of any shares unless they have 
received: (i) a declaration stating that upon 
registration, the share(s) will not be held by 
foreign persons or that upon registration 
the share(s) will be held by a foreign person 
or persons; (ii) such evidence (if any) as 
the directors may require of the authority 
of the signatory of the declaration; and 
(iii) such evidence or information (if any) as 
to the matters referred to in the declaration 
as the directors consider appropriate;
 – the directors may, in their absolute 
discretion, refuse to register any transfer 
of shares which are not fully paid up (but 
not so as to prevent dealings in listed 
shares from taking place);
 – the directors may also refuse to register 
any instrument of transfer of shares 
unless the instrument of transfer is in 
respect of only one class of share and it 
is lodged at the place where the register 
of members is kept, accompanied by a 
relevant certicate or such other evidence 
as the directors may reasonably require to 
show the right of the transferor to make 
the transfer;
 – the directors may refuse to register an 
allotment or transfer of shares in favour 
of more than four persons jointly;
 – where a shareholder has failed to provide 
the Company with certain information 
relating to their interest in shares, the 
directors can, in certain circumstances, 
refuse to register a transfer of such shares;
 – certain restrictions may from time to time 
be imposed by laws and regulations (for 
example, insider trading laws);
 – restrictions may be imposed pursuant to 
the Listing Rules of the Financial Services 
Authority whereby certain of the Group’s 
employees require the Company’s approval 
to deal in shares; and
 – awards of shares made under the 
Company’s Long-Term Incentive Plan 2014, 
Deferred Bonus Plan and Share Incentive 
Plan are subject to restrictions on the 
transfer of shares prior to vesting  
and/or release.
The Company is not aware of any 
arrangements between its shareholders 
that may result in restrictions on the 
transfer of shares and/or voting rights.
Signicant direct and indirect holders 
of securities
As at 18 February 2015, the Company had 
been advised of the following signicant

Exercise of rights of shares in employee 
share schemes
The Trustees of the employee trusts do 
not seek to exercise voting rights on shares 
held in the employee trusts other than on 
the direction of the underlying beneciaries. 
No voting rights are exercised in relation to 
shares unallocated to individual beneciaries.
Restrictions on voting deadlines
The notice of any general meeting shall 
specify the deadline for exercising voting 
rights and appointing a proxy or proxies to 
vote in relation to resolutions to be proposed 
at the general meeting. The number of proxy 
votes for, against or withheld in respect of 
each resolution are publicised on the 
Company’s website after the meeting.
Appointment and replacement of directors
Subject to certain nationality requirements 
mentioned below, the Company may by 
ordinary resolution appoint any person to 
be a director.
The majority of directors holding ofce must 
be British. Otherwise, the directors who are 
not British shall vacate ofce in such order 
that those who have been in ofce for the 
shortest period since their appointment shall 
vacate their ofce rst, unless all of the 
directors otherwise agree among themselves. 
Any director who holds the ofce of either 
Chairman (in an executive capacity) or Chief 
Executive shall also be British. GOVERNANCE

STRATEGIC  REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Governance
The Company must have six directors 
holding ofce at all times. If the number 
is reduced to below six, then such number 
of persons shall be appointed as directors 
as soon as is reasonably practicable to 
reinstate the number of directors to six. 
The Company may by ordinary resolution 
from time to time vary the minimum number 
of directors.
At each AGM of the Company, any director 
who was elected or last re-elected at or 
before the AGM held in the third calendar 
year before the then current calendar year 
must retire by rotation and such further 
directors must retire by rotation so that in 
total one-third of the directors retire by 
rotation each year. A retiring director is 
eligible for re-election. It is the Board’s 
intention that all directors will stand for 
election or re-election in 2015 in compliance 
with the UK Corporate Governance Code.
Amendment of the Company’s Articles 
of Association
The Company’s Articles of Association may 
only be amended by a special resolution at 
a general meeting of shareholders. Where 
class rights are varied, such amendments 
must be approved by the members of each 
class of shares separately.
In addition, certain provisions of the Articles 
of Association cannot be amended without 
the consent of the Special Shareholder. 
These provisions include the requirement 
that no foreign person, or foreign persons 
acting in concert, can have more than a 
15% voting interest in the Company, the 
requirement that the majority of the directors 
are British, and the requirement that the 
Chief Executive and any executive Chairman 
are British.
Powers of the directors
The directors are responsible for the 
management of the business of the Company 
and may exercise all powers of the Company 
subject to applicable legislation and 
regulation, and the Articles of Association.
At the 2014 AGM, the directors were given 
the power to buy back a maximum number of 
317,455,371 ordinary shares at a minimum 
price of 2.5p each. The maximum price was 
the higher of (i) an amount equal to 105% of 
the average of the middle market quotations 
of the Company’s ordinary shares as derived 
from the London Stock Exchange Daily 
Ofcial List for the ve business days 
immediately preceding the day on which 
such ordinary shares are contracted to be 
purchased, and (ii) the higher of the price of 
the last independent trade and the highest 
current independent bid on the London 
Stock Exchange as stipulated in Article 5(1) 
of the Buy-back and Stabilisation Regulation. 
This power will expire at the earlier of the 
conclusion of the 2015 AGM or 30 June 
2015. A special resolution will be proposed 
at the 2015 AGM to renew the Company’s 
authority to acquire its own shares.
At the 2014 AGM, the directors were given 
the power to issue new shares up to a 
nominal amount of £26,451,968. This power 
will expire on the earlier of the conclusion of 
the 2015 AGM or 30 June 2015. Accordingly, 
a resolution will be proposed at the 2015 
AGM to renew the Company’s authority to 
issue further new shares. At the 2014 AGM, 
the directors were also given the power to 
issue new issue shares up to a further 
nominal amount of £26,451,968 in 
connection with an offer by way of a rights 
issue. This authority too will expire on the 
earlier of the conclusion of the 2015 AGM 
or 30 June 2015, and a resolution will be 
proposed at the 2015 AGM to renew this 
additional authority.
Conicts of interest
As permitted under the Companies Act 
2006, the Company’s Articles of Association 
contain provisions which enable the Board to 
authorise conicts or potential conicts that 
individual directors may have.
To avoid potential conicts of interest the 
Board requires the Nominations Committee 
to check that any individuals it nominates 
for appointment to the Board are free of 
potential conicts. In addition, the Board’s 
procedures and the induction programme 
for new directors emphasise a director’s 
personal responsibility for complying with 
the duties relating to conicts of interest. 
The procedure adopted by the Board for the 
authorisation of conicts reminds directors 
of the need to consider their duties as 
directors and not grant an authorisation 
unless they believe, in good faith, that this 
would be likely to promote the success of 
the Company. As required by law, the 
potentially conicted director cannot vote on 
an authorisation resolution or be counted in 
the quorum. Any authorisation granted may 
be terminated at any time and the director 
is informed of the obligation to inform the 
Company without delay should there be any 
material change in the nature of the conict 
or potential conict so authorised.
Directors’ indemnities
The Company has entered into deeds of 
indemnity with all its current directors and 
those persons who were directors for any 
part of 2014 which are qualifying indemnity 
provisions for the purpose of the Companies 
Act 2006.
The directors of BAE Systems Pension Funds 
Trustees Limited, BAE Systems 2000 
Pension Plan Trustees Limited, BAE Systems 
Executive Pension Scheme Trustees Limited 
and Alvis Pension Scheme Trustees Limited 
benet from indemnities in the governing 
documentation of the BAE Systems Pension 
Scheme, the BAE Systems 2000 Pension 
Plan, the BAE Systems Executive Pension 
Scheme and the Alvis Pension Scheme, 
respectively, which are qualifying indemnity 
provisions for the purpose of the Companies 
Act 2006.
All such indemnity provisions are in force as 
at the date of this Directors’ Report. 96

Change of control – signicant agreements
The following signicant agreements contain 
provisions entitling the counterparties to 
exercise termination, alteration or other 
similar rights in the event of a change of 
control of the Company:
 – The Group has entered into a £2bn 
Revolving Credit Facility dated 12 December 
2013 which provides that, in the event of 
a change of control of the Company, the 
lenders are entitled to renegotiate terms, 
or if no agreement is reached on 
negotiated terms within a certain period, 
to call for the repayment or cancellation 
of the facility. The Revolving Credit Facility 
was undrawn as at 31 December 2014. 
 – The Company has entered into a Restated 
and Amended Shareholders Agreement 
with European Aeronautic Defence and 
Space Company EADS N.V. (EADS) and 
Finmeccanica S.p.A. (Finmeccanica) relating 
to MBDA S.A.S. dated 18 December 2001 
(as amended). In the event that control of 
the Company passes to certain specied 
third-party acquirors, the agreement allows 
EADS and Finmeccanica to exercise an 
option to terminate certain executive 
management level nomination and voting 
rights, and certain shareholder information 
rights of the Company in relation to the 
MBDA joint venture. Following the exercise 
of this option, the Company would have 
the right to require the other shareholders 
to purchase its interest in MBDA at fair 
market value.
The Company and EADS have agreed that 
if Finmeccanica acquires a controlling 
interest in the Company, EADS will 
increase its shareholding in MBDA to 50% 
by purchasing the appropriate number of 
shares in MBDA at fair market value.
 – The Company, BAE Systems, Inc., 
BAE Systems (Holdings) Limited and 
BAE Systems Holdings Inc. entered into 
a Special Security Agreement dated 
8 November 2010 with the US Department 
of Defense regarding the management of 
BAE Systems, Inc. in order to comply with 
the US government’s national security 
requirements. In the event of a change 
of control of the Company, the Agreement 
may be terminated or altered by the US 
Department of Defense.
 – In July 2009, BVT Surface Fleet Limited 
(now BAE Systems Surface Ships Limited) 
and the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) 
entered into a denitive Terms of Business 
Agreement (ToBA) which sets out a 15-year 
partnering arrangement, including lead 
roles for the BVT business on dened 
surface shipbuilding and support 
programmes. Where the MoD considers 
that a proposed change of control of 
BAE Systems Surface Ships Limited would 
be contrary to the defence, national 
security or national interest of the UK, then 
the change of control shall not proceed 
until agreement with the MoD is 
established. In the event that there is a 
change of control of BAE Systems Surface 
Ships Limited notwithstanding the 
objection of the MoD on such grounds, 
the MoD shall be entitled to terminate the 
ToBA immediately without compensation 
or termination charges.
On 30 September 2014, BAE Systems 
Surface Ships Limited and the MoD 
entered into an agreement which sets 
out terms for the progressive suspension, 
amendment and termination of the ToBA 
through the entering into of other contracts, 
such as the Maritime Support Delivery 
Framework (MSDF) agreement (see below) 
which triggered the deletion of elements of 
the ToBA relating to surface ship support. 
The current scope of the ToBA has, 
therefore, been reduced to focus on 
surface shipbuilding and the MoD retains 
its right to terminate the ToBA if there is 
a change of control notwithstanding the 
objection of the MoD.
 – The MSDF agreement between 
BAE Systems Surface Ships Limited and 
the MoD became effective on 1 October 
2014 and establishes a framework until 
March 2019 for the provision of surface 
ship support work and services relating 
to HM Naval Base Portsmouth. Where the 
MoD considers that a proposed change of 
control of BAE Systems Surface Ships 
Limited would be contrary to the defence, 
national security or national interest of the 
UK, then the change of control shall not 
proceed until agreement with the MoD is 
established. If there is a change of control 
without notice or notwithstanding the 
objection of the MoD, the MoD shall be 
entitled to terminate the MSDF.
 – In August 2008, BAE Systems Land 
Systems (Munitions & Ordnance) Limited 
(now BAE Systems Global Combat 
Systems Munitions Limited) and the 
MoD entered into a 15-year partnering 
agreement for the provision of ammunition 
to UK Forces (the Munitions Acquisition 
Supply Solution (MASS) partnering 
agreement). Where the MoD considers 
that a proposed change of control of 
BAE Systems Global Combat Systems 
Munitions Limited would be contrary to 
the defence, national security or national 
interest of the UK, then the change of 
control shall not proceed until agreement 
with the MoD is established. In the event 
that there is a change of control of 
BAE Systems Global Combat Systems 
Munitions Limited, notwithstanding the 
objection of the MoD on such grounds, 
the MoD may, having followed the dispute 
resolution process, terminate the MASS 
agreement for default.
 – In November 2012, BAE Systems Marine 
Limited entered into a contract with the 
MoD for the design, construction, testing 
and commissioning of Boat 4 of the Astute 
Class programme (the Agreement). Where 
the MoD considers that a proposed 
change of control of BAE Systems Marine 
Limited would be contrary to the defence, 
national security or national interest of the 
UK, then the change of control shall not 
proceed until agreement is established 
with the MoD. In the event that there is a 
change of control of BAE Systems Marine 
Limited, notwithstanding the objection of 
the MoD on such grounds, the MoD shall 
be entitled to terminate the Agreement 
immediately.
In addition, the Company’s share plans 
contain provisions as a result of which 
options and awards may vest and become 
exercisable on a change of control of the 
Company in accordance with the rules of 
the plans.

Statement of directors’ responsibilities in 
respect of the Annual Report and nancial 
statements
The directors are responsible for preparing 
the Annual Report, and the Group and parent 
company nancial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to 
prepare Group and parent company nancial 
statements for each nancial year. Under 
that law they are required to prepare the 
Group nancial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the EU and 
applicable law, and have elected to prepare 
the parent company nancial statements in 
accordance with UK accounting standards 
and applicable law (UK Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice).
Under company law the directors must not 
approve the nancial statements unless they 
are satised that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and 
parent company, and of their prot or loss for 
that period. In preparing each of the Group 
and parent company nancial statements, 
the directors are required to:
 – select suitable accounting policies and 
then apply them consistently;
 – make judgements and estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent;
 – for the Group nancial statements, state 
whether they have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by 
the EU;
 – for the parent company nancial 
statements, state whether applicable UK 
accounting standards have been followed, 
subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the parent 
company nancial statements; and
 – prepare the nancial statements on 
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the Group 
and the parent company will continue 
in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufcient to show and explain the parent 
company’s transactions, and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the nancial 
position of the parent company and enable 
them to ensure that its nancial statements 
comply with the Companies Act 2006. They 
have general responsibility for taking such 
steps as are reasonably open to them to 
safeguard the assets of the Group, and to 
prevent and detect fraud and other 
irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the 
directors are also responsible for preparing a 
strategic report, directors’ report, directors’ 
remuneration report and corporate 
governance statement that comply with that 
law and those regulations.
The directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the corporate 
and nancial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the UK 
governing the preparation and dissemination 
of nancial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
Statement of disclosure of information 
to auditors
The directors who held ofce at the date 
of approval of this Directors’ Report conrm 
that, so far as they are each aware, there is 
no relevant audit information of which the 
Company’s auditors are unaware; and each 
director has taken all the steps that he/she 
ought to have taken to make himself/herself 
aware of any relevant audit information and 
to establish that the Company’s auditors are 
aware of that information.

Responsibility statement of the 
directors in respect of the Annual 
Report and nancial statements
Each of the directors listed below conrms 
that to the best of their knowledge:
 – the nancial statements, prepared in 
accordance with the applicable set of 
accounting standards, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, nancial 
position and prot or loss of the Company, 
and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and
 – the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report, 
taken together, include a fair review of the 
development and performance of the 
business, and the position of the Company 
and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole, together 
with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that they face.
In addition, each of the directors considers 
that the Annual Report, taken as a whole, 
is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Company’s 
performance, business model and strategy.

INDEPENDENT 
AUDITOR’S REPORT
Opinions and conclusions arising 
from our audit
1. Our opinion on the nancial statements 
is unmodied 
We have audited the nancial statements 
of BAE Systems plc for the year ended 
31 December 2014 which comprise the 
Consolidated Income Statement, the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income, the Group and parent company 
balance sheets, the Consolidated Cash 
Flow Statement, the Consolidated Statement 
of Changes in Equity and related notes. 
In our opinion: 
 – the nancial statements give a true and 
fair view of the state of the Group’s and 
of the parent company’s affairs as at 
31 December 2014 and of the Group’s 
prot for the year then ended; 
 – the Group nancial statements have been 
properly prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards 
as adopted by the European Union; 
 – the parent company nancial statements 
have been properly prepared in accordance 
with UK accounting standards; and 
 – the nancial statements have been 
prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006 
and, as regards the Group nancial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
2. Our assessment of risks of material 
misstatement
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the 
nancial statements the risks of material 
misstatement that had the greatest effect 
on our audit were as follows:
Recognition of revenues and prots on 
long-term contracts
Refer to page 62 (Audit Committee Report) and page 
108 (accounting policy and nancial disclosures)
Audit risk 
A signicant proportion of the Group’s 
revenues and prots are derived from  
long-term contracts. 
These contracts include complex technical 
and commercial risks and often specify 
performance milestones to be achieved 
throughout the contract period, which can 
last many years. This results in estimates 
and assumptions being made to: 
 – assess the proportion of revenues to 
recognise in line with contract completion;
 – forecast the prot margin on each contract 
after making appropriate allowances for 
technical and commercial risks related 
to performance milestones yet to be 
achieved; and
 – appropriately provide for loss-making 
contracts. 
The risk of misstatement is that the 
accounting for the Group’s signicant 
contracts does not accurately reect the 
status of the relevant contract.
Procedures to address these audit risks 
included those listed below
The directors have detailed procedures and 
processes, called Lifecycle Management 
(LCM), in place to manage the commercial, 
technical and nancial aspects of the Group’s 
long-term contracts. The LCM process includes 
the regular preparation of a Contract Status 
Report (CSR) which includes key accounting 
information for the relevant contract.
We considered the design and tested the 
effective operation of key controls within  
the LCM process and supporting  
contract-related balances, including:
 – transactional controls that underpin the 
production of long-term contract-related 
balances, including cost information on 
contracts, such as purchase-to-pay cycle 
and payroll controls;
 – programme-level controls such as periodic 
peer-reviews performed by experienced 
employees independent to the contract at 
pre-determined stages of the contract 
lifecycle; and
 – higher-level controls, such as monthly 
contract review meetings, quarterly business 
unit review meetings and Group-level review 
meetings, covering all key contracts.
For signicant contracts, determined on the 
basis of the current and future technical or 
commercial complexity, nancial signicance 
and any forecast to be in signicant 
loss-making positions, we also: 
 – obtained an understanding of the 
performance and status of the contract 
through discussion with contract project 
teams, Group and business unit directors 
as well as attendance at project teams’ 
contract review meetings;
 – corroborated managements’ positions 
through the examination of externally 
available evidence, such as customer 
correspondence, and, in the case of one 
signicant programme, met the customer 
directly to further corroborate the status 
of contracts;
 – corroborated the consistency of 
information presented in the year-end 
CSRs to other nancial information 
received and knowledge gained through 
the above procedures; and
 – used our cumulative knowledge of contract 
issues to challenge the appropriateness of 
the contract positions reected in the 
nancial statements at the year end, 
including the assessment of margin traded 
on contracts based on allowances made 
for risks.  GOVERNANCE
99
BAE Systems
Annual Report 2014
STRATEGIC  REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Governance
The contracts requiring the highest degree 
of judgement that occupied a signicant 
proportion of the audit effort and discussion 
with management included:
 – US commercial shipbuilding contracts;
 – Korea F-16;
 – European Typhoon;
 – Saudi Typhoon;
 – Astute Class submarines; and
 – Queen Elizabeth Class aircraft carriers.
We also considered the adequacy of the 
Group’s segmental disclosures in respect of 
changes in the status of contracts which had 
a material impact on the Group’s nancial 
performance for the year.
Carrying value of US goodwill (£7.3bn)
Refer to page 62 (Audit Committee Report) and page 
118 (accounting policy and nancial disclosures)
Audit risk 
An impairment charge of £87m was 
recognised against the US Cash-Generating 
Units in the period (2013 £865m impairment). 
The uncertainty over future US defence 
spending and the importance of securing 
certain export contracts increases the risk 
that the goodwill allocated to the Group’s US 
Cash-Generating Units will not be 
recoverable.
Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in 
forecasting and discounting future cash 
ows, which are the basis of the 
assessment of recoverability, this is one of 
the key judgemental areas that our audit is 
concentrated on.
Procedures to address these audit risks 
included those listed below
The directors’ annual goodwill impairment 
testing is based on the Group’s ve-year 
Integrated Business Plan, as approved by 
the Board. 
In respect of the cash ows: 
We considered the Group’s budgeting 
procedures upon which the forecasts are 
based and the principles and integrity of the 
Group’s discounted cash ow model. To 
support the reasonableness of those cash 
ows, we assessed the historical accuracy 
of the Group’s forecasting and considered 
the forecasts with reference to publicly 
available information regarding future 
defence expenditure. 
In respect of the discount rate: 
We compared the Group’s assumptions 
to externally-derived data (for example, 
bond yields and ination statistics) where 
possible. We conducted our own 
assessments in relation to other key inputs, 
such as projected economic growth and 
gearing leverage. We also used our own 
valuation specialists in assessing the 
overall discount rates used. 
In respect of Cash-Generating Unit 
recoverable amounts: 
As an additional sense check to challenge 
the recoverable values of Cash-Generating 
Units, we performed a breakeven analysis 
on the key assumptions and compared the 
sum of discounted cash ows to the Group’s 
market capitalisation.
In respect of the disclosures: 
We assessed whether the Group’s 
disclosures about the sensitivity of the 
outcome of the impairment assessment to 
changes in key assumptions reected the 
risks inherent in the valuation of goodwill.
Retirement benet obligations (£5.5bn)
Refer to page 62 (Audit Committee Report) and page 
134 (accounting policy and nancial disclosures)
Audit risk 
As presented in note 21 of the nancial 
statements, the Group’s share of the 
pension schemes’ net decit was £5.5bn 
after allocating £1.4bn to equity accounted 
investments and other participating employers.
Small changes in assumptions and 
estimates used to value the Group’s 
retirement benet obligation, including those 
supporting the proportion allocated to equity 
accounted investments and other 
participating employers, have a signicant 
impact on the Group’s share of the 
retirement benet obligation.
Procedures to address these audit risks 
included those listed below
In respect of the multi-employer allocation:
We considered whether the methodology 
used by the directors, to allocate a proportion 
of the Group’s retirement benet obligation 
to the equity accounted investments and 
other participating employers, was 
appropriate. We assessed this estimate 
with reference to agreements between the 
Group and the equity accounted investments 
and other participating employers, which 
we examined.
In respect of the decit valuation: 
We challenged the key assumptions 
supporting the Group’s retirement benet 
obligations valuation, with input from our 
own actuarial specialists. This included a 
comparison of the discount rate, ination 
and life expectancy assumptions used 
against externally-derived data. In order 
to sense check the reasonableness of 
these assumptions, we performed a 
benchmarking exercise against comparator 
companies’ assumptions. We also agreed 
scheme assets to external valuations.
In respect of the disclosures: 
We considered the adequacy of the 
Group’s disclosures in respect of 
these key assumptions, including the 
sensitivity of the decit to changes.
Tax accruals
Audit risk 
Accruals for tax contingencies require the 
directors to make judgements and estimates 
in relation to tax risks. This is one of the key 
judgemental areas that our audit is 
concentrated on due to the Group operating 
in a number of tax jurisdictions and the 
complexities of international tax legislation.
The tax matters are at various stages, from 
preliminary discussions with tax authorities 
through to tax tribunal or court proceedings 
where the matters can take many years to 
resolve. The risk to the nancial statements 
is that the eventual resolution of a matter 
with tax authorities is at an amount materially 
different to the estimated accrual.
Procedures to address these audit risks 
included those listed below
Together with our own tax specialists, we 
considered any large or unusual items in the 
effective tax reconciliation and whether or 
not these current year items would indicate 
a requirement for further accruals. 
In considering the judgements and estimates 
of tax accruals, we used our own international 
and local tax specialists to assess the 
Group’s tax positions. This included the 
assessment of its correspondence with the 
relevant tax authorities and the Company’s 
external tax advisers; we also used our 
knowledge and experience of the application 
of the international and local legislation by 
the relevant authorities and courts in order 
to challenge the positions taken by 
management. In support of these discussions, 
we separately met with certain key external 
tax advisers of the Company.
We also analysed and challenged the 
assumptions used to determine the tax 
accruals and tested the accuracy of 
calculations. 
We have also considered the adequacy of 
the Group’s tax disclosures.
3. Our application of materiality and 
an overview of the scope of our audit
The materiality for the Group nancial 
statements as a whole was set at £80m, 
determined with reference to a benchmark 
of Group prot before tax, excluding the 
impairment charge for the year of £170m 
as disclosed on the face of the Consolidated 
Income Statement. This represents 7.6% 
of the adjusted benchmark.
We reported to the Audit Committee 
any corrected or uncorrected identied 
misstatements exceeding £4m for income 
statement items, in addition to other 
identied misstatements that warranted 
reporting on qualitative grounds. 100

Governance
Of the Group’s 36 reporting components, we subjected ten to audits for Group reporting 
purposes and nine to specied risk-focused audit procedures. The latter were not individually 
nancially signicant enough to require an audit for Group reporting purposes, but did present 
specic individual risks that needed to be addressed.
The components within the scope of our work accounted for the following percentages of the 
Group’s results:

1. In the UK, US, Saudi Arabia and Australia.
2. In the UK and US.
For the remaining components, we performed 
analysis at an aggregated level to re-examine 
our assessment that there were no signicant 
risks of material misstatement within these. 
The Group audit team instructed component 
auditors as to the signicant areas to be 
covered, including the relevant risks detailed 
above and the information to be reported 
back. The Group audit team approved the 
component materialities, which ranged from 
£8m to £40m, having regard to the mix of 
size and risk prole of the Group across the 
components. The work on 17 of the 19 
components was performed by component 
auditors and the rest by the Group audit team.
The Group audit team held a global audit 
conference in the year, where all signicant 
components came together in London to 
consider the audit risk and strategy. In 
addition, the Group audit team visited 
component teams in the UK, US, Saudi 
Arabia and Australia, to assess the audit 
risk and strategy, discuss and moderate 
the results of controls testing and discuss 
preliminary ndings of components’ nal 
procedures. Video and telephone conference 
meetings were also held with these 
component auditors and the others that were 
not physically visited. At these visits and 
meetings, the ndings reported to the Group 
audit team were discussed in more detail, 
and any further work required by the Group 
audit team was then performed by the 
component auditor. 
4. Our opinion on other matters prescribed 
by the Companies Act 2006 is unmodied
In our opinion: 
 – the part of the Annual Remuneration 
Report to be audited has been properly 
prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006; and 
 – the information given in the Strategic 
Report and the Directors’ Report for the 
nancial year for which the nancial 
statements are prepared is consistent 
with the nancial statements. 
5. We have nothing to report in respect of the 
matters on which we are required to report 
by exception 
Under International Standards on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland) we are required to report to 
you if, based on the knowledge we acquired 
during our audit, we have identied other 
information in the Annual Report that 
contains a material inconsistency with either 
that knowledge or the nancial statements, 
a material misstatement of fact, or that is 
otherwise misleading. 
In particular, we are required to report to you if: 
 – we have identied material inconsistencies 
between the knowledge we acquired 
during our audit and the directors’ 
statement that they consider that the 
Annual Report and nancial statements 
taken as a whole is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Group’s performance, 
business model and strategy; or
 – the Audit Committee Report does not 
appropriately address matters communicated 
by us to the Audit Committee.
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are 
required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 – adequate accounting records have not 
been kept by the parent company, or 
returns adequate for our audit have not 
been received from branches not visited 
by us; or 
 – the parent company nancial statements 
and the part of the Annual Remuneration 
Report to be audited are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns; or 
 – certain disclosures of directors’ 
remuneration specied by law are not 
made; or 
 – we have not received all the information 
and explanations we require for our audit. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to 
review: 
 – the directors’ statement, set out on page 
60, in relation to going concern; and 
 – the part of the Governance section relating 
to the Company’s compliance with the ten 
provisions of the 2012 UK Corporate 
Governance Code specied for our review. 
We have nothing to report in respect of the 
above responsibilities.
Scope of report and responsibilities
As explained more fully in the directors’ 
responsibilities statement set out on page 
97, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the nancial statements and 
for being satised that they give a true and 
fair view. A description of the scope of an 
audit of nancial statements is provided on 
the Financial Reporting Council’s website 
at www.frc.org.uk/auditscopeukprivate. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s 
members as a body and is subject to 
important explanations and disclaimers 
regarding our responsibilities, published 
on our website at www.kpmg.com/uk/
auditscopeukco2014a, which are 
incorporated into this report as if set out 
in full and should be read to provide an 
understanding of the purpose of this report, 
the work we have undertaken and the basis 
of our opinions.

GROUP ACCOUNTS 
PREPARATION  
The consolidated financial statements of BAE Systems plc have been prepared on a going concern basis, as discussed in the Corporate 
Governance Report on page 60, and in accordance with EU-endorsed International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the 
Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.  
The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling and, unless stated otherwise, rounded to the nearest million. They 
have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of available-for-sale financial assets, and other 
relevant financial assets and financial liabilities (including derivative instruments).  
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. These exchange 
differences are recognised in the income statement. 
Principal accounting policies, judgements and estimates  
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out in the relevant notes. 
These policies have been applied consistently to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated. 
Certain of the Group’s principal accounting policies are considered by the directors to be critical because of the level of complexity, 
judgement or estimation involved in their application and their impact on the consolidated financial statements. The critical accounting 
policies are listed below and explained in more detail in the relevant notes to the Group accounts:  
Critical accounting policy Description Notes
Revenue and profit recognition 
– The recognition of revenue and profit on 
long-term contracts. 
 
The majority of long-term contracts are accounted for under IAS 11, Construction 
Contracts. Revenue on long-term contracts is recognised when performance 
milestones have been completed.  
The ultimate profitability of long-term contracts is estimated based on estimates 
of revenue and costs, including allowances for technical and other risks, which are 
reliant on the knowledge and experience of the Group’s project managers, 
engineers, and finance and commercial professionals. Material changes in these 
estimates could affect the profitability of individual contracts. 
Revenue and cost estimates are reviewed and updated at least quarterly, and more 
frequently as determined by events or circumstances. 
Profit is recognised progressively as risks have been mitigated or retired. 
1
Carrying value of intangible assets 
– The valuation of acquired intangible 
assets; and 
 
 
 
 
– the determination of assumptions 
underpinning goodwill impairment  
testing. 
 
Acquired intangible assets, excluding goodwill, are valued in line with internationally 
used models, which require the use of estimates that may differ from actual 
outcomes. These assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives. Future 
results are impacted by the amortisation periods adopted and, potentially, any 
differences between estimated and actual circumstances related to individual 
intangible assets. 
Goodwill is not amortised, but is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost 
less accumulated impairment losses. The impairment review calculations require the 
use of estimates related to the future profitability and cash-generating ability of the 
acquired businesses and the pre-tax discount rate used in discounting these 
projected cash flows. 
9
Valuation of retirement benefit obligations 
– The determination of assumptions 
underpinning the valuation of retirement 
benefit obligations for defined benefit 
pension schemes; and 
 
 
– the determination of the share of the 
pension deficit allocated to the Group’s 
equity accounted investments and other 
participating employers. 
 
Pension scheme accounting valuations are prepared by independent actuaries. For 
each of the actuarial assumptions used to measure the Group’s pension scheme 
liabilities, there is a range of possible values and management exercises judgement 
in deciding the point within that range that most appropriately reflects the Group’s 
circumstances. Small changes in these assumptions can have a significant impact 
on the size of the deficit.  
The Group has allocated a share of the pension deficit to its equity accounted 
investments and other participating employers using a consistent allocation method 
intended to reflect a reasonable approximation of their share of the deficit. 
21
In addition to the critical accounting policies, the directors exercise judgement to determine the amount of tax provisions. Provision is 
made for known issues based on interpretation of country-specific legislation and the likely outcome of negotiations or litigation. The 
resolution of tax positions taken by the Group can take a considerable period of time to conclude and, in some cases, it is difficult to 
predict the outcome. To the extent that the outcome differs from the estimates made, tax adjustments may be required in future periods. 
The directors believe that the consolidated financial statements reflect appropriate judgements and estimates, and provide a true and 
fair view of the Group’s financial performance and position.   
 
PREPARATION continued 
Changes in accounting policies 
With effect from 1 January 2014, the Group has adopted the following new standards and amendments to existing standards: 
− IFRS 10, Consolidated Financial Statements 
− IFRS 11, Joint Arrangements 
− IFRS 12, Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities  
− IAS 27, Separate Financial Statements (revised 2011) 
− IAS 28, Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures (revised 2011) 
With the exception of new disclosure requirements, none of these have impacted the consolidated financial statements of the Group. 
There are no other EU-endorsed IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are not yet effective that are expected to have a material impact 
on the Group. 
IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, issued in May 2014, is not yet EU endorsed. Management is in the process of 
reviewing the impact that this will have on the Group. 
IFRS 9, Financial Instruments, issued in July 2014, is not yet EU endorsed. It is not expected to have a material impact on the Group. 
Consolidation 
The financial statements of the Group consolidate the results of the Company and its subsidiary entities, and include its share of its 
joint ventures’ results accounted for under the equity method, all of which are prepared to 31 December.  
A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group. The Group controls a subsidiary when it is exposed, or has the rights, to variable 
returns from its involvement with the subsidiary and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the subsidiary.  
The results of subsidiaries are included in the income statement from the date of acquisition. 
Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements. 
Joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method where the Consolidated Income Statement includes the Group’s share of their 
profits and losses, and the Consolidated Balance Sheet includes its share of their net assets within equity accounted investments.  
The assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiaries and equity accounted investments are translated at the exchange rates ruling at the 
balance sheet date. The income statements of such entities are translated at average rates of exchange during the year. All resulting 
exchange differences are recognised directly in a separate component of equity.  
Translation differences that arose before the transition date to IFRS (1 January 2004) are presented in equity, but not as a separate 
component. When a foreign operation is sold, the cumulative exchange differences recognised in equity since 1 January 2004 are 
recognised in the income statement as part of the profit or loss on sale.

NOTES TO THE GROUP ACCOUNTS  
 
1. SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS  
 
Revenue and profit recognition 
Sales include the Group’s share of sales of equity accounted investments. Revenue represents sales made by the Company and its 
subsidiary undertakings, excluding the Group’s share of sales of equity accounted investments. 
Long-term contracts 
The majority of the Group’s long-term contract arrangements are accounted for under IAS 11, Construction Contracts. Sales are 
recognised when the Group has obtained the right to consideration in exchange for its performance. This is usually when title passes 
or a separately identifiable phase (milestone) of a contract or development has been completed. 
No profit is recognised on contracts until the outcome of the contract can be reliably estimated. Profit is calculated by reference to 
reliable estimates of contract revenue and forecast costs after making suitable allowances for technical and other risks related to 
performance milestones yet to be achieved. Profit is recognised progressively as risks have been mitigated or retired.  
When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised immediately as an expense. 
Goods sold and services rendered 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of returns, rebates and other similar allowances. 
Revenue from the sale of goods not under a long-term contract is recognised in the income statement when the significant risks and 
rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer, recovery of the consideration is probable, there is no continuing management 
involvement with the goods, and the amount of revenue and costs can be measured reliably. Profit is recognised at the time of sale. 
Revenue from the provision of services not under a long-term contract is recognised in the income statement in proportion to the stage 
of completion of the contract at the reporting date. The stage of completion is measured on the basis of direct expenses incurred as a 
percentage of total expenses to be incurred for material contracts and labour hours delivered as a percentage of total labour hours to 
be delivered for time contracts. 
Sales and profits on intercompany trading are determined on an arm’s length basis. 
Research and development 
The Group undertakes research and development activities either on its own behalf or on behalf of customers.  
Where the research and development activity is performed on behalf of customers, the revenue arising is recognised in the income 
statement in accordance with the Group’s revenue recognition policy. 
 
Key Performance Indicator – Underlying EBITA 
Management uses an underlying profit measure to monitor the year-on-year profitability of the Group, which is defined as earnings 
before amortisation and impairment of intangible assets, finance costs and taxation expense (EBITA) excluding non-recurring items. 
This definition is referred to as underlying EBITA. Underlying EBITA is the measure of profit on which segmental performance is 
monitored by management. As such, underlying EBITA is disclosed on page 110 on a segmental basis and reconciled to the reporting 
segment result and operating profit in the consolidated financial statements.  
Non-recurring items 
Non-recurring items are defined as items that are relevant to an understanding of the Group’s performance with reference to their 
materiality and nature. As part of a planned reorganisation of the Group’s portfolio of interests in a number of industrial companies in 
Saudi Arabia and an enhancement of its existing relationship with Riyadh Wings Aviation Academy LLC (Riyadh Wings), BAE Systems has 
acquired an additional 59% shareholding in Saudi Development and Training Company (SDT) from Riyadh Wings and expects to complete 
the disposal of its 85.7% shareholding in Aircraft Accessories and Components Company (AACC) during 2015, subject to the satisfaction 
of certain regulatory approvals. Accordingly, AACC is presented as held for sale at 31 December 2014. Upon classification of AACC as 
held for sale, the carrying value of the business was in excess of the expected proceeds of the proposed disposal and, therefore, a 
charge of £47m has been taken in 2014. Upon acquisition of the additional shareholding in SDT and control of the company, the Group 
has recognised a £47m fair value gain on its existing 40% shareholding. The Group considers the combined impact of these two 
transactions in Saudi Arabia to meet its definition of non-recurring items, being profit/loss on business transactions, and, therefore, 
they have been presented within non-recurring items in the Group’s income statement.  
Reporting segments 
The Group has six reporting segments which align with the Group’s strategic direction:  
– Electronic Systems comprises the US and UK-based electronics activities, including electronic warfare systems and electro-optical 
sensors, military and commercial digital engine and flight controls, next-generation military communications systems and data links, 
persistent surveillance capabilities, and hybrid electric drive systems;  
– Cyber & Intelligence comprises the US-based Intelligence & Security business and UK-headquartered Applied Intelligence business, 
and covers the Group’s cyber, secure government, and commercial and financial security activities; 
– Platforms & Services (US) comprises the US-headquartered Land & Armaments business, with operations in the US, UK, Sweden 
and South Africa, and the US-based services and sustainment activities, including ship repair and munitions services; 
– Platforms & Services (UK) comprises the Group’s UK-based air, maritime, combat vehicle, munitions and shared services activities;

1. SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS continued 
Management monitors the results of these reporting segments to assess performance and make decisions about the allocation of 
resources. Segment performance is evaluated based on combined sales of the Group and its share of equity accounted investments, 
and underlying EBITA. Finance costs and taxation expense are managed on a Group basis.  
Following a restructuring of its US operations in 2014 to reduce management and administrative overhead, some activities previously 
included in the Group's Platforms & Services (US) segment will, from 1 January 2015, be reported within the Cyber & Intelligence 
segment. Consistent with financial information regularly reviewed by the Group’s Executive Committee, the impact of the restructuring 
on the Group’s external reporting segments will be reflected in 2015 and comparatives for 2014 restated at that time.

NOTES TO THE GROUP ACCOUNTS  
 
1. SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS  
 
Revenue and profit recognition 
Sales include the Group’s share of sales of equity accounted investments. Revenue represents sales made by the Company and its 
subsidiary undertakings, excluding the Group’s share of sales of equity accounted investments. 
Long-term contracts 
The majority of the Group’s long-term contract arrangements are accounted for under IAS 11, Construction Contracts. Sales are 
recognised when the Group has obtained the right to consideration in exchange for its performance. This is usually when title passes 
or a separately identifiable phase (milestone) of a contract or development has been completed. 
No profit is recognised on contracts until the outcome of the contract can be reliably estimated. Profit is calculated by reference to 
reliable estimates of contract revenue and forecast costs after making suitable allowances for technical and other risks related to 
performance milestones yet to be achieved. Profit is recognised progressively as risks have been mitigated or retired.  
When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised immediately as an expense. 
Goods sold and services rendered 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of returns, rebates and other similar allowances. 
Revenue from the sale of goods not under a long-term contract is recognised in the income statement when the significant risks and 
rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer, recovery of the consideration is probable, there is no continuing management 
involvement with the goods, and the amount of revenue and costs can be measured reliably. Profit is recognised at the time of sale. 
Revenue from the provision of services not under a long-term contract is recognised in the income statement in proportion to the stage 
of completion of the contract at the reporting date. The stage of completion is measured on the basis of direct expenses incurred as a 
percentage of total expenses to be incurred for material contracts and labour hours delivered as a percentage of total labour hours to 
be delivered for time contracts. 
Sales and profits on intercompany trading are determined on an arm’s length basis. 
Research and development 
The Group undertakes research and development activities either on its own behalf or on behalf of customers.  
Where the research and development activity is performed on behalf of customers, the revenue arising is recognised in the income 
statement in accordance with the Group’s revenue recognition policy. 
 
Key Performance Indicator – Underlying EBITA 
Management uses an underlying profit measure to monitor the year-on-year profitability of the Group, which is defined as earnings 
before amortisation and impairment of intangible assets, finance costs and taxation expense (EBITA) excluding non-recurring items. 
This definition is referred to as underlying EBITA. Underlying EBITA is the measure of profit on which segmental performance is 
monitored by management. As such, underlying EBITA is disclosed on page 110 on a segmental basis and reconciled to the reporting 
segment result and operating profit in the consolidated financial statements.  
Non-recurring items 
Non-recurring items are defined as items that are relevant to an understanding of the Group’s performance with reference to their 
materiality and nature. As part of a planned reorganisation of the Group’s portfolio of interests in a number of industrial companies in 
Saudi Arabia and an enhancement of its existing relationship with Riyadh Wings Aviation Academy LLC (Riyadh Wings), BAE Systems has 
acquired an additional 59% shareholding in Saudi Development and Training Company (SDT) from Riyadh Wings and expects to complete 
the disposal of its 85.7% shareholding in Aircraft Accessories and Components Company (AACC) during 2015, subject to the satisfaction 
of certain regulatory approvals. Accordingly, AACC is presented as held for sale at 31 December 2014. Upon classification of AACC as 
held for sale, the carrying value of the business was in excess of the expected proceeds of the proposed disposal and, therefore, a 
charge of £47m has been taken in 2014. Upon acquisition of the additional shareholding in SDT and control of the company, the Group 
has recognised a £47m fair value gain on its existing 40% shareholding. The Group considers the combined impact of these two 
transactions in Saudi Arabia to meet its definition of non-recurring items, being profit/loss on business transactions, and, therefore, 
they have been presented within non-recurring items in the Group’s income statement.  
Reporting segments 
The Group has six reporting segments which align with the Group’s strategic direction:  
– Electronic Systems comprises the US and UK-based electronics activities, including electronic warfare systems and electro-optical 
sensors, military and commercial digital engine and flight controls, next-generation military communications systems and data links, 
persistent surveillance capabilities, and hybrid electric drive systems;  
– Cyber & Intelligence comprises the US-based Intelligence & Security business and UK-headquartered Applied Intelligence business, 
and covers the Group’s cyber, secure government, and commercial and financial security activities; 
– Platforms & Services (US) comprises the US-headquartered Land & Armaments business, with operations in the US, UK, Sweden 
and South Africa, and the US-based services and sustainment activities, including ship repair and munitions services; 
– Platforms & Services (UK) comprises the Group’s UK-based air, maritime, combat vehicle, munitions and shared services activities; 
– Platforms & Services (International) comprises the Group’s businesses in Saudi Arabia, Australia and Oman, together with its 37.5% 
interest in the pan-European MBDA joint venture; and 
– HQ comprises the Group’s business in India and head office activities, together with a 49% interest in Air Astana.

6. TAXATION EXPENSE 
 
Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Current and deferred tax is recognised in profit or loss except to the extent 
that it relates to a business combination or items recognised directly in equity or other comprehensive income. 
Current tax 
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable profit or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively 
enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. 
Deferred tax 
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial 
reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognised for temporary differences: 
– on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting 
nor taxable profit or loss; 
– related to investments in subsidiaries and equity accounted investments to the extent that it is probable that they will not reverse in 
the foreseeable future; and 
– arising on the initial recognition of goodwill. 
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, based on the 
laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.

The £51m credit relates to one such position in respect of an overseas issue where information received in the year enabled the estimate to be updated.  
2. The UK current tax rate was reduced from 23% to 21% with effect from 1 April 2014, and will be reduced to 20% with effect from 1 April 2015. In line with this 
change, the rate applying to UK deferred tax assets and liabilities was reduced from 23% to 20%, creating a rate adjustment in 2013, which is partly reflected

7. HELD FOR SALE  
 
Held for sale comprises assets and liabilities that are expected to be recovered primarily through sale rather than continuing use. 
Assets and liabilities held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying value and fair value less costs to sell.  
In August, the Group announced an agreement for the proposed sale of its 75% holding in BAE Systems Land Systems South Africa (Pty) 
Limited (LSSA) for cash consideration of 641 million Rand (£36m), subject to closing adjustments. The proposed disposal, which is 
conditional upon receiving regulatory and other approvals, is expected to complete during 2015. Accordingly, LSSA is presented as held 
for sale at 31 December 2014.  
As part of a planned reorganisation of the Group’s portfolio of interests in a number of industrial companies in Saudi Arabia, BAE Systems 
expects to complete the disposal of its 85.7% shareholding in Aircraft Accessories and Components Company (AACC) during 2015, 
subject to the satisfaction of certain regulatory approvals. Accordingly, AACC is presented as held for sale at 31 December 2014.

NOTES TO THE GROUP ACCOUNTS 
CONTINUED  
9. INTANGIBLE ASSETS  
 
Intangible assets are carried at cost or valuation, less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. 
Cost or valuation 
Intangible assets arising from a business combination are recognised at fair value, amortised over their estimated useful lives and 
subject to impairment testing. The Group’s accounting policy on business combinations is included in note 26. 
Goodwill 
Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets. Goodwill on acquisitions of joint ventures and associates is 
included in the carrying value of equity accounted investments. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying 
amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold. 
Programme and customer-related 
The most significant intangible assets recognised by the Group are in relation to ongoing programmes within businesses acquired, 
mainly in respect of customer relationships and order backlog.  
Other intangible assets 
Other intangible assets include: 
– Computer software licences acquired for use within the Group are capitalised as an intangible asset on the basis of the costs incurred 
to acquire and bring to use the specific software; 
– Software development costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products controlled by 
the Group, and that will probably generate economic benefits exceeding costs beyond one year, are recognised as intangible assets. 
Group-funded expenditure associated with enhancing or maintaining computer software programs for sale is recognised as an 
expense as incurred; 
– Research and development expenditure funded by the Group on development activities applied to a plan or design for the production 
of new or substantially improved products is capitalised as an internally generated intangible asset if certain conditions are met. The 
expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and related overheads; and  
– Patents, trademarks and licences.  
Amortisation 
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets.  
For programme-related intangibles, amortisation is set on a programme-by-programme basis over the life of the individual programme. 
Amortisation for customer-related intangibles is also set on an individual basis. 
The estimated useful lives are as follows: 
Programme and customer-related up to 15 years 
Other intangible assets:  
Computer software licences acquired 2 to 5 years 
Software development costs 2 to 5 years 
Research and development expenditure  up to 10 years 
Patents, trademarks and licences  up to 20 years 
Other intangibles up to 10 years 
The Group has no indefinite life intangible assets other than goodwill. 
Impairment of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, investment property and equity accounted investments 
The carrying amounts of the Group’s intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, investment property and equity accounted 
investments are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment as required by IAS 36, 
Impairment of Assets. If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. For intangible assets that are not yet 
available for use, impairment testing is performed annually. 
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.  
The recoverable amount is the greater of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future 
cash flows are discounted to their present value using an appropriate pre-tax discount rate. For an asset that does not generate largely 
independent cash flows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.  
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement. 
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.  
An impairment loss in respect of other intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, investment property and equity accounted 
investments is reversed if the subsequent increase in recoverable amount can be related objectively to an event occurring after the 
impairment loss was recognised or if there has been a change in the estimate used to determine the recoverable amount. 
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would 
have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.

1. Includes intangible assets with nil net book value no longer used by the Group.  
Impairment testing 
In order to calculate the recoverable amount of the Group’s goodwill, all goodwill balances have been considered with regard to  
value-in-use calculations.  
The value-in-use calculations use risk-adjusted future cash flow projections based on the Group’s five-year Integrated Business Plan (IBP) 
and include a terminal value based on the projections for the final year of that plan, with growth rate assumptions applied. The IBP 
process includes the use of historic experience, available government spending data and the Group’s order backlog. Pre-tax discount 
rates, derived from the Group’s post-tax weighted average cost of capital of 7.12% (2013 7.96%) (adjusted for risks specific to the 
market in which the Cash-Generating Unit (CGU) operates), have been used in discounting these projected risk-adjusted cash flows.

Other CGUs 
The remaining goodwill balance of £2.4bn (2013 £2.3bn) is allocated across multiple CGUs, including £0.5bn (2013 £0.5bn) in the 
Applied Intelligence CGU, with no individual CGU exceeding 10% of the Group’s total goodwill balance. The majority of the projected cash 
flows within these CGUs are underpinned by expected levels of primarily UK government spending on defence, aerospace and security, 
and the Group’s ability to capture a broadly consistent market share. In the case of Applied Intelligence, the future cash flow projections 
are based on the expectation of growth in cyber and intelligence, in the UK and overseas government markets, together with increasing 
demand for products and services in commercial markets. 
Impairment – goodwill 
In 2014, the impairment charge of £161m comprises the Support Solutions CGU (£87m), reflecting performance issues at the US 
commercial shipbuilding business, and the Land & Armaments CGU (£74m), reflecting the agreement to sell the Group’s 75% holding 
in BAE Systems Land Systems South Africa (Pty) Limited at a price below its total carrying value.  
In 2013, the impairment charge of £865m comprised the US Intelligence & Security (£417m) and Land & Armaments (£448m) CGUs.  
Impairment – intangible assets 
In 2014, the impairment charge of £9m relates to the Electronic Systems (£1m) and Platforms & Services (US) (£8m) reporting segments.  
In 2013, the impairment charge of £22m related to the Electronic Systems (£4m), Cyber & Intelligence (£8m) and Platforms & Services 
(US) (£10m) reporting segments. 
  
 
10. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT 
 
Cost 
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. The cost of  
self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of production overheads. The cost 
of demonstration assets is written off as incurred.  
Assets held for leasing out under operating leases are included in property, plant and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation 
and impairment losses.  
Depreciation 
Depreciation is provided, normally on a straight-line basis, to write off the cost of property, plant and equipment over their estimated 
useful lives to any estimated residual value, using the following rates: 
Buildings up to 50 years, or the lease term if shorter 
Plant and machinery:  
Computing equipment and motor vehicles  4 to 5 years 
Other equipment  10 to 20 years, or the project life if shorter 
For certain items of plant and equipment in the Group’s US businesses, depreciation is normally provided on a basis consistent with 
cost reimbursement profiles under US government contracts. Typically this provides for a faster rate of depreciation than would 
otherwise arise on a straight-line basis. 
No depreciation is provided on freehold land and assets in the course of construction. 
The assets’ residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.  
Impairment 
The carrying amounts of the Group’s property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether 
there is any indication of impairment in accordance with the policy shown in note 9.

11. INVESTMENT PROPERTY 
 
Cost 
Land and buildings that are leased to non-Group entities are classified as investment property. The Group measures investment 
property at its cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. 
Depreciation 
Depreciation is provided, on a straight-line basis, to write off the cost of investment property over its estimated useful life of up to 
50 years. 
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date. 
Impairment 
The carrying amounts of the Group’s investment property are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any 
indication of impairment in accordance with the policy shown in note 9.

12. EQUITY ACCOUNTED INVESTMENTS 
 
A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control have rights to the net assets of the arrangement.  
Carrying value 
The carrying value of an equity accounted investment comprises the Group’s share of net assets and purchased goodwill, and is 
assessed for impairment as a single asset. The carrying amounts of the Group’s equity accounted investments are reviewed at each 
balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment in accordance with the policy shown in note 9.

The Company has taken advantage of the exemption under Section 410(2) of the Companies Act 2006 by providing information only 
in relation to equity accounted investments whose results or financial position, in the opinion of the directors, principally affected the 
financial statements. Accordingly, the equity accounted investments listed in the table above are those that represent more than 5% 
of total Group sales or underlying EBITA
1
 or that represent a significant proportion of the total carrying value of equity accounted 
investments. A full list of subsidiary, equity accounted investments and other associated undertakings as at 31 December 2014 
will be annexed to the Company’s next annual return filed with the Registrar of Companies. 
The following tables summarise the financial information of the Group’s principal equity accounted investments included in their own 
financial statements, as adjusted for fair value adjustments at acquisition and differences in accounting policies, and reconcile this 
to the Group's interest in those equity accounted investments.

11. INVESTMENT PROPERTY 
 
Cost 
Land and buildings that are leased to non-Group entities are classified as investment property. The Group measures investment 
property at its cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. 
Depreciation 
Depreciation is provided, on a straight-line basis, to write off the cost of investment property over its estimated useful life of up to 
50 years. 
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date. 
Impairment 
The carrying amounts of the Group’s investment property are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any 
indication of impairment in accordance with the policy shown in note 9.

12. EQUITY ACCOUNTED INVESTMENTS 
 
A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control have rights to the net assets of the arrangement.  
Carrying value 
The carrying value of an equity accounted investment comprises the Group’s share of net assets and purchased goodwill, and is 
assessed for impairment as a single asset. The carrying amounts of the Group’s equity accounted investments are reviewed at each 
balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment in accordance with the policy shown in note 9.

The Company has taken advantage of the exemption under Section 410(2) of the Companies Act 2006 by providing information only 
in relation to equity accounted investments whose results or financial position, in the opinion of the directors, principally affected the 
financial statements. Accordingly, the equity accounted investments listed in the table above are those that represent more than 5% 
of total Group sales or underlying EBITA
1
 or that represent a significant proportion of the total carrying value of equity accounted 
investments. A full list of subsidiary, equity accounted investments and other associated undertakings as at 31 December 2014 
will be annexed to the Company’s next annual return filed with the Registrar of Companies. 
The following tables summarise the financial information of the Group’s principal equity accounted investments included in their own 
financial statements, as adjusted for fair value adjustments at acquisition and differences in accounting policies, and reconcile this 
to the Group's interest in those equity accounted investments.

Contingent liabilities

13. TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES 
 
Trade and other receivables are stated at their cost less provision for bad debts. A provision for bad debt is established when there 
is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. 
Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default 
or delinquency in payments are considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired. Receivables with a short-term duration are 
not discounted. 
A loss on provision for bad debt is reversed if the subsequent increase in recoverable amount can be related objectively to an event 
occurring after the impairment loss was recognised. 
Amounts due from customers for contract work includes long-term contract balances and amounts due from contract customers, 
less attributable progress payments. 
Long-term contract balances are stated at cost less provision for any anticipated losses. Provisions for losses on contracts are 
recorded when it becomes probable that total estimated contract costs will exceed total contract revenues. Such provisions are 
recorded as write downs of long-term contract balances for that portion of the work which has already been completed, and the 
remainder is included as amounts due to long-term contract customers within trade and other payables. Losses are determined 
on the basis of estimated results on completion of contracts and are updated regularly. 
Progress payments are amounts received from customers in accordance with the terms of contracts which specify payments in 
advance of delivery and are credited, as progress payments, against any expenditure incurred for the particular contract. Any 
unexpended balance in respect of progress payments is held in trade and other payables as customer stage payments or, if the 
amounts are subject to advance payment guarantees unrelated to Group performance, as cash received on customers’ account. 
Amounts due from contract customers represent unbilled income and are stated at cost, plus attributable profit.

2. There are no retentions against long-term contracts (2013 £nil) and no amounts that are past due within amounts due from cus tomers for contract work (2013 £nil).  
The aggregate amount of costs incurred and recognised profits (less recognised losses) to date in respect of contracts in progress at 
31 December 2014 are estimated to be £30.2bn (2013 £31.7bn).  
Trade receivables are disclosed net of a provision for bad debts. Disclosures relating to the ageing of trade receivables and movements 
in the provision for bad debts are provided in note 28. 
Other receivables do not contain assets which are considered to be impaired.

NOTES TO THE GROUP ACCOUNTS 
CONTINUED  
14. OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES 
 
Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities 
The global nature of the Group’s business means it is exposed to volatility in currency exchange rates. In order to protect itself against 
currency fluctuations, the Group’s policy is to hedge all material firm transactional exposures. The Group also uses interest rate 
derivative instruments to manage the Group’s exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its borrowings and deposits by varying the 
proportion of fixed rate debt relative to floating rate debt over the forward time horizon. The Group aims to achieve hedge accounting 
treatment for all derivatives that hedge material foreign currency exposures and those interest rate exposures where hedge accounting 
can be achieved. 
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.  
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, such instruments are stated 
at fair value at the balance sheet date. Gains and losses on derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting 
are recognised in the income statement for the period. 
Cash flow hedges 
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of cash flows relating to a highly probable forecast transacti on 
(income or expense), the effective portion of any change in the fair value of the instrument is recognised in other comprehensive 
income and presented in the hedging reserve in equity. Amounts recognised in equity are reclassified from reserves into the cost 
of the underlying transaction and recognised in the income statement when the underlying transaction affects profit or loss. The 
ineffective portion of any change in the fair value of the instrument is recognised in the income statement immediately.  
Fair value hedges 
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a fair value hedge, changes in the fair value of the underlying asset or liability 
attributable to the hedged risk, and gains and losses on the derivative instrument, are recognised in the income statement for the period.

The debt-related derivative financial liabilities are presented as a component of loans and overdrafts (see note 19). 
Cash flow hedges 
The hedged, highly probable forecast transactions denominated in foreign currency are predominantly expected to occur at various 
stages during the next 12 months. The majority of those extending beyond 12 months are expected to have been transacted within five 
years of the balance sheet date. 
Amounts charged to the hedging reserve in respect of cash flow hedges were £92m (2013 credited £53m), including a £1m credit on 
reclassification to profit and loss on maturity and a £93m charge on contracts held at 31 December 2014.  
Fair value hedges 
The loss arising in the income statement on fair value hedging instruments was £2m (2013 £7m). The loss arising in the income 
statement on the fair value of the underlying hedged items was £1m (2013 gain £7m). The ineffective portion recognised in the income 
statement arising from fair value hedges was £3m (2013 £nil).  
  
 
15. DEFERRED TAX 
 
A deferred tax asset is recognised for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is 
probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each 
reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they 
relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different taxable entities, but they intend to 
settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously.

Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of cash flows relating to a highly probable forecast transacti on 
(income or expense), the effective portion of any change in the fair value of the instrument is recognised in other comprehensive 
income and presented in the hedging reserve in equity. Amounts recognised in equity are reclassified from reserves into the cost 
of the underlying transaction and recognised in the income statement when the underlying transaction affects profit or loss. The 
ineffective portion of any change in the fair value of the instrument is recognised in the income statement immediately.  
Fair value hedges 
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a fair value hedge, changes in the fair value of the underlying asset or liability 
attributable to the hedged risk, and gains and losses on the derivative instrument, are recognised in the income statement for the period.

The debt-related derivative financial liabilities are presented as a component of loans and overdrafts (see note 19). 
Cash flow hedges 
The hedged, highly probable forecast transactions denominated in foreign currency are predominantly expected to occur at various 
stages during the next 12 months. The majority of those extending beyond 12 months are expected to have been transacted within five 
years of the balance sheet date. 
Amounts charged to the hedging reserve in respect of cash flow hedges were £92m (2013 credited £53m), including a £1m credit on 
reclassification to profit and loss on maturity and a £93m charge on contracts held at 31 December 2014.  
Fair value hedges 
The loss arising in the income statement on fair value hedging instruments was £2m (2013 £7m). The loss arising in the income 
statement on the fair value of the underlying hedged items was £1m (2013 gain £7m). The ineffective portion recognised in the income 
statement arising from fair value hedges was £3m (2013 £nil).  
  
 
15. DEFERRED TAX 
 
A deferred tax asset is recognised for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is 
probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each 
reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they 
relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different taxable entities, but they intend to 
settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously.

Deductible temporary differences, including tax credits 2 1
Capital losses carried forward 38 36
Trading and other losses carried forward 62 62

These assets have not been recognised as the incidence of future profits in the relevant countries and legal entities cannot be 
accurately predicted at this time.  
Future changes in tax rates 
Under the Finance Act 2013, the UK current tax rate reduced from 23% to 21% with effect from 1 April 2014, and will then reduce to 
20% with effect from 1 April 2015. This will reduce future current tax charges accordingly.  
The reduction from 23% to 20% was substantively enacted before 31 December 2013. In line with this change, the rate applying to UK 
deferred tax assets and liabilities was reduced from 23% to 20%, creating a rate adjustment in 2013, which was partly reflected in the 
Consolidated Income Statement and partly in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. Accordingly, both recognised and 
unrecognised UK deferred tax balances as at 31 December 2013 were calculated at 20% and this rate continues to apply as at 
31 December 2014.

US$500m of the US$1bn 6.375% bond, repayable 2019, has been converted to a floating rate bond utilising a series of interest rate 
swaps that mature in June 2019 and give an effective rate during 2014 of 4.8%.  
The US$500m 7.5% bond, repayable 2027, was converted at issue to a sterling fixed rate bond by utilising cross-currency swaps and 
has an effective interest rate of 7.7%. 
On 7 October, BAE Systems issued US$800m of 3.8% fixed rate debt maturing in October 2024 and US$300m of 4.75% fixed rate debt 
maturing in October 2044. Subsequently, the Group entered into interest rate derivatives to swap US$500m of the ten-year fixed rate debt 
into a floating rate to October 2019. The swaps are at an average rate of LIBOR +1.9% for each three-month period and the initial fixing was 
at 2.1% inclusive of LIBOR, giving an effective rate during 2014 of 2.8%. US$500m of the US$800m bond is measured at fair value.  
The debt-related derivative financial instruments represent the fair value of interest rate and cross-currency derivatives relating to the 
US$500m 7.5% bond, repayable 2027, and the US$800m 3.8% bond, repayable 2024. These derivatives have been entered into 
specifically to manage the Group’s exposure to foreign exchange or interest rate risk. Debt-related derivative financial liabilities are 
presented within loans and overdrafts above and debt-related derivative financial assets are presented within other financial assets

21. RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS 
 
Defined contribution pension schemes 
Obligations for contributions are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.  
Defined benefit pension schemes 
The cost of providing benefits is determined periodically by independent actuaries and charged to the income statement in the period 
in which those benefits are earned by the employees. Remeasurements, including actuarial gains and losses, are recognised in the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income in the period in which they occur. Past service costs resulting from a plan 
amendment or curtailment are recognised immediately in the income statement.  
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the Group’s balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit 
obligations calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions as set out on page 136 reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.  
Certain of the Group’s equity accounted investments participate in the Group’s defined benefit schemes as well as Airbus SAS, the 
Group’s share of which was disposed of in 2006. As these schemes are multi-employer schemes, the Group has allocated a share 
of the IAS 19, Employee Benefits, pension deficit to its equity accounted investments and other participating employers using a 
consistent allocation method intended to reflect a reasonable approximation of their share of the deficit. The deficit allocation method 
for all schemes is based on the BAE Systems Pension Scheme’s (Main Scheme) schedule of contributions agreed with the sponsoring 
employers and trustees as part of the triennial funding valuations performed in 2014. Following the completion of the triennial funding 
valuations, there will be discussions between the participating employers on the allocation of the deficit and the outcome of those 
discussions will be reflected in the allocation of the IAS 19 deficit. The Group’s share of the IAS 19 pension deficit allocated to the 
equity accounted investments is included in the balance sheet within equity accounted investments. In the event that an employer 
who participates in the Group’s pension schemes fails or cannot be compelled to fulfil its obligations as a participating employer, the 
remaining participating employers are obliged to collectively take on its obligations. The Group considers the likelihood of this event 
arising as remote. 
Pension schemes 
Background 
BAE Systems plc operates pension schemes for the Group’s qualifying employees in the UK, US and other countries. The principal 
schemes in the UK and US are funded defined benefit schemes, and the assets are held in separate trustee administered funds. 
The two largest funded defined benefit schemes are the Main Scheme and the BAE Systems 2000 Pension Plan (2000 Plan) which, 
in aggregate, represent 71% (2013 72%) of the total IAS 19 defined benefit obligation at 31 December 2014. The schemes in other 
countries are primarily defined contribution schemes.  
At 31 December 2014, the weighted average durations of the UK and US defined benefit pension obligations were 19 years (2013 
18 years) and 12 years (2013 12 years), respectively. 
The split of the defined benefit pension liability on a funding basis between active, deferred and pensioner members for the Main 
Scheme, 2000 Plan and US schemes in aggregate is set out below:

Regulatory framework 
The funded UK schemes are registered and subject to the statutory scheme specific-funding requirements outlined in UK legislation, 
including the payment of levies to the Pension Protection Fund as set out in the Pension Act 2004. These schemes were established 
under trust and the responsibility for their governance lies jointly with the trustees and the Group. 
The funded US schemes are tax-qualified pension schemes regulated by the Pension Protection Act 2006 and insured by the Pension 
Benefit Guarantee Corporation (PBGC) up to certain limits. These schemes were established under and are governed by the US Employee 
Retirement Income Security Act 1974 and the BAE Systems Administrative Committee is a named fiduciary with the authority to man age 
their operation.  
Benefits 
The UK defined benefit schemes provide benefits to members in the form of a set level of pension payable for life based on members’ 
final salaries. The benefits attract inflation-related increases both in deferment and payment. All UK defined benefit schemes are closed 
to new entrants, with benefits for new employees being provided through a defined contribution scheme. The Normal Retirement Age for 
active members of the Main Scheme and 2000 Plan is 65. Specific benefits applicable to members differ between schemes. Further 
details on the benefits provided by each scheme are provided on the BAE Systems Pensions website: www.baesystemspensions.com. 
The US defined benefit schemes ceased to be final salary schemes in January 2013. The benefits accrued based on the final salaries 
of members at that point will become payable on retirement. The Normal Retirement Age for the largest scheme in the US is 65.  
  
 
21. RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS continued 
Funding  
The majority of the UK and US defined benefit pension schemes are funded by the Group’s subsidiaries, equity accounted investments 
and other participating employers. The individual pension schemes’ funding requirements are based on actuarial measurement 
frameworks set out in their funding policies.  
For funding valuation purposes, pension scheme assets are included at market value, whilst the liabilities are determined based on 
prudent assumptions set by the trustees following consultation with scheme actuaries. 
The separate actuarial valuations for funding purposes include assumptions which differ from the actuarial assumptions used for IAS 19 
accounting purposes shown on page 136. The latest valuations of the Main Scheme and 2000 Plan were performed as at 31 March 
2014 and showed a funding deficit of £2.6bn. The total net funding deficit in respect of all of the UK schemes was £2.7bn. Deficit 
recovery plans agreed with the trustees of the relevant schemes run until 2026. 
The results of future triennial valuations and associated funding requirements will be impacted by the future performance of investment 
markets, and interest and inflation rates. 
The total Group contributions made to the defined benefit schemes in the year ended 31 December 2014 were £548m (2013 £560m) 
excluding those amounts allocated to equity accounted investments and participating employers of £92m (2013 £86m). This includes 
additional contributions of £108m into the UK schemes relating to the share buyback programme (2013 £44m).  
In 2015, the Group expects to make contributions at a similar level to the recurring contributions and deficit funding as made in 2014.  
The Group incurred a charge in respect of cash contributions of £125m (2013 £130m) paid to defined contribution schemes for employees. 
Risk management 
The defined benefit pension schemes expose the Group to actuarial risks, including market (investment) risk, interest rate risk, inflation 
risk and longevity risk.  
Risk  Mitigation 
Market (investment) risk 
Asset returns may not move in line with the 
liabilities and may be subject to volatility. 
  
The investment portfolios are highly diversified, investing in a wide range of assets, in 
order to provide reasonable assurance that no single security or type of security could 
have a materially adverse impact on the total portfolio. To reduce volatility, certain assets 
are held in a matching portfolio, which largely consists of index-linked bonds, gilts and 
swaps, designed to mirror movements in corresponding liabilities. 
Some 46% (2013 50%) of the Group’s pension scheme assets are held in equities and 
pooled investment vehicles due to the higher expected level of return over the long term. 
Some of the Group’s pension schemes use derivative financial instruments as part of 
their investment strategy to manage the level of market risk. In August 2013, the Main 
Scheme implemented a long-dated equity option strategy protecting £1.4bn of assets 
against a significant fall in equity markets. 
Interest rate risk 
Liabilities are sensitive to movements in 
interest rates, with lower interest rates leading 
to an increase in the valuation of liabilities. 
  
In addition to investing in bonds as part of the matching portfolio, the principal UK 
schemes invest in interest rate swaps to reduce the exposure to movements in interest 
rates. The swaps are held with several banks to reduce counterparty risk. 
Inflation risk  
Liabilities are sensitive to movements in 
inflation, with higher inflation leading to 
an increase in the valuation of liabilities. 
  
In addition to investing in index-linked bonds as part of the matching portfolio, the principal 
UK schemes invest in long-term inflation swaps to reduce the exposure to movements in 
inflation. The swaps are held with several banks to reduce counterparty risk. 
Effective 1 May 2014, the Main Scheme implemented a pension increase exchange to 
allow retired members to elect for a higher current pension in exchange for foregoing certain 
rights to future pension increases.  
Longevity risk 
Liabilities are sensitive to life expectancy, 
with increases in life expectancies leading to 
an increase in the valuation of liabilities.  
  
Longevity Adjustment Factors are used in the majority of the UK pension schemes in 
order to adjust the pension benefits payable so as to share the cost of people living 
longer with employees.  
In February 2013, with the agreement of the Company, the trustees of the 2000 Plan 
entered into an arrangement with Legal & General to insure against longevity risk for the 
current pensioner population, covering £2.7bn of pension scheme liabilities. In December 
2013, similar arrangements were entered into, with Legal & General, by the trustees of 
the Royal Ordnance Pension Scheme and Shipbuilding Industries Pension Scheme, 
covering £0.9bn and £0.8bn of pension scheme liabilities, respectively. These 
arrangements will reduce the funding volatility relating to increasing life expectancy.

Life expectancy of a female currently aged 45 (years) 91 – 92 91 – 92 91 – 92 89 86 86
Discount rate 
Discount rate assumptions are based on third-party AA corporate bond indices and yields that reflect the maturity profile of the expected 
benefit payments.  
Inflation 
In the UK, the inflation assumptions are derived by reference to the difference between the yields on index-linked and fixed-interest  
long-term government bonds, or advice from the local actuary depending on the available information. In the US, inflation assumptions 
are not significant as the Group’s US pension schemes are not indexed with inflation. 
Rate of increase in salaries 
The rate of increase in salaries for the UK schemes is assumed to be Retail Prices Index (RPI) inflation of 3.2% (2013 RPI inflation of 
3.4%), plus a promotional scale. From 1 January 2013, employees in the US schemes no longer accrue salary-related benefits. 
Rate of increase in pensions in payment 
The rate of increase in pensions in payment differs between UK schemes. Different tranches of the schemes increase at rates based on 
either RPI or Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation, and some are subject to an inflation cap. With the exception of two smaller schemes, 
the rate of increase in pensions in payment is based on RPI inflation. 
Rate of increase in deferred pensions 
The rate of increase in deferred pensions for the UK schemes is based on CPI inflation of 2.3% (2013 CPI inflation of 2.5%), with the 
exception of the 2000 Plan, which is based on RPI inflation of 3.2% (2013 RPI inflation of 3.4%). For all UK schemes, the rate of 
increase in deferred pensions is subject to inflation caps.  
Life expectancy 
For its UK pension schemes, the Group has used the Self-Administered Pension Schemes S2 mortality tables based on year of birth (as 
published by the Institute of Actuaries) for both pensioner and non-pensioner members in conjunction with the results of an investigation 
into the actual mortality experience of scheme members. In addition, to allow for future improvements in longevity, the Continuous 
Mortality Investigation 2013 tables (published by the Institute of Actuaries) have been used, with an assumed long-term rate of future 
annual mortality improvements of 1.25% (2013 1%), for both pensioner and non-pensioner members.  
In October 2014, the Society of Actuaries in the US released updated mortality assumptions reflecting the results of its comprehensive 
mortality study. For the majority of the US schemes, the mortality tables used at 31 December 2014 are a blend of the fully generational 
RP-2014 Aggregate table and the RP-2014 White Collar table, both projected using Scale MP-2014. The mortality table changes have 
resulted in a £0.3bn increase in the US defined benefit obligations. IRS approval of the mortality tables is expected in 2017, following 
which the tables are expected to be adopted for funding valuation purposes.  
Retirement benefits other than pensions 
Background 
The Group operates a number of non-pension retirement benefit schemes, under which certain employees are eligible to receive 
benefits after retirement, the majority of which relate to the provision of medical benefits to retired employees of the Group’s 
subsidiaries in the US. The latest valuations of the principal schemes, covering retiree medical and life insurance schemes in certain 
US subsidiaries, were performed by independent actuaries as at 1 January 2014. These valuations were rolled forward to reflect the 
information at 31 December 2014. The method of accounting for these is similar to that used for defined benefit pension schemes. 
Principal actuarial assumptions 
The assumption for long-term healthcare cost increases is 5.3% (2013 5.3%) based on the assumptions that the increases are 7.9% 
in 2015 reducing to 5% by 2023 and 5% each year thereafter for pre-retirement, and 7.5% in 2015 reducing to 5% by 2023 and 5% 
each year thereafter for post-retirement.   
 
21. RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS continued 
The disclosures below relate to post-retirement benefit schemes in the UK, US and other countries which are accounted for as defined 
benefit schemes in accordance with IAS 19. The valuations used for the IAS 19 disclosures are based on the most recent actuarial 
valuation undertaken by independent qualified actuaries as updated to take account of the requirements of IAS 19 to assess the deficits 
of the schemes at 31 December each year.

Principal actuarial assumptions  
The assumptions used are estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the long-term nature of the 
obligation covered, may not necessarily occur in practice.

Life expectancy of a female currently aged 65 (years) 89 – 90 89 – 90 89 – 90 89 86 86
Life expectancy of a male currently aged 45 (years) 89 – 91 88 – 90 88 – 90 87 84 84
Life expectancy of a female currently aged 45 (years) 91 – 92 91 – 92 91 – 92 89 86 86
Discount rate 
Discount rate assumptions are based on third-party AA corporate bond indices and yields that reflect the maturity profile of the expected 
benefit payments.  
Inflation 
In the UK, the inflation assumptions are derived by reference to the difference between the yields on index-linked and fixed-interest  
long-term government bonds, or advice from the local actuary depending on the available information. In the US, inflation assumptions 
are not significant as the Group’s US pension schemes are not indexed with inflation. 
Rate of increase in salaries 
The rate of increase in salaries for the UK schemes is assumed to be Retail Prices Index (RPI) inflation of 3.2% (2013 RPI inflation of 
3.4%), plus a promotional scale. From 1 January 2013, employees in the US schemes no longer accrue salary-related benefits. 
Rate of increase in pensions in payment 
The rate of increase in pensions in payment differs between UK schemes. Different tranches of the schemes increase at rates based on 
either RPI or Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation, and some are subject to an inflation cap. With the exception of two smaller schemes, 
the rate of increase in pensions in payment is based on RPI inflation. 
Rate of increase in deferred pensions 
The rate of increase in deferred pensions for the UK schemes is based on CPI inflation of 2.3% (2013 CPI inflation of 2.5%), with the 
exception of the 2000 Plan, which is based on RPI inflation of 3.2% (2013 RPI inflation of 3.4%). For all UK schemes, the rate of 
increase in deferred pensions is subject to inflation caps.  
Life expectancy 
For its UK pension schemes, the Group has used the Self-Administered Pension Schemes S2 mortality tables based on year of birth (as 
published by the Institute of Actuaries) for both pensioner and non-pensioner members in conjunction with the results of an investigation 
into the actual mortality experience of scheme members. In addition, to allow for future improvements in longevity, the Continuous 
Mortality Investigation 2013 tables (published by the Institute of Actuaries) have been used, with an assumed long-term rate of future 
annual mortality improvements of 1.25% (2013 1%), for both pensioner and non-pensioner members.  
In October 2014, the Society of Actuaries in the US released updated mortality assumptions reflecting the results of its comprehensive 
mortality study. For the majority of the US schemes, the mortality tables used at 31 December 2014 are a blend of the fully generational 
RP-2014 Aggregate table and the RP-2014 White Collar table, both projected using Scale MP-2014. The mortality table changes have 
resulted in a £0.3bn increase in the US defined benefit obligations. IRS approval of the mortality tables is expected in 2017, following 
which the tables are expected to be adopted for funding valuation purposes.  
Retirement benefits other than pensions 
Background 
The Group operates a number of non-pension retirement benefit schemes, under which certain employees are eligible to receive 
benefits after retirement, the majority of which relate to the provision of medical benefits to retired employees of the Group’s 
subsidiaries in the US. The latest valuations of the principal schemes, covering retiree medical and life insurance schemes in certain 
US subsidiaries, were performed by independent actuaries as at 1 January 2014. These valuations were rolled forward to reflect the 
information at 31 December 2014. The method of accounting for these is similar to that used for defined benefit pension schemes. 
Principal actuarial assumptions 
The assumption for long-term healthcare cost increases is 5.3% (2013 5.3%) based on the assumptions that the increases are 7.9% 
in 2015 reducing to 5% by 2023 and 5% each year thereafter for pre-retirement, and 7.5% in 2015 reducing to 5% by 2023 and 5% 
each year thereafter for post-retirement.   
 
21. RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS continued 
The disclosures below relate to post-retirement benefit schemes in the UK, US and other countries which are accounted for as defined 
benefit schemes in accordance with IAS 19. The valuations used for the IAS 19 disclosures are based on the most recent actuarial 
valuation undertaken by independent qualified actuaries as updated to take account of the requirements of IAS 19 to assess the deficits 
of the schemes at 31 December each year.

The bid values of scheme assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant change 
before they are realised, and the present values of scheme liabilities, which are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and 
therefore inherently uncertain, as at 31 December are shown in the following tables.

Sensitivity analysis 
The sensitivity information has been derived using scenario analysis from the actuarial assumptions as at 31 December 2014 and 
keeping all other assumptions as set out on page 136.  
Financial assumptions 
Changes in the following financial assumptions would have the following effect on the defined benefit pension obligation: 
 
(Increase)/decrease
£bn
Discount rate: 
0.1 percentage point increase 0.5
0.1 percentage point decrease (0.5)
Inflation:  
0.1 percentage point increase (0.5)
0.1 percentage point decrease 0.5
The sensitivity of the valuation of the liabilities to changes in the inflation assumption presented above assumes that a 0.1 percentage 
point change to expectations of future inflation results in a 0.1 percentage point change to all inflation-related assumptions used to 
value the liabilities. However, upper and lower limits exist on the majority of inflation-related benefits such that a change in expectations 
of future inflation may not have the same impact on the inflation-related benefits, and hence will result in a smaller change to the 
valuation of the liabilities. Accordingly, extrapolation of the above results beyond the specific sensitivity figures shown may not be 
appropriate. To illustrate this, the (increase)/decrease in the defined benefit pension obligation resulting from larger changes in the 
inflation assumption would be as follows: 
(Increase)/decrease
£bn
Inflation: 
0.5 percentage point increase (1.8)
0.5 percentage point decrease 1.7
1.0 percentage point increase (3.6)
1.0 percentage point decrease 3.3
Demographic assumptions 
Changes in the life expectancy assumption, including the benefit of longevity swap arrangements (see longevity risk on page 135), 
would have the following effect on the total IAS 19 deficit:  
 
(Increase)/decrease
£bn
Life expectancy:  
One-year increase (0.9)
One-year decrease 0.9

NOTES TO THE GROUP ACCOUNTS 
CONTINUED  
22. PROVISIONS 
 
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past 
event, it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and the amount has been reliably 
estimated. If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at an appropriate pre-tax 
discount rate. 
Warranties and after-sales service 
Warranties and after-sales service are provided in the normal course of business with provisions for associated costs being made 
based on an assessment of future claims with reference to past experience. A provision for warranties is recognised when the 
underlying products and services are sold. The provision is based on historical warranty data and a weighting of possible outcomes 
against their associated probabilities. 
Reorganisations 
A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring 
has either commenced or has been publicly announced. The costs associated with the reorganisation programmes are supported by 
detailed plans and based on previous experience as well as other known factors. Future operating costs are not provided for. 
Legal, contractual and environmental 
The Group holds provisions for expected legal, contractual and environmental costs that it expects to incur over an extended period. 
These costs are based on past experience of similar items and other known factors and represent management’s best estimate of 
the likely outcome.  
Other 
Other provisions include provisions for onerous contracts, which are recognised when the expected benefits to be derived by the Group 
from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract.

Warranties and after-sales service  
Warranty and after-sales service costs are generally incurred within three years post-delivery. Whilst actual events could result in 
potentially significant differences to the quantum, but not the timing, of the outflows in relation to the provisions, management has 
reflected current knowledge in assessing the provision levels.  
Reorganisations  
Reorganisation costs are generally incurred within one to three years. There is limited volatility around the timing and amount of the 
ultimate outflows related to these provisions.  
Legal, contractual and environmental  
Reflecting the inherent uncertainty within many legal proceedings, the timing and amount of the outflows could differ significantly from 
the amount provided. 
Other  
Includes a provision taken in 2013 in respect of the Radford Army Ammunition Plant contract. There are no other individually significant 
provisions included within other provisions.

Special Share 
One Special Share of £1 in the Company is held on behalf of the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills (the Special

one ordinary voting share. The Special Shareholder is entitled to receive notice of and to attend general meetings and class meetings of 
the Company’s shareholders, but has no voting right, nor other rights, other than to speak in relation to any business in respect of the 
Special Share. 
Share buyback

options under the Share Incentive Plan, Performance Share Plan, Restricted Share Plan and Executive Share Option Plan.  
Own shares held 
Own shares held, including treasury shares and shares held by BAE Systems Employee Share Option Plan (ESOP) Trust, are recognised 
as a deduction from retained earnings.  
BAE Systems ESOP Trust  
The Group has an ESOP discretionary trust to administer the share plans and to acquire Company shares, using funds loaned by the 
Group, to meet commitments to Group employees. A dividend waiver was in operation for shares within the ESOP Trust, other than those 
owned beneficially by the participants, for the dividends paid in June and December 2014.  
At 31 December 2014, the ESOP held 1,509,844 (2013 1,451,631) ordinary shares of 2.5p each, with a market value of £7m 
(2013 £6m). The shares held by the ESOP are recorded at cost and deducted from retained earnings until such time as the shares vest 
unconditionally to employees.  
Dividend waivers were in operation for the dividends paid in June and December 2014 over shares in the Group All-Employee Free 
Shares Plan Trust other than those shares owned beneficially by participants. A dividend waiver was also in operation for the dividends 
paid in June and December 2014 over shares within the Company’s Share Incentive Plan Trust other than those shares owned 
beneficially by the participants. 
Equity dividends 
Equity dividends on ordinary share capital are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are declared. The interim dividend is 
recognised when it has been approved by the Board and the final dividend is recognised when it has been approved by the 
shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.

Merger reserve 
The merger reserve arose on the acquisition of the Marconi Electronic Systems (MES) business by British Aerospace in 1999 to form 
BAE Systems, and represents the amount by which the fair value of the shares issued by British Aerospace as consideration exceeded 
their nominal value.  
Statutory reserve 
Under Section 4 of the British Aerospace Act 1980, this reserve may only be applied in paying up unissued shares of the Company to be 
allotted to members of the Company as fully paid bonus shares. 
Revaluation reserve 
The revaluation reserve relates to the revaluation at fair value of the net assets of the BVT joint venture previously held as an equity 
accounted investment on the acquisition of the remaining 45% interest in 2009. 
Translation reserve 
The translation reserve comprises all foreign currency differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign 
operations. 
Hedging reserve 
The hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash flow hedging instruments 
related to hedged transactions that have not yet occurred.  
Capital redemption reserve 
The capital redemption reserve represents the cumulative nominal value of the Company’s ordinary shares repurchased and 
subsequently cancelled. During the year ended 31 December 2014, 67,417,000 (2013 51,595,000) ordinary shares with a nominal 
value of £2m (2013 £1m) were repurchased and have been subsequently cancelled.  
Capital 
The Group funds its operations through a mixture of equity funding and debt financing, including bank and capital market borrowings. 
At 31 December 2014, the Group’s capital was £1,919m (2013 £3,387m), which comprises total equity of £1,877m (2013 £3,418m), 
excluding amounts accumulated in equity relating to cash flow hedges of £42m (2013 £31m credit). Net debt (as defined by the Group) 
was £1,032m (2013 £699m). 
The capital structure of the Group reflects the judgement of the directors of an appropriate balance of funding required. The Group’s 
policy is to maintain an investment grade credit rating and ensure operating flexibility, whilst:  
– meeting its pension obligations; 
– continuing to pursue organic investment opportunities;  
– paying dividends in line with the Group’s policy of long-term sustainable cover of around two times underlying earnings (see note 8); 
– making accelerated returns of capital to shareholders when the balance sheet allows; and  
– investing in value-enhancing acquisitions, where market conditions are right and where they deliver on the Group’s strategy.

26. ACQUISITIONS  
 
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is 
transferred to the Group. The Group measures goodwill as the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred, including the 
amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree, less the net of the acquisition-date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired 
and liabilities assumed, including contingent liabilities as required by IFRS 3.  
Consideration transferred includes the fair values of assets transferred, liabilities incurred by the Group to the previous own ers 
of the acquiree, equity interests issued by the Group, contingent consideration, and share-based payment awards of the acquiree 
that are replaced in the business combination. Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition 
date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent consideration that is not classified as equity are recognised in the 
income statement.  
Transaction costs that the Group incurs in connection with a business combination, such as finder’s fees, legal fees, due diligence 
fees, and other professional and consulting fees, are expensed as incurred.  
In 2014, BAE Systems acquired: Perimeter Internetworking Corp., trading as SilverSky; an additional 59% shareholding in Saudi 
Development and Training Company (SDT); and Signal Innovations Group, Inc. (SIG).  
If the acquisitions had occurred on 1 January 2014, combined sales of Group and share of equity accounted investments would have 
been £16.7bn, revenue £15.5bn and profit £752m for the year ended 31 December 2014. 
For all acquisitions made in the year, fair values remain provisional, but will be finalised within 12 months of acquisition.

27. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT 
Fair value of financial instruments 
Certain of the Group’s financial instruments are held at fair value. 
The fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly 
transaction between market participants at the balance sheet date. 
The fair values of financial instruments held at fair value have been determined based on available market information at the balance 
sheet date, and the valuation methodologies listed below: 
– the fair values of forward foreign exchange contracts are calculated by discounting the contracted forward values and translating at the 
appropriate balance sheet rates;  
– the fair values of both interest rate and cross-currency swaps are calculated by discounting expected future principal and interest cash 
flows and translating at the appropriate balance sheet rates; and  
– the fair values of loans and overdrafts have been estimated by discounting the future cash flows to net present values using appropriate 
market-based interest rates prevailing at 31 December.  
Due to the variability of the valuation factors, the fair values presented at 31 December may not be indicative of the amounts the Group 
would expect to realise in the current market environment. 
Fair value hierarchy 
The fair value measurement hierarchy is as follows: 
– Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;  
– Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as 
prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and 
– Level 3 – Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

27. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT 
Fair value of financial instruments 
Certain of the Group’s financial instruments are held at fair value. 
The fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly 
transaction between market participants at the balance sheet date. 
The fair values of financial instruments held at fair value have been determined based on available market information at the balance 
sheet date, and the valuation methodologies listed below: 
– the fair values of forward foreign exchange contracts are calculated by discounting the contracted forward values and translating at the 
appropriate balance sheet rates;  
– the fair values of both interest rate and cross-currency swaps are calculated by discounting expected future principal and interest cash 
flows and translating at the appropriate balance sheet rates; and  
– the fair values of loans and overdrafts have been estimated by discounting the future cash flows to net present values using appropriate 
market-based interest rates prevailing at 31 December.  
Due to the variability of the valuation factors, the fair values presented at 31 December may not be indicative of the amounts the Group 
would expect to realise in the current market environment. 
Fair value hierarchy 
The fair value measurement hierarchy is as follows: 
– Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;  
– Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as 
prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and 
– Level 3 – Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

28. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT  
Interest rate risk 
The Group’s objective is to manage its exposure to interest rate fluctuations on borrowings through varying the proportion of fixed rate 
debt relative to floating rate debt with derivative instruments, including interest rate and cross-currency swaps.  
The Group’s interest rate management policy is that a minimum of 50% (2013 50%) and a maximum of 90% (2013 90%) of gross debt 
is maintained at fixed interest rates. At 31 December 2014, the Group had 81% (2013 69%) of fixed rate debt and 19% (2013 31%) of 
floating rate debt based on a gross debt of £3.3bn, including debt-related derivative financial assets (2013 £2.9bn). 
Based on contracted maturities and/or repricing dates, the following amounts are exposed to interest rate risk over the future as shown below:

£m
More than 
two 
years
£m
Cash and cash equivalents 2,308 – –
Loans and overdrafts (644) (643) (643)
The floating rate debt has been predominantly achieved by entering into interest rate swaps which swap the fixed rate US dollar interest 
payable on debt into either floating rate sterling or US dollars. At the end of 2014, the Group had a total of $1.0bn (2013 $1.5bn) of 
this type of swap outstanding with a weighted average duration of 4.6 years (2013 2.3 years). In respect of the fixed rate debt, the 
weighted average period in respect of which interest is fixed was 10.1 years (2013 9.6 years). 
Given the level of short-term interest rates during the year, the average cost of the floating rate debt was 4.1% (2013 3.3%) on US dollars. 
The cost of the fixed rate debt was 5.4% (2013 5.7%).  
A change of 100 basis points in short-term rates applied to the average fixed/floating mix and level of borrowings would vary the interest 
cost to the Group by £6m (2013 £6m).  
In respect of cash deposits, given the fluctuation in the Group’s working capital requirements, cash is generally invested for short-term 
periods based at floating interest rates. A change of 100 basis points in the average interest rates during the year applied to the 
average cash deposits would vary the interest receivable by £9m (2013 £13m).

28. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT continued 
Borrowing facilities 
The Group’s objective is to maintain adequate undrawn committed borrowing facilities.  
At 31 December 2014, the Group had a committed Revolving Credit Facility (RCF) of £2bn (2013 £2bn). The RCF is contracted 
until 2018 at £2bn and from 2018 to 2019 at £1.8bn. The RCF was undrawn throughout the year.  
Cash management 
Cash flow forecasting is performed by the businesses on a monthly basis. The Group monitors a rolling forecast of its liquidity 
requirements to ensure that there is sufficient cash to meet operational needs and maintain adequate headroom.  
Surplus cash held by the businesses over and above balances required for working capital management is loaned to the Group’s 
centralised treasury department. Surplus cash is invested in interest bearing current accounts, term deposits, money market deposits 
and marketable securities, choosing instruments with appropriate maturities or sufficient liquidity to provide sufficient headroom as 
determined by cash forecasts.  
The Group’s objective is to monitor and control counterparty credit risk and credit limit utilisation. The Group adopts a conservative 
approach to the investment of its surplus cash. It is deposited with financial institutions with the strongest credit ratings for short 
periods. The cash and cash equivalents balance at 31 December 2014 of £2,308m (2013 £2,222m) was invested with 30 (2013 27) 
financial institutions. A credit limit is allocated to each institution taking account of its market capitalisation, credit rating and credit 
default swap price. The Group has no exposure to Greek, Irish, Italian, Portuguese or Spanish banks. Additionally, the Group monitors 
its exposure to banks which have exposure to these countries.  
The cash and cash equivalents of the Group are invested in non-speculative financial instruments which are usually highly liquid, such 
as short-term deposits. The Group, therefore, believes it has reduced its exposure to counterparty credit risk through this process.  
Currency risk 
The Group’s objective is to reduce its exposure to transactional volatility in earnings and cash flows from movements in foreign currency 
exchange rates, mainly the US dollar, Euro and Saudi Riyal. 
The Group is exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates in respect of foreign currency denominated transactions. All 
material firm transactional exposures are hedged and the Group aims, where possible, to apply hedge accounting to these transactions. 
The Group is exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates in respect of the translation of net assets and income statements of 
foreign subsidiaries and equity accounted investments. The Group does not hedge the translation effect of exchange rate movements on the 
income statements or balance sheets of foreign subsidiaries and equity accounted investments it regards as long-term investment s. 
Credit risk  
The Group has material receivables due from the UK, US and Saudi Arabian governments where credit risk is not considered an issue. 
For the remaining trade receivables, a provision for bad debts has been calculated taking into account individual assessments based on 
past credit history and prior knowledge of debtor insolvency or other credit risk, and no one counterparty constitutes more than 7% of the 
balance (2013 5%).

29. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS  
 
The Group has granted equity-settled share options and Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) arrangements, and cash-settled share 
appreciation rights to employees.  
Equity-settled share options and LTIP arrangements are measured at fair value at the date of grant using an option pricing model.  
The fair value is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of the number of shares that 
will actually vest. 
Cash-settled share options are measured at fair value at the balance sheet date. The Group recognises a liability at the balance sheet 
date based on these fair values, and taking into account the estimated number that will actually vest and the relative completion of the 
vesting period. Changes in the value of this liability are recognised in the income statement for the year. 
Details of the terms and conditions of each share-based payment plan are given in the Annual Remuneration Report on pages 69 to 82.

29. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS  
 
The Group has granted equity-settled share options and Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) arrangements, and cash-settled share 
appreciation rights to employees.  
Equity-settled share options and LTIP arrangements are measured at fair value at the date of grant using an option pricing model.  
The fair value is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of the number of shares that 
will actually vest. 
Cash-settled share options are measured at fair value at the balance sheet date. The Group recognises a liability at the balance sheet 
date based on these fair values, and taking into account the estimated number that will actually vest and the relative completion of the 
vesting period. Changes in the value of this liability are recognised in the income statement for the year. 
Details of the terms and conditions of each share-based payment plan are given in the Annual Remuneration Report on pages 69 to 82.

Financial statements
NOTES TO THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS 
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
Basis of preparation 
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical 
cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of available-for-sale 
financial assets, and financial assets and financial liabilities 
(including derivative instruments) at fair value through profit or 
loss, and in accordance with applicable accounting standards in 
the UK (UK GAAP). The going concern basis has been applied in 
these accounts. 
In accordance with Section 408(3) of the Companies Act 2006, 
the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own 
profit and loss account. The amount of profit for the financial year 
of the Company is disclosed in note 11 to these accounts. The 
Company has no other recognised gains or losses in the current 
or preceding year and, therefore, no statement of total recognised 
gains or losses is presented.  
Cash flow statement 
The Company is exempt under the terms of FRS 1, Cash Flow 
Statements, from the requirement to publish its own cash flow 
statement, as its cash flows are included within the Consolidated 
Cash Flow Statement of the Group. 
Foreign currencies 
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange 
rates ruling at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at 
the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. These 
exchange differences are recognised in the profit and loss account 
unless they qualify for hedge accounting treatment, in which case 
the effective portion is recognised directly in a separate 
component of equity. 
Intangible assets 
Software development costs that are directly associated with the 
production of identifiable and unique software products controlled 
by the Company, and that will probably generate economic 
benefits exceeding costs beyond one year, are recognised as 
intangible assets.  
Tangible fixed assets 
Depreciation is provided, normally on a straight-line basis, to 
write off the cost or valuation of tangible fixed assets over their 
estimated useful economic lives to any estimated residual value 
using the following rates: 
Buildings up to 50 years, or the lease term 
if shorter 
Computing equipment  5 years 
No depreciation is provided on freehold land and assets in the 
course of construction. 
Impairment reviews are undertaken if there are indications that 
the carrying values may not be recoverable. 
Leases 
Rental payments under operating leases are charged to the 
profit and loss account on a straight-line basis in arriving at 
operating profit. 
Investments 
The Company’s investment in shares in Group companies is 
stated at cost less provision for impairment. 
Financial instruments 
The policies disclosed in note 14 to the Group accounts for 
recognition, measurement and presentation of financial 
instruments are applied in the Company accounts. 
Tax 
The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year  
and takes account of taxation deferred because of timing 
differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation 
and accounting purposes. Deferred tax is recognised on an 
undiscounted basis in respect of all timing differences between 
the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting 
purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance  
sheet date where there is an obligation to pay more tax, or a  
right to pay less tax, in the future. 
Pensions and other post-retirement benefits 
The Company contributes to Group pension schemes operated 
in the UK. Details of the principal schemes and the financial 
assumptions used are contained in note 21 to the Group 
accounts. As permitted by FRS 17, Retirement Benefits, the 
schemes are accounted for as defined contribution schemes, as 
the employer cannot identify its share of the underlying assets 
and liabilities of the schemes. The employer’s contributions are 
set in relation to the current service period and also to fund a 
series of agreed measures to address the pension scheme 
funding deficits. 
Share-based payment compensation 
The Company has granted equity-settled share options and  
Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) arrangements to Group employees. 
Equity-settled share options and LTIP arrangements are measured 
at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value of awards granted 
to employees of the Company is expensed on a straight-line basis 
over the vesting period, based on the Company’s estimate of the 
number of shares that will actually vest. The cost of awards to 
employees of subsidiary undertakings is accounted for as an 
additional investment in the employing subsidiary.  
In accordance with Urgent Issues Task Force (UITF) Abstract 25, 
National Insurance Contributions on Share Option Gains, the 
Company provides in full for the employer’s national insurance 
liability estimated to arise on the future exercise of share options 
and LTIP arrangements granted, except where the employee has 
agreed to settle the employer’s national insurance liability as a 
condition of grant. 
Own shares held 
As required under UITF Abstract 38, Accounting for ESOP Trusts, 
the cost to the Company of own shares held is shown as a 
deduction from shareholders’ funds within the profit and loss 
account. Consideration paid or received for the purchase or sale of 
the Company’s own shares in the ESOP Trust is shown separately 
in the reconciliation of movements in shareholders’ funds. 
Dividends 
Dividends received and receivable are credited to the Company’s 
profit and loss account. 
Equity dividends on ordinary share capital are recognised as  
a liability in the period in which they are declared. The interim 
dividend is recognised when it has been approved by the Board 
and the final dividend is recognised when it has been approved 
by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting. 
Changes in accounting policies in 2015 
A new financial reporting framework in the UK was effective on 
1 January 2015. As a result, BAE Systems plc has adopted 
FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework for the year ending 
31 December 2015.

Changes in accounting policies in 2015 
A new financial reporting framework in the UK was effective on 
1 January 2015. As a result, BAE Systems plc has adopted 
FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework for the year ending 
31 December 2015. It is likely that this new framework will 
have a material impact because the Company will be allocated 
a share of the deficit in the BAE Systems Group UK pension 
schemes in which it participates.

a 15% voting interest in the Company, the requirement that the majority of the directors are British, and the requirement that the Chief 
Executive and any executive Chairman are British citizens. The effect of these requirements can also be amended by regulations made 
by the directors and approved by the Special Shareholder. 
The Special Shareholder may require the Company at any time to redeem the Special Share at par or to convert the Special Share into 
one ordinary voting share. The Special Shareholder is entitled to receive notice of and to attend general meetings and class meetings of 
the Company’s shareholders but has no voting right, nor other rights, other than to speak in relation to any business in respect of the

BEWARE OF SHARE FRAUD 
Fraudsters use persuasive and high-pressure tactics to lure investors into scams.  
They may offer to sell shares that turn out to be worthless or non-existent, or to buy shares at an inflated price in return for an upfront payment. 
While high profits are promised, if you buy or sell shares in this way you will probably lose your money. 
5,000 people contact the Financial Conduct Authority about share fraud each year, with victims losing an average of £20,000. 
How to avoid share fraud   
1. Keep in mind that firms authorised by the FCA are unlikely to 
contact you out of the blue with an offer to buy or sell shares. 
2. Do not get into a conversation, note the name of the person 
and firm contacting you and then end the call.  
3. Check the Financial Services Register from www.fca.org.uk to see 
if the person and firm contacting you is authorised by the FCA.  
4. Beware of fraudsters claiming to be from an authorised firm, 
copying its website or giving you false contact details.  
5. Use the firm’s contact details listed on the Register if you want 
to call it back.  
6.  Call the FCA on 0800 111 6768 if the firm does not have contact 
details on the Register or you are told they are out of date.  
7.  Search the list of unauthorised firms to avoid at 
www.fca.org.uk/scams  
8.  Consider that if you buy or sell shares from an unauthorised 
firm you will not have access to the Financial Ombudsman 
Service or Financial Services Compensation Scheme.  
9.  Think about getting independent financial and professional 
advice before you hand over any money.  
10. Remember: if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is! 
Report a scam  
If you are approached by fraudsters please tell the FCA using the share fraud reporting form at www.fca.org.uk/scams, where you can 
find out more about investment scams.  
You can also call the FCA Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768.  
If you have already paid money to share fraudsters you should contact Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040.

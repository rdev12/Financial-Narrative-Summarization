Chairman’s statement 
Carpetright plc Annual report and accounts 2013 
“The backbone of the business and 
the key to Carpetright’s future success 
will be the quality of our service, 
backed by the very best product 
ranges at competitive prices.” 
 
In my statement last year I noted that, while we expected economic 
conditions to remain difficult for some time, we were encouraged 
that we were beginning to see a positive impact from the self-help 
actions we were taking.   These two trends did indeed come to 
characterise the year as a whole, with solid like-for-like sales growth 
achieved in the UK being driven by self-help actions, in an overall 
floor coverings market which we believe declined year on year.  In 
Europe, political and economic uncertainty continues to depress 
consumer demand and this has impacted the Group particularly 
hard in the Netherlands.  Against this background it is therefore 
encouraging to be able to report an improvement in underlying 
Group profit and a further reduction in net debt. 
Total revenue for the 52 weeks en ded 27 April 2013 decreased by 
2.9% to £457.6m (2012: £471.5m).  Underlying profit before tax 
increased by 142.5% to £9.7m (2012: £4.0m).  After the impact of 
exceptional items the loss before tax was £5.1m (2012: profit of 
£13.5m) (further information on these items is contained in the 
Financial Review).  Underlying earnings per share increased to 9.6p 
(2012: 4.5p) and basic loss per share was 9.8p (2012: earnings of 
16.4p).  During the period we have continued our focus on reducing 
the Group’s net debt.  It is therefore pleasing to announce that as at 
27 April 2013 this has nearly halved to £10.2m (2012: £19.1m), 
demonstrating the ability of the Group to continue to generate cash 
even in these difficult times. 
In my statement last year, I said we would look to restore payment  
of a dividend when debt has been reduced, a sustained recovery is 
evident and the financial results of the Group reflected this.  Good 
progress has been made on the debt and we believe our self-help 
activities have momentum, although it is important to continue to 
invest in these to improve the level of profitability.  That said, the 
economic environment continues to be uncertain and the Board  
feel it is important to see a continued recovery before restoring the 
dividend.  The Board believes the difficult decision not to pay a 
dividend is in the best interests of the business and the Board will 
continue to review the dividend policy on a biannual basis. 
In May 2012, Darren Shapland was appointed as Chief Executive 
and he has made a huge contribution in his first year in this role.  
Darren has established an Executive Committee to manage the 
business on a day-to-day basis and I am working closely with them 
to pass on the benefit of my knowledge and experience.  As 
anticipated, my active executive involvement will continue to 
decrease over time as part of a progressive transfer to Darren  
and the executive management team.   
I would like to welcome Andrew Page who will be joining the Board, 
as a Non-Executive Director, effective from 1 July 2013.  I am sure 
his experience and track record will enable him to make a valuable 
contribution to the Board. 
The backbone of the business and the key to Carpetright’s future 
success will be the quality of our service, backed by the very best 
product ranges at competitive prices.  Each is key to guaranteeing 
that our proposition continues to resonate with our customers.   
The management team is striving to ensure that every colleague is 
fully attuned to the need for continuous improvement in all of these 
areas.  I am sure that our colleagues in stores, distribution centres 
and support offices will rise to the challenge, as it is their efforts that 
really make the difference.  Once again, on behalf of the Board, I 
extend my thanks for their commitment this year. 
Looking forward, we expect fragile consumer confidence will 
continue to produce a weak floor coverings market.  We are 
concentrating on maintaining the momentum delivered by our  
self-help actions taken during the year, whilst recognising within  
our plans that economic conditions are likely to remain difficult  
for some time.

Chief Executive’s review

Business review Governance Financial statements 
“The success of our self-help activities 
in improving Group performance 
during the period was particularly 
encouraging, demonstrating that a 
focus on factors within our control 
can yield good results. 
While we expect trading conditions 
to remain challenging, we are 
confident this combination of self-
help initiatives will underpin the 
positive momentum of the Group.” 
 
As the Chairman notes in his statement, the Group grew underlying 
profits and generated cash during the year, with an encouraging 
increase in UK retail store like-for-like sales and a significant 
improvement in gross profit percentage year-on-year.  In the Rest  
of Europe, trading conditions in the Netherlands remained difficult 
whilst progress has been made in the recovery plan for the Republic 
of Ireland.  
The improvement in the Group’s performance this year has been 
driven, in large part, by the success of our programme of self-help 
measures, a number of which were accelerated on conclusion of the 
review completed immediately following my appointment as Chief 
Executive in May 2012.  The results from this package of initiatives 
have been very encouraging and further potential exists in the 
ongoing roll-out over the next two financial years.   
The programme is concentrated on six elements, each of which is 
discussed in more detail below: 
1. Modernising the estate 
2. Adjusting the store portfolio 
3. Enhancing our range of floor coverings and services  
4. Optimising digital as part of a multi-channel offering 
5. Developing our bed proposition 
6. Delivering a step change in service 
  
1. Modernising the estate 
We are part way through a three year programme of refurbishing 
the UK store estate, introducing an updated store design, with a  
new, more contemporary feel, in which it is easier for customers  
to shop.  This has involved improving natural light, updating 
signage, developing new layouts, replacing floor coverings and 
upgrading in-store lighting.   
We have focused on the 357 larger out-of-town stores of the estate,  
those circa 8,000 sq ft and above, of which 244 are circa 10,000 sq ft, 
including a bed department.  This ex cludes 22 of our stores trading 
under the Storey Carpets brand.   
The typical spend per store is around £55k, with post-refurbishment 
sales showing an increase of around 10% compared to the un-
invested estate, resulting in an average payback of about one year.  
As some of these stores have now passed their first anniversary, it 
has been encouraging to see they are continuing to show sales 
growth above that of the un-invested estate. 
Within this programme there were 57 smaller-scale refreshes of 
newer stores which did not need a full refurbishment but required 
some updating to align them to the latest look.  These typically cost 
around £20k per store.  
To date, we have completed 186 modernisations, representing over 
50% of this group of larger out-of-town stores, and the customer 
response has been very positive.  We aim to complete the 
refurbishment of the remaining larger out-of-town stores over the 
next two years. 
At the same time as modernising the larger out-of-town locations  
we have also been looking at our smaller format stores.  We have 47 
stores on high streets and a furthe r 16 concessions sites, which tend 
to be between 2,000-4,000 sq ft in size.  We have trialled  a ‘sample 
only’ format in two stores, with a special ‘smooth flooring’ area and 
extended ranges of roll stock samples, plus a dedicated area for 
premium branded carpets within our range.  While we are still 
refining the proposition, the results have been strong enough to 
support a plan to modernise the stores in this format. 
Our last group of stores are the mid-size locations of around  
4,000-8,000 sq ft, of which we have 36.  Again we have trialled a new 
format, with the focus on ‘sample only’ with a small takeaway range.  
The results have been encouraging and we are looking to finalise  
the elements of this mid-size format by October 2013. 
Following the success of the UK plan, we have also commenced  
a similar refurbishment programme in the Rest of Europe to adapt 
to changing customer preferences.  By the end of the year, we had 
refurbished six stores with positive initial results.  Although trading 
conditions in this business remain challenging, we are planning a 
further four store refurbishments in the first quarter of this financial 
year, prior to assessing the potential for a further roll out.

2. Adjusting the store portfolio 
At the end of April 2013 we had 478 stores trading in the UK  
and during the last 12 months we opened 11 stores and closed 23.  
This net reduction is primarily the result of completing detailed 
catchment analysis which identified a small number of overlaps, 
where having more than one store in a town was not beneficial to 
profit or cash flow.  The new stores have been smaller than the estate 
average.  These are primarily high street stores located in the Greater 
London area, where there is a h igh concentration of potential 
customers who currently do not have easy access to a Carpetright 
store.  We have been encouraged by the early trading results and see 
potential for a further 10-15 of these opportunities.    
We continue to take a robust view at lease renewal, which provides 
an opportunity to secure lower rental cost for future years.  In the 
period we achieved an average rent reduction of over 10% on the 
current rent payable in respect of leases which were renewed and 
exited seven poor performing stores.  Within the next five years  
20% of the estate has lease renewals scheduled. 
In the Rest of Europe we had 14 2 stores trading as at the end  
of April 2013.  During the last 12 months we opened three stores 
and closed three.  We now have 13 stores operating a ‘sample only’  
with a small takeaway range format, which has the benefit of lower 
operating costs without negatively affecting customer choice.   
This format allows us to reduce fixed occupancy costs by either  
sub-letting or handing back space to the landlord, hence  
increasing profit. 
3. Enhancing our range of floor coverings  
and services 
In the current economic environment our customers are looking 
harder than ever for value before making their purchase.  Based on 
our experience, we are adapting our ranges and promotional activity 
to continue to offer the best prices across a broader flooring 
selection, to strengthen our product authority as market leader and 
maximise our market opportunity. 
In the UK, in line with broadening our appeal to more affluent 
customers, we introduced a selection of branded carpets at very 
competitive prices, such as Brintons, Ulster and Westex, and sisal 
and sea grass ranges to the majority of stores during the period.  The 
results have been encouraging, generating incremental sales.  
Analysis indicates that more of our customers are choosing to have 
their carpet fitted for them, rather than doing it themselves.  As a 
consequence, we are seeing a higher proportion of our ‘pay and take’ 
roll stock – which was traditionally taken home by the customer 
from the store on the day of pu rchase – being fitted for the 
customer.  The trend has enabled us to introduce samples of these 
products, enabling us to offer a wider selection, particularly in a 
number of smaller stores.    
A further area of opportunity is to develop our smooth flooring 
selection in the UK, building on our extensive knowledge and 
success in this market in continental Europe, where it has 
traditionally made up a much greater proportion of the sales mix.  
The roll out of our stocked laminate offering has continued and is 
now in over 340 stores, alongside a laminate sample range available 
in all stores.  In addition, we in troduced a competitive Luxury Vinyl 
Tile (LVT) offer into 300 stores, with plans to extend this to over 440 
stores by the end of July 2013.  Alongside this, we have introduced a 
new range of engineered wood, which is also being rolled out over 
the same time period.  We continue to believe this category will 
provide an area of growth, supported by the strength of our value 
and service proposition. 
In the Rest of Europe, we have adapted displays to broaden the 
colour choice on our most popular roll stock ranges and introduced 
LVT to all stores.  In addition, we have introduced a distressed wood 
collection along with sisal and sea grass, the latter two under the 
branding of ‘Natural Collection’. 
4. Optimising digital as part of a  
multi-channel offering 
Our customer research indicates that the nature of our product 
means that the vast majority of cu stomers prefer to visit a store to 
make their purchase, to give them the opportunity to see and touch 
their choice of floor covering.  However, the internet is playing an 
ever-increasing role in pre-purchase behaviour, becoming a vital 
research tool for many customers and the rapid growth of smart 
phone and tablet use also underlines the importance of having an 
effective and integrated digital proposition.   
We continued to develop and improve our online presence  
during the period.  By the end of the year, on a weekly basis we were 
achieving an average of over 87,000 unique visitors to our website, a 
21% increase on the same period last year and this has produced a 
corresponding increase in appointment leads.  Some of the increase 
is attributable to an enhanced search engine optimisation 
programme and increased investment in pay-per-click.  The ability 
to track attributable sales has given us encouragement to invest more 
in this area this year.  This initiative, alongside widening the range of 
available samples, has helped to increase the volume of sample 
requests by 70%.  We have also continued to focus activity in 
improving our conversion to sales ratio, through a call centre 
manned by knowledgeable colleagues and by improved  
follow-up at store level. 
In the Rest of Europe, we are developing a process for appointment 
leads and samples and improving the compatibility of our websites 
on mobile devices.  We expect to have this operational by the end of 
the calendar year. 
5. Developing our bed proposition 
Beds provide an important complementary revenue stream, in  
our UK business, to our core floor coverings offer and we believe 
this category has significant further growth potential.  We have 
established a compelling offer with a typical in-store range of 
between 25-35 beds available at market leading prices, backed up  
by a good home delivery service.  At the end of April 2013 the offer 
‘Sleepright by Carpetright’ was trading from 271 stores (2012: 272 
stores).  The business delivered an increase in sales of 10.4% in the 
year as a whole, with 5.6% in the first half and 15.2% in the second 
half, giving an indication of the momentum being achieved.  Beds 
now represent 6.7% of total UK sales revenue (2012: 6.1%) and 
10.8% of the sales mix in those stores where it is available.  Our 
biggest opportunity is now in buil ding customer awareness that we 
sell beds and, to support this, we are increasing our investment in 
marketing activity focused on this area.   7

www.carpetright.plc.uk 
Business review Governance Financial statements 
By building on the lessons learnt in the UK we have looked to 
replicate the bed proposition in the Netherlands, albeit adjusted  
to reflect the needs of the local consumer.  We have opened bed 
departments in two stores as a tria l and are rolling this out to four 
more stores by the end of July.  These will be evaluated by the end  
of the calendar year.   
6. Delivering a step change in service 
In an environment where customers’ service expectations continue 
to rise, we believe there is an opportunity to drive our customer 
service standards higher and make them a real competitive 
advantage.  This view is supported by externally conducted market 
research.  Based on this research, during the year, we introduced 
new point of sale and price tickets to improve the transparency of 
our pricing.  In addition, we invested in training to develop our  
store colleagues to enable them to provide even better service to  
our customers. 
Mystery shopper visits provide a robust measure of our 
performance, enabling recognition of the best stores and identifying 
those where corrective action is needed when we have fallen short  
of our expectations.  Starting in late Summer 2012, we increased the 
frequency of these visits with every store now getting at least one 
visit every month.  Simultaneously, all store colleagues received 
training on selling and service standards and we have increased the 
bonus and incentives for those who achieve the required standard.   
As more customers place a premium on their time, we have seen a 
growth in the number of customers who would like to make their 
purchase decision in their own home.  This trend underlines the 
increasing importance of the role of the estimator in visiting 
customers’ homes, providing a selected range of flooring and 
measuring room(s).  We are currently evaluating how we can 
optimise this resource to provide a market leading service in this 
area and, as a start, have commenced a programme of ‘mystery 
shopper’ evaluation of our current performance and increased  
our training in this area. 
Our cutting and distribution centre at Purfleet provides a market 
leading cut-to-measure service to our stores, together with short  
lead times.  This gives our store colleagues the ability to sell with the 
confidence of meeting our customers’ expectation of fulfilling their 
order rapidly.  Later this year, we are switching to a new transport 
fleet, which will reduce our fuel consumption and enable us to 
increase the proportion of products under centralised distribution. 
The latter will free up time in store, to be invested in improving our 
customer service.  
In the majority of instances, the last contact point the customer  
has with Carpetright is with the flooring fitter.  In the UK, we 
recommend the use of one of 1,284 fitters who have been 
independently assessed and validated.  To monitor the performance 
of the fitter, customers are contacted after the fitting to seek 
comments on their experience.  This allows our store managers  
to track individual performance and identify areas for improvement.  
We are looking to improve the ro bustness of this process by 
introducing automation in the capture of the customer comments.  
We offer all our recommended fitters access to an independent 
assessment and have broadened the numbers of disciplines to 
support the expansion of our range into laminate and LVT. 
Outlook 
Historically, trends in UK housing transactions and mortgage 
approvals have been useful lead indicators of consumer demand in 
our sector, bearing a positive correlation with floor covering sales.  
Both of these indicators have recently shown some early signs of 
improvement, although this is from a very low base and it remains 
premature to call a wider recovery in the economy.  
The success of our self-help activities in improving Group 
performance during the period was particularly encouraging, 
demonstrating that a focus on factors within our control can  
yield good results.  
While we expect trading conditions to remain challenging, we are 
confident this combination of self-help initiatives will underpin the 
positive momentum of the Group.

UK 
Total UK revenue in the year was £3 81.6m, in line with the previous 
year.  We opened 11 stores and closed 23 stores in the year, which 
translated into net space decline of 117,000 sq ft, a decrease of 2.7%. 
After taking into account the movement in the number of stores, 
like-for-like sales for the year increased by 2.2% and can be 
attributed to the following key factors: 
i) The stores which have now been fully refurbished are reporting 
sales increases around 10% above the underlying store base; 
ii) The development of our bed business.  This category now 
makes up 6.7% of UK sales (2012: 6.1%); 
iii) The introduction of an improved laminate range to  
more stores;  
iv) The increased use of digital media; and 
v) A 54.4% decline in the wholesale businesses, which now 
represents 1.5% of sales (2012: 3.3%).  Whilst there remains  
a market, the level of profitability available to Carpetright  
has been significantly reduced by structural changes in the 
insurance replacement market.  This is likely to remain  
a relatively small proportion of total sales for the  
foreseeable future. 
The progress made on the self-help initiatives was reflected in  
the sales line with first half like-for-like sales up 0.8% and this 
accelerated in the second half to 3.6%.   
Gross profit increased by 4.4% to £234.8m, representing 61.5% of 
sales, an increase of 2.6 percentage points.  This improvement was 
achieved in the floor covering margin through better sourcing and 
promotional planning.  The impact of the increase of bed sales at  
a lower margin was offset by a corresponding decrease from our 
wholesale business. 
The total UK cost base increased by 0.9% compared with the prior 
year to £223.9m (2012: £222.0m).  Store payroll costs continue to be 
managed closely to the volume of sales and increased by 0.2% to 
£58.3m (2012: £57.6m).  Store occupancy costs fell 0.9% to £126.4m 
(2012: £127.5m) due to a net reduction in the number of stores, 
successful rent negotiations and reduced depreciation, although this 
was partially offset by utility and business rates inflation.  The 
underlying rent in like-for-like stores increased marginally by 0.3% 
(2012: 0.2%), with the majority of rent reviews being settled at zero, a 
reflection of the current economic climate.  Marketing and central 
support costs were up 5.7% at £39.2m (2012: £37.1m), primarily the 
result of an increased investment in sales-driving advertising activity 
supporting self-help initiatives and an increase in performance 
related bonuses.  
Underlying operating profit increased significantly to £10.9m 
(2012: £2.8m).

Overview 
Total sales decreased by 2.9% to £457.6m, with the UK business 
being level and a decline in the Rest of Europe.  During the year, the 
Group opened 14 stores and closed 26 which gave a net decrease of 
12 stores, with a total store base of 620.  Total store space declined by 
2.1% to 5.7 million square feet. 
The challenging consumer environment in the UK is continuing to 
impact the disposable incomes of our customers and subdued 
mortgage approval volumes influence a lower level of activity within 
our sector.  Against this backdrop, our self-help actions continue to 
deliver positive results.  The key driver in the performance of the Rest 
of Europe continues to be the dete rioration of consumer confidence 
in the Netherlands, where the floor coverings market remains weak.   
Overall, Group underlying operatin g profit increased by 42.5% to 
£11.4m.  Underlying net finance charges were £2.3m lower at £1.7m, the 
result of lower average net debt achi eved, for the most part, through the 
sale and leaseback of freehold properties in the latter part of the previous 
financial year.   These factors combined to generate an underlying profit 
before tax of £9.7m, a 142.5% increase on the prior year. 
Exceptional charges totalled £14.8m (2012: a surplus of £9.5m) 
primarily from onerous lease provisions, net losses on the disposal of 
property and non-cash impairment charges. 
As a result, the loss before tax was £5.1m (2012:  profit of £13.5m).  
Basic loss per share was 9.8p reflecting the post tax loss (2012: 
earnings of 16.4p). 
The combination of cash flow from continued underlying 
profitability and the level of net ca pital expenditure, enabled year-end 
net debt to be reduced by £8.9m to £10.2m (2012: £19.1m).  The cash 
flow strength of the Group is highl ighted by the fact that in the past 
four years net debt has been reduced by over 89% from £97.1m as at 
May 2009.

Rest of Europe 
In the Netherlands, following the implementation of government 
austerity measures which adversely affected consumer confidence, 
the flooring market was weak.  This resulted in an extremely 
challenging year for our business.  Belgium also faced a difficult 
period with a similar package of austerity measures, although our 
sales were not as severely impacted.  Whilst in the Republic of 
Ireland we achieved consistent sales growth throughout the year, as 
our recovery plan continues to gain momentum. 
The three businesses combined to produce a total sales decline  
of 10.4% in local currency, with like-for-like sales decreasing by 
11.0%.  After exchange rate movements, total sales fell 15.5% in 
reported revenue. 
Gross profit percentage increased marginally to 57.2% (2012: 
57.0%), but was not enough to offset the decline in sales, resulting in 
a decline of gross profit to £43.5m (2012: £51.2m).  In local currency 
terms, this represented a 9.7% decline. 
Reported operating costs decreased by 6.5% to £43.0m.  In local 
currency terms, costs decreased by 0.3%, which included an 
additional £0.8m of occupancy costs following the sale and leaseback 
disposal of four freehold properties in Belgium at the end of the last 
financial year.  The reduction in the remaining costs reflects tight 
management control and a focus on achieving efficiencies.   
The net result was an underlying operating profit of £0.5m (2012: 
£5.2m).  In local currency terms, the underlying profit decreased  
by 90.5%.

Net Finance Costs and Taxation 
Underlying net finance charges were £1.7m (2012: £4.0m) reflecting 
lower average net debt and a reduction in the margin rates on 
borrowings.  The effective tax rate on profits is 29.3% (2012: 18.7%).  
This increase arises as a combination of non-recurring adjustments 
in the prior year and the impact of a change in UK tax rates.   
Exceptional Items 
The Group recorded a net charge of £14.8m (2012: surplus of £9.5m) 
in the year.

We continued to trade our property portfolio, although the 
deterioration in the UK out-of-town retail property market has 
made this more challenging.  A net loss of £1.2m was made on 
property disposals in the year (2012: profit of £13.4m).  
During the period, a property portfolio review was completed.  This 
resulted in the closure of 11 stores previously trading under the 
‘Storey Carpets’ brand.  In all of these locations there is a 
‘Carpetright’ store in close proximity.  As expected, a proportion of 
the sales have transferred to nearby stores with an annualised benefit 
to profit to be around £1m.  In addition, we have had leases for two 
stores return under privity of contract following their current 
occupier’s administration.  As a result, along with three other 
closures, the Group is making an onerous lease provision for the 
estimated future outgoings of these stores of £5.4m.  In April 2011, 
we made onerous lease provisions for 20 UK stores, we have 
disposed of eight of these, leav ing 12, where in the light of the 
deterioration of the out-of-town property market, the provision has 
been reviewed and increased by £2.7m.    
We have reviewed the carrying value of the store assets in our 
balance sheet, consistent with the approach in previous years.  The 
model used to value these assets includes a number of assumptions 
relating to market growth and inflationary expectations.  These tests 
have led to a net impairment charge of £0.3m (2012: £1.0m).   
Historically, the Group has made net gains on disposal of freehold 
properties and has a track record of overachievement against 
valuations.  Nevertheless, the weakening of the property market in 
both the UK and the Netherlands, with more properties being 
returned to landlords, has led us to review the carrying value of the 
Group’s freehold properties.  This has resulted in a non-cash 
impairment charge of £5.2m.   
Earnings per Share 
Basic loss per share was 9.8 pence (2012: earnings of 16.4 pence), 
reflecting the post tax loss.  Underlying earnings per share increased 
to 9.6 pence (2012: 4.5 pence).  
Dividend 
Whilst recognising good progress has been made in reducing our  
debt and there has been some encouragement in the increase of the 
level of underlying profitability, the current economic environment 
continues to be uncertain.  As a resu lt, the Board feels it is important  
to see a continued recovery in Grou p performance before restoring the 
dividend.  The Board has therefore de cided not to pay a final dividend  
(2012: nil pence), resulting in no full year dividend (2012: nil pence). 
Balance Sheet 
The Group had net assets of £65.3m (2012: £70.7m) at the end of the 
year, a decrease of £5.4m since 28 April 2012, reflecting the post tax 
loss for the year.

Net debt and cash flow 
The cash generative nature of the business remains one of the 
strengths of the Group, with operating cash flow of £17.4m in the 
year (2012: £29.1m).   
The increase in working capital in the year was attributable to the 
decline in merchandise creditors in the Netherlands, a consequence 
of the lower sales, the net amortisation of property lease incentives 
and the reversal of a timing difference from the previous year related 
to payment of UK VAT.  The payment for provisions reflects the 
cash outgoing for previous years’ exceptional items, predominantly 
onerous leases in the UK and Republic of Ireland.

Net capital receipts/(expenditure) was an outflow of £6.6m (2012: 
inflow of £22.8m).  This can be broken down into the following

Net capital receipts/(expenditure) (6.6) 22.8
After the repayment of borrowings, net debt decreased by £8.9m to 
£10.2m at the year end (2012: £19.1m). 
Property 
The Group owns a significant proper ty portfolio, most of which is 
used for trading purposes. This portfolio is estimated by 
management to have a market value of £79.7m at the year-end 
(2012: £86.6m), compared to a net book value of £73.6m recorded in 
the financial statements (2012: £81.8m).  The movement in the year 
is predominantly the result of recognising weaker property markets. 
Pensions 
The IAS 19 valuation as at 27 April 2013 was a net deficit of £5.1m in 
relation to defined benefit pension arrangements (2012: £4.3m).  
The Carpetright scheme closed to future accrual on 30 April 2010.  
Plan assets increased to £21.7m (2012: £18.3m) driven by higher 
market values and additional Company contributions agreed with 
the pension trustees following the triennial valuation in April 2011.  
The present value of plan liabilities increased to £26.8m (2012: 
£22.6m) driven principally by a reduction in the discount rate to 
4.2% (2012: 4.6%). 
Current liquidity 
At the year end the Group held cash balances of £7.9m (2012: 
£9.6m) principally a combination of Sterling and Euros.  
Gross bank borrowings at the balance sheet date were £15.5m (2012: 
£26.0m) of which £1.6m is term based with the balance of £13.9m 
being drawn down from overdraft and revolving credit facilities.  
The Group had further undrawn, comm itted facilities of £46.7m at 
the balance sheet date.  
In June 2011, the Group completed a refinancing arrangement of its 
principal facilities, split between amortising term loans, a revolving 
credit facility and overdrafts in a mixture of Sterling and Euro 
currencies.  The term loans and revolving credit facilities mature in 
July 2015.  As at 27 April 2013, the facilities provided debt capacity 
of around £63m.   Arrangement fees and legal costs are amortised 
over the period to June 2014, although paid in cash at the outset.  
The facilities contain financial covenants which are tested on a 
quarterly basis.  The Group monitors actual and prospective 
compliance with these on a regular basis.

Principal risks and uncertainties 
www.carpetright.plc.uk 
Business review Governance Financial statements 
Carpetright recognises that effective business management requires regular 
review of business risks to identify, evaluate and prioritise them, to assign 
management ownership and to ensure appropriate controls are in place to 
provide mitigation. 
The process for identification of business risks is described on page 24 of this report. 
The risk factors addressed below are those which we believe could adversely affect the operations, revenue, profit, cash flow o r assets of the 
Group.  Additional risks and uncertainties currently unknown to us, or which we currently believe are immaterial, may also have an adverse 
effect on the Group. 
We use our risk management process to identify, monitor, evaluate and escalate such issues as they emerge, enabling management to take 
appropriate action wherever possible in order to control them and also enabling the Board to keep risk management under review. 
Business Objective and Strategies 
The primary financial objective of the Group is to deliver long term sustainable growth in earnings per share and cash flow.  T he strategies that 
we are following to achieve this are set out on page 8 of this report.  We face a number of strategic and operational risks which are set out 
below, together with the controls and actions which mitigate the impact of those risks. 
 
Operational

Our profitability is dependent upon our ability to attract, retain 
and motivate people across all levels of the business. 
We invest in training to develop our colleagues to provide great 
service to our customers.  Our approach to remuneration aims to 
ensure that high calibre executives are attracted and retained.   
 
 Risk Description Mitigation
Strategic Risks 
 Development and execution of a strategy: 
The business requires a strategy that responds to the challenges 
of the market place so as to posi tion itself for long-term growth.
The Board holds an annual strategy day and from this 
business plans are developed to ensure targets are both set  
and resourced appropriately.  
Regular monitoring of performance against plan is carried out  
to ensure targets are being achiev ed and that they remain relevant 
to and focused on the Group strategy. 
 Economic uncertainty:
The economy is a major influence on consumer spending.  
Trends in employment, inflation, taxation, consumer debt levels 
and interest rates impact consumer expenditure in discretionary 
areas.  Changes in Government policies may also affect our 
consumers’ ability to purchase our products and services.
Throughout the year we have continued to monitor the 
effectiveness of our pricing, promotional and marketing  
strategies across our businesses, tailoring our consumer  
offering where appropriate.   
 Cost control: 
In the event we are unable to control our costs the financial 
results of the Group will be adversely affected. 
 
 
We have a budgetary and planning process which has been 
developed to ensure that there is an appropriate budget for both 
operational costs and capital expenditure.  There is a system of 
authorisation to prevent costs being incurred without appropriate 
authorisation and being in excess of budget. 
In addition we continually focus on our cost base to ensure that 
we are able to manage our margins. 
 Reputation: 
The failure to properly mitigate and manage other risks may 
manifest itself by damaging Carpetright’s reputation.  This may 
lead to a lack of confidence by consumers, thereby adversely 
affecting the business. 
We have mitigation strategies in place to manage our other risks, 
thereby reducing the chance of them arising.  In the event that 
there is a threat of reputational damage, there is a process in place 
to deal with enquiries from the press, investors and others, as well 
as social media.

 Risk Description  Mitigation
Operational Risks 
 Product and service quality: 
The Carpetright name is a key as set of the business and as the 
largest operator in its markets, expectations of the Group are 
high.  Failure to provide high quality products and services 
could lead to a loss of trust and confidence, and damage the 
Group’s reputation and brand.  This could result in a decline in 
the customer base and affect the ability to recruit good people.
The protection of the Carpetright brand and position in its core 
markets will be sustained by unique and extensive product and 
service offerings in our stores.  Colleague and fitter training is 
delivered continually with fitters being independently assessed. 
 IT systems, supply chain and business continuity: 
Carpetright is dependent on the reliability and capability of key 
information systems and technology.  A major incident or 
sustained performance problems with regard to store, logistics, 
multi-channel or support office systems could constitute a 
significant threat to the business, at least in the short term. 
Business continuity plans have been documented and 
arrangements made to mitigate significant risks arising.  The 
systems implemented within the UK and the Republic of Ireland 
are mirrored in a separate location.  Plans are in place to replicate 
this in the remaining European businesses by the end of 
September 2013. 
 Compliance: 
The Group risks incurring penalties or punitive damages  
arising from failure to comply with legislative or regulatory 
requirements across many areas.  
The Group has developed clear policies on compliance and it is 
the Group’s Legal Director’s responsibility to identify prospective 
changes to laws and regulations and to bring these to the 
attention of the relevant people.
 
Financial 
Risks 
 Finance and Treasury: 
The Group risks exposure to exchange rate, interest rate, 
liquidity and credit risks having an adverse or unexpected 
impact on results, funding requirements or purchasing ability. 
The Group frequently reviews its financial position to ensure  
that its funding requirements are being met.  Bank covenant  
tests are regularly monitored.  Rolling cash flow forecasts are 
produced weekly.
 
 
People 
The Group employs over 3,200 
people and is proud of being 
regarded as a responsible and 
respected employer. 
Equal opportunities 
The Board believes in creating throughout the Company a culture 
that is free from discrimination and harassment, and will not permit 
or tolerate discrimination in any form.  The Group operates a 
whistleblowing hotline through a third party provider enabling 
matters of concern to be raised with the Company on a named or 
anonymous basis.  The Company gives full and fair consideration to 
applications for employment when these are received from disabled 
people.  Should an individual become disabled while working for the 
Company, efforts are made to continue their employment and 
retraining is provided, if necessary. 
Training and development 
Our training and development programmes are focused on  
giving our people the skills they need to carry out their jobs and  
in due course to move up to new roles, enabling them to develop 
their careers and ensuring that there is a pipeline of talent within  
the Group. 
 
Engagement 
There are a number of communication channels in place to help 
people develop their knowledge of, and enhance their involvement 
with, the Group.  These channels include surveys, conferences, 
management briefings, weekly briefings broadcast to stores and 
offices, and other less formal communications.  Additionally, all 
annual results and interim management statements are made 
available through the intranet.  Directors and senior management 
regularly visit stores and discuss matters of current interest and 
concern with colleagues. 
Share ownership 
Colleagues have an opportunity to invest in the Company’s shares 
and through two all-employee share schemes, namely an  
All Employee Share Ownership Plan and a Savings Related Share 
Option Scheme.  Approximately 500 colleagues participate in  
these schemes.  17

Corporate responsibility 
www.carpetright.plc.uk 
Governance Business review Financial statements 
Our Corporate Responsibility (CR) policy is designed to meet the long-term expectations of our 
customers and other stakeholders and ensure the sustainable development of our business. 
 
It is clear that protecting the environment and running our business 
ethically makes good commercial sense and, apart from improving 
the environment for both our colleagues and our customers, will 
also help us to enhance shareholder returns.  The Customer and 
Corporate Responsibility Committee was created on 1 July 2012 and 
oversees, amongst other matters, the Group’s CR activities.  Martin 
Harris is the Executive Director responsible for co-ordinating the 
Group’s CR activities.  Details of the number of meetings and 
attendance are set out on page 22. 
We have continued developing and improving policies to cover  
the following: 
Providing excellent service 
Our aim is to provide an outstanding customer experience by selling 
a comprehensive range of products at the keenest prices, supported 
by dedicated store teams and, where required, by organising a high 
quality estimating and fitting service. 
One of the streams in our strategic plan is delivering a step change  
in service delivery as we believe that this can help significantly 
differentiate us from our competitors. 
Post-sales calls to customers were introduced in the UK in winter 
2011/12, allowing immediate feedback thereby ensuring that any 
issues can be immediately addressed by the relevant store.  We also 
introduced this process in the Rest of Europe in March 2013. 
In the Netherlands we introduced an online customer satisfaction 
survey with a response rate of nearly 60% and were very encouraged 
by the results, with the majority of our customers ranking us ‘good’ 
or ‘very good’ in all areas of serv ice and over 97% of the respondents 
saying they would recommend Carpetright. 
In the UK we undertake a mystery shopping programme which 
assesses the customer service and selling skills of our store 
colleagues.  Part of their overall remuneration is based upon their 
success in achieving high customer service scores.  During 2013/14 
we will be rolling this out to our estimators. 
We have identified that the estimating service is very important to 
the overall customer experience.  We are therefore increasing our 
training to improve our estimating service, and this will remain a 
focus for the company. 
We do not employ our own fitters in the UK but instead have a 
commercial arrangement to introduce those fitters in whose skills 
we have confidence and recommend to our customers.  Our mobile 
fitter training pods enable us to offer all our recommended fitters 
access to the Flooring Industry Trade Association (FITA) 
assessment and additional training where required to meet FITA’s 
exacting standards.  As at 27 April 2013 we would recommend 1,284 
independent fitters who have been independently assessed by FITA.  
We also ensure that fitters carry public liability insurance.
We will be developing our colleagues in 2013/14 in order to 
underpin our provision of excellent service and our targets for this 
are included in the ‘Developing committed people’ section below.  
For the financial year 2013/14 our targets are: 
• To achieve 100% post-sales calls in the UK; 
• To improve our mystery shopper scores in the UK;  
• To introduce fitters’ identity cards to Northern Ireland and  
the Republic of Ireland; 
• To introduce a quality assurance programme to ensure  
that recommended fitters in the UK continue to meet the  
required standards;  
• To ensure all recommended fitters in the Netherlands and 
Belgium meet or exceed the same standards as those in the  
UK; and 
• To introduce a fitters’ Code of Conduct in Belgium and 
the Netherlands. 
Developing committed people 
As at 27 April 2013 we employed 3,280 colleagues in stores, 
distribution centres and offices throughout the UK and the Rest of 
Europe.  Our aims are to ensure everyone has the appropriate skills 
and knowledge; to offer our people a good range of benefits; and to 
value and promote the diversity of our workforce. 
In the UK over 2,500 man-days of training were undertaken, in 
addition to on-line Health and Safety training.  This training is 
intended to develop our colleagues and enable them to provide  
great service to our customers. 
In Europe, we targeted our training towards our colleagues in stores, 
focussing on product training to enable them to provide a great 
service to our customers.  Additionally eLearning training was rolled 
out.  Furthermore all store managers and assistant managers in the 
Netherlands and Belgium have undergone management skills 
training appropriate to their position. 
Our colleagues in the Netherlands participate in a 10 mile run to 
raise money for a children’s cancer charity which is aiming to build  
a hospital in the Utrecht area, and in 2013 members of the Executive 
Team will be joining them. 
For the financial year 2013/14 our targets are: 
• To deliver a training programme for every estimator and store 
manager in the UK; 
• To deliver product knowledge training to every store-based 
colleague in the UK on beds, smooth floor coverings and carpets; 
• To provide refresher training on measuring and planning to  
every store-based colleague in the UK;  
• To ensure every new colleague attends a structured  
induction programme;

• To design and deliver eLearning packages on all products  
for availability via the Company’s intranet; 
• To test the core competencies of all store based colleagues in  
the Netherlands and Belgium through an on-line platform to 
prove competency levels and identify any specific training 
requirements; and 
• To introduce a management training programme for high 
potential store managers in the Netherlands and Belgium 
as preparation for more senior positions in the future. 
Sourcing great products 
We are committed to buying our products from suppliers who 
operate responsibly.  Our aims are to ensure suppliers are subject  
to vetting for satisfactory ethics and procedures, to insist our 
product suppliers sign up to the Carpetright Ethical and 
Environmental Code of Conduct, and to ensure we act in a 
responsible and ethical manner.  This covers matters such as the 
prohibition of the use of child and forced labour, freedom of 
association and the provision of safe and hygienic working 
conditions.  In respect of the products, the Code of Conduct 
prohibits the use of certain chemicals and includes a timber policy  
to ensure all timber floor covering products are manufactured  
from sustainable resources. 
All floor covering and bed suppliers to our businesses both in the 
UK and in the Rest of Europe have signed up to compliance with 
our Code of Conduct. 
Our product suppliers are, principally, based in Europe, which 
means that less fuel is used in transporting the products than if  
we sourced from further afield. 
We now sell Luxury Vinyl Tiles which are made from 40%  
recycled materials and which are, themselves, 100% recyclable.  
Further, both sisal and sea-grass products are now available in  
the majority of our stores. 
For the financial year 2013/14 our targets are: 
• To grow our sales of Luxury Vinyl Tiles;  
• To introduce a carpet collection made partly from maize in the 
Netherlands and Belgium; and 
• To identify and source products from suppliers who use 
techniques that reduce raw materials usage in the carpet 
manufacturing process. 
Creating a safe place to work and shop 
We are committed to achieving high standards of health and safety 
in all operational areas. 
Quarterly Health and Safety Committee meetings take place in all 
business units.  We are pleased to report that there have not been 
any fatalities again this year (2012: nil).  There has been an increase 
in the overall level of accidents in the UK to 116 (2012: 110).  
Pleasingly, the number of serious accidents that are reportable to the 
Health and Safety Executive decreased in the period to 11 (2012: 12), 
and there were 3 (2012: 7) accidents in the Rest of Europe which 
would have been reportable had they occurred in the UK. 
We remain committed to eliminating all heavy manual handling 
from our stores.  Wherever possible, each of our branches has a 
pedestrian operated boom truck to unload and move carpet and 
vinyl deliveries, and where it has not been possible to provide a truck 
we have arranged a series of nearby ‘buddy’ branches to accept 
deliveries.  In Europe manual handling training was undertaken  
by all colleagues in the Netherlands and Belgium. 
The Health and Safety manual used in the UK is being translated 
and revised for use in the Rest of Europe. 
For the financial year 2013/14 our targets are: 
• To deliver the remaining 225 Easylift devices and associated 
training, thereby ensuring all stores in the UK and RoI that have 
rollstock have an Easylift device; 
• For our European business, to translate, revise and launch health 
and safety procedures manual as documented in our UK manual; 
• To assess an automated ‘roll-on’ device for easily rolling roll-stock 
onto standard European roll-stock stands; and 
• To implement a programme to replace all non-standard  
roll-stock stands in the UK with standard stands as they are  
easier to maintain. 
Respect for the environment 
We are committed to taking steps to control and minimise any 
damage our operations may cause to the environment through 
manufacturing processes, transport, energy usage and packaging.   
In particular we are aware of th e issue of climate change and we 
want to understand and minimise our carbon emissions.   
In the UK we make our own cardboard tubes on site, thereby 
reducing the cost of delivery of what is, essentially, air in the centre 
of the tubes.  Where possible we re-use cardboard tubes.  Sheet 
polythene wrapping and cardboard tubes that are not re-used but 
are delivered within the UK (excluding Northern Ireland) from our 
main distribution centre are recycled.  No waste produced from our 
store support office, warehouse and distribution centre is sent to 
landfill; general rubbish being compacted and incinerated to 
produce energy.  Currently other waste from stores is sent to landfill, 
although we aim to address this in the forthcoming financial year. 
In Belgium and the Netherlands sheet polythene wrapping around 
our carpets is also collected and recycled. 
We continue to consider whether there are opportunities to recycle 
of end-of-use carpets.  A mattress recycling service is offered to our 
customers in the Netherlands. 
We were able to reduce our water consumption in the UK  
by approximately a third during the year, and nearly half  
measured over the last two years, which has been achieved  
through improved analysis of consumption data and 
identification of any high-use locations. 
We are trialling different forms of energy-efficient lighting and, 
where a store undergoes a full refurbishment, it is the intention to 
install such lighting at that location.  19

Governance Business review Financial statements 
Nearly 60% of the eligible property portfolio in the UK now  
has Automatic Meter Reading (AMR) electricity meters, which 
provide daily meter reading data and allows us to target any high-
consumption locations, understand why the usage is higher than 
anticipated and manage our consumption appropriately.  AMR 
electricity meters were also installed in 92% of stores in the 
Netherlands where installation is possible, although it is too early  
to assess their success. 
Approximately 72% of our eligible property portfolio in the UK  
now has gas AMR meters, enabling us to monitor gas consumption 
in a similar way to electricity consumption. This has enabled us to 
identify stores that were, for example, leaving heating on overnight.  
In the Netherlands 80% of stores of the eligible property portfolio 
has had AMR meters installed.
For the financial year 2013/14 our targets are: 
• To explore the potential to introduce movement sensitive lighting 
to our main UK distribution and cutting warehouse; 
• To install a further 108 gas AMR meters in the UK, completing 
the roll-out to all eligible trading stores; 
• To install a further 186 electricity AMR meters in the UK, 
completing the roll-out to all eligible trading stores; 
• To divert all waste generated by stores in the UK (excluding 
Northern Ireland) from landfill to either recycling or incineration 
to produce electricity; 
• To provide a bed recycling service in the UK; and 
• To introduce a new, more energy efficient, fleet of lorries.

The Board currently consists of the Chairman, three Executive and 
four Non-Executive Directors, brief biographies of whom can be 
found on page 20.  Andrew Page will join the Board on 1 July 2013 
as an additional independent Non-Executive Director.  There is a 
formal, rigorous and transparent procedure for the appointment of 
new Directors to the Board and this is described in the section 
concerning the Nomination Committee on page 23. 
As at 27 April 2013 a quarter of the Board was female (two out  
of eight) and one out of six members of the Executive Committee 
was female. 
All Directors will offer themselves for election or re-election at the 
Annual General Meeting in accordance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. 
Until 14 May 2012 the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive were 
both held by Lord Harris.  He ce ased to be Chief Executive when 
Darren Shapland was appointed to that role.  Lord Harris remains  
as Chairman and for the financial year ended in April 2013 worked 
four days per week in support of Darren Shapland in specific areas 
of the business, notably property and buying.  Since 1 June 2013, 
reflecting the progress made in the last year, Lord Harris has  
reduced his time commitment to three days per week.  Following  
the appointment of a Trading Director in May 2013, Lord Harris 
will be working with the Trading Director so that his involvement  
in the buying role can be transferred and it is anticipated that his 
executive involvement in the Company’s property activities will  
also significantly reduce in the near future.  As a consequence  
Lord Harris’s time commitment is expected to reduce further. 
A formal statement on the division of responsibilities between the 
Chairman and Chief Executive has been adopted by the Board and 
this makes it clear that the Chief Executive has the responsibility and 
accountability for running the business. 
The Non-Executive Directors of the Company play a key 
governance role and bring an extra dimension to the Board’s 
deliberations.  The Board considered the independence of each  
Non-Executive Director against the criteria specified in the UK 
Corporate Governance Code and has determined that each  
remains fully independent.  The Board in particular considered  
the independence of both Baroness Noakes and Alan Dickinson,  
both of whom are considered by the Board to be independent in 
character and judgment. 
In reaching this determination the Board specifically considered  
the fact that Baroness Noakes is a Non-Executive Director of the 
Royal Bank of Scotland, the Company’s principal banker, and she 
has served as a Director of the Company for more than nine years 
from the date of her first election.  22

Baroness Noakes had intended to step down from the Board in 2012, 
but at the request of the Board agreed to remain on the Board in 
order to facilitate the transition of the Company to the new 
management arrangements.  She has been the Senior Independent 
Director (SID) since 2004 and assumed the role of Deputy 
Chairman in May 2012.  She ceased to be Chairman of the Audit 
Committee in July 2012 but continues to chair the Nomination 
Committee and remains a member of all Board Committees.  She 
plays an active role in determining the agenda for the Board, the 
Board appraisal process and in ensuring that any issues raised by the 
Non-Executive Directors are dealt with.  She also keeps under review 
the division of responsibilities between the Chairman and Chief 
Executive so that it works well in practice. 
The Board views that it is appr opriately balanced, comprising  
the Chairman, three Executive Directors and five independent 
Non-Executive Directors. 
The Board believes that its current size and structure are appropriate 
for managing the Group in an effective and successful manner. 
A process of evaluation of the Board and its Audit, Nomination, 
Remuneration and Customer and Corporate Responsibility 
Committees has been undertaken.  The exercise to evaluate the 
performance of the Board was led by the Deputy Chairman, and 
those of the Audit and Remuneration Committees were led by the 
chairmen of those committees.  The results of these assessments 
have been considered by the Board and confirmed the strength  
of leadership within the business and a sound governance 
framework.  Only minor changes to the way that the Board  
works were found necessary. 
The Non-Executive Directors meet, with no Executive Directors 
present, at least once each year inter alia to review the performance 
of the Chairman. 
The Board is responsible for setting the Group’s objectives and 
policies, providing effective leadership and for approving the Group 
strategy, budgets, business plans and major capital expenditure.  It 
has responsibility for the management, direction and performance 
of the Group and is accountable to the Company’s shareholders for 
the proper conduct of its business.  The Board has a formal schedule 
which sets out those matters requiring Board approval and 
specifically reserved to it for decision. 
Day-to-day management is delegated to the Chief Executive who 
chairs an Executive Committee.  Other members of the Executive 
Committee are the Group Finance Director, Group Development 
Director, the Operations Directors for each of the UK and the Rest 
of Europe, the Trading Director and the Company Secretary. 
Directors receive monthly trading results, commentary, briefing 
notes and reports for their consideration in advance of each Board 
meeting, including reports on the Group’s operations, to ensure that 
they remain briefed on the latest developments and are able to make 
fully informed decisions. 
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the  
Company Secretary and the Board has established a procedure 
whereby Directors may take independent professional advice at the 
Company’s expense.  In addition, such advice may include training 
in order to enable them to discharge their roles and responsibilities 
as a Director.  All new Directors receive an induction tailored to 
their particular requirements. 
Board committees 
The Board has four Committees, each of which has written terms  
of reference which are available on the Company’s corporate website 
(www.carpetright.plc.uk). 
The Board periodically reviews the membership of its  
Committees to ensure that it is refreshed.  The Company provides 
the Committees with sufficient resources to undertake their duties.   
The Company Secretary, or his nominee, acts as Secretary to  
each Committee. 
The role of the Audit Committee, its members and details of how  
it carried out its duties are set out in the Audit Committee report  
on page 25. 
The role of the Remuneration Committee, its members and details 
of how it carried out its duties are set out in the Directors’ 
remuneration report on pages 26 to 35. 
The Customer and Corporate Responsibility Committee

The responsibilities of the Nomination Committee include: 
• identifying and nominating candidates for the approval of the 
Board.  External search consultants are generally appointed to 
assist in the search process; 
• reviewing development needs of the Executive; and 
• making recommendations to the Board on Board composition 
and balance. 
The Committee considers the diversity of the Board and the  
skills and competencies of the existing Directors when drawing  
up specifications for new appointments.  It ensures that the 
development needs of Executive Directors and other senior 
managers are addressed appropriately.  The Chief Executive  
attends the Nomination Committee meetings at the invitation  
of the Committee Chairman. 
The Committee also considers whether Directors due to retire  
at an Annual General Meeting should be recommended for  
re-appointment, and whether the appointment of Non-Executive 
Directors reaching the end of their three-year term should be 
renewed.  Committee members do not vote on their  
own re-appointment. 
An external search consultancy was engaged in relation to  
the recruitment of Andrew Page as an additional independent  
Non-Executive Director. 
Continuing Professional Development 
All Board members are updated on matters relevant to the Group, 
including legal and regulatory developments, and members of Board 
committees are updated on matters relevant to their committee 
membership.  In the year the Remuneration Committee received 
updates on current best practice from New Bridge Street. 
The performance of individual Directors is considered as part of the 
annual Board appraisal process.  The individual development needs 
of Executive Directors are overseen by the Nomination Committee, 
which includes the Chairman.  Non-Executive Directors have access 
to professional development provided by external bodies.  Their 
continuing competence is considered by the Nomination 
Committee as part of the annual process of recommending the 
reappointment of Directors at the AGM. 
Risk Management and Internal Controls 
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of 
internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness.  In order to  
fulfil this responsibility, safeguard shareholder investment and the 
Company’s and the Group’s assets, the Directors have established  
an organisational framework with clear operational procedures,  
lines of responsibility and delegated authority which has operated 
throughout the year under review and up to the date of approval  
of the Annual Report and Financial Statements. 
The system of internal control is designed to identify, evaluate  
and manage significant risks associated with the achievement of  
the Group’s objectives.  Because of the limitations inherent in any 
system of internal control, this system is designed to meet the 
Group’s particular needs and the risks to which it is exposed  
rather than eliminate risk altogether.  Consequently it can only 
provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. 
The Board has reviewed the Group’s systems of internal controls 
including financial, operational and compliance controls as well as 
risk management, and is satisfied that these accord with the 
guidance on internal controls set out in Internal Control: Revised 
Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code, issued by the 
Financial Reporting Council in October 2005. 
The day-to-day responsibility for managing risk and the 
maintenance of the Group’s system of internal control is collectively 
assumed by the Executive Directors.  An Executive Risk Committee 
(‘ERC’) comprising the Executive Directors and senior managers 
exists to review key risk and control issues.  The ERC met quarterly. 
Several key processes exist within the Group to ensure a sound 
system of internal control, which is described overleaf:  24
Carpetright plc Annual report and accounts 2013

Carpetright plc Annual report and accounts 2013 
Identification of business risks 
The Board is responsible for identifying the major business risks 
faced by the Group, and determining a suitable response.  The ERC 
identifies and assesses risks to the Group’s medium-term strategy.  
The ERC directs the risk managemen t processes within both the  
UK and the Rest of Europe to address each of the identified risks, 
formulate a mitigation strategy and assess the likely impact of  
such risk occurring.  The ERC provides regular reports to the  
Audit Committee. 
During the financial year the UK Risk Management Committee  
and the European Risk Management Committee met quarterly  
and each comprised a small number of the senior management  
team as regular members, who are able to call on the expertise of 
other managers as required.  The work formerly carried out by the 
UK Risk Management Committee is being absorbed by the ERC and 
the UK Risk Management Committee is being disbanded.  The UK 
Risk Management Committee and the ERC considered the response 
to the significant risks which have been identified by management 
and others, and monitors the maintenance of a control environment 
directed towards the proper management of risk. 
The principal risks and uncertainties affecting the business are set 
out on pages 15 and 16. 
Health and safety 
Enforcing the health and safety policy is a high priority for 
management and manuals are available to colleagues, supported by a 
training programme for stores, distribution centres and offices.  Risk 
assessments are undertaken for all procedures and safe systems of 
work devised for all procedures involving physical risk.  Failure to 
adhere to safe systems of work or following unsafe working practices 
will be subject to review and, if necessary, disciplinary proceedings.  
Health and safety issues are includ ed as part of the internal audit 
review of all premises. 
Internal audit 
The internal audit function: 
• undertakes its work, both on central functions and in the field, 
based on a risk assessment model; 
• provides the Audit Committee and the Board with objective 
assurance on the control environment across the Group; and 
• monitors adherence to the Group’s key policies and principles. 
Planning 
The Group’s planning process underpins the development of the 
annual budget.  The budget is reviewed and approved formally  
by the Board.  Actual performance is reported on a monthly basis 
and measured against the budget and the prior year and a detailed 
explanation of significant variances is provided. 
Control procedures 
The Group has control procedures designed to provide a complete 
and accurate record of financial transactions, to ensure correct 
accounting and to minimise the possible exposure to fraudulent 
transactions.  The Board believes that the measures taken, including 
physical controls, separation of duties and management reviews, 
provide suitable assurance.  Any issues raised by the Group’s 
auditors or the internal audit function are fully reviewed  
and considered. 
Management and specialists within the finance team are  
responsible for ensuring the appropriate maintenance of financial 
records and processes that ensure all financial information is 
relevant, reliable, in accordance with the applicable laws and 
regulations, and appropriate information is distributed both 
internally and externally in a timely manner. 
A review of the consolidation and financial statements is completed 
by management to ensure that the financial position and results of 
the Group are appropriately reflected.  The preliminary and interim 
results are subject to review by the Audit Committee prior to 
approval by the Board. 
Share capital 
Details of the Company’s share capital and significant shareholders 
can be found on pages 37 and 38. 
Statement of Compliance 
During the financial year ended 27 April 2013 the Company 
complied with the provisions set out in the UK Corporate 
Governance Code except as set out below. 
The Company did not comply with provision A.2.1 of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code for the entire period as the roles of 
Chairman and Chief Executive were combined for a short period  
at the start of the 2012/13 financial year, until mid-May 2012.  The 
roles were combined until such time as Darren Shapland was able  
to start in his role as the Chief Executive.

All members of the Audit Committee are independent Non-
Executive Directors.  At the invitation of the Committee, the Chief 
Executive, Group Finance Director, Director of Group Internal 
Audit and representatives from the external auditors regularly 
attended meetings.  Other Directors and senior managers also attend 
if required.  There were also regular private meetings with the 
external and internal auditors without management present. 
The Audit Committee has an agenda linked to events in the Group’s 
financial calendar and pays particular attention to the financial 
statements for the year, the annual results announcement and the 
results for the half-year set out in the interim statement.  Following 
review, these are recommended to the Board for approval. 
The Audit Committee reviews the consistency of and any changes to 
the Group’s accounting policies, the application of appropriate 
accounting standards, the methods used to account for significant or 
unusual transactions and areas of s ignificant judgment.  During the 
year the Audit Committee focused in particular on the judgments 
made in making provision for the impairment of stores, freehold 
properties and goodwill in the light of difficult trading conditions.  In 
addition, it examined carefully all the other items which are disclosed 
as exceptional. 
During the period ended 27 April 2013, other matters dealt with 
by the Audit Committee were: 
• reviewing the independence, objectivity and effectiveness of the 
external auditors and, on the basis of that review, recommending 
to the Board their re-appointment at the AGM; 
• reviewing the Group’s Corpor ate Responsibility Report; 
• approving the audit fees paid to the external auditors and reviewing 
the application of the policy on non-audit work performed by them 
together with the non-audit fees payable to them; 
• reviewing the external auditors’ plan for the audit of the Group’s 
accounts, and approving the terms of engagement for the audit; 
• reviewing the process for ensuring that senior management 
confirm that they have supplied the auditors with relevant audit 
information; 
• reviewing the internal audit plan, monitoring the delivery of  
that plan during the year and reviewing the effectiveness of the 
internal audit function; 
• reviewing the work of the ERC, which oversees the identification 
and management of the risks to the business, together with reports 
on the Group’s systems of internal control, and reporting the  
results of this review to the Board; 
• reviewing its terms of reference and effectiveness; 
• carrying out detailed reviews into th e controls in place relative to 
various elements of risk; and 
• reviewing the whistleblowing policy and relevant items  
reported under that policy. 
The Audit Committee and Board place great emphasis on  
the independence and objectivity of the Group’s auditors, 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, when performing their role in the 
Group’s reporting to shareholders.  The external auditors report  
to the Audit Committee annually on their independence from  
the Company. 
The Audit Committee reviews the independence, objectivity and 
performance of the auditors annually, including the annual report on 
the auditors produced by the Audit Quality Review Team of the 
Financial Reporting Council.  On the basis of that review, the Audit 
Committee makes a recommendation on the reappointment of the 
auditors to the Board. 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP have been auditors to the Company 
since 2005 when they were ap pointed following a competitive 
tender.  The Company intends to retender the audit no later than 
2020 in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code.  The 
auditors’ tenure runs from one AGM to the next and there are no 
contractual obligations that restrict the Committee’s choice of 
external auditors. 
The Board has also adopted a fo rmal policy on the Company’s 
relationship with its auditor in respect of non-audit work.  The 
auditors may only provide such serv ices provided that such advice 
does not conflict with their statutory responsibilities and ethical 
guidance.  The Audit Committee Chairman’s approval is required 
before the Company uses non-audit services that exceed financial 
limits set out by that policy.  Details of the auditors’ remuneration for 
audit work and non-audit fees for the period ended 27 April 2013 are 
disclosed in note 3 to the Financial Statements. 
The Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities in relation to the 
accounts is set out on page 39.  The Statement by the Auditors on 
their responsibilities in respect of the accounts is contained in their 
report on page 76.  The Chairman of the Audit Committee will be 
available at the Annual General Meeting.  26

Directors’ remuneration report 
Carpetright plc Annual report and accounts 2013 
Dear Shareholder, 
This is my first full year as Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee, and I am pleased to present the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report for 2012/13 on behalf of the Board. 
During the year the key appointment was of Darren Shapland as 
Chief Executive and the separation of the roles of Chairman and 
Chief Executive.  Following this appointment and as part of the 
progressive handover of responsibilities, Lord Harris’s time 
commitment reduced to four days per week, and this reduced 
further to three days per week on 1 June 2013.  As a result Lord 
Harris’s remuneration has been reduced accordingly. 
The metrics used in Carpetright’s 2012/13 annual bonus and 2009 
long-term incentive (which became capable of vesting in 
September 2012) are based on financial measures (underlying 
profit before tax and growth in EPS respectively). 
The 2012/13 annual bonus was affected by difficult economic 
conditions which were off-set, in part, by self-help measures.  This 
resulted in payment at less than would have been paid for on-
target performance.  Annual bonuses for Executive Directors who 
served as Directors throughout the year will be approximately 29% 
of salary.  The Committee has also determined that the annual 
incentive arrangements for Executive Directors for the 2013/14 
financial year will be better aligned with the incentive 
arrangements with their colleagues in the UK who have a 
proportion of their bonuses linked to internal customer service 
targets, measured through UK mystery shopper visits. 
The financial performance in 2011/12 resulted in a  
determination that none of the lo ng-term incentive awards made  
in 2009 would vest and all awards made therefore lapsed.  
Although not finally determined, the results in the year under 
review are unlikely to result in any of the long-term incentive 
awards made in 2010 vesting. 
A benchmarking exercise of Executive Directors’ salaries was 
undertaken during the year which resulted in no pay increase  
for any of the Executive Directors. 
The Committee reviewed the Company’s long-term incentive 
arrangements during the year.  The Committee wants to reward  
the senior executive team for delivering a recovery in the Group’s 
performance as well as laying the foundations for long-term value 
to shareholders.  To that end the intention is to introduce a new 
Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’) at this year’s Annual General 
Meeting.  The performance targets which are proposed will enable 
senior executives to earn enhanced awards in return for meeting 
targets linked to the new strategy.  The Company has consulted its 
major shareholders on the proposed new arrangement. 
I will be available to answer any questions at the AGM in 
September and very much hope that you will support the 2012/13 
Directors’ Remuneration Report at our forthcoming meeting. 
Alan Dickinson 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee

Directors’ remuneration report 
This report is made by the Board on the recommendation of the 
Remuneration Committee and has been prepared in accordance 
with the UK Corporate Governance Code, relevant regulations and 
the relevant parts of the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority.  
The first part of the report provides details of the Remuneration 
Committee and remuneration policy.  The second part provides 
details of the remuneration, pensions and share plan interests of the 
Directors and former Directors who served as a Director of the 
Company during the 52 weeks ended 27 April 2013. 
Remuneration policy section 
The Committee’s policy is to provide remuneration packages for the 
Executive Directors which include an appropriate balance between 
the fixed and variable elements of pay, and which reflect their 
responsibilities relative to the size and nature of the business.   
It is committed to ensuring the management teams are rewarded for 
delivering the Company’s growth plans and long-term shareholder 
value.  The Committee aims to set levels of fixed pay that are 
competitive within the markets within which it competes for talent 
and short- and long-term incentive opportunities at levels that are 
sufficient to motivate Executives to achieve the Company’s short- 
and long-term goals without encouraging inappropriate behaviours.  
The remuneration strategy ensures that a significant element of 
Executives’ remuneration remains ‘at risk’. 
In line with the Association of British Insurers’ Guidelines on 
Responsible Investment Disclosure, the Committee will ensure  
that the incentive structure for Executive Directors and senior 
management will not raise environmental, social or governance  
risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour.  More 
generally, the Committee will ensure that the overall remuneration 
policy does not encourage inappropriate operational risk-taking. 
Components of remuneration 
The main remuneration components for the Executive Directors 
comprise basic salary, pensions, benefits and incentive plans, which 
are set out below: 
i) Basic salary 
Basic salary for each Executive Director and other Senior  
Executives is determined by the Committee, taking account of the 
responsibilities, performance and experience of the individual.  A 
benchmarking exercise was carried out in the period in relation to 
the Executive Directors and other Senior Executives.  The 
Remuneration Committee took account of market trends in 
reviewing basic salaries.  When reviewing the salaries of the 
Executive Directors, the Committee also has regard to the impact on 
the cost of pension provision and pay and conditions elsewhere in 
the Group.  In particular, the Committee takes account of the level of 
salary increases awarded to other employees of the Group when 
deciding on increases for Executive Directors. 
   27

Business review Governance Financial statements

www.carpetright.plc.uk 
Governance Business review Financial statements 
Executive Directors’ basic salaries have been reviewed and no 
increase is to take place in 2013.  The current salaries of the 
Executive Directors are as follows: 
 Current base salary
Darren Shapland £450,000
Neil Page £280,000
Martin Harris £280,000
The combined annual salary increase for all colleagues and 
management was 1.3%. 
ii) Pensions  
Darren Shapland and Martin Harris are deferred members of the 
Carpetright plc Pension Plan, which is a defined benefit scheme  
and closed to future accrual from 30 April 2010.  Lord Harris 
receives a pension under the plan.  Executive Directors are offered 
an allowance of 20% of their base salary to fund their own pension 
provision.  The individual is able to choose whether this allowance  
is paid to the Company’s defined contribution Group Personal 
Pension Plan (‘GPPP’) or receive the allowance by way of a salary 
supplement.  Darren Shapland and Martin Harris each receive  
their allowance as a salary supplement.  Neil Page splits his 
allowance between a contribution to the GPPP scheme and a 
salary supplement. 
iii) Benefits 
The Executive Directors are eligible for car benefits, life assurance 
and private medical cover. 
iv) Annual incentives 
Executive Directors are eligible to receive an annual performance 
bonus which is a proportion of sa lary based on the achievement of 
the annual budgeted underlying profit.   
The maximum bonus opportunity for Executive Directors in  
respect of the 2013/14 financial year is 100% (2012/13: 100%) of 
basic salary, with 40% (2012/13: 30%) of salary payable for on-target 
performance.  90% of the 2013/14 bonus will be dependent on 
underlying profit before tax targets.  The target at which minimum 
bonus is payable has been set at a level in excess of the underlying 
profit before tax achieved in 2012/13.  The remaining 10% of the 
bonus will be determined by reference to an internal customer 
service targets, measured through UK mystery shopper visits.  This 
aligns the reward of the Executive directors with the rest of their 
colleagues in the United Kingdom. 
Where bonuses are paid, they are paid in cash and do not form  
part of the Directors’ pensionable earnings.  Subject to the discretion 
of the Committee, bonuses may be clawed back where the financial 
results have been materially misstated, where an error has been 
made in assessing the size of the bonus or where the individual had 
committed an act of gross misconduct in respect of the relevant 
financial year. 
v) Long-term incentives 
Executive Directors and other Senior Executives are eligible to 
participate in the Company’s Long Term Incentive Plan (the ‘LTIP’).  
Awards under the LTIP consist of conditional awards of shares that 
vest three years after grant to the extent that performance conditions 
have been met over a three year performance period. 
Awards made in 2012 to Executive Directors (excluding Lord Harris 
who declined his award) were made at 100% of salary. 
Lord Harris has not been eligible to receive future awards since 
ceasing to be Chief Executive.  It is the Company’s policy that 
awards under the LTIP will be satisfied using shares purchased in 
the market or by new issue shares, provided that the use of new  
issue shares will not breach the rules of the scheme. 
At the time of Darren Shapland’s recruitment as Chief Executive,  
the Committee undertook to introduce a revised long-term 
incentive arrangement to focus Darren and the other members of 
the senior executive team on delivering not only a recovery in Group 
performance but also to drive long-term value for shareholders.   
The intention was that this should enable senior executives to earn 
enhanced awards in return for meeting targets linked to the new 
strategy.  The Company has consulted its major shareholders on  
the proposed new arrangement, and a new Performance Share  
Plan (‘PSP’) will be proposed for adoption at this year’s Annual 
General Meeting. 
Awards under the new plan will continue to consist of annual grants 
of performance shares that vest three years after grant subject to the 
extent that performance targets have been achieved.  However, in 
order to tie-in with the new strategy and the commitments made to 
Darren Shapland at the time of his appointment award levels over 
the first two years of the scheme’s operation, when the importance of 
the implementation of the revised strategy is most critical, will be 
increased before reverting to a lower normal level of award for 
future years. 
The scheme will reflect current market and best practice, while being 
appropriately tailored to the Company’s specific circumstances. 
Providing the scheme is approved by shareholders, annual awards of 
performance shares may be made to Executive Directors and other 
members of the Executive Committee with a market value of shares 
at grant of 250% of salary for the first two years of the PSP’s 
operation and a normal limit of 150% of salary is expected to apply 
thereafter (i.e. from 2015).  Lower percentages of salary would apply 
to less senior roles, again with enhanced award levels in the first two 
years.  After the first two years, awards with a market value of up to 
250% of salary could be made in exceptional circumstances under 
the PSP.  The current maximum in the 2004 LTIP is 300% of salary 
but the Committee’s policy in recent years has been to make awards 
up to a maximum of 100% of salary. 28
Carpetright plc Annual report and accounts 2013
28 
Governance continued 
Directors’ remuneration report continued 
Carpetright plc Annual report and accounts 2013 
Awards will vest after a three year period to the extent performance 
conditions have been achieved.  Vesting of awards made under the 
LTIP have been subject to performance targets set by reference to 
the Company’s Earnings Per Share.  The 2013 and 2014 awards 
under the new PSP will also be subject to an earnings based 
performance metric which will be cumulative underlying profit 
before tax.  In reaching this decision the Committee considered 
other metrics such as relative and absolute Total Shareholder  
Return but found there was insufficient correlation between the 
performance of the business and the returns generated.  
Consequently underlying profit before tax was selected as it is 
considered by the Committee to be the metric most relevant to the 
Company’s business.  Performance against this target will be fully 
disclosed in future annual reports.  In future years, the Committee 
would be able to set different targets provided that it reasonably 
concludes that these are no less challenging in the circumstances 
than the targets set for the initial awards. 
The Committee decided to measure performance on a cumulative 
basis in order to ensure consistent enhanced performance as well as, 
given the current economic uncertainty, reducing the risk that a 
change in economic conditions in a single year of the performance 
period will unduly influence performance against the targets. 
The proposed targets for the awards to be made in 2013 are that if 
cumulative underlying profit before tax over the three-year 
measurement period is £60m then 10% of the award will vest, if it is 
£75m then 100% of the award will vest, and there would be vesting 
on a straight line basis between the two points.  
vi) Service contracts  
It is the Company’s policy to employ Executive Directors under 
contracts with an indefinite term subject to termination by notice 
given by either party, normally of 12 months.  If the Company 
terminates employment without giving full notice to the Director, 
the Company has the option to either: 
• pay damages calculated by reference to common law principles, 
including an obligation on the Director to mitigate loss; or  
• to make a payment in lieu of notice calculated by reference to 
basic salary and benefits only.  This payment would be reduced or 
terminated if alternative employment was secured during the 
notice period and there is a requirement to mitigate loss. 
The Executive Directors’ service contracts became effective on the 
following dates: 
Contract date Notice period
Darren Shapland 11 May 2012 12 months
Martin Harris 27 January 2011 12 months
Neil Page 2 March 2009 12 months
Outside appointments of the Chairman and 
Executive Directors 
Executive Directors retain remuneration from outside non-
executive directorships.  During the year Lord Harris’s directors’  
fees payable by Arsenal Holdings plc were waived and paid directly 
by Arsenal to charity. 
Darren Shapland received a fee at a rate of £150,000 per annum  
in respect of his role as Chairman of Sainsburys Bank plc; his 
commitment of one day per week ceased in February 2013.   
Darren Shapland also receives a fee at a rate of £60,000 per annum  
as a Non-Executive Director of Ladbrokes plc. 
Shareholding guidelines 
Share ownership guidelines exist to create greater alignment with  
the interests of shareholders and to be consistent with one of the 
objectives of the incentive framework.  All Executive Directors 
should build up a shareholding in the Company equal to their 
annual basic salary and maintain it thereafter by the retention of 
shares with a value equal to 50% on the net of taxes gain on their 
vested long-term incentives subject always to their individual 
circumstances.  At the year end the holdings of Lord Harris and 
Martin Harris were above this level.  Neil Page held 10,029 shares 
which, based on the year end shar e price of 635p, represented 23%  
of his salary.  Darren Shapland held 25,419 shares which, based on 
the year end share price of 635p , represented 36% of his salary.

The fees of the Chairman are determined by the Remuneration Co mmittee.  Non-Executive Directors’ fees are determined by the Exe cutive 
Directors.  These fees are set with refere nce to external data on fee levels in similar businesses, having taken account of the responsibilities of 
individual Directors and their expected annual time commitment.  The Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors are not eligible for any of 
the Company’s variable pay arrangements.  The Chairman is entitled to car benefits, life assurance and private medical cover.  The Non-
Executive Directors receive no benefits. 
The fees of the Non-Executive Directors were last reviewed in May 2012.  The base fees for Non-Executive Directors are £39,000 p.a.  The fees 
of Baroness Noakes are £60,000 to take account of her role as Deputy Chairman, membership of all Board Committees, chairing the 
Nomination Committee and her role as the Seni or Independent Director.  The fees for chairing each Committee are £5,000 per chair.  The fees 
for Lord Harris were reduced from £300,000 p.a. to £225,000 p.a. with effect from 1 June 2013 to reflect a reduction in time co mmitment from 
four to three days per week.

1. Highest paid Director. 
2. The Recruitment LTIP buyout was paid in respect of LTIPs that lapsed from previous employment as a result of joining the Com pany.  The net proceeds were subscribed for shares 
in the Company. 
3. The bonus will be paid in July 2013, and relates to the financial year 2012/13. 
4. Paid by subsidiary companies in Euros.  The average exchange rate of €1.23:£1 has been used for the financial year 2012/13 a nd the average exchange rate of €1.16:£1 was used for the 
financial year 2011/12. 
5. Claire Balmforth and Andy Corden stepped down from the Board on 11 May 2012.  They both remain senior executives on their pr evious contract terms.  Their full annual 
remuneration is disclosed. 
6. The amounts received post-termination in the year relate to Christian Sollesse, whose final payment was made in June 2012.  The payment includes amounts paid in lieu of salary 
(£24k), Pension and pension supplement (£7k) holiday pay and other benefits (£36k).  Payments were made monthly, subject to mit igation, and continued to June 2012. 
ii) 2012/13 annual bonus 
The Committee reviewed the levels of bonus opportunity for the Executive Directors for the 2012/13 financial year in the light of the challenging 
trading environment and concluded that it would be appropriate to retain the percentage of salary payable for maximum at 100% o f salary. 
The performance targets for 2012/13 were set by reference to budgeted levels of underlying profit before tax.  The targets for the UK and the 
Group were partly achieved, but targets were no t achieved for the Rest of Europe.  The bonus for Andy Corden and Claire Balmforth, the 
Operations Directors for the Rest of Europe and the UK respective ly, both of whom stepped down from the Board in May 2012 but r etain 
their executive responsibilities, was based as to 50% on the Rest of Europe and UK performance respectively and 50% on Group pe rformance.  
The bonus for the other Directors was ba sed exclusively on Group performance.  
Consequently a bonus will be paid in 2013 (2012: nil) to the Executive Directors who served during the period.  Where bonuses a re paid, they 
are paid in cash and do not form part of the Directors’ pensionable earnings.  The Group targets for the 2012/13 financial year were set such 
that no bonus would be paid unless the underlying profit before tax exceeded that achieved in the prior financial year by 50%.  The Group 
targets were as follows, with straight-line vesting between a Group underl ying profit before tax of £6m and £20m: 
Underlying profit before tax Proportion of maximum bonus
Less than £6m 0%
£6m 10%
£20m 100%
The targets for the Rest of Europe and the UK are commercially sensitive and have not been disclosed. 
As a result of the performance achieved in the year bonuses of between 14% and 42% of salary will be paid in 2013 (2012: nil) t o the Executive 
Directors who served during the period.  These bonuses will be paid in cash and do not form part of the Directors’ pensionable earnings.  33

1. This award was made under rule 9.4.2 of the Listing Rules.  The share price used was the same share price as was used for th e awards made in September 2011 and the terms are 
identical to those of the 2011 awards. 
2. The 2010 awards are measured by reference to a percentage growth in underlying EPS.  This translates to none of the 2010 awa rds vest if underlying EPS is less than 51.3p in the 
financial year 2012/13.  If underlying EPS is 51.3 then 25% of the award vests and if EPS is 77.7p all of the award vests.  For growth between these two points between 25% and 100% 
vests on a sliding scale. 
3. The 2011 awards are measured by reference to a percentage growth in underlying EPS.  This translates to none of the 2011 awa rds vest if underlying EPS is less than 21.1p in the 
financial year 2013/14.  If underlying EPS is 21.1p then 25% of the award vests and if EPS is 24.0p all of the award vests.  Fo r growth between these two points between 25% and 100% 
vests on a sliding scale. 
4. None of the 2012 awards vest if underlying EPS is less than 21.1p in the financial year 2014/ 15.  If underlying EPS is 21.1p then 25% of the award vests and if EPS is 24.0p all of the 
award vests.  For growth between these two points between 25% and 100% vests on a sliding scale. 
5. Andy Corden’s award in 2010 was made on a phantom basis such that a payment will be made based upon the market value of a sh are, rather than receiving shares. 
6. Neither the 2010 conditional award nor the 2011 conditional award is currently expected to vest.

Significant agreements – change of control 
There are a number of agreements that take effect, alter or termi nate upon a change of control of the Company following a takeo ver bid,  
such as bank loan agreements and employee share plans.  None of these are deemed to be significant in terms of their potential impact on  
the business of the Group as a whole except for: 
• a term loan and revolving facilities agreement dated 19 March 2008, as amended and restated most recently on 27 June 2011, for term  
loans of €14m and £22m and a revolving credit facility of £45m, which provides that on a change of control all lenders’ commitm ents are 
cancelled and all outstanding loans, together with accrued interest, will become immediately due and payable.  Details of balan ce at the 
financial year end can be found at note 23 to the consolidated financial statements; and 
• under the Company’s all-employee and discretionary share schemes, a change of control of the Company would normally be a vestin g 
event, facilitating the exercise or transfer of awards, subject to any relevant performance conditions being satisfied. 
The Company does not have agreements with an y Director or officer that would provide co mpensation for loss of office or employm ent 
resulting from a takeover, except that provisions in the Company’s share plans may cause options and awards granted under such plans to vest 
on a takeover. 
There is no information that the Company would be required to disclose about persons with whom it has contractual or other arra ngements 
which are essential to the business of the Company. 
Share capital 
Details of the Company’s issued share capital can be found in note 24 to the consolidated financial statements.  All of the Com pany’s issued 
ordinary shares are fully paid up and rank equally in all respects. 
The rights and obligations attaching to the Company’s ordinary sh ares, in addition to those conf erred on their holders by law, are contained in 
the Company’s Articles of Association, copies of which can be obtained from Companies House in the UK or by writing to the Comp any 
Secretary.  The holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive the Company’s report and accounts, to attend and speak at ge neral meetings 
of the Company, to appoint proxies and to exercise voting rights. 
There are no restrictions on the transfer of ordinary shares or on the exercise of voting rights attached to them, except (i) w here the Company 
has exercised its right to suspend their voting rights or to prohibit their transfer following the omission of their holder or any person interested 
in them to provide the Company with information requested by it in accordance with Part 22 of the Companies Act 2006 or (ii) wh ere their 
holder is precluded from exercising voting rights by the FSA’s Listing Rules or the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers. 
The Company is not aware of any agreements between shareholders th at might result in the restriction of transfer or voting righ ts in relation 
to the shares held by such shareholders. 
Shares acquired through Carpetright’s employee share schemes rank equally with all other ordinary shares in issue and have no s pecial rights.  
The Trustee of the Company’s Employee Benefit Trust (‘EBT’) has wa ived its rights to dividends on shares held by the EBT and do es not 
exercise its right to vote in respect of such shares.  Shares he ld in trust on behalf of partic ipants in the All Employee Share Ownership Plan are 
voted by the Trustee as directed by the pa rticipants.  Details of share-based payments, including information regarding the shares held by the 
EBT, can be found in notes 24 and 25 to the financial statements on pages 70 to 72.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, th e Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable laws and regulations. 
UK company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statem ents for each financial year.  Under that law the Directors have prepared 
the Group and Parent Company financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as ado pted by 
the European Union.  The financial statemen ts are required by law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the C ompany and the 
Group and of the profit or loss of the Company and Group for that period. 
In preparing those financial statements, the Directors are required to: 
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
• make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
• state that the financial statements comply with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and 
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis, unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group will continue in business, 
in which case there should be supporting assumptions or qualifications as necessary. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping prop er accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the fina ncial position 
of the Company and the Group and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements and the Directors’ Remuneration Report comply 
with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.  They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence fo r taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information on the Company’s web sites.  
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of fina ncial statements may differ from legislation in  
other jurisdictions. 
Going concern  
The Directors confirm that, after reviewing expenditure commitments, expected cash flows and borrowing facilities, they have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resource s to continue in operational existence for the next financial year and the 
foreseeable future.  For this reason they continue to adopt th e going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.  Further details of the 
Group’s liquidity are given in the financial review on page 14. 
Disclosure of information to auditors 
Each of the Directors of the Company has confirmed that, as far as they are aware, there is no relevant audit information of wh ich the auditors 
are unaware and that each Director has taken all steps to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establ ish that the 
Company’s auditors are aware of that information. 
Responsibility Statement 
Each of the Directors whose names and details are set out on page 20 of this report confirms that to the best of their knowledg e: 
• the financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and 
• the business review, which is incorporated into the Directors’ report, includes a fair review of the development and performanc e of the 
business and the position of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a d escription 
of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face. 
This Director’s Report, including the Statement of Direct ors’ responsibilities, has been approved by the Board.

Notes to the accounts 
 Carpetright plc Annual report and accounts 2013 
1.  Principal accounting policies 
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below.  The se policies have 
been consistently applied to all the years presented unless otherwise stated. 
General information 
Carpetright plc (‘the Company’) and its subs idiaries (together, ‘the Group’) are retail ers of floor coverings and beds.  The Co mpany is listed  
on the London Stock Exchange and incorporated in England and Wales and domiciled in the United Kingdom.  The address of its reg istered 
office is Harris House, Purfleet Bypass, Purfleet, Essex, RM19 1TT. 
The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in the Business Review on pages 1 to 17. 
Basis of preparation 
The financial statements of the Group are dr awn up to within seven days of the accounting record date being 30 April of each ye ar.   
The financial year for 2013 represents the 52 weeks ended 27 April 2013.  The comparative financial year for 2012 was 52 weeks ended  
28 April 2012. 
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and Internat ional 
Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) interpretations endorsed by the European Union, together with those parts of  
the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for pension assets and liabilities and share based 
payments which are measured at fair value.  The principal accounti ng policies set out below have been consistently applied to a ll periods 
presented unless otherwise stated. 
The Company has elected to take the exemption under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its profit and loss ac count.  
The loss for the Company for the period was £7.8m (2012: profit of £19.7m). 
New and amended accounting standards 
The following new standards and amendments to standards, which ar e mandatory for the first time in the financial year beginning  
29 April 2012, are relevant for the Group but have not had a material impact in the current financial year: 
• IFRS 7 (revised) ‘Financial instruments: disclosures’ – disclosure on transfer of financial assets. 
• IAS 12 ‘Income taxes’ – accounting for investment properties. 
• IAS 32 ‘Financial instruments: presentation’. 
At 27 April 2013 the following new standa rds and interpretations and amendments to exis ting standards which are expected to be relevant  
to the Group and have an immaterial impact on the fi nancial statements, were issued but not yet effective: 
• IFRS 7 (amendment) ‘Financial instruments’ – disclosures on offsetting (effective from 1 January 2013).  
• IFRS 9 (reissued) ‘Financial instruments’ (effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2015).  The standard sets out how an entity 
should classify and measure financial assets, as well as the derecognition of financial instruments.  The Group will apply IFRS 9 when it 
becomes effective and is endorsed by the EU. 
• IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated financial statements’ (effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013). 
• IFRS 12 ‘Disclosures of interest in other entities’ (effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013). 
• IFRS 13 ‘Fair value measurement’ (effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013). 
• IAS 1 (amendment) ‘Presentation of financial statements’ (effective for periods beginning on or after 1 July 2012).  The amendm ent changes 
the presentation of the Statement of other comprehensive income.

Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements include the Company and its subsidiary undertakings.  The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted  
for using the purchase method.  The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of in the period are included in the consolidated income 
statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal respectively. 
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains or losses on transactions between Group companies are eliminated.   
Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consis tency with the policies adopted by the Gr oup. 
Exchange differences 
The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds Sterling, which is the Company’s functional and presentational cu rrency.  
Transactions in foreign currencies, which are those other than the functional currency of an entity, are recorded at the openin g rate for the 
month in which the transaction occurs which is used as a reasonab le approximation to the rate at the transaction date.  Monetar y assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.  Resulting exchange g ains or losses are 
recognised in the income statement for the period except where they are part of a net foreign investment hedge when they are re cognised  
in equity. 
On consolidation the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet 
date.  Income and expenses of foreign operations are translated at the average rate during the period.  Differences on translation are recognised 
as a separate component of equity.  On di sposal of a foreign operation the cumulative exchange differences for that operation are recognised  
in the income statement as part of the profit or loss on disposal. 
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of that operation and 
are translated at the rate ruling at the balance sheet date. 
Segment reporting 
Segmental information is presented using a ‘management approach’ on the same basis as that used for internal reporting to the C hief 
Operating decision maker.  The Chief Operating decision maker, who is responsible for resource allocation and assessing perform ance  
of the operating segments, has been identified as the Executive Committee. 
Revenue 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration receiv ed or receivable for the provision of goods and services to cu stomers outside 
the Group net of returns, sales allowances and value added and ot her sales based taxes.  Revenue from goods and services is rec ognised at the 
point the Group fulfils its commercial obligations to the customer, the revenue and costs in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably 
and collectability is reasonably assured. 
Share based payments 
The Group issues equity-settled share based payments to certain employees.  The fair value of the employee services received in exchange  
for the grant of options is recognised as an expense and is calculated using Black-Scholes model.  The value of the charge is a djusted to reflect 
expected and actual levels of options vesting.  The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by refere nce to the fair 
value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any service and performance conditions that are included in the assumptio ns about the 
number of options which are expected to become exercisable. 
At each balance sheet date the Group revises its estimates of the number of options which are expected to become exercisable.   
It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the income statement and a corresponding adjustment to equity  
over the vesting period. 
Impairment 
Assets that have an indefinite useful life, for example goodwill, are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for i mpairment.  Assets 
that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for indications of impairment at each balance sheet date.  If there is an indicat ion of impairment 
the recoverable amount of either the asset or the cash-generating unit to which it belongs is estimated.  Cash-generating units are used where 
an individual asset does not generate cash flows which are independent of other assets.  The recoverable amount of a non-financ ial asset is the 
higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.  Value in use is the present value of the future cash flows e xpected to be derived 
from the asset or cash-generating unit. 
An impairment loss is recognised in the in come statement whenever the carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating unit excee ds its 
recoverable amount.  Non-financial assets other than goodwill that suffer an impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of i mpairment  
at each reporting date.

Other operating income 
Rental income earned on investment property is recognised in other operating income, in accordance with the substance of the re levant  
rental agreements. 
Profits or losses on the disposal of property, plant and equi pment represent the difference between the net proceeds and the ne t carrying  
value at the date of sale.  Disposals are accounted for when there has been an unconditional exchange of contracts except where payment  
or completion is expected to occur significantly after exchange. 
Exceptional items 
Profits/losses on property disposals and non-recurring transactions which are material by virtue of their size or incidence suc h as major 
reorganisation costs, onerous leases and impairments are disclosed as exceptional items. 
Tax 
Current tax liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be paid, based on tax rates and laws that are enacted or substan tively enacted  
at the balance sheet date in the countries where the Company’s subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income. 
Deferred tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and 
their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes is accoun ted for using the balance sheet liability method.  Deferred tax liabilities are 
generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences, and defe rred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable 
profits will be available against which deductible temporary differen ces can be utilised. 
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a 
business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.  Deferred 
tax is calculated at the rates of tax that are expected to appl y when the asset or liability is settled, based on tax rates tha t have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date, and is not discounted. 
Tax is charged or credited directly to equity if it relates to items that are credited or charged to equity; otherwise, it is r ecognised in the  
income statement. 
Dividends 
Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the period in w hich the 
dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders or, in the case of interim dividends, paid. 
Goodwill 
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable a ssets of the acquired 
entity.  Goodwill is not amortised, but is reviewed for impairment at least annually.  Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income 
statement and is not subsequently reversed.  On disposal of a subsidiary the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination 
of the profit or loss on disposal. 
Other intangible assets 
Purchased brand names and other intangible assets are capitalised at cost.  Acquired software licences and software development costs are 
capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific software. 
Amortisation of intangible assets is calculated to write off the cost of the asset, on a straight line basis, over its expected useful life.   
The expected useful lives generally applicable are: 
Brands    20 years 
Computer software  5 to 10 years

Governance Business review Financial statements 
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is shown at cost less accumulate d depreciation and any provisions for impairment in value. 
Depreciation is provided to write down the cost of property, plant and equipment, on a straight line basis, to their estimated residual  
values over their estimated useful lives.  Freehold land is not depreciated.  The estimated useful lives and residual values of assets are  
reviewed annually. 
The estimated useful lives by asset category that are generally applicable are: 
Freehold and long leasehold buildings 50 years
Short leasehold buildings The shorter of the period of the lease and the estimated useful life 
Fixtures and fittings 7 to 15 years
Computers 5 to 7 years
Motor vehicles 4 years
Other plant and machinery 7 to 10 years
Borrowing costs 
Gross interest costs incurred on the financin g of major projects are capitalised until the time that they are available for use .  Unless a specific 
borrowing is taken out to finance the asset, interest is capitalised using the weighted average interest rate of all non specif ic borrowings.   
Where a specific borrowing is taken out to finance the asset, in terest is capitalised at the rate applicable to that borrowing. 
Investment property 
Property that is held to earn rental income and for capital appreciation is separately disclosed as investment property.  Inves tment property  
is carried at depreciated historical cost.  Depreciation rates and useful lives of investment property are the same as those fo r property, plant  
and equipment. 
Leasing commitments 
Leases are classified as finance leases wh ere the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of owners hip to the Group.   
All other leases are classified as operating leases. 
Assets used by the Group which have been funded through finance leases are capitalised in property, plant and equipment and the resulting 
lease obligations are included in payables.  The assets are depr eciated over the shorter of thei r useful lives and the period of the lease.  The 
interest element of the rental obligations is charged to the income statement over th e period of the lease and represents a con stant proportion 
of the balance of capital repayments outstanding. 
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.  Premiums p ayable,  
rent free periods and contributions receivable on entering an oper ating lease are charged or credited to income on a straight l ine basis  
over the lease term. 
Investment in subsidiaries 
The Company’s investment in subsidiary undertakings is recognised at cost and is acco unted for net of impairment losses.  Incom e from 
investments is recognised in the income st atement to the extent that post acquisition profits are received.  Distributions of p re-acquisition 
profits reduce the cost of the investment. 
Inventories 
Inventories are valued at the lower of weighted average cost and net realisable value.  Net realisable value is based on estima ted selling prices 
less further costs to be incurred to dispos al.  Provisions are made for obsolescence, mark down and shrinkage based on actual l osses, ageing  
of inventories and sales trends. 
Rebates receivable from suppliers 
Volume related rebates receivable from suppliers are credited to the carrying value of the inventory to which they relate.  Whe re a rebate 
agreement with a supplier covers more than one year, the rebates are recognised in the period in which they are earned. 
Trade receivables and payables 
Trade receivables and payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently adjusted to the amount receivable or pay able.   
Receivables are stated net of a provision for impairment.

Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, cash at bank, deposits repayable on demand and highly liquid investments.   
For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equi valents also includes bank overdrafts which are shown within bor rowings  
and overdrafts in current liabilities on the balance sheet. 
Bank loans and overdrafts 
Bank loans and overdrafts are initially recognised at fair valu e less directly attributable transaction costs and are subsequen tly measured  
at amortised cost using the effective interest rate model. 
Provisions 
A provision is recognised where the Group has a legal or constructi ve obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an  
outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.  Provisions are calculated on a discounted basis when a ppropriate. 
Retirement benefit obligation 
The Group operates defined benefit and defined contribution schemes and also participates in a multi-employer pension scheme in respect  
of its employees in the Netherlands.  The assets and liabilities of all schemes are held separately from those of the Group.  T he Group is  
unable to identify its share of the assets and liabilities of the multi-employer scheme and, therefore, accounts for this schem e as a defined 
contribution scheme. 
The cost of providing benefits under the de fined benefit schemes is determined using th e projected unit credit method, with act uarial 
valuations being carried out at each balanc e sheet date.  The net retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents  
the present value of the defined benefit ob ligation less the fair value of the sc heme assets at the balance sheet date. 
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full, directly in eq uity in the period in which they occur and are presented in ot her comprehensive 
income.  Other income and expenses associat ed with the defined benefit scheme are reco gnised in the income statement.  The pens ion cost of 
defined contribution schemes is charged in the income statement as incurred. 
Financial instruments 
Hedge accounting 
The Group hedges net investments in foreign entities through currency borrowings, the gains or losses on the retranslation of the borrowings 
are recognised in equity. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expi res or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifie s for hedge 
accounting.  At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument previously recognised in equity is retained in equity until  
the hedged transaction occurs.  If the hedged transaction is no lo nger expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recog nised in equity  
is then transferred to the income statement. 
Critical estimates and judgements 
The preparation of consolidated financial statements under IFRS requires the Group to make estimates and assumptions that affec t the 
application of policies and reported amounts.  Estimates and ju dgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical e xperience  
and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.  Actual results may  
differ from these estimates.  The estimates and assumptions which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to t he carrying 
amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below: 
Impairment of goodwill 
The Group is required to test whether goodwi ll has suffered any impairment.  The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units h ave been 
determined based on value in use calculations.  The use of this method requires the estimation of future cash flows expected to arise from the 
continuing operation of the cash-generating unit and the choice of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present v alue.  Actual 
outcomes could vary significantly from these estimates. 
Impairment of assets 
Property, plant and equipment is reviewed for impairment if even ts or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amoun t may not  
be recoverable.  When a review for impairment is conducted, the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is deter mined based 
on value in use calculations prepared on the basis of management’s assumptions and estimates. 
Retirement benefits 
The present value of the defined benefit liabilities recognised in the balance sheet is dependent on the interest rates of high -quality corporate 
bonds.  The net financing charge is dependent on both the interest rates of high quality corporate bonds and the assumed invest ment returns 
on scheme assets.  Other key assumptions for pension obligations, including mortality rates, are based in part on current marke t conditions. 49

The Finance Act 2012 included legislation to reduce the main rate of corporation tax from 26% to 24% from 1 April 2012 and to 2 3% from  
1 April 2013.  The reduction from 24% to 23% was substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and has therefore been reflect ed in these 
Group financial statements. 
In addition to the changes in the corporation tax disclosed abov e, it was announced in the December 2012 Budget Statement that the rate 
would be reduced from 23% to 21% from 1 April 2014 and in the March 2013 Budget Statement it was announced that the rate would be 
further reduced to 20% from 1 April 2015.  These further rate re ductions had not been substantively enacted at the balance shee t date and  
are therefore not reflected in these Group financial statements. 
The proposed reductions of the main rate of corporation tax to 21% and 20% by 1 April 2014 and 1 April 2015, respectively, are expected  
to be enacted separately each year.  The combined effect would be to reduce the net deferred tax liability provided at 27 April 2013 by £2.4m.

The Directors decided that no final dividend will be paid (2012: No final dividend paid).  This results in no dividend in the y ear to  
27 April 2013 (2012: No dividend paid). 
9.  Earnings per share 
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing earnings at tributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary 
shares in issue during the period, excluding those held by Equity Trust (Jersey) Limi ted (see note 25) which are treated as can celled. 
In order to compute diluted earnings per shar e, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume c onversion  
of all potentially dilutive ordinary shar es.  Those share options granted to employees and Executive Directors where the exerci se price is less 
than the average market price of the Company’s ordinary shares during the period represent potentially dilutive ordinary shares .

Goodwill is not amortised.  Instead it is subject to an impairment review at each reporting date or more frequently if there is an indication  
that it may be impaired.  Other intangibles are amortised and also tested for impairment when there is an indication that the a sset may be 
impaired.  Goodwill impairment, intangible amortisation and impairment and reversals thereof are recognised in full in administration 
expenses in the income statement during the period in which they are identified. 
Group goodwill comprises purchased goodwill in respect of the following business acquisitions:

Goodwill is impaired if the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount.  The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs  
to sell and the value in use.  In the absence of a recent market transaction the recoverable amount of the goodwill held by the Group is 
determined from value in use calculations.  These calculations are based on 10 year profit projections, the same period used by the Group for 
appraising the potential of business acquisitions, adjusted for non-cash items, planned working capital movements and capital e xpenditure. 
The cash flow projections for the initial five year period are based on financial budgets and plans approved by the Board.  The key drivers are 
like-for-like sales growth, gross margin percentage and anticipated cost inflation.  Cash flows beyond the five year plan perio d are extrapolated 
at a constant growth rate of 2.5% (2012: 2.5%) and a terminal valu e is included at five times year 10 EBITDA.  The growth rate is in line with 
long term growth rates of the countries in which the Group operates.  The pre-tax discount rate applied to cash flow projection s is 7.7%  
(2012: 8.0%) and is based on the Group’s weighted average cost of capital adjusted to reflect the risks of the businesses acqui red.  Based  
on these calculations goodwill is not impaired.  An increase of 1% in the discount rate would not lead to an impairment of good will.

22.  Retirement benefit obligations 
The Group operates a variety of pension schemes, principally in the UK, the Netherlands and Belgium.  They comprise defined ben efit 
schemes where benefits are based on employees’ length of service and average final salary, and defined contribution schemes whe re the 
employer company pays a set contribution to the scheme.  The UK defined benefit schemes referred to in 22 (i) (a) and the first two defined 
contribution schemes referred to in 22 (ii) are accounted for by the Company. 
(i) Defined benefit schemes 
(a) UK defined benefit schemes 
The Company operated a funded defined benefit pension scheme providing benefits based on final pensionable pay for its employee s and  
has assumed the liability for the scheme previously operated by Storey Carpets Ltd (Storeys).  The Company scheme was closed to defined 
benefit service accrual on 30 April 2010 and has been closed to new members since 31 March 2006.  The scheme previously operate d by 
Storeys is also closed to new members and has no active members.  The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of t he Company.  
The assets of the Company scheme are invest ed in a Managed Fund operated by a fund management company.  Contributions are determined 
by a qualified actuary using the projected unit method.  The most recent actuarial review was at 6 April 2011 when the actuaria l value of the 
assets represented 77% of the benefits acc rued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.  A deficit reduction plan 
has been agreed with the Trustees under which £0.6m was paid in the year (2012: £0.6m). 
The assets of the Storeys scheme are held in independently managed funds.  The most recent actuarial review of the Storeys sche me was at  
1 March 2011 when the actuarial value of th e assets represented 90% of the benefits accrued to members.  A deficit reduction pl an has been 
agreed with the Trustees under which £0.2 m was paid in the year (2012: £0.1m). 
The assets and liabilities of the schemes were valued on an IAS 19 basis at 27 April 2013 by a qualified actuary.  The numbers set out below  
are the aggregate of the two schemes. 
1) Key assumptions used: 
  
2013 
% 
2012 
% 
RPI inflation 3.4 2.8
Discount rate 4.2 4.6 
Deferred pension revaluation 2.8 2.2 
Expected return on scheme assets 4.4 5.2 
The assumptions used by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale 
covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.  The assump tions used for future life expectancy of members of the schem e are derived 
from industry dates and standard tables.  Specifically the S1N MA table (2012: S1NMA table) with medium cohort improvement has been  
used for male pensioners and the S1NFA table (2012: S1NFA table) with medium cohort improvement for female pensioners projected by 
year of birth. 
The most significant assumptions are the expected return on scheme assets and the discount rate, of which the most sensitive as sumption  
is the discount rate.  If this assumption increased or decreased by 0.1% the defined benefit obligation would change by £0.4m ( 2012: £0.2m). 
2) The amount included in the balance sheet arising from the Group’s and Company’s obligations in respect of the defined benefi t scheme is

Employer contributions of £0.9m are expected to be paid into these pension schemes during the financial year 2013/14. 
(b) Multi-employer scheme 
The Group’s Dutch subsidiary participates in a multi-employer run industry pension scheme which has arrangements similar to tho se of  
a defined benefit scheme.  It is not possible to identify the Group’s share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the sch eme, and therefore  
in accordance with IAS 19, the Group has taken the exemption for multi-employer pension schemes not to disclose pension scheme assets  
and liabilities.  Accordingly, although this scheme is a defined benefit scheme it is treated as a defined contribution scheme recognising  
the contributions payable in each period in the income statement.  Under the terms of the scheme the scheme deficit is recovere d through 
increased contributions from participating members.  At the period end the Group was unable to obtain a valuation of the indust ry  
scheme’s full surplus or deficit.  Contributions charged to the income statement amounted to £1.1m (2012: £1.3m). 
(ii) Defined contribution schemes 
The Company launched a Group Personal Pension Plan in April 2006.  Contributions made by employees are matched by the Company  
to an upper limit.  The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Company and are invested by Scottish Life.  Contributions  
for the period amounted to £0.9m (2012: £1.0m). 
In addition, the Group operates defined contribution pension schemes for subsidiary companies in Belgium and the Netherlands.  The Group 
makes contributions into the schemes, the assets of which are held separately from those of the Group and are invested by local insurance 
companies.  The contributions by the Group into individual company schemes for the period were a net charge of £nil (2012: £nil ) and 
contributions to industry collective schemes were £0.1m (2012: £0.1m).

23.  Financial instruments 
(i) Financial risk management objectives and policies 
Risk management 
The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise borrowings and overdrafts, cash and cash equivalents.  These financial ins truments are 
used to manage funding and liquidity requirements.  Other financial instruments which arise directly from the Group’s operations include 
trade receivables and payables. 
Exposure to credit, liquidity, foreign currency exchange and in terest rate risks arise in the norm al course of the Group’s business operations 
and each of these risks is managed in accordance with the Group’s treasury risk management strategy, which is also discussed in the Business 
Review in the section Current liquidity. 
(a) Credit risk 
The Group does not have significant concentrations of credit risk as exposure is spread over a number of counterparties and cus tomers. 
The Group is exposed to a small amount of credit risk that is primarily attributable to its trade and other receivables, the majority of which 
relates to retail customer products held ready for collection (see note 15).  Retail customers are required to settle outstandi ng balances in cash 
or using a major credit card prior to goods being collected from/delivered by the store. 
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are banks with a minimum A- credit rating.  The maximum a mount  
of credit risk is represented by the carrying amounts of financial assets. 
(b) Liquidity risk 
The Group finances its operations from a mix of retained profits and bank borrowings achieved through term loans, revolving cre dit 
agreements and overdraft facilities.  Daily cash balances are fore cast and surplus cash is placed on treasury deposit with the Group’s bankers  
at commercial rates.  All counterparties have minimum A- credit ratings.

Committed overdraft facilities are renewable annually and amounts undrawn were £2.2m and €nil (2012: £6.0m and €0.9m).  The Com pany 
has committed facilities to July 2015.  These facilities comprise a €14.0m amortising term loan and a £45.0m revolving credit f acility.  
Repayments on the term loans cannot be redrawn.  There are a numb er of covenants which commit the Group to maintaining certain rates  
of leverage and fixed charge cover.  The Group has and is expected to remain in compliance with these covenants.  At 27 April 2 013 the Euro 
amortising term loan was €1.8m and the revolving credit facility had an undrawn amount of £42.5m (2012: £32.5m). 
(c) Foreign exchange risk 
Outside the UK the Group operates in the Republic of Ireland, the Netherlands, Belgium and has an investment property in Poland .  Revenues 
and expenses of these operations are denominated in Euros or Zlot ys.  The Group’s investment in Poland is not sufficiently mate rial to require 
the risk to be hedged.  The Group mitigates currency risk in resp ect of the net investment in European operations by designatin g Euro 
denominated borrowings as hedging instruments of Eu ro denominated investments in foreign operations. 
If the closing Sterling-Euro rate had been 0.01 points lower in the period the exchange difference reported in the statement of comprehensive 
income would have been £0.6m lower (2012: £0.7m lower).  At 27 April 2013 if Sterling had weakened/strengthened by 10% against the Euro, 
profit after tax for the year would have been £0.1m higher/lower as a result of the translation of the Euro denominated busines ses.

(d) Interest rate risk 
The Group has various borrowings bearing interest at a margin over LIBOR or EURIBOR rates.   
In accordance with IFRS 7, the Group has undertaken sensitivity analysis on its financial instruments which are affected by cha nges in interest 
rates.  This analysis has been prepared on the basis of a constant amount of net debt and a constant ratio of fixed to floating interest rates as at 
27 April 2013 and 28 April 2012 respectively.  Consequently analysis relates to the situation at those dates and is not represe ntative of the years 
then ended.   
Based on the Group’s net debt position at the year end a 1% change in interest rates would affect the Group’s profit before tax by 
approximately £0.1m (2012: £0.3m). 
The interest rate profile of the financial assets and liabilities of the Group is as follows:

Capital management 
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern and retain financial f lexibility in order 
to continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits fo r other stakeholders.  The Group considers capital to be equity and net debt.  
Net debt is disclosed in note 29. 
The Group manages its capital by: continued focus on free cash flow generation; setting the level of capital expenditure and dividend in the 
context of the current year and forecast fr ee cash flow; and monitoring the level of the Group’s financial and leasehold debt in the context of 
Group performance.

Determination of fair values 
The carrying values of all other financial assets and liabilities are deemed to reflect fair value. 
(iv) Hedge accounting 
Net investment hedges 
Euro-denominated borrowings are designated as hedging instruments of Euro-denominated net assets of the Group’s foreign operati ons  
in order to protect the Group from currency risk in respect of the Group’s Euro-denominated foreign operations.  Borrowing bala nces are 
carried at amortised cost which approximates fair value since borrowings bear interest at the prevailing floating rate.  The ca rrying value  
of borrowings amounted to €1.8m (2012: €6.7m).

The Group’s LTIP was established to grant contingent rights to shares.  Such grants are made on recommendation by the Group’s 
Remuneration Committee.  Shares are purchased by a Trust and held until they are used to satisfy the LTIP awards.  As required by IAS 32 
grants of such shares are classified as Treasury shares and accordingly are deducted from total equity attributable to equity h olders of the 
parent.  The assets, liabilities, income and costs of the LTIP and Trust are included in both the Company and the consolidated financial 
statements.  During the period the Trust did not purchase any ordinary shares (2012: nil shares purchased).  At the year end th e Trust  
held 27,869 (2012: 27,869) ordinary shares of 1p each with a market value of £0.2m (2012: £0.2m). 
The Group also operates a share option scheme under which shares are issued to satisfy share options upon exercise. 
25.  Share based payments 
Included within administration expenses is a charge of £0.5m (2012: £0.2m) in respect of equity-settled share based payments. 
The Group’s employee share schemes are described below and additional detail is disclosed in the Directors’ remuneration report on pages  
26 to 35.  Scheme participants are either Directors of the Comp any or employees of the Group.  The costs associated with the sc hemes are 
accounted for in the Company’s accounts. 
(i) LTIP 
Under this scheme participants may receive annual awards in the form of contingent entitlements to Company shares.  These entit lements  
are equity-settled through the purchase of existing shares by th e administering Trust.  The shares vest three years after award if participants 
remain with the Group during the vesting period and the Group meets targeted levels of performance.  The performance conditions are fully 
described in the Directors’ remuneration report in the section titled Long Term Incentive Plan. 
During the period contingent entitlements to 327,224 shares were awarded (2012: 360,778).  The amount recognised in the income statement 
in respect of all LTIP awards is a charge of £0.3m (2012: £0.1m) .  The fair values of the awards, where there is no market cond ition, are valued 
using a Black-Scholes option pricing model.  The Group’s LTIP Tr ust is administered by the Equity Trust (Jersey) Limited and it waives its 
right to dividends on the shares held.

(ii) Savings Related Share Option Scheme (“SAYE”) 
Three and five year SAYE schemes were introduced in 2004.  Empl oyees and Executive Directors are invited to subscribe for options over 
shares in the Company at a 20% discount.  The options are ordinarily exercisable within six months from the third or fifth anni versary  
of the grant date.  The entitlement to share options is equity-s ettled.  Funds for the purchase of Company shares are built up through  
the contribution of a maximum of £250 per month from salary.  Share options were valued using a Black-Scholes option-pricing mo del.   
The cost charged to the income statement in re spect of this scheme is £0.2m (2012: £0.1m).

Independent auditors’ report to the members  
of Carpetright plc 
Carpetright plc Annual report and accounts 2013 
We have audited the financial statements of Carpetright plc for  
the 52 week period ended 27 April 2013 which comprise the 
Consolidated income statement, the Consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income, the Group and Company Statements of 
changes in equity, the Group and Company Balance sheets, the 
Group and Company statements of cash flow and the related notes.  
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their 
preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and, as 
regards the Parent Company financial statements, as applied in 
accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. 
Respective responsibilities of directors  
and auditors 
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibilities on page 39, the Directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view.  Our responsibility is to audit and 
express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland).  Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing 
Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only 
for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 
of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose.   
We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility 
for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is 
shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed 
by our prior consent in writing. 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error.  This includes  
an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate  
to the Group’s and the Parent Company’s circumstances and  
have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the 
reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the 
Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements.  
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information 
in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the 
audited financial statements.  If we become aware of any apparent 
material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report. 
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion: 
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the 
Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 27 April 2013 
and of the Group’s loss and th e Group’s and Parent Company’s 
cash flows for the year then ended; 
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; 
• the Parent Company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006; and 
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the 
Group financial statements, Article 4 of the lAS Regulation. 
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion: 
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has 
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006; and 
• the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial 
year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent 
with the financial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report  
by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following: 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, 
in our opinion: 
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent 
Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or 
• the Parent Company financial statements and the part of  
the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not  
in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or 
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by  
law are not made; or 
• we have not received all the information and explanations  
we require for our audit. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
• the Directors’ statement, set out on page 39, in relation to  
going concern; 
• the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to  
the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the  
UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review; and 
• certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board  
on Directors’ remuneration.
